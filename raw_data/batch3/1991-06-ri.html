      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity in late May and early June was, on 
balance, not much improved from the month before, but the attitude 
of businesses about the near-term outlook remained optimistic. 
Retail sales were lower and manufacturing activity was flat. Almost 
no new commercial construction was started and housing activity was 
lackluster. Sluggish growth in the volume of business loans was 
attributed primarily to weak loan demand, although some supply 
constraints were noted. On the brighter side, retailers and 
manufacturers are optimistic about their prospects, export volume 
rose at District ports and the outlook for the District's farming 
sector appeared promising.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular survey of retailers suggested that retail activity 
declined slightly in the past month. Reports of lower sales -- 
including sales of big-ticket items -- outnumbered reports of higher 
sales. Shopper traffic was slightly lower, as was retail employment. 
Retail prices showed little change, even though wholesale prices 
were reported to be somewhat higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents were optimistic about retail activity over the next six 
months. About half expected shopper traffic and sales to increase, 
but only a small percentage anticipated any change in employment. 
Prices at the wholesale and retail levels were expected to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to our regular survey of manufacturers indicated that 
District factory activity remained stable. Manufacturers reported 
almost no change in shipments, prices, export orders, capital 
expenditures, and employment. New orders increased slightly, while 
inventories and order backlogs decreased slightly. About two-thirds 
of the responding manufacturers viewed poor sales as their single 
most important problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers remained optimistic about business conditions and 
their prospects for the next six months, although somewhat less so 
than in our previous survey. About half of the manufacturers foresaw 
increases in shipments, new orders, and order backlogs. Respondents 
anticipated slight increases in capital expenditures and export 
orders, but they expected little change in inventories and 
employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports -- Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk) --indicated that exports were higher and 
imports were generally unchanged in May from April. Compared with a 
year ago, export activity was higher and import activity was lower. 
Exports are expected to increase faster than imports over the next 
six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated that tourist activity increased significantly 
over the Memorial Day weekend compared with last year. Many beach 
areas were reportedly booked to capacity while most other beach and 
mountain areas experienced increases in bookings which they 
attributed to the unseasonably hot weather. A majority of the 
respondents expected tourist activity this summer to be above last 
year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone indicated 
that the demand for commercial and industrial loans remained weak in 
April and late May. Among businesses that requested loans, smaller 
firms slightly outnumbered larger ones, and few new businesses 
sought financing. Loan delinquency rates edged down.
     </p>
     <p>
      We also asked retailers and manufacturers about credit conditions. A 
majority indicated that loan activity was sluggish in their 
respective areas. Most felt that a moderate number of creditworthy 
borrowers had been refused loans recently. Most also indicated, 
however, that loan demand was weaker.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Results from our survey of home builders suggested that housing 
activity was mixed in recent weeks. The number of reports of 
increases in housing starts about equaled the number of reports of 
decreases. Although some builders noted an increase in sales, most 
reported that sales were unchanged to lower. Low- and medium-priced 
homes apparently sold better than high-priced homes. Nearly all 
builders reported that home prices were steady. A few indicated that 
credit conditions were stringent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction firms contacted by telephone noted few signs 
of an upturn in nonresidential building. These firms reported that 
little private commercial construction was underway and indicated 
that much of their current work was public projects--bridges, 
highways, and government buildings. Some respondents, however, 
suggested that the decline in activity had bottomed out, although 
none expected a strong upturn. The outlook in the Washington, D.C. 
area was said to be especially uncertain. Several respondents 
reported that industry profit margins were extremely thin and that 
in some cases firms were bidding jobs at below variable costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite scarce rainfall and record high temperatures across much of 
the District in late May, our contacts in agriculture indicated that 
prospects were generally favorable as of the end of the first week 
of June. The harvest of small grains and peaches was in progress, 
and preliminary assessments indicated that yields for these crops 
would be excellent. The spring planting of corn, soybeans, and the 
transplanting of tobacco were nearing completion and were ahead of 
last year's pace. The condition of most crops was good to excellent 
with only scattered reports of heat stress and disease damage.
