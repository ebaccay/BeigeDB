      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District business activity continues to grow moderately, as retail 
sales have improved in recent weeks and production remains strong. 
Increased sales of furniture and other household items and 
automobiles have sustained a modest recovery in consumer spending. 
Manufacturers generally report strong orders, pushing several 
producers to operate near capacity. Some producers, particularly 
those experiencing production constraints, have been able to sustain 
price increases in recent months, but many anticipate that softening 
in several commodity markets may help to alleviate further upward 
price pressure. A moderate rise in loan demand has been driven 
primarily by new mortgage financing and refinancing and some large 
banks have noted a seasonal rise in business loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retailers report that sales continued to climb 
higher in May and early June from the rebound that began in April. 
Activity among the various types of outlets was mixed, however, as 
department stores generally fared better than apparel chains and 
discount competitors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel sales have been slow to recover from their March decline, 
partly due to poor weather conditions during spring clothes sales 
and to consumer resistance to sharply increasing apparel prices. 
Instead of clothes, the popular items at department stores include 
hardware-type items and furniture and household goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite slower-than-expected sales earlier in the year, retail 
inventories are only slightly above desired levels. Clearance 
pricing of spring goods, especially apparel, has begun in earnest 
but is not expected to go beyond the usual discounting. Retailers 
believe that consumers will respond to clothing sales and that the 
overall retail market will continue a slow improvement. However, 
they are optimistic that the Midwest will outperform the national 
average.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers report brisk sales in May, leading many to expect that 
a sustainable sales recovery is under way. Dealers attribute the 
increasing vehicle demand mostly to replacement or necessity buying. 
noting lagging sales of luxury models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District respondents report that growth in manufacturing output is 
reviving in most industries, except for defense and construction-
related producers that are experiencing further adjustment. A few 
large producers in the District are operating near capacity and 
express concern about bumping against production constraints. 
However, most are confident that they have ample capacity to 
accommodate their steadily rising business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers indicate that their flat-rolled operations are at 
capacity. Although incoming orders have eased from the peak rate of 
the 1993:1Q, a major producer claims to be booked through the third 
quarter and anticipates a full order book for the balance of the 
year. Traditional capital goods producers generally expect output to 
grow at an even faster rate during the second half of the year than 
it did in the first half. The high rate of truck output has led to 
capacity constraints among the smaller suppliers in the industry. 
Auto production is up sharply in several Ohio facilities, which has 
led to additional shifts and more hiring. However, not all plants 
have shared in this revival. One production facility of mid-size 
cars reported output down more than 12% from a year ago. A producer 
of electronic parts reports a rising pace in orders and production 
across its markets, except for construction. On the other hand, a 
producer of aircraft parts posted a sizable decline in orders in 
April, primarily from defense and international customers, although 
orders year-to-date were still ahead of a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large manufacturers report no plans to hire additional workers, at 
least for the next several months. The major exception is steel 
producers, who have recalled employees recently. However, even the 
steel industry expects these gains to be offset by layoffs later in 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents believe that the surge in prices earlier in 1993 may be 
transitory, although some expect further, less-intense upward 
pressure in the second half of the year. Several producers 
acknowledge higher prices of materials, including steel, chlorine, 
special chemicals, glass, and truck parts in recent months, but 
surmise that these were in response to strong market conditions 
following several years of declining prices. A capital goods 
manufacturer and a chemical producer asserted that their price hikes 
this year represent the first such opportunity since the late 1980s. 
Other producers contend that the recent declines in industrial 
commodity and lumber prices may help to constrain upward price 
pressures in the second half of this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The volume of new mortgage loans rose in May, according to banks and 
thrifts contacted, and mortgage refinancing rebounded from a letup 
in the previous month. Some large banks also report that business 
loans rose in April and early May, but they doubt that the rise was 
more than seasonal. Bankers still report a runoff of certificates of 
deposit, and a few note that savings deposits are down from previous 
levels. However, bankers have generally refrained from resorting to 
incentives to hold or attract new deposits, because of what they 
describe as relatively weak demand for funds.
