      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District since the last report remained 
basically mixed. Most contacts at District department stores 
reported stronger-than-planned sales in September and positive over-
the-year changes. Moreover, office leasing activity showed some 
improvement as firms continue to avail themselves of lower rents and 
other concessions in order to upgrade their quarters. The 
residential construction market was mixed, however, with 
homebuilders in upstate New York reporting somewhat stronger buying 
interest than those in downstate communities. New York's 
unemployment rate rose in September while New Jersey's fell 
following August declines in both states. The latest Buffalo and 
Rochester purchasing managers' reports were less favorable than 
earlier. Most senior loan officers at small and midsized banks 
indicated no change in their willingness to lend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts at District department stores reported stronger-than-
planned sales in September and positive over-the-year changes. 
However, while generally pleased with the results, some retailers 
cited the later back-to-school shopping this year and extra 
promotional activity as major factors in September's strength. No 
one thought a turnaround in consumer sentiment had occurred and most 
said they were cautiously optimistic about what lies ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Year-to-year sales increases in September generally ranged from 4 to 
16 percent. One chain reported a smaller-than-expected over-the-year 
decrease. Categories registering the greatest improvement were 
sports apparel, outerwear and bed and bath items. Inventories are 
reportedly in good shape-either on plan or a little below.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential construction market remained mixed in recent weeks 
with homebuilders in upstate New York reporting somewhat stronger 
buying interest than those in downstate communities. In some New 
Jersey areas, plans are being revived and revised for projects that 
have been in default, and in New York City, several moderate-income 
housing developments have recently been started or soon will be 
underway. Developers report continuing problems in obtaining 
acquisition and construction loans, however, and observers note that 
most new homebuilding involves substantial amounts of internal 
financing or government subsidies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity showed some improvement as firms continue to 
avail themselves of lower rents and other concessions in order to 
upgrade their quarters. In addition, most areas report little or no 
new office space under construction at this time. As a result of 
these developments, several areas, including Long Island, Fairfield 
and Westchester counties and mid-Manhattan, have experienced a 
recent decline in office vacancy rates, although they remain at high 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates moved in opposite directions during 
September following August declines. New York's rate rose to 9.0 
percent from 8.5 percent in August while New Jersey's rate, also at 
9.0 percent in September, fell from 9.4 percent. Two developments 
are likely to boost construction employment. The Port Authority of 
New York and New Jersey recently announced that it will build an 
additional international terminal at Newark Airport and that major 
projects are planned or already begun at La Guardia and Kennedy 
airports, including the first new passenger terminal at Kennedy 
since the 1960s. In another major construction project, New York 
City has embarked on a huge program to build or renovate 32 court 
facilities throughout the five boroughs over the next several years. 
In other news, a large discount chain has agreed to acquire and 
reopen 6 of the 11 Alexander Department Stores in the New York 
metropolitan area which closed earlier this year. Remington Products 
announced that it will remain in Bridgeport, Connecticut, thereby 
retaining 1100 jobs and probably repatriating some jobs from abroad 
as well. On the negative side, I.B.M. will reduce production of 
semiconductors and mainframe computers, probably resulting in 
layoffs at its factories in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The September survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed much 
smaller percentages of firms reporting a rise in new orders and 
production following substantial improvements in these categories 
during August. The latest survey of Rochester purchasing managers 
also showed a sizable drop in the percentage anticipating an 
improvement in business conditions over the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District indicated that their willingness to lend 
remained steady relative to two months ago, although the percentage 
of officers citing an increased willingness was somewhat higher than 
in the last survey. Almost all bankers reported that they would not 
ease their standards in response to the recently revised federal 
guidelines recommending less rigid loan-to-value ratios for 
construction and land development loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of respondents noted that overall loan demand remained 
sluggish. Largely due to refinancing activity, demand for 
residential mortgages continued to increase and consumer loan demand 
improved slightly. However, demand for commercial and industrial 
loans and nonresidential mortgages weakened. Almost all respondents 
reported either maintaining or lowering interest rates. A majority 
of officers indicated that delinquency rates for residential 
mortgages and commercial and industrial loans were unchanged to 
slightly lower during the preceding two months.
