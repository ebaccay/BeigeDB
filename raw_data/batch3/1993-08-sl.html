     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 4, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite flooding in parts of the District, contacts report that 
their operations have been largely unaffected. For most 
establishments, the biggest change has been the use of trucks rather 
than railroads for their transportation needs. A preliminary 
assessment puts a lower bound on damage from flooding in the 
District at $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This estimate is tentative 
at this point and subject to a relatively large forecast error.
     </p>
     <p>
      Flooding aside, other reports from District firms are mixed, with 
some experiencing modestly increased sales and others having flat or 
declining sales. Residential construction activity is strong in most 
areas of the District, as are new and existing home sales. Area 
banks for the most part were unaffected by recent flooding. While 
excessive rainfall and flooding have affected northern portions of 
the District, hot, dry weather is the norm in the southern reaches.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts in both flooded and non-flooded areas report that the 
flooding has had minimal effect on their operations. Delays in 
transporting supplies and output because of flooded rail lines are 
the main hardship. A switch to trucking has created little 
disruption and has sufficed for most establishments. One major 
manufacturer in St. Louis has had to close a plant because of an 
evacuation order. Other large manufacturers along the Missouri 
River, especially near Jefferson City, and along the Mississippi 
River have had to close temporarily because of flooding. In total, 
the Missouri Department of Employment Security estimates that about 
10,000 workers have been shut out of their workplaces by flood 
waters. This number will fluctuate, of course, as the rivers 
continue to rise and fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Public utilities in the affected areas report that service has been 
maintained, although in some cases a great deal of overtime has been 
employed to stay on top of service losses. Most major terminals and 
substations have been unaffected by the flooding. The total extent 
of flood damage at the household level, though, cannot be determined 
until flood waters recede and people return to their homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the St. Louis area report sales, especially in apparel, 
as relatively flat compared with the same period last year. The 
riverfront has seen an increase in foot traffic, but no 
proportionate movement in purchases. Some are concerned that 
misinformation reported in the media about flooding in the St. Louis 
area could lead to a decline in retail sales in the coming weeks 
because potential tourists cannot distinguish between the city's 
flooded and non-flooded areas. Apparently the national attention has 
yet to affect the city's convention business, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the iron, hydraulic parts and oil-extraction equipment 
industries report that sales are good and growing modestly. One 
contact emphasized international sales as being strong, especially 
from developing countries, while domestic sales are almost 
nonexistent. Many domestic firms, the contact reports, are 
postponing capital equipment expenditures until 1994. A contact from 
the heating and cooling industry reports that industry-wide sales 
have fallen dramatically and that inventories are growing.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses 
survey of District firms, about one-half of the respondents do not 
believe this is a good time to expand. One-fourth of the respondents 
felt conditions in the coming six months would be somewhat worse; 
however, one-fourth will increase employment this quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Declining interest rates continue to stimulate new construction and 
both new and existing home sales in most parts of the District. The 
housing market in Little Rock remains tight, as potential buyers 
outnumber available properties. Contacts report rising prices for 
new and existing homes as well as rental properties. The St. Louis 
and Memphis markets have also picked up in recent months, although 
homebuilders in St. Louis are still behind because of the weather. 
Contacts in the two cities also report improving conditions in 
commercial real estate markets: In St. Louis, retail vacancy rates 
are down and rental rates are up; in Memphis, speculative warehouse 
building is on the rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District banks in flooded areas have faced minimal disruptions 
to their businesses. Several area banks are offering special loan 
products and low rates to flood victims. Outside the flooded areas, 
consumer loan demand is reported to be increasing, especially for 
auto loans. Mortgage refinancings at area financial institutions 
continue at a brisk pace. No appreciable pickup in commercial loan 
demand has been reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weather conditions vary dramatically throughout the District. In the 
northern parts of the District, flooding has affected an estimated 
1.7 million acres in Missouri, more than 750,000 acres in Illinois 
and roughly 35,000 acres in Kentucky. In areas that have not been 
affected, the corn and soybean crops are in mostly good condition, 
and those farmers are reaping the benefit from higher grain prices. 
Much drier weather has prevailed in the southern portions of the 
District. Contacts in Arkansas report that dry, hot weather has led 
many farmers to irrigate their crops. Arkansas poultry producers 
report thousands of chickens have died because of the heat.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of St. Louis 
probably will not open until late August or early September. The 
closure of the upper Mississippi to barge traffic has led to only a 
slight increase in activity on the Ohio River, principally grain 
shipments. Flooding has also disrupted rail and trucking activities. 
A large District trucking firm reports that although shipments are 
off from one year ago, they are receiving some business they would 
not usually receive because of rail and barge disruptions.
