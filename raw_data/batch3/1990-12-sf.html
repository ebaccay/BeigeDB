      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in the West remains sluggish, and western business 
leaders' expectations about the national economy continue to 
deteriorate. Reports suggest that price increases may have moderated 
in recent weeks. Retail trade activity in the West is mixed, with 
wide variations by region. Activity in most manufacturing industries 
is reported to be flat to down front a year ago. Agriculture is one 
of the stronger sectors in the District, with strong prices and good 
yields. Lumber orders are down, while oil producers are enjoying the 
current high level of prices. Construction and real estate activity 
are down in most parts of the West, but several inland regions 
report continued strength. While conditions in Twelfth District 
financial institutions remain generally healthy, some California 
banks report further softening in major markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Western business leaders' expectations about the national economy 
continue to deteriorate. According to the most recent survey, 72 
percent of respondents expect a recession during the next year, 
compared with 67 percent five weeks earlier and 4 percent at the end 
of July. The remainder of respondents anticipate that real GNP will 
grow at a pace slower than 2 1/2 to 3 percent. Weakness is 
anticipated in the home building, consumer spending, and business 
investment sectors, with more than 90 percent of respondents 
expecting softening in each of these sectors. In contrast, 
respondents are evenly split between those expecting the trade 
balance to improve and those expecting it to worsen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports suggest that price increases may have moderated in recent 
weeks. While some petroleum based products, including plastic 
products, have seen their prices rise during the past six weeks, 
users of other petroleum products, such as jet fuel, note recent 
decline since the sharp run-ups immediately following the invasion 
of Kuwait. Reported price increases for labor and for most other 
products continue to cluster in the 3 to 5 percent range. However, 
auto dealers and department store retailers report that consumer 
resistance is holding their prices down. One retailer notes that 
wholesale prices for soft goods appear to be declining, and these 
reduction should eventually be passed on to the consumer. Another 
retailer expects prices to fall during the holiday season as stores 
resort to promotional pricing to attract shoppers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to current reports, retail trade activity in the West is 
mixed. Several respondents report weakness, including an auto dealer 
and a department store executive. Sales are stronger in the Pacific 
Northwest and inter-mountain areas than they are in other parts of 
the West Moreover, a Sacramento respondent notes that some retailers 
in that area are experiencing stronger sales than they did a year 
ago, much to their surprise.
     </p>
     <p>
      While one retailer reports a slight increase in inventories, another 
notes that inventories are in "surprisingly good shape" due to 
cautious ordering by retailers. No significant changes in the 
composition of retail orders, in terms of domestic versus imported 
products, were reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents familiar with manufacturing industries report that 
activity is flat to down compared with a year ago. Inventories, 
however, are generally under control. One respondent reports that 
electronics industry orders are being placed with much shorter lead 
times as customers try to hold down inventory costs. While the 
number of commercial aircraft manufactured remains flat, orders 
continue to pour in and the order backlog continues to lengthen. 
This year, 90 percent of one aircraft manufacturers' orders were 
from overseas, compared to an average of 60 percent during the 
previous two years. A smaller aircraft manufacturer, however, 
reports that the overall number of orders at his company is about 
the same as it was last year, and that there has been no appreciable 
change in the composition of domestic versus foreign orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture is one of the stronger sectors in the District, with 
strong prices and good yields for most products. Beef producers are 
enjoying high prices, and beef exports to the Pacific Rim have 
picked up again after slowing this summer. In California, farmers 
and ranchers are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a 
fifth drought year. This concern, along with worries about trade 
negotiation and the general economy, have led to increased caution 
among some farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumber orders are down from a quarter ago and from a year ago. Many 
mills in the Northwest are cutting back production due to this lack 
of demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil producers are enjoying the current high level of prices. In Kern 
County, California, oil companies are spending money to enhance 
their wells, but long-term price uncertainty is keeping them from 
doing much exploration.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity is down in most parts of the West, 
particularly in the office and commercial sectors. The weakness is 
attributed to an abundant supply of space in most markets, coupled 
with resulting caution on the part of lenders. Reports suggest that 
construction activity in the Seattle area may be growing more slowly 
or declining, but a utility company continues to experience robust 
growth in its number of residential hookups. Some parts of the 
District continue to experience strong residential construction 
activity, including Bakersfield and Fresno in California's central 
valley, and parts of Idaho, Utah, and Oregon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate activity, as measured by the number of sales, property 
values, and rents, continues to weaken in most parts of the West. A 
southern California developer reports that new leases on office 
space in some areas are priced 10 to 15 percent below their peak 
levels. This developer also reports that few commercial properties 
are being sold, but estimates that the values of the well-leased 
commercial properties that are changing hands have fallen by as much 
as 10 to 15 percent as well. At the same time, in California's 
central valley, the Pacific Northwest, and the inter-mountain 
states, residential property values continue to exceed their year-
earlier levels. Even in markets that are generally lackluster, low-
priced homes continue to sell relatively briskly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While conditions in Twelfth District financial institutions remain 
generally healthy, some California banks report further softening in 
major markets. One California banker, for example, reports that 
business loan demand is flat and consumer loan demand has softened 
considerably during the past two to three months. At the same time, 
bankers in Oregon, Utah, Idaho, Hawaii, and central California 
report strong or improved loan demand.
