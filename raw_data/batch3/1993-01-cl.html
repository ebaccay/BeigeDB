      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity in the Fourth District was generally stronger in 
recent months than was widely anticipated, and manufacturers 
forecast a larger increase in production this quarter than last. 
Consumer spending during the holiday season rose considerably more 
than retailers had estimated last fall, and housing sales in late 
1992 showed sizable year-over-year increases. Most manufacturers of 
steel, autos, and capital goods forecast higher production this 
quarter than last. Still, businesses typically are not planning 
increases in employment, least over the next few months. Lenders 
report a surge in credit-card use in December, but a slacker pace in 
mortgage loan refinancing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales in December were much stronger than retailers 
expected. The surge in sales led many stores to order additional 
holiday-type merchandise. Despite the last-minute ordering, 
inventories generally have been depleted, and retailers report that 
heavy post-season discounting to cut excess stocks will not be 
necessary this year. However traditional retailers, facing pressure 
from "off-price" competitors, were forced to discount merchandise 
prior to Christmas.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car dealers report a mixed sales performance in December and 
early January. Sellers of Big Three models generally fared better 
than Japanese nameplate dealers, and van and light truck sales 
continued to grow more strongly than those for cars. Dealers claim 
new car inventories, in a 60- to 70-day range, are slightly larger 
than desired, but stocks of the new Chrysler products are said to be 
tight. Dealers also note that consumers are moving toward more 
options and high-end models within each class.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and the Mortgage Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lenders and realtors in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati report 
that home sales were higher in November and December than is typical 
for this season. Total year-over-year sales increases in Columbus 
were in double digits in December, with homes priced over $250,000 
posting strong year-over-year gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Cincinnati, sales and starts rose at double-digit rates in 
November, and in Cleveland, sales rebounded after two monthly 
declines and were up 10% from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers expect last fall's upswing in production so 
continue into this quarter. Some steel producers predict that 
production will rebound this quarter following a decline last 
quarter. Several steel customers, especially automotive, have 
already placed orders for February and March delivery. Galvanized 
sheet production could reach capacity during the first quarter. 
Steel analysts estimate that steel operations will average about 85% 
of capacity this quarter, up from the 82% rate last quarter. 
Automotive sources also estimate a higher production rate this 
quarter than last. Domestic auto producers recently raised their
1993:IQ production schedules by a few percentage points from the 
previous forecast. If achieved, the production rate will be at least 
10% higher than last quarter's pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong demand for both passenger and truck tires has pushed tire 
production close to capacity for some producers. According to 
industry sources, these producers are planning to increase capacity 
to accommodate the better-than-expected sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers note an uneven but steadily rising trend in 
their businesses. However, uncertainty over a proposed investment 
tax credit has led to postponements and cutbacks in some orders. A 
producer of information processing equipment reports that computer 
orders fell unexpectedly in late 1992, after a strong increase 
during the summer quarter. A producer of industrial motors claims 
that some of its customers have delayed placing new orders until 
more details of a possible tax credit are known.
     </p>
     <p>
      The strongly reviving heavy-duty truck market is apparently largely 
unaffected by the tax credit discussion. New orders in December 
continue to climb at an annual rate that is well above the forecast 
for this year. Analysts estimate a 20% increase in output this year 
from last, which will place 1993 production only slightly below the 
level of the last peak year in 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other capital goods producers report below-average sales growth. The 
market for industrial controls is gradually recovering, but is still 
constrained by the slump in the nonresidential building industry and 
by weakness in aerospace. Similarly, markets for valves, fittings, 
and industrial components continue to strengthen erratically.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District employment shows little sign of a sizable pickup. Most 
manufacturers and retailers report that higher-than-anticipated 
production and sales can be accommodated with their existing work 
force. Although some employees have been recalled in recent weeks, 
many manufacturers report that they will take on new workers only 
after receiving sustained increases in new orders. Structural 
layoffs because of mergers and reorganization in the 
telecommunications, utilities, and plastic industries in the 
District are likely to result in job losses of about 1,200 workers 
during the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business loans outstanding rose slowly in the District again in 
December, according so some bankers. These sources also noted an 
unexpected surge in credit-card use in December. Both banks and 
thrifts indicate a letup in mortgage loan refinancing in December. A 
large thrift reported that its volume of new mortgage loans in early 
January had slowed substantially from a year earlier. Several 
thrifts and banks in the Cleveland area have been offering 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgages at 7.8% plus 2.5 to 3 points.
