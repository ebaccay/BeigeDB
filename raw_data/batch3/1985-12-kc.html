      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District appears to be generally 
sluggish, with little improvement anticipated in the near future. 
Retailers report flat sales and stable prices, conditions that are 
expected to continue into next year. Automobile dealers are 
pessimistic for sales through yearend and into 1986. Inventories of 
retail good and materials inputs are both considered satisfactory. 
Homebuilders are cautiously optimistic for 1986, though current 
conditions are mixed. Savings and loan institutions also expect 
mortgage demand and mortgage commitments to improve slightly in 
1986. Tenth District banks report relatively constant loan demands, 
deposits and loan rates over the last month. Fall crop yields are 
well above normal. Further, but slower, declines in farm land values 
are expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report flat sales in the last three months, and no 
significant change in sales this year over last year. Women's wear 
and home furnishings sales have been strong while sporting goods and 
housewares sales have been weak. Retailers have been expanding 
inventories in anticipation of sales increases during the coming 
holidays. Most report that they are planning on having special sales 
and promotions for Christmas this year. For 1986 retailers expect 
sales to remain fairly constant and inventory levels to fluctuate 
only seasonally. Prices are stable and are expected to remain so the 
rest of this year and through next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers report sales have declined recently, due largely 
to the elimination of financing incentives. Sales currently are 
about the same to down slightly compared with a year ago. Most 
dealers expect sales to be flat to down slightly through yearend and 
down in 1986. Sluggish sales and large shipments of 1986 models have 
resulted in expanding inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most purchasing agents report that input prices have remained nearly 
unchanged over the past three months as well as from a year earlier. 
They generally expect input prices to remain constant for the rest 
of the year and foresee no major price increases in 1986. Very few 
difficulties in obtaining materials are reported and few problems 
are expected to arise. All firms report that materials inventories 
are satisfactory and no major changes are expected for the rest of 
the year or in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders give mixed reports about current housing conditions, 
but are cautiously optimistic for 1986. Housing starts range from 
slightly up to significantly down for both single-family and multi-family structures, relative to a year ago. But most area builders 
expect starts in 1986 to be as good as or better than 1985. Sales of 
new homes, prices of new homes, and the inventory of unsold homes 
vary widely across reporting areas. Prices of materials are 
generally steady and materials availability is good, with no changes 
expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan institutions also give mixed reports about current 
and future mortgage behavior. Respondents report a moderate increase 
in savings inflows relative to last year, along with slightly lower 
to constant mortgage demand and commitments. Generally, stable 
inflows are expected for 1986, along with slightly higher to 
constant mortgage demand and commitments. Most savings and loans 
report declining mortgage rates recently, but expectations for 1986 
rates are mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand, total deposits, and loan rates have been 
relatively constant at Tenth District banks over the last month. 
Most bankers report unchanged demand for commercial and industrial 
loans. Half of the respondents experienced a stronger demand for 
consumer credit, while the other half report no change. Several 
bankers note that their automobile loans have not been competitive 
lately, but credit card lending has increased. Agricultural lending 
was flat to slightly down, and bankers continue to express concern 
about the quality of agricultural credit. The prime rate is constant 
at Tenth District banks. Most respondents also report no change in 
consumer loan rates. Total deposits have been stable. Half of the 
respondents had lower levels of demand deposits, but modest 
increases were registered for NOW accounts, Super NOW accounts, and 
MMDA's. IRA and Keogh contributions were steady to slightly higher. 
Most banks had no change in passbook savings accounts, although a 
few report decreases. Large certificates of deposit and small time 
deposits generally were unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fall crop yields are above normal and paydowns on livestock loans 
are improving, but liquidations and foreclosures continue with 
farmland values still falling. Fall harvest in the Tenth District is 
generally on schedule, although wet weather has delayed fieldwork in 
some states. Corn, soybean, and sorghum yields are reported well 
above normal in several district states. In Oklahoma, normal cotton 
yields are expected. Paydowns on livestock loans in Nebraska, 
Kansas, Wyoming, and New Mexico are much better than a year ago. 
Much of this improvement is attributed to the recent rebound in 
cattle prices. Farm liquidations and foreclosures have saturated the 
farm real estate market, and very little land is changing hands. 
Some financial institutions that have acquired farmland through 
foreclosure or liquidation are not selling at current low prices. 
Lenders expect further declines in farm real estate values in the 
coming months, but the rate of decline may not be as sharp as it was 
a year ago. Agricultural lenders in most district states are 
encouraging their farm borrowers to apply for Farmers' Home 
Administration (FmHA) guarantees. Lenders in Colorado and Wyoming, 
however, report that they no longer send borrowers to the FmHA, as 
many sent in the past have failed to qualify.
