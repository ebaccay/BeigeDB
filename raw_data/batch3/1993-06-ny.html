      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, the pace of economic activity in the District seemed 
somewhat slower in recent weeks but the outlook remains modestly 
favorable. While retail sales results varied widely during April and 
May, a majority of contacts reported sales were under plan. 
Homebuilding activity slowed somewhat in parts of the District and 
the earlier optimism about surpassing last year's level of starts 
was less pervasive. Office leasing activity picked up in recent 
weeks, however, and primary vacancy rates declined in much of the 
District. New Jersey's unemployment rate fell sharply in May while 
New York's rate rose. Recent discussions with 26 manufacturing firms 
indicated a modest increase in sales is anticipated over the next 
six months. Small and midsized banks in the District reported no 
change in their willingness to lend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While sales results varied widely at District retail stores during 
April and May, a majority of contacts reported that sales were 
somewhat below plan. They attributed this in part to cool and rainy 
weather during much of the period and also to a continued 
cautiousness on the part of consumers due to economic uncertainty. 
Some retailers noted a pickup in sales towards the end of May and 
into early June, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales changes ranged from -4 percent to +10 percent in 
April and from -5 percent to +2.5 percent in May. Because Memorial 
Day was celebrated a week earlier last year, several respondents 
noted that promotionals associated with that holiday will benefit 
June this year instead of May. While the weather continued to put a 
damper on the sale of summer apparel, other types of apparel such as 
sportswear and children's wear sold well. Demand for furniture, 
appliances and other home items was also strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite somewhat disappointing sales, most retailers reported that 
inventories were at satisfactory levels. However, two stated that 
stocks were somewhat bloated and that some paring was necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </p>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity slowed somewhat in parts of the District and 
the earlier optimism about surpassing last year's level of starts 
was less pervasive. Factors cited were continuing layoffs and 
uncertainty about jobs and probably higher taxes. Apparently sales 
to first-time homebuyers have been good, but trade-up demand has 
slowed in several areas. Although still high, lumber prices have 
started to decline and builders state that credit has become more 
available for construction loans. Funds remain very scarce for 
acquisition and development loans, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity picked up in recent weeks and primary 
vacancy rates declined in much of the District. The largest decline-
-reportedly almost one percentage point--occurred in downtown 
Manhattan where a major securities firm renewed an existing lease 
and rented a substantial amount of additional space as well. Despite 
the recent, widespread improvement, however, office vacancy rates 
remain at very high levels throughout the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New Jersey's unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.4 percent in May 
from a very high 9.1 percent in April while New York's rate rose to 
7.5 percent from 7.0 percent. New Jersey's 130,000 increase in 
household employment was 15 percent of the national increase of 
857,000. (Several published reports mistakenly compared the 130,000 
to the nationwide payroll employment rise of 209,000 and stated that 
New Jersey accounted for more than half the nation's gain.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Among recent announcements concerning the District, Bausch and Lomb 
plans to erect a new headquarters office tower in downtown Rochester 
and a $25-40 million medical complex will be constructed in Buffalo. 
On the negative side, New York Telephone will lay off 600 managers 
next September and Readers Digest will reduce its headquarters staff 
by 250 over the next 15 months. April reports from purchasing 
managers in Buffalo showed an improvement in production but a slight 
decline in new orders. In continuation of a recent up and down 
pattern, a much smaller percentage of Rochester purchasing managers 
reported better general business conditions in April than in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discussions were recently held with 26 manufacturing firms in the 
District regarding sales, prices, wages, investment plans and 
exports. On the whole, our contacts anticipate a modest increase in 
sales over the next six months. Twenty expect sales to be flat or 
increasing while four anticipate declines of 5 percent or more. 
There was no evidence of inflationary pressures. Only three firms 
plan to raise their prices over the next six months and more than 20 
said wage increases will be the same or lower than last year. Only 
one firm reported a noticeable increase in the cost of materials. 
More than half the firms plan to reduce capital spending, four 
significantly. More than two thirds expect exports to continue 
growing at the same rate or faster over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The latest survey of small and midsized banks in the Second District 
showed that loan officers' willingness to lend was unchanged during 
the last two months after four months of increased willingness. Most 
officers reported that their loan rates have remained stable. 
Overall loan demand was unchanged to somewhat higher from two months 
ago. Demand for residential mortgages was unchanged as refinancing 
activity leveled off.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents noted some growth in overall deposits over the past 
year. Savings accounts increased as customers shifted funds from 
maturing certificates of deposit to passbook savings. Delinquency 
rates for all types of loans remained unchanged during the preceding 
two months.
