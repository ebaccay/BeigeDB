      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Tenth District economy continues to grow moderately. In the 
energy sector, drilling activity has picked up recently and remains 
well above the level of a year ago. Retail sales are unchanged or 
slightly higher than a year ago, but sales are mixed. While many 
retailers and manufacturers are trimming inventories, automobile 
dealers are keeping new car inventories at current levels. In the 
agricultural sector, winter wheat yields are average or better 
across most of the district. Yet the surge in production is driving 
wheat prices down sharply, limiting income gains for district wheat 
farmers. Housing starts in the district have fallen from a year ago, 
but prices for new homes remain stable. Although mortgage rates are 
edging down, mortgage demand stays mixed. Commercial bankers report 
slightly higher total loan demand, primarily for consumer and home 
equity loans. Demand for commercial, industrial, and real estate 
loans remains stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers report sales are unchanged or slightly increased 
from a year earlier, but mixed over the last three months. Sales are 
expected to increase slightly during the rest of the year. Demand is 
especially strong for women's apparel, while sales for junior wear 
is weak. Prices are changing in line with cost increases, but are 
expected to remain steady in coming months. Retailers are trimming 
inventories. Over the last month, new auto sales have improved 
slightly in some district states but have slowed in others. Adequate 
financing is available both for inventories and for potential 
buyers. Most dealers are maintaining current inventory levels as 
sales are expected to continue at their current pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most purchasing agents report only slightly higher input prices over 
a year ago. Prices have been mostly stable over the past three 
months and are expected to remain so over the next three months. 
Most agents report no difficulty obtaining materials and expect no 
problems for the rest of the year. Lead times for steel are 
increasing but are expected to decrease over the remainder of the 
year. Many firms are trimming inventories, and plants are operating 
below capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After plunging to near $15 a barrel in late June, domestic oil 
prices have increased in recent weeks on speculation that OPEC will 
reduce oil production. Nonetheless, the price of West Texas 
Intermediate crude oil remains $5 below its level at the beginning 
of the year. Exploration and development activity in the district 
picked up in June and remains well above the year-earlier level. The 
district rig count increased from 266 in May to 290 in June, up 
almost 30 percent from June 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing starts are down from a year ago in most areas of the 
district but have stabilized over the last month. New home sales are 
improving slightly, and prices remain generally stable. Builders 
report no problems with delivery times or availability of materials. 
New homes sales are expected to be steady to slightly lower the rest 
of 1990.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most district savings and loan respondents report net inflows of 
deposits over the last month. Net deposit flows generally are 
running higher than they were a year ago and in the previous month. 
Respondents expect deposit growth to continue in the near term. 
Mortgage demand has been mixed. Mortgage rates remain stable to 
slightly lower and are expected to fall further in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial bankers report that total loan demand increased slightly 
over the last month. Demand strengthened primarily for consumer 
loans and home equity loans. There has been little change in the 
demand for commercial and industrial loans or for residential real 
estate loans. Commercial real estate loans have been steady overall, 
although a few banks are reducing lending for commercial real estate 
and land development because of concerns about credit quality. None 
of the respondents report a change in their prime rate over the last 
month, and few expect the prime rate to change in the near future. 
Most bankers also report no change in consumer loan rates. The level 
of investments have increased at Tenth District banks over the last 
month. Total deposits are rising because of increases in demand 
deposits and small time deposits. Large certificates of deposit, NOW 
accounts, and money market deposit accounts remain generally 
unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Harvest of the district's winter wheat crop is nearly complete. 
Wheat yields and quality are average to well above average across 
most of the district. The wheat crop in Kansas, the nation's leading 
wheat producing state, is estimated to be the largest crop on record 
and more than double the size of last year's drought-reduced crop. 
The surge in wheat production, however, is driving wheat prices down 
sharply, limiting income gains for district wheat producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The district's corn, soybean, milo, and cotton crops are generally 
in good condition. Crop development in Missouri and eastern Kansas 
is well behind normal, however, due to planting delays caused by 
excessive spring rains. Dry weather since late June his left crops 
in western Kansas and Nebraska in need of additional moisture.
     </p>
     <p>
      The limited availability and high cost of feeder cattle has resulted 
in a modest reduction in district cattle feeding activity. Strong 
cattle prices continue to support incomes of district cattle 
ranchers, but the high cost of feeder cattle is limiting profit 
margins for cattle feeders.
