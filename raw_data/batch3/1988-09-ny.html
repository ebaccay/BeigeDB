      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 6, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the Second District economy registered a modest uptrend 
since the last report. Business activity picked up somewhat and 
several areas reported either an improvement in residential 
construction or less softening than was anticipated. Office leasing 
continued at a moderate pace while the pattern of department store 
sales was mixed. Demand for commercial loans remained strong at 
small- and mid-sized banks in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of District department store sales was mixed during July 
as respondents reported results ranging from somewhat below to well 
above plan. A prolonged period of hot and humid weather was cited by 
several retailers as a factor in slower-than-anticipated apparel 
sales since consumers were reluctant to try on new fall clothes. 
Furniture and housewares were also somewhat weak. Among items 
mentioned as selling well were accessories, handbags, and women's 
at-home clothing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales changes in July ranged from -l percent to +10 
percent with most stores registering a net gain. Inventories were 
generally reported in good shape, due in part to heavy markdowns of 
summer merchandise. However, one respondent noted that stocks are 
somewhat higher at his store than planned. After about a year of 
sluggish sales of women's apparel, all are hopeful that the new fall 
fashions will be able to turn things around.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Second District have picked up somewhat 
recently. The percentage of Buffalo purchasing managers reporting an 
improvement in general business activity increased in July while the 
percentage with a worsening declined. A semiannual survey of 
manufacturers in the Syracuse area found that four-fifths of the 
responding firms were operating at a capacity of 80 percent or 
higher, up from only 50 percent at that operating level in January. 
Purchasing managers in the Rochester survey generally reported 
stable conditions and most anticipate little change over the next 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates in the District remain lower than the national 
average with July readings of 4.1 percent in New York and 3.6 
percent in New Jersey. A midyear review of labor market conditions 
in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey area noted that the first 
half of 1988 saw continued but slower job growth compared with the 
last half of 1987 and much lower unemployment than a year earlier. 
For the first five months of 1988 the area's unemployment rate 
averaged 3.8 percent, down from 4.7 percent a year earlier. Thus, 
despite cutbacks in New York City's finance and manufacturing 
sectors, the predicted large increase in regional unemployment has 
so far not materialized.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While the overall pace of homebuilding activity remains somewhat 
slower than in the past few years, several areas reported either an 
improvement in recent weeks or less softening than had been 
anticipated. The moderate rise in mortgage interest rates reportedly 
has motivated some potential buyers to act now before rates move 
higher. In addition, some upstate New York communities continue to 
experience stronger homebuying and higher levels of residential 
construction than a year earlier. The outcome of several cases now 
under litigation will have a decided impact on future residential 
construction in the District. Hundreds of units of affordable 
housing have been mandated in a number of communities, but several 
plans for implementing the mandates are being challenged in the 
courts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity has continued at a moderate pace since the 
last report. The expansion of foreign firms was a major factor in 
both midtown and downtown Manhattan leasing, and negotiations with 
several other international companies are reportedly underway. In 
addition, some financial services firms which had earlier 
contemplated moving have decided to retain in lower Manhattan, where 
excess space has made rental rates and other terms more flexible. 
With little or no new office construction planned, vacancy rates in 
Westchester and Fairfield counties have either declined or 
stabilized in recent months, albeit at high levels. A modest slowing 
has also occurred in office construction in northern New Jersey 
where the overall vacancy rate remains about 20 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Officers of small- and mid-sized banks in the Second District report 
that demand for commercial loans continues to be strong. The 
majority of bankers said that demand is the same or greater than a 
year ago. The few who noted a decline in activity attributed the 
slowdown to a weak commercial real estate market, particularly in 
Stamford and northern New Jersey. Except for the real estate 
sector, nearly all respondents believed that their local economy is 
quite strong. Most officers expect that interest rates will continue 
to increase for the remainder of 1988, though some anticipate that 
rates will stabilize in early 1989. Higher interest rates have not 
as yet dampened commercial loan demand at the surveyed banks. 
Opinion was split as to whether further increases in rates would 
cause an appreciable reduction in loan activity in the next several 
months. Several bankers expect demand to continue brisk so long as 
the economy remains strong. Others noted that some clients have 
expressed apprehension concerning any further rise in rates. In 
terms of loan distribution, most of the officers said that the bulk 
of their loans go to established firms that are expanding or 
modernizing. However, some mentioned that they issue many small 
business loans and help finance new companies.
