       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to contract in 
February, but contacts from several sectors reported that indicators 
have begun to show signs of bottoming out. Retail sales generally 
remained soft in February and early March, although several sources 
stated that the pattern of sales within the month of February may 
have hinted at the beginning of a recovery. Sales and production in 
the auto industry continued to be depressed, but a turnaround is 
still expected next quarter. Reports from capital goods 
manufacturers were mixed, with weakness in computer-related and 
heavy equipment and strength in machine tools. District steel 
production reflected weakness in construction and equipment demand, 
as well as in auto production. Bank reports indicate that both 
borrowers and lenders remain reluctant to commit to new lending 
agreements, despite lower interest rates. However, lower rates may 
be sparking new activity in the residential real estate market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales activity remained soft in February and early 
March. However, several reports suggest some signs of resilience 
after the marked weakness experienced in January. One large 
department store chain stated that District sales in February 
continued to show year-over-year declines, in line with results for 
the nation as a whole, although the pattern of sales within the 
month hinted at a bottoming out. A large catalog retailer stated 
that orders showed an uptick once hostilities ended, but it was too 
early to tell whether this reaction warranted modifying the firm's 
cautious stance on orders to manufacturers. Two large general 
merchandise retailers based in the District reported little sales 
improvement immediately after the cease-fire in the Middle East. One 
major discount retailer reported that District sales were above 
inflation rates during February. This retailer's sales gains in the 
District were also roughly in line with performance nationwide. 
Sales improvement may be in part the result of bankruptcies at other 
discount outlets, but sales were still strong enough to suggest that 
the decline in consumer spending is bottoming out, according to this 
retailer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Motor vehicle sales in the District remained depressed in both 
January and February. Several auto dealerships stated that, 
following an extremely weak period in early January, sales and 
traffic picked up briefly after the United States launched military 
action. Few dealers contacted reported any significant sales 
increases in the brief period since the cease-fire, although several 
stated that consumer attitudes and traffic levels improved 
measurably, leading to hopes that the month of March will show a 
solid turnaround in sales. A large dealer of cars sold to upper-
income customers reported that sales fell 60 percent in January and 
50 percent in February from the year-earlier periods, in part due to 
new taxes. Another dealer, who characterized his customer base as 
relatively stable, also reported sharply weaker sales in January, 
with no sign of a turnaround in February. This contact stated that 
consumers are increasingly insensitive to incentives. One dealer 
argued that the decline in interest rates has not yet passed through 
to the auto-buying consumer, as many financially-pressured lenders 
have simply captured a higher spread. Still, lower interest rates 
have helped by lowering inventory financing costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increasingly frequent downward revisions to announced auto 
production schedules have hurt inventory planning for dealers as 
well as parts suppliers. Car production increased during the month 
of January in both 1990 and 1991. However, production in early to 
mid-February 1991 turned downward again, in contrast to continued 
improvement over the same period last year. One industry analyst 
reported that current schedules still call for an increased 
production rate (seasonally adjusted) in the second quarter over the 
first quarter, in anticipation of a sales rebound. However, a large 
dealer expressed concern that the recent acceleration of fleet sales 
will provide an overhang of "nearly-new" used cars, dampening a 
production turnaround in the event sales rebound soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from capital goods producers are mixed, with some contacts 
reporting continued weakness since the beginning of the year and 
others holding firm. A large manufacturer of communications 
equipment stated that new domestic orders began to show year-over-
year declines in January, and the company was starting to experience 
some order cancellations. Order growth had been slowing since the 
latter half of 1990, but the rate of decline in January orders was 
not as severe as experienced in early 1987. A manufacturer of a wide 
variety of capital goods, who had experienced solid growth through 
much of 1990, reported a sharp decline in orders for nondefense 
machinery in January. However, a small producer of electric engines 
reported strong export-based orders, resulting from the relative 
weakness in the dollar. A District steel producer reported that 
orders from capital goods producers, such as farm equipment and most 
forms of industrial machinery, remained soft through February. 
However, orders from machine tool producers were strong, along with 
orders from those manufacturers who enjoyed solid export growth 
potential.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After holding up relatively well through the end of 1990, steel 
production fell significantly in January and early February, and the 
industry's operating rate fell to about 65 percent in early February 
(compared to 85 percent in the year-earlier period). A large 
District steel producer reported that production has begun to lag 
shipments, following some inventory building in December. According 
to this contact, steel suppliers to the auto industry are 
increasingly cautious about maintaining inventory at levels 
sufficient to respond quickly to an auto production turnaround.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price erosion contributed to poor steel industry profits in 1990 and 
may continue to hold down profits this year. One senior executive 
expressed optimism that the industry would benefit from price 
increases, which officially became effective in early 1991. However, 
part of the proposed increase has already been rolled back. Some 
industry analysts are projecting continued price erosion in 1991, 
citing increased competition to meet slowing domestic demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several District loan officers reported further tightening in loan 
terms for commercial and industrial customers in early 1991. 
Tightening most often took the form of higher spreads, smaller 
credit lines, and increased credit-line costs. These actions were 
reported more frequently, and with greater magnitudes, for lending 
to large borrowers than to small borrowers. Because the new 
tightening in credit-line terms only applies to new lines of credit, 
the ultimate impact on total credit-line utilization may not be felt 
immediately, according to several financial analysts. One District 
banker, who reported little change in lending policy, also cited 
weak demand as contributing to slow lending activity. However, this 
contact used that potential commercial and industrial customers 
seemed to be "shopping around" more often for the bank offering the 
best terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lower mortgage interest rates may have recently helped to spark some 
activity in the residential real estate market. Several District 
sources reported higher levels of inquiries in recent weeks, which 
may translate into increased home resale activity in coming months. 
One large District realtor reported that residential transaction 
volume declines seemed to level off somewhat in January. The rate of 
decline in February was at a much slower pace than in late 1990, and 
inquiries began to increase. Most new business has been generated by 
first-time home buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several contacts noted that interest rate declines are not a key 
factor in today's commercial market, as institutional investors 
remain reluctant to provide capital for new projects. One large 
retailer stated that the firm's new store expansion program was 
being held back, not for strategic reasons or internal cash flow 
problems, but by the inability of shopping mall developers to obtain 
financing for new projects. A structural steel fabricator stated 
that architectural firms continue to cut back on employment, a sign 
that a turnaround in sales of construction materials is not in 
sight. Industrial properties remain the strongest in the commercial 
market, however, and have recently been viewed more favorably by 
investors, according to one commercial realtor.
