      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District appears to have improved 
slightly around yearend, with further improvement expected in 1986. 
Christmas season sales, though not up to retailers' expectations, 
contributed to a moderate increase in final quarter sales. Though 
auto sales were sluggish at yearend, dealers are cautiously 
optimistic for 1986. Inventories of retail goods and industrial 
materials are generally viewed as satisfactory. Prices are expected 
to be relatively stable both for inputs and at retail. Homebuilders 
are optimistic for 1986 in spite of some weakness in 1985. Savings 
inflows to thrift institutions are expected to increase and mortgage 
rates are expected to stabilize. Total loan demand is stable and 
total deposits are higher at commercial banks. Farm liquidations and 
foreclosures remain a problem, in spite of some improvement in 
yearend loan paydowns.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report a moderate increase in sales for the last three 
months of 1985 over the same period a year earlier. Clothing sales 
have been strong while home furnishing sales have been weak. Sales 
are expected to increase slightly through 1986. Prices have been 
stable and are expected to remain so. Generally, retailers are 
satisfied with their inventory levels and expect to maintain them 
throughout 1986. Sales for Christmas 1985 were relatively strong but 
not up to retailers' expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales, healthy for most of 1985, slowed by yearend. But new 
factory incentives and credit market conditions in general continue 
to have a positive impact on sales. Dealers are cautiously 
optimistic about new car sales in 1986. Most new car dealers are 
generally satisfied with their inventories. Colorado dealers report 
that inventories of used cars are too high, as factory sponsored 
financing on new autos has resulted in a glut of used cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      East purchasing agents surveyed had not experienced price increases 
in the past three months and expect prices to remain fairly stable 
through 1986, due to an ample supply of materials. Some firms have 
trimmed materials inventory levels in recent months but most report 
that current levels are satisfactory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area homebuilders report that housing activity in 1985 was generally 
below that of 1984, but they are somewhat optimistic for 1986. 
Housing starts in 1985 are fewer than those in 1984. Both prices and 
sales of new homes are generally at or slightly below 1984 levels. 
Most area homebuilders expect housing starts, sales of new home and 
prices of new homes for 1986 to be at or slightly above 1985 levels. 
Prices of most housing materials in 1985 remained close to 1984 
levels, with stable to slightly lower materials prices expected for 
1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan institutions give mixed reports regarding current 
savings inflows relative to a year earlier, but they expect savings 
inflows to increase in 1986. Respondents report constant mortgage 
demand and commitments and expect little change. Mortgage rates have 
been falling and most respondents expect them to remain at present 
levels in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand was stable and total deposits were higher at Tenth 
District banks compared with a month earlier. Consumer loans, 
commercial and industrial loans, and residential real estate loans 
were generally constant. Commercial real estate lending decreased at 
most of the banks surveyed, while agricultural lending was steady to 
slightly lower. Tenth District bankers did not change either their 
prime rate or their consumer loan rates during the last month, and 
most did not anticipate any rate changes in the near future. Total 
deposits rose at Tenth District banks. Most respondents report 
higher levels of demand deposits and MMDA's. Super NOW accounts, 
small time deposits, and large certificates of deposit typically 
were constant, while changes in NOW accounts were mixed. Passbook 
savings accounts continued their recent pattern of decline. Bankers 
are beginning to see the usual seasonal inflows into IRA and Keogh 
accounts. Tenth District banks, in general, have not changed the 
minimum balances on their Super NOW's and MMDA's in response to 
recent deregulation. Several bankers were considering changes in 
minimum balances, however, though most respondents doubted 
significant effects on the kinds of deposits held by bank customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Paydowns on agricultural loans at the end of 1985 generally were 
reported to be satisfactory in the Tenth District. For most banks, 
1985 marked an improved yearend paydown situation over a year 
earlier. Excellent crop yields and stronger year-end livestock 
prices accounted for the better than expected loan situation. Even 
so, bankers report that they will not carry all of their current 
farm accounts through 1986. Some borrowers are being sent to 
alternative lenders, while in cases of extreme financial stress 
backers are urging operators to liquidate part of their assets. 
Voluntary farm liquidations are running above normal in most areas. 
Few bankers are resorting to foreclosure as an immediate solution to 
failing loans, though most indicate that foreclosure is a future 
possibility for some borrowers. Farm Credit System (FCS) lenders in 
some parts of the district have not had as much foreclosure 
flexibility as the commercial banks. FCS outlets operating under a 
burden of troubled loans continue to follow strict loan review 
guidelines. Bankers report that the recent FCS bailout legislation 
has done little to alter the behavior of the FCS outlets in their 
area. Only a slight upswing in equipment sales was evident at the 
end of 1985.
