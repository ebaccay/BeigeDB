      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 25, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Tenth District economy continues to grow slowly. Retail sales 
have strengthened, as have new car sales. Manufacturers report high 
capacity use rates and some labor shortages. Demand for capital 
goods is still increasing. Farm incomes are at a high level, and 
that sector's financial recovery continues. Housing activity is 
weak, however, and the energy sector shows little change. Loan 
demand at commercial banks has changed little, while deposits have 
grown slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All respondents note that retail sales have improved from a year 
earlier, and most report that Christmas sales expectations were met 
or exceeded. Promotional activities have now returned to normal 
post-holiday levels. Sales of sportswear and accessories are 
relatively strong; sales of home furnishings are relatively weak. 
Prices are generally steady to slightly higher with some retailers 
reporting adjustments to wholesale price increases. Retailers' 
expectations are optimistic and inventory levels are generally 
satisfactory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents report steady to slightly higher automobile sales 
over the last month. Adequate dealer and consumer financing is 
generally available. Most dealers report that they have sold most of 
the 1988 model cars, but some report higher than desired inventory 
levels. In general, dealers are optimistic about the outlook for 
automobile sales during 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents are reporting moderate increases in major input prices 
compared with last year. Input prices are expected to level off in 
the months ahead, with some materials prices expected to fall 
somewhat. Firms are not experiencing difficulty getting materials, 
with some lead times shortening and availability a little better 
than a year ago. Most respondents are satisfied with inventory 
levels, but a few plan to trim inventories. Firms are operating at 
high levels of capacity use, with some shortages of labor, both 
skilled and unskilled.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for capital goods is still increasing, on balance, among 
Tenth District manufacturers, although a sizable minority of 
respondents report some slowing. Nearly all respondents directed 
their 1988 capital spending toward equipment purchases rather than 
new plant construction, a mix that is expected to continue in 1989. 
Capital spending in 1988 did increase capacity slightly, however, 
through replacing obsolete equipment with more progressive 
equipment, acquiring additional equipment, and adding shifts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The majority of respondents export some of their output, and they 
report stable to increasing exports, which are unhampered by 
capacity constraints. Firms generally believe they can easily switch 
from producing for domestic customers to producing for foreign 
customers. Most respondents import some of their capital goods, but 
few have been increasing those imports. Uncertainty about changes in 
the value of the dollar is not an important consideration in capital 
spending decisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's energy industry remains stable following OPEC's 
recent agreement to restrict output. Although oil prices have firmed 
recently, uncertainty about the agreement's longer term effect on 
oil prices has held down drilling activity. December drilling 
activity was down over a fourth from a year ago, but the average 
number of active drilling rigs in the district rose slightly from 
263 in November to 270 in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity in the district remains weak. Homebuilders report 
that housing starts were down in December 1988 compared to December 
1987 and were generally unchanged from November 1988. Single-family 
construction continues to be the strongest component, while multi-
family construction remains weak, New home prices are reported 
somewhat higher, and the recent high level of home inventories is 
returning to normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents from district savings and loan institutions report mixed 
savings inflow performance relative both to a year ago and to a 
month ago. Expectations of future savings inflows are also mixed. 
Promotional activity and a "flight to quality" from troubled 
institutions are largely credited for improvements in savings 
inflows at some institutions. Mortgage demand has been constant or 
down slightly in recent months. Mortgage interest rates have 
generally increased and are expected to increase further in the 
coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District commercial banks report little change in loan demand over 
the past month. Demand for commercial and industrial loans and 
consumer loans was up slightly at a few institutions, while demand 
for most other types of loans was either constant or down slightly. 
About half of the respondents increased their prime rates by fifty 
basis points; most of the others had raised their rates earlier. 
Most of the respondents expect further increases in the near term. 
Consumer loan rates increased at most of the banks surveyed, and, 
again, most banks expect additional increases. Deposits increased 
somewhat at district banks, with the greatest strength in demand 
deposits, NOW accounts, and small time deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although the 1988 drought was generally not as severe in the Tenth 
District as in other parts of the nation, the moisture situation and 
crop conditions remain a concern in 1989. Several district areas 
have experienced very dry conditions through fall end early winter, 
and moisture is needed soon to ensure a healthy winter wheat crop in 
1989. Soil moisture reserves are being further depleted by dry 
weather, which will make 1989 crops especially dependent on timely 
rains during the growing season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong crop and livestock prices produced relatively high farm 
income in the Tenth District in 1988. As a result, year-end loan 
repayment rates were generally high, continuing the financial 
recovery begun in 1987. Most bankers in the region expect fewer 
credit renewals in the coming spring credit season as some farmers 
pay off operating loans and reduce carryover debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Changes in federal farm programs may have only a small effect on the 
financial situation of district farmers. Reduced acreage idling 
requirements may boost loan demand as farmers put land back into 
crop production. Fewer acres may be farmed in some areas of the 
district, however, as more acres are placed in the Conservation 
Reserve Program, trimming operating credit needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      While strong livestock prices have contributed significantly to high 
farm income, little expansion has taken place in district livestock 
operations. Cow/calf operators appear to be just maintaining herds, 
holding back replacement heifers while selling cows. Inadequate 
wheat pastures have forced some stocker operations to reduce herds 
or purchase additional feed.
