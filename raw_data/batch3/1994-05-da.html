      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace. Price 
pressures were mixed. Additional hiring led to scattered wage 
pressures in some industries. Manufacturers reported an increase in 
orders. Business service firms said that demand was higher and that 
prices were generally stable or lower. Construction and real estate 
demand increased leading to higher prices in several markets. 
Strength in natural gas prices kept energy activity stronger than 
expected despite weakness in oil prices. Agricultural conditions 
improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing orders increased, leading to hiring and scattered wage 
pressures. Price movements were mixed. Demand for construction-
related manufacturing continued to be strong. Brick and cement 
producers were operating at capacity and tight inventories led to 
higher prices. Glass producers said that they were hiring because of 
higher demand from automobile manufacturers. Orders for lumber and 
wood products weakened but were stronger than a year earlier. Some 
contacts lowered their lumber prices to unload inventory because 
they were concerned that demand would slow. Sales of corrugated 
boxes increased, while sales of other packaging materials remained 
steady. Prices and input costs were higher for boxes and packaging
products. Primary metal producers reported higher demand for their 
products, especially steel. Demand for fabricated metals was 
slightly below year-ago levels. Sales of electrical and electronic 
machinery increased. Prices were lower for semiconductors, printed 
circuit boards, and computers. Apparel contacts said that demand for 
garments increased, and they were optimistic that growth in orders 
would continue. Higher wages led to higher prices for some apparel 
products. Growth in contracts for garment-finishing slowed, however, 
causing lay offs in this segment of the industry. Some of this work 
was absorbed into other parts of the industry through vertical 
integration. Some garment-finishing was moved to other countries, 
including Mexico, and some contracts were delayed because a new 
"wrinkle-free" process had slowed production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for food and kindred products increased. Wood producers 
reported that they were passing along higher costs by raising their 
prices. Demand for chemicals remained strong. Inventories of 
ethylene and propylene were very low, and prices increased for those 
and some other chemicals. Despite the increases, prices remained low 
for many chemicals and several companies were planning 
restructurings and job cuts. Refiners reported that cold weather had 
stimulated demand for oil products and that low oil prices had 
boosted profit margins. Demand and margins slipped this spring, but 
remained healthy. Natural gas drilling continued to boost demand for 
oil field equipment and services. A backlog of orders is expected to 
keep sales of energy-related manufacturing strong through the second 
quarter. Except for Canada, foreign demand for energy equipment and 
services had been weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business service firms said that demand increased and prices were 
generally stable. Temporary service contacts still reported the 
strongest activity, but advertising, accounting, communications, 
consulting, transportation and legal firms also reported growing 
demand for their services. Temporary businesses said that they are 
having difficulty hiring in Austin and Dallas and expect wages and 
prices to increase. Heavy competition led to unusually heavy 
discounting of transportation services. Several service firms noted 
that their medical insurance costs were increasing at a slower rate 
or declining. Hospitals reported that lower demand for inpatient 
care led several facilities to restructure their operations to 
reduce costs and employees. One hospital contact said that HMOs and 
other managed care contracts are critical to maintaining demand and 
that selection is driven increasingly more by price than quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales continued to grow slowly. Sales remained very 
competitive, and contacts who reported the strongest sales gains 
also reported that their prices were below year-ago levels. Some 
contacts with national companies reported that sales at their stores 
in Texas were not as strong as at stores in other parts of the 
country. Auto sales were strong in March and contacts were 
optimistic that sales growth would continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate activity increased across most of the 
District. New home construction remained very strong and prices were 
higher because of higher costs particularly for sheet rock, brick, 
concrete, and developed land. Fear of higher interest rates was 
credited with causing a surge in existing home sales in Dallas and 
Houston. Apartment markets continued to be tight with some new 
construction in Dallas and Austin. Occupancies are high and rents 
are rising, particularly in Austin. Commercial markets strengthened, 
especially retail and industrial. Office markets tightened in 
Austin, El Paso and San Antonio.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strength in natural gas prices kept energy activity stronger than 
expected despite weakness in oil prices. Oil prices bounced between 
$14 and $17 per barrel in March and April. Prices were pushed up by 
signs of stronger economic growth and reduced shipments out of the 
North Sea. Natural gas spot prices dropped to $2.05 per Mcf as 
winter weather moderated. Still, the number of rigs searching for 
natural gas did not experience a normal seasonal decline and oil 
drilling dropped only slightly. Improved technology spurred drilling 
in the Gulf of Mexico - "the hottest offshore market in the world." 
Rigs, supply boats and other offshore equipment were being brought 
into the Gulf from all over the world. Over 70 percent of Gulf 
drilling is for natural gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers reported moderate loan demand. Lending was particularly 
strong in Austin and along the Mexican border. Real estate lending 
remained strong but contacts noted growth in consumer lending and 
said that they were being increasingly aggressive in obtaining 
business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural conditions improved and crop planting was ahead of the 
1989-93 average. Crops and livestock were generally in fair to good 
condition, and supplemental feeding of livestock had decreased. 
Still, most areas continued to be in need of a good soaking rain. In 
March the Texas Index of Prices Received for All Farm Products was 
1.3 percent higher than a year earlier. Livestock and Livestock 
Product Prices were 5.2 percent below last year's level, while the 
Crop Prices rose 17.0 percent from a year ago.
