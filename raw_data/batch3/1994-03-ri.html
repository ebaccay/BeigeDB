      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity expanded in January and early February. 
Manufacturing output increased, and the cold and snow boosted 
business at District ski resorts. Housing sales and commercial real 
estate activity strengthened, state tax collections increased, and 
loan demand rose somewhat. Retail activity and housing starts 
declined, in part because of unseasonably harsh winter weather. 
Housing prices were steady, but the costs of business inputs rose 
and commercial rents edged up. In agriculture, severe weather caused 
little damage to crops and livestock, but hay was in short supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that activity decreased in January. 
Revenues, employment, inventories, and shopper traffic declined, 
while wages and sales of big-ticket items were steady. Carolina 
respondents indicated that the mid-February ice storm barely 
affected their sales, but contacts in other District states reported 
reduced sales activity extending over several days. Looking ahead to 
the next six months, District retailers expected their sales to 
increase. They also expected retail prices to rise, but by less than 
the general rate of inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite unseasonably severe weather, manufacturers responding to our 
regular mail survey indicated that District factory activity grew 
moderately in January. Shipments, new orders, the average workweek, 
and order backlogs increased, and employment changed little. 
Finished goods prices were steady, and raw materials prices rose by 
less than inflation. One bakery owner, however, noted that prices 
for oil, flour, and sugar had risen dramatically. Another contact 
said that sheet steel producers had raised their prices. Most 
respondents expected shipments, the workweek, and prices to increase 
over the next six months, but they foresaw little change in 
employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service-Producing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our survey of service-producing firms indicated that activity was 
steady in January. Revenues, employment, and wages generally changed 
little from December. Firms in North Carolina, however, reported 
increased revenues, while those in West Virginia said revenues 
declined. Respondents expressed more optimism about their business 
prospects than they had previously, and they expected prices to 
increase only modestly during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at the District ports of Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk) indicated that exports were unchanged while 
imports were higher in January than in December and a year ago. 
Fewer vessels called at the Port of Baltimore, but they more than 
made up for their decline in number by carrying larger loads. 
Baltimore and Charleston expected export growth to outpace import 
growth during the next six months, but Hampton Roads expected both 
to grow at about the same pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity at District hotels, motels, and resorts was higher in 
February than in December and a year ago, according to our contacts. 
Ski resorts in North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia reported 
unusually good activity as did respondents at beach locations. Most 
contacts expected tourist activity to continue to improve during the 
next six months. Advance bookings at some coastal areas in the 
Carolinas were at record levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions improved during the last six weeks, according to 
District financial institutions. Some bankers noted that commercial 
loan demand was up and that loan activity had shifted from business 
refinancings to business expansions. Interest rates on commercial 
loans rose. Consumer loan demand and interest rates were steady. 
Several respondents noted that unusually harsh winter weather had 
had little impact on consumer loan activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage activity was steady, as a rise in originations offset a 
slight fall in refinancings. Rates on residential mortgages rose, 
which most respondents attributed to the recent tightening by the 
Federal Reserve. Loan officers had a positive outlook for all 
categories of lending activity in the near term but suggested that 
mortgage refinancing activity might taper off further if rates 
continued to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential and Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District real estate activity strengthened in January and early 
February. Our contacts attributed stronger residential sales to 
continued consumer optimism about the economy and to a perception 
that mortgage rates had bottomed out. Recent harsh weather 
apparently did not dampen sales much but did reduce housing starts. 
Home prices were little changed during the period, but most 
homebuilders again reported increases in the costs of lumber and 
other building materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate conditions continued to improve. Lower 
vacancy rates in the retail sector were widely reported, and vacancy 
rates in Charlotte fell to a six-year low. Retail construction was 
underway in many areas, much of it being built by its discount chain 
occupants. Similarly, activity in the office and industrial sectors 
strengthened. Contacts expected a pickup in office leasing activity 
in the Washington area because a freeze on federal government 
leasing recently ended. Respondents reported speculative office 
building construction outside of Raleigh and in the Washington 
suburbs and noted construction of buildings to be occupied by owners 
in several other areas. Office rents were higher as a result of 
reduced landlord concessions and, in some instances, direct rent 
increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State revenue forecasters reported healthy tax revenue growth in 
most jurisdictions. Growth was slower in Maryland than in other 
states but remained on an upward trend. Contacts reported a 
turnaround in the District of Columbia where one individual said of 
the local economy, "It's not healthy, but perhaps the fever is 
breaking." Most states reported strong January sales tax 
collections, although Maryland's fell short of estimates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural sector suffered only slightly from the severe 
winter weather. Small grains were in fair to good condition in most 
areas, with few reports of freeze damage. Winter calving and lambing 
activity and survival rates were normal. Several livestock 
producers, however, reported ice-related injuries to cattle and 
sheep. The bad weather increased hay usage and short hay stocks were 
widely reported. In some instances, livestock producers were culling 
herds as a result.
