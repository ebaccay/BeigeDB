      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District slowed moderately in 
October and early November, although several contacts reported that 
some sectors were holding firm. Retailing sources indicated that 
personal consumption spending has begun to show the effects of a 
decline in consumer confidence, and it is difficult to detect 
previously available signs of relative strength in spending in the 
District. A slowdown in orders from auto dealers prompted Big Three 
automakers to reduce assembly plans for the fourth quarter, 
affecting a number of District production facilities. Overall 
manufacturing activity is mixed, however, with strength in shipments 
in several key sectors accompanied by some weakening in orders in 
other sectors. Large District banks generally continued to tighten 
lending standards, especially for commercial real estate 
development. While many projects continue to move ahead, a number of 
contacts expressed growing concern about future construction 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer confidence fell more sharply from July to October than in 
any three month period in the last 44 years, including the 1973-74 
oil embargo period, according to the University of Michigan's Index 
of Consumer Sentiment. Several contacts in the retail sector stated 
that this decline has begun to impact consumer spending. A national 
department store chain reported that the weakness in comparable-
store sales that developed in October continued into early November. 
Results in several Midwestern markets were somewhat better than in 
the nation as a whole, although sales still declined (year-over-
year) in October and early November. Store traffic has slowed, 
according to this contact, but the average expenditure per customer 
is holding up. A fast-growing specialty retail chain based in the 
District reported that sales growth in September and October dropped 
more sharply than in past experience. Sales in the company's big-
ticket durable goods category fell sharply from a year ago. Recent 
weakness in durable goods sales was also reported by a large 
department store chain, with October appliance sales in the Chicago 
metropolitan area declining somewhat less than in the nation as a 
whole. A large national discount store chain reported that the month 
of October ended stronger than it began, with good momentum 
continuing into November. This contact had reported declining year-
over-year sales growth from June through September, a trend that 
reversed itself in October and early November. District sales growth 
lagged behind the company's national average, principally because of 
increased competition in the Midwestern market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Auto Production
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto production in the District faces a serious slowdown over the 
next several mouths. Slowing dealer orders have prompted Big Three 
automakers to reduce production schedules for the fourth quarter, 
and several auto industry analysts maintained that Big Three 
production cutbacks probably will be greater than those already 
announced. While income guarantees included in organized labor 
contracts may help cushion the impact on District consumer spending, 
one analyst noted that the employees of many regional suppliers to 
the industry do not enjoy such protection. Still, several automakers 
contended that current and expected conditions should not produce a 
slump in the auto sector comparable to those in previous 
recessionary periods. One industry spokesman argued that 1991 sales 
could be as high as in 1990 if the Middle East crisis is resolved 
soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall manufacturing activity in the District is mixed. While other 
durable-goods sectors have weakened along with autos recently, 
machine tool orders in October were robust and steel production 
remained solid. A large District steel producer reported that 
October was a good month for the company's shipments. Order books 
for the industry are generally full for the fourth quarter. Steel 
orders for the first quarter of 1991 look normal, according to an 
industry economist, including orders from the auto industry. A major 
producer of capital goods in the District reported that nondefense 
machinery shipments in October grew slightly faster than for the 
year-to-date period. However, nondefense machinery orders declined 
in October, in contrast to relatively strong growth for the year-to-
date period. The capital-goods market was characterized as showing 
"no widespread recessionary cratering," but concern was expressed 
about the near-term outlook. New weakness in orders is consistent 
with the results of October purchasing managers' surveys in Chicago 
and Indianapolis, both of which showed relatively sharp declines in 
the new orders component.
     </p>
     <p>
      Slowing economies in Canada, Western Europe, and other foreign 
markets could affect a significant source of expected strength in 
the District's manufacturing sector. A large District producer of 
heavy equipment reported continued slowing in unit sales in October 
and early November in many of its important overseas markets, 
following the weakness that developed over the summer. Sales growth 
in Asia has continued at about the same pace recorded in the third 
quarter, however. A capital goods producer in the District reported 
solid increases in export sales (in current dollar amounts) in 
October, but noted continued weakness in some of its foreign 
subsidiaries' sales. Another large exporter in the District, which 
produces less cyclically sensitive goods, stated that unit sales 
volume overseas continued to expand in October and November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The downturn in the U.S. commercial real estate market, the prospect 
of higher deposit insurance premiums, and bank regulatory concerns 
about capital adequacy have combined to tighten credit standards at 
large banks in the District. One bank economist stated that recent 
loan demand has been driven in part by greater customer concerns 
about the future supply of credit, which contributed to a recent 
surge in medium-term note issues. Several large District banks 
reported stricter standards on commercial and industrial loan 
applications by large borrowers, while a smaller number disclosed 
stricter standards for small and middle market firms. Approved 
lending generally (although not universally) bore higher spreads on 
loan rates over base rates, stricter covenants, decreased maximums 
for credit lines, and somewhat increased credit-line fees. District 
respondents generally reported tighter credit standards for 
construction and land development loans than for other types of 
loans. One large District lender stared that commercial mortgage 
loan foreclosures are "certain to exceed 1987 levels (the previous 
peak) in 1990."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While most construction projects that previously received financing 
continue to move ahead, commercial and multi-family residential 
construction have become generally acknowledged sources of weakness 
in the District economy. A large contractor in the District stated 
that occupancy and rental rates indicated that demand for new office 
building and hotel construction would probably be "falling rather 
sharply." Construction of retail stores and industrial structures 
has been relatively strong, but this contact believed that 
conditions would likely deteriorate in these areas as well. A large 
manufacturer of construction equipment reported that sales in the 
District were holding up relatively well. However, equipment 
customers were expressing reservations about future District 
construction activity, if conditions in the Northeast and the West 
Coast spread to the Midwest. A producer of construction materials 
reported greater declines in shipments for October than for the 
year-to-date, and noted that industry shipments in the District have 
begun to show declines comparable to those in the nation as a whole. 
Still, this source stated that Midwest construction activity is "not 
quite so bad" as in much of the rest of the country. A District 
manufacturer of capital goods used in construction reported that, 
after four months of deterioration in contract awards, order rates 
were just beginning to fall off. Reports of construction slowdowns 
are not universal, however, and development continues in many 
communities outside of major metropolitan areas in the District.
