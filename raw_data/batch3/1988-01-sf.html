      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy continues to exhibit good health 
overall. Retail sales during the Christmas season appear to have 
registered modest increases, of about 5 percent, over last year's 
levels. Manufacturing, agriculture, and forest products industries 
continue to show improved sales, with much of the growth attributed 
to exports. Construction activity, however, is flat or down in many 
parts of the West, as builders wait for current inventories to be 
sold. Lending activity shows mixed trends. For most western banks, 
the number of mortgage applications is higher than it was earlier in 
the fall, but below last years levels, while installment lending is 
on a downward trend. Few bankers noted changes in lending patterns 
that they attributed to the stock market decline last October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports suggest that Twelfth District retailers experienced sales 
gains averaging around 5 percent over last year's Christmas season, 
with a range of zero to 10 percent. For several stores, sales gains 
were close to the original plans made before October 19. Many 
respondents said that price cuts were deeper and earlier this year 
than they were last year, but several others reported discounting 
patterns similar to those of previous years. Reports on retail 
inventories were mixed, with about equal numbers of respondents 
reporting higher and lower inventories compared with last January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car sales are reported to have been slow in December in most parts 
of the District, and many dealers have accumulated inventories 
compared with three months ago and with year-earlier levels. One 
banker noted strong demand for boat loans through late fall, 
although there was a normal seasonal slowdown in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues to strengthen in the West, buoyed 
by the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar. Some respondents 
reported sharp increases in foreign equipment prices during early 
January. In addition, aluminum producers in the Northwest are 
enjoying a surge of activity generated by a combination of higher 
aluminum prices, lower wages, and a favorable electric rate schedule 
recently negotiated with the Bonneville Power Administration. 
Airplane inventories at western aerospace companies are very lean, 
due in part to strong export demand. Currently, one large firm has 
more than two years' worth of orders for commercial aircraft on its 
books.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy sector activity in the West remains higher than it was a year 
ago. In 1987, oil service firms posted losses equal to 4 percent of 
sales, an improvement over the dismal performance of 1986. Although 
the recent price decline did not reduce the demand for oil services, 
it did dash hopes of further gains. At present, industry observers 
expect drilling plans to remain stable if prices stay at or above 
$15 per barrel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are very lean in many export-oriented firms that produce 
paper, plywood, lumber, and logs. Drought-related logging 
restrictions have exacerbated the inventory tightness, so that log 
inventories stand at only 30 to 40 percent of their normal levels. 
The importance of export-related demand to these firms is 
illustrated by a major wood products firm, active only in the 
domestic market, which is experiencing just moderate growth, and is 
maintaining merely ordinary inventory production and inventory 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many agricultural products also have seen strong exports in recent 
months. For example, wheat exports are up 25 percent compared with a 
year ago. Inventories of some western crops are slightly higher than 
they were a year ago, due primarily to higher 1987 yields. 
Inventories of principal California crops (almonds, cotton, rice) 
are expected to fall quickly due to the strong export activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wine inventories are down, partly due to substantially lower 
imports, but also due to low grape yields last fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity is relatively sluggish in most parts of the 
West. In Arizona, housing starts are down nearly 40 percent, with 
multifamily construction at a virtual standstill. In contrast, the 
strong export-led growth in the coastal areas of the Pacific 
Northwest has buoyed both housing starts and commercial construction 
in that area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mortgage applications in December were down from their year-earlier 
levels in most parts of the District, but some bankers pointed out 
that the strong refinancing activity of a year ago accounts for much 
of the decline. Some bankers reported increases in mortgage 
applications between the third and fourth quarters of 1987, which 
they attributed to the decline in long-term interest rates. However, 
one banker noted a substantial decline in the number of requests for 
new construction loans compared with six months ago and with a year 
ago. Several bankers reported that demand for home equity loans was 
strong throughout 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applications for consumer installment loans also were below their 
year-earlier levels at many western banks. In the Seattle area, one 
banker reported installment loan applications up about 2 percent 
from last year which, although better than most banks' experiences, 
represents a marked deterioration from the 13 to 14 percent growth 
rate this bank registered a year earlier. Several bankers noted no 
discontinuities in credit patterns associated with the stock market 
decline in October, although a few argued that the October crash 
reduced loan demand dramatically.
