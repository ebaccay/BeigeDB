      Beige Book Report: Chicago

       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District has experienced a slow but increasingly 
widespread advance in economic activity since the end of January. 
Recent indicators of regional economic activity generally signaled 
expansion in February. Most manufacturers reported flat to modest 
improvement in activity and expect production to improve in the 
months ahead. Auto dealers' orders over die last month have been 
better than the industry expected, but auto suppliers have seen only 
limited improvements in their orders. Several retailers have also 
indicated "surprisingly strong" sales in February, even though part 
of the improvement over year-ago levels still reflects weak sales 
last year. Housing activity in the District picked up markedly in 
February, aided in part by unseasonably warm weather. Business 
lending activity has changed little in recent months, but an 
increase in loan demand was noted in selected markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Regional Indicators
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of District economic activity for the month of February 
were generally positive. Purchasing managers' surveys for Chicago 
and Milwaukee showed solid gains in orders and production, although 
their employment indexes remained relatively weak. The Detroit index 
switched from signaling widespread contraction to modest expansion 
in both non-auto and auto-related businesses, led again by increases 
in production, orders, and--for nonauto-related businesses-vender 
performance. Purchasing managers' reports taken over the second half 
of January for Western Michigan, which is more dependent on office 
furniture and appliances than autos, indicated some slowing in the 
overall rate of decline in that area's activity, although several 
survey participants stated that business was picking up or was 
expected to pick up by the end of the first quarter. Help-wanted 
advertising in the Midwest region declined slightly in January, 
although in recent months it has been holding up somewhat better 
than in other regions. A survey of hiring activity in the region 
expects hiring to be down this quarter, but to rebound in the second 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on manufacturing activity in the District have turned 
increasingly positive since the last report, although some producers 
were still reporting that activity has remained depressed since the 
end of last year. Several auto producers report a marked improvement 
in dealer orders for light vehicles, especially minivans, since the 
end of January, and one producer has begun to revise production 
schedules upward. Car orders remain weak relative to light truck 
orders, but car production this quarter is still expected to be 
slightly higher than in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted 
basis. With sales rates running above production rates, several 
sources expect that dealers will have to increase car orders soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      While several auto suppliers are anticipating an increase in auto 
production, improvements in their auto-related activity has not yet 
appeared. One supplier noted that delivery schedules to auto 
producers have stabilized in recent weeks, suggesting that auto 
production plans are firming. A supplier of transmissions stated 
that sales were down in January, although spot improvements were 
noted, particularly in 5-speed transmissions. A steel producer 
reported that first quarter bookings show a seasonally adjusted 
improvement over the fourth quarter. However, gains were not 
attributed to autos, but rather to an increase in orders from steel 
service centers, which generally derive their demand from small 
industrial customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several District retailers reported solid year-over-year gains in 
same-store sales during January and February, even when considering 
the weakness in sales a year ago. A large discount chain reported 
improved sales, particularly in home products, despite intense 
competitive pressure on prices. Nondurable-goods producers are 
offering attractive bulk deals to large retailers, apparently to 
reduce inventory, and retailers are running special promotions to 
take advantage of the deals. A major department store chain, which 
recorded double-digit sales growth in January, continued to post 
equivalent year-over-year gains in February, led by furniture and 
appliance sales. A survey of retailers in the Northern Illinois and 
Indiana area suggests that recent sales gains are concentrated among
department stores, while sales at specialty stores continue to be 
weak. However, one retailer noted that department stores suffered 
greater weakness a year ago than the specialty stores, which may 
account for the current difference in performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several auto dealers were upbeat about February auto sales. Traffic 
has been improving since the end of last year, according to several 
contacts. One Michigan dealer recorded the best February in the 
franchises' ten-year history. According to another dealer, "nearly 
new" program cars are still an important source of dealership sales, 
but reduced availability of program cars over the next few months 
should shift the mix of sales toward new cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Gains in housing starts for the Midwest in January were followed by 
a surge in new home sales in February. A larger realty firm noted 
that existing home sales in the Chicago area began to strengthen in 
January, and sales for the firm continue to run about 25-30% above 
"normal" levels for this time of year. Gains are attributed to lower 
interest rates, a mild winter, and stable house prices. Home 
builders are reporting an upward trend in sales, and one developer 
has started planning two new projects in the Chicago area. A 
supplier of building materials sees an unmistakable uptick in sales, 
with sales to professional home builders in the Chicago area up 40% 
from a weak year-ago period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business loan activity in the District has changed little since the 
end of last year, but several large banks in the District cited 
signs of improvement in loan demand from middle-market businesses. 
With credit standards unchanged, several banks cited weak loan 
demand, rather than credit availability, as the reason for the lack 
of improvement in lending. However, a bank economist reported a few 
cases of customers seeking financing to activate capital spending 
programs that had been postponed in the fourth quarter. One bank 
reported some increase in loans to small businesses for the purpose 
of financing inventory. Mortgage demand was moderately stronger at 
some large banks, but unchanged at others. An auto dealer noted that 
effective interest rates on new auto loans declined in recent 
months, as local banks have become more aggressive in their lending 
than at the end of last year. However, several large banks reported 
little change in demand for consumer installment loans.
