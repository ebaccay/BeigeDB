      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 20, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District respondents are a little more optimistic about 
short-term prospects for manufacturing than they were several weeks 
ago. Higher motor vehicle output should add to overall output this 
quarter. Capital spending plans from the sample of District 
manufacturers call for larger spending increases than indicated in 
the latest Commerce Department survey, and export growth is expected 
to continue at least through the balance of this year. Respondents, 
however, appear more cautious about the short-term outlook for 
consumer spending. Lenders and borrowers acknowledge tightening in 
credit availability and lending standards in real estate, but also 
note that other declines in lending are due to easing in demand for 
single-family houses and for consumer credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Output
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The 5.9 percent unemployment rate in Ohio in April and May has been 
relatively unchanged since last fall, despite monthly fluctuations. 
Employment in manufacturing has held steady, and services employment 
has continued to grow, albeit slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents report that manufacturing output rose in May and expect 
that second quarter growth in output, particularly in autos, will be 
stronger than in the first quarter. Higher auto output should add 
between 0.5 and 1.0 percentage point to the real GNP growth rate 
this quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers are more optimistic about capital spending 
for 1990 than reported in the latest Commerce Department survey. 
Respondents plan larger percentage increases in nominal outlays this 
year than last, and all but one report that they plan to increase 
their capital spending this year by a larger percentage than the 
planned 3.4 percent indicated in the latest Commerce survey. A few 
manufacturers plan to add capacity for products that were in short 
supply during the peak 1987-88 period. Others mentioned the need for 
product quality improvement and for further modernization of 
facilities. Some also remarked that 1990 may be the peak year in 
their multiyear capital spending programs. Most respondents 
mentioned that they plan to finance most of their 1990 capital 
spending from internally generated funds. They expect that profits 
from production will revive this quarter. The run-up in interest 
rates earlier this year was not judged to be a deterrent to spending 
plans for 1990 because real rates of interest did not change much.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Exports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Multinational firms as well as smaller businesses headquartered in 
this District report that overseas markets remain generally strong, 
although some expect a slowdown in U.S. export growth later this 
year. Capital goods producers were optimistic about export prospects 
again this year. Exchange rate changes apparently have not had much 
effect on exports so far in 1990. A capital goods producer commented 
that costs of parts and sub-assemblies have risen in recent months, 
but that changes in exchange rates of even 10 percent to 15 percent 
are "swamped" by rapid improvement in technology. An auto parts 
producer reports that effects of dollar appreciation relative to the 
yen may be less than expected because Japanese auto producers are 
attempting to use American-produced products where possible to meet 
domestic-content goals for new cars. Several export-sensitive firms 
are concerned that anti-inflation policies in Brazil will either 
reduce exports to that country or diminish earnings from their 
plants located there.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major retailers report disappointing May and early June sales 
volumes, especially for apparel, which they attribute to 
unseasonable weather, slower income gains, and more competition from 
discount stores. Home furnishing sales also weakened. Another 
retailer reports good sales over the past several weeks, however, 
apparently in response to an upgrading of its merchandise. Two large 
retailers contacted report that inventories are high relative to 
their objective. They also expect soft sales, at least through the 
summer months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents acknowledge that credit standards have tightened, 
but report that ample funds are available except for real estate and 
for highly leveraged transactions. Some large commercial banks 
apparently are not presently interested in development and 
construction loans, while some others are still making those loans, 
but with terms that could include a few percentage points above 
prime, extensive documentation, and personal guarantees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The problem in real estate appears to be in multifamily housing and 
in commercial buildings, where developers and builders complain that 
it is "hard to find lenders." Lenders, for their part, emphasize 
prudence in their exposure to this sector of the economy. Small 
builders, especially of single-family units, report funds are still 
ample, although FIRREA legislation has forced a search for credit 
away from traditional lenders, generally thrifts. According to one 
report, the major complaint among single-family builders is a 
sluggish demand for houses rather than unavailability of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      At present, there is little to indicate that credit conditions have 
tightened in other parts of the regional economy. Bankers report 
that recent slowing in growth of consumer credit is due to softening 
demand rather than to tightened supply of credit. A few lenders 
noted that consumer spending could be dampened if lines of credit 
based on equity in homes are reduced.
