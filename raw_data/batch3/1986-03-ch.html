      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 20,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from respondents and other information indicate that 
moderate overall expansion in the Seventh District continues. The 
plunge in oil prices and the recent sharp drop in interest rates 
(which some analysts believe is related to lower oil prices) are 
contributing to favorable expectations regarding the economic 
outlook. Chicago purchasing managers reported a healthy upturn in 
orders and production in January and February, but not in 
employment. Commercial and industrial electric power usage in the 
region has been on an upward trend since last summer, breaking the 
sluggish trend of recent years. Construction activity continues at a 
vigorous pace in portions of the District, notably the Chicago area 
and southeast Michigan, but is soft in other areas, particularly in 
Iowa, primarily an agricultural state. Demand for motor vehicles 
remains strong, but will require ongoing incentive programs. Orders 
for steel are improved. Employment growth in this region continues 
to trail the nation. Heavy emphasis on cost containment, merger-
related staff reductions, and plant closings have restrained hiring 
and caused layoffs, in a wide range of industries. Agriculture 
remains depressed. Farmers are confused over details of the recent 
farm legislation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After more than three years of expansion, payroll employment in the 
District is 3 percent below the late 1970s, with only Wisconsin 
higher. Manufacturing in the five-state region is 21 percent below 7 
years ago, with Illinois down 27 percent. Numerous firms in various 
industries continue efforts to increase efficiency and 
competitiveness, by controlling costs, often through layoffs. 
Mergers and acquisitions often bring job cuts as positions deemed 
duplicative are eliminated. In some cases, job cutbacks result from 
work being shifted abroad. Examples include processing of 
manufacturers' coupons in Iowa and manufacturing of material 
handling equipment in Michigan. Announcement of 3,300 jobs to be 
filled at Mazda's new Michigan plant brought 110,000 requests for 
applications. Temporary layoffs to control inventories have recently 
been announced in railroad equipment and farm equipment. Permanent 
job cuts, often following earlier staffing reductions, have recently 
been reported in various industries including steel, trucking, farm 
equipment, medical technology, hospitals, communications gear, 
chemicals, and gas transmission. In some cases, job cuts are 
associated with shutdowns of production facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Plant Closings
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers of several lines of heavy capital goods in the District 
are responding to feeble recoveries with temporary and permanent 
plant closings. The leading producer of locomotives will cease 
production for two months at its main plant in the Chicago area and 
lay off 2,000 because of slack orders. An extended summer shutdown 
is planned at an Iowa farm equipment plant. Permanent plant closings 
are planned by a maker of home videodisc equipment, a manufacturer 
of parts for transmissions, and a producer of heavy forgings. A 
major producer of material handling equipment will shift one-third 
of its manufacturing overseas, and permanently close plants in 
Michigan, which had been its main facilities. In contrast, a large 
maker of construction equipment cancelled plans to shift certain 
output abroad, due to a more favorable cost picture at home. 
Threatened phaseout of auto assemblies at an Illinois plant was 
averted as a labor pact was reached after hard bargaining.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The office building boom is continuing in downtown Chicago. Despite 
an apparent glut of space, announcements of major new structures 
still appear. Soil testing work, in advance of construction, also 
continues at a good pace, despite concerns that contracts were being 
shifted from 1986 into 1985 to grandfather current tax treatment, 
and would slacken after the turn of the year. The pace of office 
building is reported to be slackening somewhat in suburban areas 
where it has been strong. Highway renovation definitely will be at a 
high level again in 1986, because funds are set aside, and work is 
sorely needed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Home Building
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Spurred by sharply lower mortgage interest rates, home construction 
is expected to remain at a high level in many parts of the District 
in 1986, relative to the early 1980s, though still well short of 
peaks in the 1970s. The upturn has been particularly vigorous in 
southeast Michigan, while activity in Iowa has been slipping. Demand 
for existing homes is strong in some areas, and realtors complain of 
a paucity of listings. The move-up share of the market has been 
larger than earlier in the expansion. A heavy volume of refinancing 
of existing mortgages at lower rates is underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District steel producers report improved orders and output. Demand 
from motor vehicle makers is in line with that industry's high 
production schedules. Activity has been very strong at steel service 
centers, which are doing more processing and holding more inventory 
for customers. User inventories are low and expected to rise. Prices 
are firming but remain low. Imported steel prices have risen, but 
much less than would be indicated by the fall in the dollar. Price 
increases will be reflected in steelmakers' revenues gradually as 
existing contracts expire.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Vigorous car production plans, bolstered by a new round of sales 
incentives from major domestic automakers, promise a high level of 
activity at District assembly plants and parts suppliers in 1986. 
Forecasts for motor vehicle demand in 1986 generally call for a 
decline in total sales from 1985, and an increase in import market 
share. Japanese renewal of their quota on auto exports to the U.S. 
at last year's level supports this projection. A leading District 
producer of motor homes has sharply increased production, partly 
because of completion of an inventory adjustment in 1985, and partly 
in anticipation of increased demand resulting from lower gasoline 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major chain stores in the District report 1986 sales ranging from 
small declines to modest increases. Retailers blame weather 
problems, high consumer debt levels, and generally cautious 
attitudes for the anemic performance of sales. The sharp drop in oil 
prices since late 1985 should bolster consumers' discretionary 
income, and may tend to raise forecasts for consumer spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices of farm commodities important in the District have trended 
lower since mid-January, pressured by seasonally large supplies and 
weak demand. Corn and wheat exports will decline again this year, 
probably by more than current USDA forecasts. Soybean exports, 
however, are rising. Exports will benefit eventually from lower U.S. 
support prices, lower oil prices, and the lower value of the U.S. 
dollar. A flurry of late Congressional actions created confusion 
over details of various federal farm income and price support 
programs. Farmers must decide whether to participate in these 
programs within the next few weeks, as planting decisions are 
finalized.
