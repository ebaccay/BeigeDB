      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicate generally 
modest improvement in economic conditions across much of the nation. 
Shopper traffic and retail sales were reported to have rebounded 
modestly in April, following general declines in March resulting in 
part from severe weather. Manufacturers in most districts report 
increases in shipments and orders, with near-capacity production at 
some automotive and steel facilities. Higher production schedules 
are being met through productivity gains and overtime, although some 
districts have reported new hires. Residential real estate activity 
in most districts is strong or on the rise, and pockets of 
improvement in commercial office markets are noted by some 
districts. The general increase in lending continues to be 
concentrated in consumer loans and mortgage refinancing, with some 
reports of pickup in small business borrowing. District reports show 
generally stable prices, except for increases in steel and energy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts report modest increases in retail sales during April, 
after widespread declines in March. Many contacts are encouraged by 
recent signs of improvement, but the net performance for March and 
April clearly will be much lower than for the first two months of 
the year. Respondents in the eastern third of the nation blame the 
mid-March blizzard for the net softening in sales. Retailers in the 
Boston district remark that without the storm, sales would have been 
above the levels a year ago. Relative weakness in March merchandise 
sales is also noted in parts of the country not affected by the 
storm. Retailers in Chicago cite renewed consumer uncertainty and 
contacts in San Francisco point to concern about job security as 
reasons for lower-than-expected sales in parts of their regions. 
However, retailers in most districts report a rise in shopper 
traffic and sales in April, apparently led by big-ticket items, such 
as furniture and home appliances.
     </p>
     <p>
      A general pickup in the sale of autos and light trucks in the first 
half of April is also reported in most districts. Dealers in the 
Cleveland, Dallas, and Philadelphia districts note that domestically 
produced models are selling at a faster pace than foreign-produced 
ones. Also, most dealers remain optimistic that the improved trend 
will continue in the near term, and they are satisfied that 
inventories are at manageable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers generally report stable prices on most items, citing stiff 
competition, consumer sensitivity to price hikes, and slower sales 
growth. Merchants contacted by Dallas and Kansas City indicate that 
prices are stable or slightly lower compared to a year ago, and that 
they expect prices to remain stable over the near term. Richmond 
contacts, on the other hand, cite an upward trend in retail prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several districts, including Richmond and San Francisco, note a 
decline in tourism compared to a year ago. Resorts and hotels 
surveyed by Richmond indicate that the number of visitors is down 
from last year and that tourists are spending less. Hotel and 
convention industry representatives contacted by San Francisco 
characterize the Southern California visitor industry as depressed. 
At the same time, Atlanta reports a strong spring tourism season, 
with air passenger traffic, convention attendance, and the number of 
spring-break visitors to Florida higher than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts, except Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco, 
report general increases in shipments and orders, which have pushed 
some facilities to operate at near capacity. Cleveland notes tight 
conditions in some segments of the steel industry, where capacity-
level production and full order books have sustained general price 
increases. Higher production levels in the steel industry are 
reportedly linked to increased activity in the motor vehicle and 
consumer appliance industries. One motor vehicle producer in the 
Chicago district indicates that production of light trucks has been 
bumping up against capacity limits. Increased demand has also
created bottlenecks at a few domestic motor vehicle parts and 
assembly plants surveyed by Cleveland. Boston and Chicago cite 
strong increases in automotive parts production, and Cleveland 
reports near-capacity production of heavy-duty trucks. Electronics 
manufacturers surveyed in the Boston and Chicago districts indicate 
strong demand, with some respondents citing the highest level of 
orders in the past five years. Contacts in Boston attribute part of 
the higher production levels to expanding Latin American and Far 
Eastern markets, which have partially offset weak demand in European 
markets. Factory officials in Atlanta and Minneapolis note some 
growth, primarily in the consumer durables, food processing, and 
industrial machinery industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of steel price increases noted by Cleveland and 
Kansas City, most districts report constant or only slightly higher 
input prices compared to a year ago. Manufacturers surveyed by 
Atlanta comment that competition continues to hold prices of 
intermediate materials and final goods stable. Dallas respondents 
indicate flat to slightly failing prices in chemicals, plastics, 
petrochemicals, and electrical and electronic machinery, and San 
Francisco contacts add that aluminum prices are also soft. However, 
purchasing managers surveyed by Chicago note a somewhat faster rate 
of price increases as demand improves in that region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Atlanta and San Francisco report that cutbacks in the aerospace and 
defense industries continue to dampen manufacturing activity. San 
Francisco respondents indicate that Boeing continues to lay off 
workers, although they anticipate that increased orders from foreign 
carriers may partially offset the weak demand from domestic 
airlines. Dallas notes that low levels of nonresidential 
construction and oil and gas drilling have contributed to lower 
production among the firms they contacted. Firms contacted by Kansas 
City report operating below capacity, in part because of decreased 
foreign sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Job conditions are mixed in most regions. Boston, Cleveland, 
Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and St. Louis report that some firms are 
hiring modestly, particularly in automotive products and capital 
goods industries. However, no district anticipates a flurry of new 
hiring in the near term, even though several industries are 
reportedly producing near capacity. Employers surveyed in the 
Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, and Kansas City districts report that 
they are avoiding new hires by extending hours, using temporary 
workers, or increasing productivity. Atlanta adds that wage 
pressures are generally absent among their contacts. Job losses 
continue for defense-related and computer companies in the 
Minneapolis district, for apparel makers and food processors in the 
St. Louis district, and for a few insurance and pension firms in the 
Boston district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most district reports indicate strong or improving residential real 
estate markets. Contacts in Boston and New York note recent 
improvement in low-priced and mid-priced home sales. A respondent in 
Boston expresses encouragement that condominium sales volume is up 
significantly, which he believes may mark an end to the slump in 
this market. Prolonged wet weather has reportedly dampened 
homebuilding in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts, but 
builders in both areas expect starts to pick up as the weather 
improves. San Francisco notes that homebuilding is strong only in 
areas outside of Southern California. Homebuilders surveyed by most 
districts indicate that the sharp increase in lumber prices in 
recent months has added to the cost of new homes. However, lumber 
industry representatives contacted by the San Francisco bank report 
a 20 percent decline in lumber and plywood prices from the March 
peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commercial real estate market remains weak in most districts, 
except for isolated pockets of increased activity. Contacts in 
Minneapolis report that commercial contract awards are up 
significantly from a year ago. Realtors in New York note brisk 
leasing of commercial office space in midtown Manhattan but subdued 
activity in downtown Manhattan and in a few immediate suburbs. 
Richmond's survey finds strong commercial activity in the Carolinas 
and in Richmond, but weak conditions in Maryland and in the District 
of Columbia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports of lending activity range from little change to 
moderate growth. Surveys of bankers generally reveal that most of 
the increase is concentrated in consumer loans and residential 
mortgage refinancing. Several lenders in Cleveland report that the 
volume of mortgage refinancing is virtually at capacity, and 
respondents in Atlanta note that mortgage refinancing accounts for 
nearly two-thirds of the brisk pace in current originations. 
Philadelphia, on the other hand, indicates flat consumer and 
mortgage lending, as households reportedly continue to consolidate 
and reduce debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      A few districts, including Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis, note 
a pickup in commercial loans, particularly to small businesses. Some 
bankers surveyed by Cleveland cite a strong demand by businesses to 
refinance existing loans. Many respondents across the country report 
that deposit growth is steady, attributable in part to aggressive 
pricing and marketing programs. Bankers from several districts 
describe loan markets as very competitive and state that more 
aggressive pricing has decreased net interest margins A few bankers 
contacted by St Louis have expressed concern that narrow margins 
have contributed to slow deposit growth in their region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture/Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An unseasonably cool and wet spring has delayed fieldwork and 
planting for a wide variety of crops in the Chicago, Kansas City, 
Minneapolis, Richmond, and St Louis districts. This damage is 
reportedly not irreparable, provided the weather improves in the 
coming months. Winter wheat crops are said to be in good shape in 
the Kansas City and St. Louis districts. Richmond and St. Louis 
report recent improvements in the condition of their peach and apple 
crops. Livestock prices are high, benefiting producers in the 
Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts. San Francisco 
indicates strong prices for several other agricultural products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Minneapolis reports increased shipments of iron ore and stable 
conditions in copper mining despite low copper prices. Dallas and 
Kansas City report seasonally low domestic oil drilling. OPEC 
production cutbacks and blizzard-related consumption hikes are 
expected to keep oil and natural gas storage levels low and prices 
on the high side for several months.
