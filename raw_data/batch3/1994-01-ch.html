      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 19, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expansion in the Seventh District continued to run at about 
the same pace as the fourth quarter as a whole, while firms' and 
households' confidence in future growth improved. District retailers 
generally enjoyed moderate sales gains in the holiday season, with 
most reports indicating sales gains in line with expectations. 
Retail sales growth in the District seems to have proceeded somewhat 
faster than in the nation as a whole, and several large retailers 
reported unchanged to somewhat stronger sales gains in early 
January. Manufacturing activity continued to expand at a relatively 
robust pace, led by auto production. Corn and soybean prices rose 
sharply in recent weeks, reflecting expectations that harvest 
estimates will be revised downward even further. The consensus 
forecast of 33 Midwest economists called for real GDP growth to run 
at about the same pace in 1994 as in 1993. with continued above-average growth in most durable goods sectors where Midwest 
production is relatively concentrated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales generally grew at a moderate pace in the holiday season 
that was in line with District retailers' expectations, and several 
large chains stated that their sales growth was little changed or 
somewhat stronger in the post-holiday period on a seasonally 
adjusted basis. A number of surveys prior to the holiday indicated 
that District retailers expected somewhat stronger gains than the 
national average, and post-holiday results did point to relative 
strength in sales growth in the region. A review of credit card 
purchases by a retailers' association in Michigan indicated that 
credit sales rose over 14 percent from 1992 for surveyed firms on a 
same-store basis. A study by a check authorization firm indicated 
similar growth in sales paid with checks, which ranged from 6 to 15 
percent among District states. This study indicated that sales 
growth in the region exceeded the national average, and strengthened 
late in the holiday season. A group of retailers in Central Michigan 
reported same-store sales gains averaging roughly 7 percent over a 
surprisingly strong year-earlier period, although results were 
somewhat below the optimistic end of expectations. An association of 
restaurants in the District reported that its members enjoyed robust 
sales gains during the holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discussions with individual retail firms were largely consistent 
with the picture painted by survey data, and several large retailers 
indicated that moderate sales growth continued in early January. One 
large chain that reported relatively strong holiday sales gains 
stated that sales growth strengthened, if anything, in late December 
and early January. Another large chain reported that sales growth 
increased significantly in early January, with sales gains in the 
District running in line with the national average. Bigger-ticket 
items (including housewares and electronics) continued to lead 
overall sales, and hard-line inventories were running below plan for 
the first time in several months. This contact noted that post-
holiday season promotional activity was somewhat stronger than last 
year, but did not express a great deal of concern in light of the
surprisingly strong sales pace in the holiday season for 1992. 
Retail prices continue to rise slowly at best, and most firms 
indicated that competitive pressures on margins were little changed, 
including those that enjoyed relatively successful seasons. With the 
dramatic exception of Rose Bowl items sold in Wisconsin, reports 
generally indicated that apparel sales remained relatively weak. One 
department store chain stated that a shift in sales mix would 
constrain its overall margin relative to last year, but consumers 
seem to have extended their purchases beyond the basics within low-
margin categories to a greater extent than they did in the 1992 
holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers surveys and reports from District contacts 
generally indicated moderate to relatively robust gains an 
manufacturing activity. The overall index for the Chicago purchasing 
managers survey flattened out in December, but for the fourth 
quarter the index average was at its highest level since 1988. 
Surveys conducted in Western Michigan indicated that growth in 
December proceeded in line with--or perhaps slightly faster than--
the significant pace experienced in October and November. The price 
component of these surveys offered scant evidence of significant 
price pressures overall, although expectations firmed that announced 
steel price increases would hold, and several respondents reported 
that finding qualified production workers and tradespeople was 
becoming increasingly difficult. The prices-paid component of the 
Chicago survey actually declined during the second half of 1993. 
falling well below year-earlier levels. The overall index for the 
Detroit purchasing managers' survey strengthened significantly in 
December (from already high levels), and supply shortages and price 
pressures were reported somewhat more frequently in this survey than 
in others around the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from individual manufacturing firms generally reflected a 
rising note of optimism about prospects in the new year, although 
growth was expected to moderate in several durable goods markets 
following strong gains in 1993. A large steelmaker noted that space 
on order books is on an allocation basis into the second quarter of 
1994, and the auto industry remained its strongest market. A machine 
tool manufacturer reported continuing strength in orders from 
automakers and their suppliers, but stated that overall industry 
orders growth should slow somewhat in 1994 after a strong year in 
1993. Pricing and margins remain under considerable pressure from 
European and Japanese machine tool producers with underutilized 
capacity. Heavy-duty truck orders strengthened further, according to 
an industry analyst. This contact stated that many industry 
suppliers are "stretched to their limits." A manufacturer of fluid 
power equipment expected further gains in output of construction 
machinery and other forms of heavy equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Corn and soybean prices have risen sharply in recent weeks, 
reflecting analysts' expectations that the final estimates of the 
1993 harvest will show further downward revisions. A near 20 percent 
rise since early November has pushed corn prices to the highest 
levels in ten years, reaching levels roughly 40 percent higher than 
a year ago. The higher prices are helping to buoy the earnings of 
crop farmers who were able to avoid the brunt of the flood losses 
last summer. Alternatively, the higher crop prices translate into 
sharply higher feed costs for livestock and dairy farmers. The 
latter is apparently contributing to a downturn in livestock 
production, at least in District states. Similarly, milk production 
on dairy farms in the District in recent months has lagged year-
earlier levels by nearly 6.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Expectations for 1994
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The consensus forecast of 33 economists attending the Chicago Fed's 
annual economic outlook conference called for real GDP to grow 2.9 
percent on a year-over-year basis in 1994, with little change in the 
inflation rate (as measured by the CPI) and only a negligible 
increase in the prime rate. Business fixed investment was 
anticipated to continue to rise faster than overall GDP, but growth 
was still expected to slow somewhat from its robust pace in 1993.
