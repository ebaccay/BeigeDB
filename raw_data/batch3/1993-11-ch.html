       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the region picked up renewed momentum in 
September and October, although gains in most sectors were modest. 
Manufacturing output strengthened considerably, with most of the 
improvement centered in the auto industry. Retail sales and housing 
activity continued to grow, and retailers' expectations for the 
holiday season were largely consistent with those reported around 
mid-year. After losing some momentum earlier in the year, the 
employment recovery in the District has been bolstered by the recent 
revival in industrial activity. The fall harvest has proceeded at a 
slower-than-normal pace, and yields on corn are proving to be lower 
than earlier anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity strengthened in September and 
October, after stalling out to a greater extent than usual during 
the summer months. The production component of the Chicago 
purchasing managers' survey fell off modestly in October, but only 
after surging in September, and the overall index continued to climb 
following an evident loss of momentum in the previous three months. 
Surveys conducted in Detroit, Western Michigan, and Milwaukee also 
depicted higher output growth in recent months, with auto industry 
respondents accounting for much of the improvement. A large auto 
supplier expected shipment gains to climb higher in the fourth 
quarter and into the first quarter of 1994, particularly as OEM and 
dealer  inventories are "fairly skinny for this time of the year." 
Production problems at a large OEM customer are lingering but are 
expected to be largely resolved by the first quarter of 1994. A 
manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks reported some modest weakening in 
orders in September, but wasn't overly concerned in light of sizable 
gains earlier in the year. This firm expected orders to remain 
fairly steady at high levels into early 1994. Two large capital 
goods manufacturers reported substantial year-over-year sales gains 
in the third quarter, although sales actually declined on a 
seasonally adjusted basis for one of these firms. Exporters in a 
variety of industries reported further declines in European markets, 
with one auto supplier describing output there as "completely in the 
tank." Several of these firms noted that an increasing number of 
European producers are pricing more aggressively in order to get 
orders from the United States. A manufacturer of semiconductors 
reported continuing sales gains in Europe, however, and this firm's 
domestic orders growth remained at high levels in recent months. A 
manufacturer of housewares reported substantially higher third 
quarter earnings, and noted continued strengthening in orders during 
the early stages of the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending/Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in retail sales and housing activity held up well compared to 
manufacturing output during the summer, and little change in 
consumption growth was evident in reports from District contacts in 
recent weeks. Two large chains reported that their holiday season 
hiring plans were in line with, or slightly stronger than, those at 
the same time last year. A large discount retailer reported slow, 
steady improvement in sales growth in this region, after its sales 
gains had lagged the industry average earlier in the year. This firm 
continued to report little generalized upward pressure on prices. A 
large general merchandise chain concentrated in District markets 
described sales as "pretty hard to get." Sales growth slowed earlier 
in the year, and in recent months comparable store sales have been 
flat on a year-over-year basis. This firm is still expecting a good 
holiday season, but it has not raised inventory plans after a 
reduction at mid-year. Discussions with a number of retailers in 
Michigan indicated that growth in apparel sales picked up in recent 
months, after slowing materially during the summer. An auto industry 
contact reported that sales closure rates have remained relatively 
flat during recent months, after rising during most of 1993. This 
contact expected lower sales than the consensus in 1994, citing 
lower expectation for pent-up demand and a ceiling on the potential 
that leasing holds for future growth. Another auto industry observer 
stated that sales this year have benefited from a stronger trade-in 
market, after trade-ins were dampened in 1991 and 1992 by the 
extension of auto loan maturities in the late 1980s. However, this 
analyst expected only a marginal further boost from this effect in 
1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large association of homebuilders reported that gains in sales of 
new homes in October were running in line with the substantial 
increases recorded year-to-date. Citing further strength in customer 
traffic, this contact expected sales and starts to continue to gain 
momentum on a seasonally adjusted basis over coming months. 
Construction of individual custom homes has accounted for an above-
average share of the gains in the overall market this year, 
according to this contact. An October survey of homebuilders 
indicated substantial strengthening in sales expectations One of the 
largest realtors in the District reported that sales in September 
were in line with an exceptionally strong year-earlier period, and 
this contact stated that the residential market remains very active 
for this time of year. A regional bank holding company reported that 
the rapid pace of residential mortgage refinancing was little 
changed, while demand for bank loans for new home construction is 
"okay, but nothing to write home about." Another banker stated that 
borrowers' savings from home mortgage refinancing remain targeted 
toward reducing the maturity of the mortgage, rather than the 
monthly payment, although an increasing share of younger borrowers 
seems to be using the savings to lower their monthly payment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Stronger business activity in September and October helped to shore 
up labor markets in the region, after the pace of the District 
employment recovery slowed in the second and third quarters. Payroll 
survey estimates for the District states show a weaker pattern in 
1993 than they did for the comparable period last year. A survey by 
a large temporary help company indicated that hiring plans among 
Midwest businesses ebbed during the second and third quarters on a 
seasonally adjusted basis, after surging in the latter half of 1992 
and early 1993. While a majority of respondents still planned to 
increase their employment levels, hiring plans among Midwest 
businesses no longer exceeded the national average in the most 
recent survey. A survey of small businesses in Wisconsin showed a 
dropoff in hiring expectations, and a substantial majority of small 
firms in a Michigan survey indicated that regulatory uncertainty was 
prompting them to defer some hiring. District contacts were not 
entirely downbeat, however. A variety of personnel recruiting firms 
reported increased rates in recent weeks, although one contact 
expressed concern whether the strengthening would prove to be 
another in a series of false starts. A firm specializing in the 
placement of industrial engineers stated that employers are 
increasingly expecting health care reform to be a prolonged process, 
and that the related uncertainty was not so serious a hiring 
constraint as it had been earlier in the year. After declining in 
the second and third quarters, the employment component of 
purchasing managers' surveys in the District improved in September 
and October. An association of metalworking companies reported a 
growing shortage of skilled labor during a pickup in production in 
recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The soybean harvest in District states is progressing well, but the 
corn harvest remains considerably slower than normal. Various 
reports tend to suggest that the flood-related crop losses were 
somewhat greater than earlier estimates indicated, especially for 
corn. A large, last-minute enrollment in the 0/92 option of the 
price support program resulted in more abandonment of corn acreage 
than had been estimated earlier. Moreover, yields on the acreage 
that will be harvested are proving so be somewhat less than 
expected, in part because of frosts that hit northern portions of 
the District in late September and early October.
