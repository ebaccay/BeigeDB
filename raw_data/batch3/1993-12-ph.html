      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District remained on a modest upward 
trend in November, according to reports from the region's business 
community. Manufacturers noted gains in shipments and orders, 
although they indicated employment was only steady. Retailers 
generally said they were posting slight gains from a year ago, and 
auto dealers said that sales, while off slightly in recent weeks, 
were still running at a healthy pace. Bankers indicated that overall 
lending was up slightly, due mainly to growing consumer loan volume. 
Residential real estate activity had picked up, according to 
realtors, but demand for commercial real estate was stagnant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most business contacts in the Third District forecast a continuation 
of current trends. Manufacturers expect orders and sales to continue 
growing, and they are planning increases in capital spending. 
Retailers forecast year-over-year sales increases of 3 to 5 percent, 
in dollar terms, for the Christmas season. Bankers expect a seasonal 
increase in consumer borrowing, but, in general, they expect 
commercial and industrial lending to edge up very slightly, at best. 
Realtors and home builders believe the stepped-up pace of home sales 
will persist for at least another six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District manufacturers in November indicated that 
business continued to move up. While just over half said their 
shipments and new orders were running at a steady pace, nearly one-
quarter said they were seeing increases in orders and about one-
third said they were stepping up shipments. Among major industrial 
sectors in the region, food processors, chemical producers, and 
nonelectrical machinery manufacturers reported gains; manufacturers 
of paper products and primary metals noted declines in business. For 
the manufacturing sector as a whole, employment was steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, just over half of the area manufacturers contacted 
for this report expect continued improvement over the next six 
months. They forecast parallel increases in orders and shipments, 
and nearly half plan to boost capital spending. On balance, comments 
from manufacturers indicate that overall employment may edge up 
somewhat during the winter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District retailers contacted in late November said 
sales for the month were running slightly above the year-ago pace 
and about in line with plans. Executives at area stores gave sales 
forecasts for the Christmas season ranging from 3 to 5 percent above 
last year's levels, in dollar terms. Several merchants said they 
were implementing expanded promotional efforts, such as increased 
advertising and extended store hours. Most retailers described 
inventories as under control and said they had been careful in 
ordering merchandise for the Christmas sales period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers generally said sales in November had slipped a bit from 
October but were running at a good pace. They said new models were 
being well received, and they expect to close the year on a healthy 
sales trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Comments from Third District bankers indicate that overall loan 
demand was moving up only slightly in November. A majority of those 
contacted for this report said consumer lending was up a bit because 
of growth in credit card borrowing, auto loans, and home equity 
credit, but a significant number said consumer lending was just 
steady. Commercial and industrial lending was described as flat by 
most of the bank loan officers interviewed, while a few said they 
have seen recent increases in borrowing, especially by middle-market 
companies. Nearly all said the upward momentum of applications for 
residential mortgages was easing as the volume of refinancings 
declined, while the volume of purchase mortgages was holding steady 
or increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers expect consumer borrowing to increase seasonally, but they 
do not anticipate much growth in commercial and industrial lending. 
They also expect refinancing activity to taper off.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate brokers and home builders in the region said activity 
picked up in late October and appeared to be continuing. Realtors 
generally ascribed then stepped-up pace of sales to buyers' 
perceptions that mortgage rates have bottomed and to sellers' 
willingness to accept less appreciation in the price of their homes. 
Realtors noted increased sales in both the lower and middle price 
ranges. Despite the recent pickup, realtors said the inventory of 
homes for sale remains high. Nevertheless, they expect the higher 
pace of home sales to persist at least another six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity remains flat, according to brokers 
and property managers. Office vacancy rates in the region have 
changed little from a year ago according to some brokers' surveys, 
and demand for retail space was still described as soft. Some pickup 
in demand for industrial space was noted, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some positive developments have been noted in regional construction 
activity. In addition to increased residential building, some 
utility and other nonresidential projects have gotten under way. 
Overall, however, the gain in construction activity is slight.
