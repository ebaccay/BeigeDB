      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 3, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District economic activity continues to grow slowly even though 
several larger firms have announced reorganizations, some entailing 
job losses. Small businesses, in particular, report strong growth 
for the past two months. Residential construction continues to be a 
source of strength in most areas of the District. Loan demand is 
also on the upswing. The pace of the fall harvest remains 
significantly behind normal because of the lateness of the crop and 
recent, persistent rainfall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District firms continue to be mixed, as expansions and 
new plants create jobs in some industries, while reorganizations add 
to the number of layoffs in others. Small businesses, in particular, 
report stronger growth recently and are preparing for increased 
activity in the near future. Some larger companies, however, 
continue to lay off employees as they reorganize.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of small businesses reveals that the recent upswing in 
activity has also led to new plans for capital outlays, inventory 
increases and employment gains. In fact, only 23 percent of the 
surveyed firms believe that conditions in the coming two quarters 
will deteriorate rather than improve. A contact in the construction 
materials industry reports strong sales, especially brick. The 
industry is experiencing a four-to-six-week backlog, and plants are 
running at capacity. The contact expects the growth to continue 
through the first half of next year, but expects 1994 so be slightly 
weaker than 1993 overall. Contacts report that sales are up 8 
percent over last year in the glass container industry and 10 
percent at discount stores. Very strong sales are also reported by 
mattress manufacturers and paper manufacturers. A rug manufacturer 
reports that plants are running seven days a week to meet demand. 
District auto dealers report that showroom traffic is up and that, 
in some areas, domestic sales are the strongest they have been in 10 
years. The furniture industry in northern Mississippi continues to 
grow with the opening of another plant, while northeast Arkansas' 
steel industry expands with the announcement of plans for a new 
mill. Retail sales in Illinois increased sharply after the bridges 
across the Mississippi River reopened following recent flooding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several larger firms have announced plans to reorganize and reduce 
employment. A telecommunications firm has already laid off 800 of a 
total of about 1.500 nonunionized workers to be let go, 200 of whom 
were in the St. Louis area. An alcoholic beverage and snack producer 
announced a reduction of 1,200 jobs, with about 500 in St. Louis. 
This cut will be almost offset, however, when the firm's snack 
division moves to St. Louis, bringing 475 positions. A maker of 
undergarments will close its Mississippi operations this month, 
eliminating almost 300 jobs. A contact in the apparel industry notes 
that more plants have been closing than are opening recently; much 
of this is business lost to foreign competitors. A local cable 
television company in Arkansas closed its plant last month after 
nearly 30 years, affecting about 140 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate construction, though slowing somewhat, 
continues to be above year-ago levels in most areas of the District. 
Unseasonably wet weather, however, has put builders in some areas, 
particularly St. Louis, weeks and even months behind schedule. Many 
District builders and real estate agents report falling inventories 
and rising prices of new and existing homes. In Central Arkansas, 
residential properties in the $70,000-to-$90,000 range are said to 
be in short supply; employment increases by area firms are spurring 
housing demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand--especially for consumer loans--continues to strengthen 
in the District. Total loans outstanding at a sample of 102 small, 
mid-size and large banks increased more from mid-August to mid-
October than they had from mid-June to mid-August. Some bankers are 
concerned that core deposit growth is not keeping up with loan 
demand and that alternative investment products such as mutual funds 
are draining actual and potential deposits from their institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wet weather has slowed the pace of the fall harvest in many areas 
and slowed the seeding of the winter wheat crop. Early reports 
indicate that weather disturbances earlier in the year have kept 
yields below expectations in many cases. Moreover, unusually low 
test weights for corn have been reported in certain areas. Some 
isolated areas, however, have reported record or near-record corn 
and soybean yields. Contacts in parts of Illinois and Arkansas 
report that the soybean size is smaller than usual this year, 
because of unusual dryness during a crucial phase of the growing 
season. Still, Illinois farmers should harvest their second-largest 
crop ever.
     </p>
     <p>
      Delta cotton farmers report that yields have been significantly 
reduced because of heat and insects. Although yields on this year's 
rice crop appear to be running below last year's, analysts still 
expect an average size crop. There are also scattered reports that 
the milling quality of this year's crop is lower than usual. Rice 
prices have risen recently on the expectation that the Japanese, 
because of an anemic harvest, are contemplating a purchase of 
Arkansas rice. Some Arkansas and Mississippi farm equipment dealers 
report that sales have declined recently because of poor crop 
prospects. Arkansas timber producers report a firming of prices 
recently. Southern pine lumber producers report orders are running 
ahead of last year's strong pace.
