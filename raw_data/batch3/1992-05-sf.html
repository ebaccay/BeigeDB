      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions are improving very slowly in much of the Twelfth 
District, with moderate growth in intermountain areas offset by 
weakness in California. Retail and auto sales are reported soft in 
several markets, and continued layoffs are reported in defense-related manufacturing. Nonresidential construction remains weak in 
most District markets, although residential construction and home 
sales show some pick-up. Mortgage refinancing activity appears to 
have peaked, and overall loan demand remains flat. Continued drought 
threatens agriculture in Idaho and eastern Oregon, while prospects 
for California have improved with recent rainfall. Wage and price 
increases are modest, with some exceptions such as lumber and health 
care.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expectations of Twelfth District business leaders were 
little changed since our last report, with most respondents 
expecting sluggish growth. As in March, almost two-thirds of 
respondents expect the economy to expand, but at a rate below 2.5 
percent. Only 5 percent of respondents expect output to decline in 
at least two of the next four quarters, down slightly from 9 percent 
in March. Expectations are most optimistic for housing starts. A 
large majority of respondents expect inflation to decline or remain 
stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts report little upward pressure on wages and prices in most 
District markets, although lumber and health care are notable 
exceptions. Wholesale lumber prices have risen to record levels due 
to extremely tight supply conditions associated with harvesting 
restrictions and the recently adopted tariff on Canadian lumber. 
Health plan costs are expected to increase at double-digit rates in 
1992, but the rate of increase does appear to have moderated 
somewhat from last year. Energy prices remain low. One oil industry 
contact expects several years of little or no price growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts report retail and auto sales as soft in most District 
markets. Sales of new cars in Utah are reported to be "spotty", with 
buyer confidence affected by recent layoff announcements. A contact 
in Idaho reports some deterioration in auto sales since the last 
report, with traffic down 20 percent since mid-March. In contrast, 
auto dealers in Oregon report that after an extremely weak February, 
auto sales improved in March. Auto sales in the Puget Sound area 
also were above their year-earlier level in March. Contacts from 
large department stores report generally soft conditions. Sips of 
improved retail activity, however, are reported in Arizona following 
weakness early in the year, with auto, eating and drinking 
establishments, and general merchandising sales leading the way. 
District-wide food store sales are reported flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      In southern California, the slump in ad revenue and circulation has 
claimed one of only two daily Spanish-language newspapers in Los 
Angeles. One media contact reports that employment and real estate 
ads are down 11 and 19 percent, respectively, from their weak year-
earlier levels. Auto advertising, however, shows an increase of 9 
percent over the previous year. Circulation and help wanted 
advertisements in Oregon and the Puget Sound area have begun to show 
modest gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Job losses continue to be reported in defense-related manufacturing 
firms across the District. Arizona manufacturing had significant 
losses in February, principally in aircraft and missiles. Defense-
related manufacturing has fallen in Utah as well. The Boeing company 
has estimated that employment will be reduced by 6,500 during 1992, 
reflecting the cutbacks in defense and a slowing of the 737 
production line. Orders continue to climb for Boeing 777s, however, 
which are scheduled to enter passenger serve in mid-1995. Some 
nondefense manufacturers in Utah, however, are reporting a leveling 
off of the long slowdown in orders. While large job orders are still
down, an upturn in small orders is having a leveling effect on the 
total volume of sales. Medical equipment manufacturers also are 
reporting an apparent leveling off in their sales slide of the past 
six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Parts of Idaho and eastern Oregon are suffering one of their worst 
drought years on record. Crop shortages are possible in potatoes, 
beans, sugar beets, and alfalfa, and utility costs are expected to 
rise. Prospects for crops in California have improved due to recent 
rainfall. Low ocean salmon counts-in part due to the drought-are 
causing severe curtailment of the 1992 ocean commercial and sport 
salmon fishing season. Supply conditions in lumber remain extremely 
tight due to environmental restrictions. In the last 30 days, 
however, there has been some softening of demand for wood products, 
and inventory levels have increased at the distribution and mill 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While home sales and residential construction activity are reported 
up in most District markets, prospects for nonresidential 
construction continue to look weak. In Hawaii, for the first time in 
years, construction employment is declining, in part reflecting a 
drop in Japanese investment. In Washington, government construction 
spending is off substantially, and Boeing's major facilities program 
appears to be slowing with construction schedules for projects being 
extended. Recent mergers of financial institutions are expected to 
put further upward pressure on vacancy rates in several District 
markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for loans is reported to be weak to moderate in most District 
markets. Applications for mortgage refinancing in Utah have tapered 
off since January. Several southern California bankers are beginning 
to see real estate values affecting small business credit 
availability, since real estate holdings remain a primary source of 
collateral for small business loans. Nonperforming loans are 
reported to continue increasing modestly.
