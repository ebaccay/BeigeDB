      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Federal Reserve Districts describe economic activity as 
expanding slowly. Consumer spending varies from moderate to strong, 
except for auto sales which have slowed after a January rebound. The 
manufacturing sector is soft, but is improving in some Districts. 
The weakness in autos and auto-related industries, however, is 
widespread. Construction activity continues to slow in most 
Districts, but Chicago and San Francisco still are reporting 
relatively strong activity. Agricultural conditions are generally 
good, although several Districts cite serious concern over the lack 
of soil moisture. Banks have become less aggressive in making new 
loans, and demand for most types of loans has softened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have continued to improve in recent months. Most 
Districts indicate that retail sales gains in February were above a 
year ago, led by women's apparel and electronics. Cleveland and San 
Francisco note that retailers are reporting better-than-expected 
sales gains. However, retail sales in New England are weak, partly 
due to consumers turning cautious. Sales of "big ticket" items in 
Richmond are flat and demand for durable goods in Atlanta is weak. 
Most Districts report that retailers have inventories under control, 
although Chicago and Cleveland report downward pressure on prices as 
retailers attempt to cut excess inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      A slowdown in auto sales since January's rebound is widespread. 
However, dealers' inventories are in better shape with several 
Districts reporting stocks to be at or below year-ago levels. 
Philadelphia and Chicago note that dealers are cautious about new 
orders because of slow sales. Minneapolis notes that some dealers 
are having financial problems and some consolidation may take place 
in 1990. Kansas City, Cleveland, and Dallas report that weak sales 
are associated with tightening credit availability. Reasons cited 
for the credit tightening range from tighter credit standards to 
personal credit history problems left over from earlier depressed 
times.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is mixed, with Boston, Philadelphia, and St. 
Louis reporting manufacturing declines and most other Districts 
reporting moderate improvement. New York indicates that purchasing 
agent surveys indicate rising new orders and production. Capital 
goods producers in Cleveland and Chicago report a slow upward trend 
in orders. San Francisco's commercial aircraft industry is showing 
no sign of slowing and aircraft-related equipment producers in 
Boston are facing rising demand. Both Chicago and San Francisco 
report strong sales of farm machinery. However, Boston cites 
weakness in computers, auto parts, and paper. St. Louis and 
Philadelphia report weakness in employment and orders, particularly 
among durable goods industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only the weakness in the auto industry appears to be widespread. 
Atlanta notes that plant closings and layoffs in the auto industry 
are hurting suppliers, but no further weakening is expected. Auto 
output has already begun to revive in the Cleveland District, 
however, and most plants are expected to be running in the Chicago 
District by March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity is slowing in most Districts. New York reports 
that their "boom" in residential construction has subsided 
throughout the District, due to higher prices, lack of good land, 
and an easing of pent-up demand. Most observers are not anticipating 
a pickup in 1990. Commercial building has slowed in Atlanta because 
of overbuilding and slow employment growth. Construction activity is 
flat in Minneapolis and not expected to improve in the near future. 
Although San Francisco reports nonresidential construction around 
its District is mixed, overall construction activity is strongest in 
Chicago and San Francisco. Homebuilding in St. Louis has been
rising, due partly to favorable weather conditions. Kansas City 
notes that mortgage loan demand is weak and is not expected to 
improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Improved economic conditions in the agricultural sector continue to 
buoy farm incomes. Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City report that 
the yields on the winter wheat crop are expected to range from near 
normal to above normal. Freeze damage to fruits and vegetables 
caused some problems in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, with 
prices of some produce rising to their highest levels since 1984. 
While most produce prices are expected to decline over the year, 
Atlanta notes that citrus prices are likely to remain high all year. 
Chicago and Minneapolis cite high livestock and dairy prices as 
bolstering farm income. Kansas City notes that farm income for 
livestock producers is doing better than for cash grain farmers. 
However, concerns were expressed throughout the farm belt that 
moisture levels in the soil are low, despite recent precipitation. 
Minneapolis notes some concern that below-normal precipitation could 
bring another drought to the Upper Midwest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other resource-related industries are generally very strong. 
Minneapolis states that mining is one of the strongest sectors of 
the Upper Midwest economy, with iron and precious metal mines 
expanding capacity. Forest product industries are strong, with most 
plants running at capacity and many expanding capacity. However, 
forest product firms in San Francisco have been scaling back output 
as logging restrictions take effect. Oil and gas drilling in the 
Southwest is up sharply, although drilling activity is expected to 
moderate. Kansas City cites a seasonal decline in exploration and 
development of oil and gas in January, but that decline is coming 
off six consecutive months of increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts report that financial institutions are either less 
willing to extend credit or actually tightening credit terms Atlanta 
particularly notes tightening of credit standards for real estate 
loans. Richmond cites a decline in the supply of real estate loans. 
Retailers in Boston and Philadelphia state that not only are sales 
being constrained, but retailers themselves are having difficulty 
ordering because of tighter credit availability.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand also appears to be softening. Richmond and Kansas City 
report that demand for commercial and industrial loans has softened 
recently. Except for home equity loans, growth in consumer loan 
demand has weakened in Atlanta. New York notes that a widespread 
decline in interest rates has had no effect on loan demand, which is 
currently lower than a year ago. Loan volume in Philadelphia was up 
in early February from a year ago, but was slipping in mid-February.
