      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in the Ninth District may have picked up a bit late 
in 1986. Consumer spending was somewhat stronger than expected in 
December. Ongoing commercial projects have kept contractors busy. 
Major resource sectors have not deteriorated, and some may pick up. 
A few scattered bright spots have appeared in agriculture. But 
district states are still struggling with projected budget deficits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A late buying rush helped keep 1986 holiday sales of general 
merchandise moderately above 1985's. One general retailer says its 
planned promotions did quite well. Another says its December sales 
were higher than a year earlier, with most of the increase coming 
during the holiday week. Both retailers were left with only normal 
levels of inventories. Reports from this Bank's directors and the 
district's newspaper editors indicate that holiday sales followed 
the dichotomy of weaker sales at small town, Main Street retailers 
and stronger sales at regional shopping centers and in larger, 
diversified cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      In accord with the national trend, district sales of motor vehicles 
were also strong in December, as buyers rushed to take advantage or 
their last chance to deduct sales taxes from their federal taxable 
income. During the last 10 days of December, district sales of 
domestic manufacturers were 50.4 percent ahead of the comparable 
period in 1985. Due to this rush, one domestic manufacturer reports, 
its total sales for the whole month of December were "great," and it 
had low inventories of both cars and trucks left for January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lower interest rates have continued to fuel housing activity. Home 
sales in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area registered big gains late 
last year: They were 23 percent higher during November and December 
than during those months a year ago. Homebuilders contacted in 
Minnesota report statewide gains during 1986, but think a recent 
tariff on Canadian lumber may raise home prices a bit in 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist spending at district ski resorts has been spotty lately, due 
to scattered snowfall. Fortunately, the hard-pressed Upper Peninsula 
of Michigan has had a strong season so far, according to a Bank 
director. Resorts in Montana with adequate snow have benefited from 
Idaho's lack of snow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The geographic pattern of nonresidential construction has also been 
varied lately. Despite moderately high vacancy rates, contractors in 
the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area have been kept busy into 1987 by 
commercial construction. Several large downtown office projects are 
under way there, and some large new office and retail complexes have 
been planned in the area's southern suburbs. Contractors in Duluth, 
Minnesota, are looking forward to over $700 million of 
nonresidential construction lasting through 1988. A Pierre, South 
Dakota, booster notes that two-thirds of the work on its new 
convention center and hotel still remains. But a Montana contractor 
says construction sector activity is "all but nonexistent" in that 
state, due to a slow economy and a state budget crunch.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Resource-related industries have continued their mixed performance, 
although some improvement is foreseen. Wood products sectors have 
continued to do well. A recently established plywood operation may 
add 50 more workers. Gold mines in Montana and the Upper Peninsula 
of Michigan are one of the few bright spots in the mining industry. 
But the oil and gas sector is still nearly idle, with only 28 rigs 
working in the district. The recent increase in crude oil prices 
should help that sector some.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Signs of stability for some farmers in some parts of the district 
have appeared recently. Wheat prices rose somewhat in December, and 
corn and soybean prices were up a bit as well. One Bank director 
notes that federal government payments have helped struggling 
Montana wheat farmers. Livestock operations have continued to be 
aided by low feed prices, good market prices, and mild weather. Two 
surveys of district agricultural bankers indicate some improvement. 
One of then suggests that bankers thought fourth quarter farm 
earnings were higher than a year earlier; the other, only that 
general conditions deteriorated at a slower rate in 1986 than in 
1985. Better-than-expected demand materialized during some recent 
land sales. Still, many district farmers are still struggling, with 
little prospect for dramatic improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Public Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A big cause for concern recently has been the fiscal health of state 
governments. District states are struggling to balance their 
budgets. North Dakota's governor has called for a special session to 
deal with the issue, and voters may be faced with increases in sales 
or income taxes. Montana, stung in part by lower mineral taxes, has 
had to plan cutbacks in its higher education spending. And 
Minnesota, though partly aided by higher-than-expected tax 
collections in December, still must plan for a potential shortfall 
next biennium.
