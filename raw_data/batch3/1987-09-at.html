      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of southeastern economic activity remains brisk in most 
sectors at the end of the summer. Employment in key regional 
industries continues to expand; residential construction activity 
has picked up, and office vacancy rates are expected to drop in some 
major regional markets. Although retailers' sales have slowed 
recently, recent dealer incentives have boosted auto sales. Port 
activity is benefiting from the weak dollar, and tourism has been 
strong throughout the region. Crop yields and profits are expected 
to outpace last year's drought-reduced levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The service sector continues to add employment in the Sixth 
District. Health services and business services such as equipment 
renting, management consulting, and computer services have shown 
strong growth lately. Contacts indicate that factory employment 
growth is likely to continue to increase. Textile employment has 
grown briskly, and demand remains strong for the region's textile 
products. Shipments of carpet from some mills are being delayed 
because producers have not been able to hire enough workers to keep 
up with the large number of orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Concentration on narrow, localized market niches has reduced import 
vulnerability of regional steel producers. Small mills have been 
adding to capacity and boosting productivity with improved 
technology. Lumber industry spokesmen are concerned about the 
multifamily building slowdown and the rise in mortgage interest 
rates; however, the tariff on Canadian lumber has helped to curb the 
tide of imports. Also, the surge in lumber use for home remodeling 
is helping to support the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      August's retail sales showed only slight gains from a year ago in 
spite of good performance a month earlier. Retailers are heavily 
promoting back-to-school items. They say that apparel sales continue 
strong; however, there is little growth in other items. For the most 
part, inventories remain at comfortable levels although there are 
scattered reports that the stock of summer apparel remains heavy for 
late August. Retailers project sales for the coming months to be at 
or only slightly above last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Early August car sales in the District were boosted by new factory 
incentives featuring finance rates as low as 1.9 percent and 
generous cash rebates on 1987 models. Industry contacts reported a 
strong market response, particularly for some GM cars and trucks for 
which sales had been especially weak. Despite the sluggish sales of 
domestic autos, the District's new vehicle registrations in the 
first half of 1987 were off only 0.7 percent from last year, much 
less than the 7.9 percent drop nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although the spring uptick in interest rates caused a dip in 
existing home sales in June, sales for the second quarter finished 
well ahead of last year's pace. All the District states except 
Alabama bettered the national average of 5.7 percent growth. 
District realtors say pockets of activity in the region, like the 
Florida Gulf Coast, Jackson, Mississippi, and middle Tennessee, are 
fueling the growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Sixth District is attracting an increasing portion of foreign 
investment in U.S. commercial real estate. In both Atlanta and 
Miami, 18 percent of downtown commercial properties are owned by 
foreign investors, and this rate is expected to increase. Although 
no upward pressure in prices has yet occurred, the slowdown in 
construction in these overbuilt markets, coupled with the rising 
demand of foreign investors, is expected to increase prices, say 
contacts in these cities. Contacts in almost all District 
metropolitan areas expect increased foreign investment in the near 
future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing in Miami is strong although vacancy rates are still 
high. Contacts there say they expect a 30 percent increase in 
leasing this year over last. Sales and leasing of industrial 
property in Atlanta remain very active, and the vacancy rate in the 
second quarter was again below the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth at the larger commercial banks in the Sixth District 
continued to decline in July. Business, real estate, and consumer 
loans are all expanding at a reduced pace. Many banks, searching for 
lending alternatives, have begun to reemphasize home lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism continues its strong summer performance throughout the 
District. Florida campgrounds are reporting another good year. Hotel 
occupancy along the Mississippi Gulf Coast has been increasing, a 
sign that tourism is reviving in that area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The share of exports in the trade mix of southeastern ports is 
gradually rising in response to the lower dollar. The value of 
exports was up 3.3 percent during the year ending in June, slightly 
surpassing the rate of increase for imports. All District ports 
except New Orleans posted trade gains during the period. In 
Savannah, port officials expect that demand for Georgia products 
such as kaolin, fertilizers, and pulp and paper will continue to 
grow in the year ahead. In Miami, where higher shipments to Latin 
America have revived exports, the outlook also is bright. In Mobile, 
increased forest products exports have helped to offset lower coal 
shipments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In August the number of operating oil rigs declined modestly but 
still remained one-third higher than a year ago. However, production 
of crude oil remained at about 5 percent less than in August 1986. 
District refineries report failing profit margins in recent weeks as 
crude oil prices rose faster than product prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Forestry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Southern pine lumber, which accounts for 10 percent of the nation's 
total lumber exports, experienced a favorable spring with exports 
over 10 percent higher than last year. Demand for southern pine 
remains strong at relatively high prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Yields of major crops in the region are expected to be much higher 
than last year's drought-reduced harvests. Production will be up 
despite reduced acreages this year. With prices and costs near those 
of a year ago, profit per acre should also improve moderately.
