     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy continues to expand at about the same 
overall pace as it has since mid-summer. Activity in the 
manufacturing sector rose marginally in October for the fourth month 
in a row. Retail sales are also growing, although not quite making 
the increase merchants had been expecting. Total loan volume at 
major Third District banks is growing at slightly above the pace set 
during the first three quarters of the year, with commercial lending 
and real estate financing posting the strongest gains. Consumer 
lending, while still growing at a fair rate, has not accelerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations for the Third District economy are generally positive, 
although optimism has waned somewhat in recent weeks. On balance, 
manufacturers expect improving business over the next six months or 
more. Retailers are sticking with earlier predictions of a good 
fourth quarter, although some now believe that the upper range of 
their forecasts may not. be attainable. Bankers expect continued 
strength in commercial loan demand, but they see consumer credit 
demand slackening next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pickup in manufacturing activity that began in the region this 
maser has entered its fourth month, according to the latest Business 
Outlook Survey. Industrial firms posting gains in October slightly 
outnumbered those reporting slowdowns for the month. Business is 
expanding for 24 percent of the survey respondents, dropping for 14 
percent, and holding level for 54 percent. Improvement is more 
marked in the nondurable goods sector than in durable goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most indicators of manufacturing activity show improvement this 
month. New orders, shipments, and order backlogs are up, and 
inventories are falling slightly. Employment remains at a 
standstill, however. Responses to the October survey reveal mostly 
steady payrolls in the region and a fractional drop in working 
hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some upward pressure on industrial prices in the region is evident 
in this month's survey. Although the majority of survey respondents 
say input costs are steady, more now report increasing charges than 
at any time this year. Area companies' selling prices are largely 
unchanged, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local manufacturers generally have positive views of the future. 
balance, survey respondents foresee continued expansion through at 
least the first quarter of next year. They predict a growing rate of 
orders and shipments, but they do not expect any gains in 
employment. Industrial firms' capital spending plans call for 
slightly greater outlays, overall, during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Department and general merchandise stores in the area report year-
over-year sales increases of up to 10 percent in mid-October. 
However, some say this is below expectations. Unseasonably warm 
weather in late September and early October has restrained sales of 
fall outerwear, according to store officials. As these lines account 
for a substantial portion of sales at this time of year, continued 
poor performance could  hold down results for the quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discount stores generally have been experiencing slower growth than 
stores with more up-scale merchandise. Two large discount chains 
have entered the area in recent months and a third is planning a 
major expansion of its presence in the region, restricting growth of 
sales per store. Greater price competition has also narrowed selling 
margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      The apparent slowdown in retail sales is beginning to prompt concern 
for the Christmas season among merchants. However, they are still 
hoping to meet their sales objectives for the holidays. Store 
officials say there is little they can do at this late date to alter 
plans, anyway.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total lending by major Third District banks grew approximately 5 
percent from August to September. Total loan volume outstanding in 
September was approximately 17 percent above the year-earlier 
period. Demand for commercial and industrial loans remains strong. 
Some banks are implementing more stringent credit qualifications in 
this category, however, which they expect will slow the growth of 
their lending to this sector. Prospects of a softer economy during 
1987 are motivating this caution, according to these banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate lending also remains strong. Banks active in 
construction financing say they are lending to financially sound 
contractors for both commercial and residential development. Almost 
no speculative building is being done, and bank-financed projects 
are usually substantially pre-leased or have long-term commitments 
from mortgage lenders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer installment lending is generally experiencing healthy 
growth, but the rate at which credit card outstandings is increasing 
has slackened. Bankers speculate that consumers have held back in 
taking on more of this type of debt while they have increased 
purchases of automobiles. Some bankers predict even slower growth in 
consumer lending during the fourth quarter as automobile loan 
payments begin for cars bought during the latest round of 
manufacturers' incentive financing programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total deposits at large Third District banks grew approximately 12 
percent from August to September. For the month, deposits were also 
12 percent above September 1985. Some banks report a slowdown in the 
growth of savings deposits and certificates of deposit. Although 
some of this is a result of liability management strategies, 
weakening growth in core passbook and statement savings deposits is 
becoming a matter of concern at some institutions.
