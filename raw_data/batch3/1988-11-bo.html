      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 30, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic sentiment in the First District has a more positive tone 
than in recent months, although actual results are mixed. 
Manufacturing sales are good and orders are up at a majority of 
firms contacted. Retail sales are ahead of last year and generally 
on plan, but plans have been scaled back. Price pressures have 
moderated except for steel and copper. Manufacturers have now joined 
retailers in expressing concern about the tight regional labor 
market, The outlook is "steady as you go," with most contacts 
expecting a continuation of current activity levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District retailers report business in October and early 
November to be generally satisfactory and within their conservative 
expectations. Sales are moderately ahead of last year's level, and 
also better than soft third quarter results. Respondents even 
expressed optimum that a turn-around in the sluggish women's apparel 
trade is imminent. Inventories are nevertheless light, reflecting a 
desire to enter this Christmas season in a lean position. Prices 
remain relatively stable at both the wholesale and retail level. 
Profits are consistent with plans, for the most part, as increases 
in margins and improvements in sales mix offset greater promotional 
activity and rising labor cost. Wages for retail clerks, in 
particular, are up 13 to 15 percent from year-ago levels. But 
despite the prolonged tightness in regional labor markets, some 
respondents have been pleasantly surprised by the availability of 
part-time workers for the Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regional retailers generally expect a good Christmas. But over the 
longer term, most respondents foresee a sharper competitive 
environment. One sees a permanent increase in promotional activity 
while another spoke of an over-built regional retailing sector. Most 
contacts express a continued interest in building new stores should 
the right site appear, but they are focusing their capital programs 
on remodeling, warehouse, and office construction. One retailer 
found contractors unexpectedly eager to undertake a warehouse 
expansion; the bids were 15 percent below expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most First District manufacturers characterized current business 
conditions as good, with sales 3 to 20 percent above year-ago 
levels. The order situation is mixed, however. Almost half of the 
respondents report that orders are flat or down slightly - with two 
citing seasonal factors. The other contacts indicate that orders are 
10 to 15 percent above last year's levels and for one the order 
backlog is its highest in several years. Demand for machinery, 
paper, and aircraft-related products was described as particularly 
strong. Demand for consumer, defense and computer-related products 
is less robust. Several contacts mentioned good export growth or 
reduced import competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are generally reported as "comfortable" although a few 
manufacturers have increased inventories because some materials such 
as paper require longer order times. Most First District contacts 
indicate that materials prices have continued to rise. While 
manufacturers generally see paper prices stabilizing now or in early 
1989, they expect no relief from steel and copper price increases. 
Although most respondents have recently raised prices on some of 
their own products, several report that materials price increases 
continue to hurt their margins on some lines. Prices on consumer 
products are set far in advance, for instance, and raising the 
prices of auto, defense or computer-related products remains 
difficult.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment levels at First District manufacturing firms are flat or 
up slightly. Almost half of the respondents described labor markets 
as tight or indicated a need to train recruits. Views on wage 
pressures were mixed. While some contacts described recent wage 
increases (of 2 to 4 percent) as "moderate," others are giving more 
than in recent years. One firm is shifting some functions to the 
Southwest to avoid offering premium wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital spending plans are also mixed. While some firms' capital 
expenditures are substantially above last year's level, others 
report that capital spending is down slightly. Several respondents 
that undertook big capital spending programs over the last couple of 
years expect expenditures for 1989 to be down somewhat. Other 
contacts foresee an uptick in capital spending; two mentioned plans 
for new plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of contacts foresee sales growth continuing at a "strong" 
10 to 15 percent annual rate during the first half of 1989. Others 
expect a gradual slowing. One respondent, who expects reduced sales, 
pointed out that his firm can achieve better profits even on the 
basis of reduced volume because of cost cutting programs already in 
place. No contact forecast a recession in the first half of 1989. 
One characterized 1989 as likely to be "boring," but suggested that 
the country needs a boring year to reduce current imbalances.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The New England Economic Project (NEEP), a non-profit organization 
comprised of businesses, government agencies, and educational 
institutions, held its semi-annual outlook conference in mid-
November. The NEEP forecasts for the six New England states, taken 
together, call for nonfarm jobs to grow 2.5 percent in 1988 and 1.9 
percent in 1989, compared to 2.6 percent in 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of continued improvement in the nations trade deficit and 
associated increases in business fixed investment, manufacturing 
jobs in the region are expected to grow modestly in 1989. The 
region's factory job gains will be concentrated in durable goods 
industries, especially nonelectrical and electrical machinery. 
Despite the improvement in manufacturing, nonmanufacturing 
industries will still account for most of the additional jobs. 
Nonmanufacturing employment growth will be more modest than in 
recent yearsâ€”averaging about 2.2 percent in 1989. The region's 
unemployment rate will continue to be 2 percentage points below the 
national average. Personal income growth is also expected to remain 
stronger in New England than in other regions of the country.
