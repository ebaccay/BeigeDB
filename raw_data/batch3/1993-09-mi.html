      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Ninth Federal Reserve District continues to grow 
moderately and economic conditions are, on balance, positive. 
Employment is growing in all district states, and two recently 
announced large layoffs appear to be the result of corporate 
restructuring rather than slack demand. On a sector-by-sector basis, 
construction is dearly quite strong and leads the economy. 
Manufacturing is improving, especially in small and mid-size firms. 
Mining output is generally stable, though a recent strike by iron 
miners has idled production in Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan. Agriculture is the one sector with declining output; crop 
production, especially in Minnesota and the Dakotas, will be down 
sharply from 1992 levels. Retail sales have apparently slowed 
somewhat in some parts of the district, but tourism appears stronger 
after an initially slow start. Price levels are stable, with no 
indication of inflationary pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Non-farm employment continues at above year-earlier levels in all 
Ninth District states. Unemployment rates declined in Minnesota, 
Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota. Corporate restructuring 
caused layoffs of 900 insurance workers in Minnesota and 1,200 
lumber company employees in Montana that were announced recently. 
One firm in Rapid City, S.D., announced that it would add over 200 
new employees as did another in Hayward, Wis. Another South Dakota 
firm added a total of 70 workers to its plants in Sioux Falls and 
Huron.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction leads the economy. Publicly awarded construction 
contracts in Minnesota and the Dakotas for July were about 30 
percent above July 1992, while year-to-date awards are up nearly 20 
percent over year-earlier levels. South Dakota is an especially 
strong area for all types of construction and employment in this 
sector is at near-record levels. Residential construction is 
reportedly the largest element in South Dakota, but commercial 
construction and public building are also strong. Moreover, a 
Minneapolis-St Paul building association official said that 1993 
would surpass 1992 in terms of units built and dollars spent. 
Houghton and Hancock, Mich., also report a good construction season 
as do other regional centers in Montana and Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing apparently is strengthening. Small manufacturing firms 
in Minnesota report good orders as do media reports from other 
district states. A utility serving large areas of Wisconsin, 
Minnesota and South Dakota reports industrial electrical use growing 
at a rate substantially above the five-year average. Publicly traded 
manufacturing firms generally report improved business; one 
evaluation of Minnesota-based corporations notes second quarter 1993 
net earnings up l8 percent to 25 percent over 1992 for firms making 
food products, industrial machinery, biomedical equipment and 
consumer products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Metal mining output is stable. Gold output in Montana and South 
Dakota metal mines has risen somewhat in response to higher prices. 
A South Dakota gold operation requested permits for new exploratory 
drilling, and production has increased at a Montana platinum-
palladium operation. However, Montana copper production fell 
slightly as one mine closed. Iron ore output around Lake Superior 
was above year-earlier levels until a strike idled two mines in 
Minnesota and two in Michigan on Aug. 1. No settlement has been 
reached to date.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crops in Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota have 
all suffered extensive damage from excessive rain and flooding. Aug. 
1,1993, Agricultural Statistics Service reports estimate that corn 
production will be down 13 percent in Wisconsin and 30 percent or 
more in the other affected states, compared to 1992 levels. Soybean 
production will be down 8 percent In Wisconsin and 22 percent in 
Minnesota and South Dakota. All wheat production is estimated to be 
down slightly in the Dakotas, down about 20 percent in Minnesota, 
but up over 30 percent in Montana. Spring wheat in Minnesota and the 
Dakotas is reportedly heavily infested with plant diseases, 
including one that can render the grain unfit for food use. The full 
extent of damage is not yet clear, but spring wheat prices have 
risen by one-third since mid-June.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, reflecting good crop conditions in areas not affected by 
flooding, soybean and corn prices have subsided from mid-July 
increases and are now respectively only 12 percent and 5 percent 
above pre-flooding levels and about even with year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the livestock sector, cattle slaughter numbers and prices remain 
slightly above year-earlier levels. Hog prices are about 8 percent 
above year-ago levels and output is essentially the same. Milk 
production is down slightly in Wisconsin, but unchanged in Minnesota 
and other district states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending is mixed. Retail sales vary across the district in 
Minnesota, sales tax collections have fallen behind projections, and 
retail businesses were the poorest performing category in a recent 
report on publicly traded companies based in that state. But news 
media and mail managers in regional centers in the Dakotas and 
Montana report generally good business, and retail employment in 
Michigan's Upper Peninsula had the strongest growth of any sector. 
Vehicle sales are reported as steady, except in areas affected by 
flooding where sales continue to be slack.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tourism industry is having a good summer season. Montana and 
western South Dakota, which have been least affected by adverse 
weather, continue to have the most positive reports, while industry 
sources in Minnesota and Wisconsin report generally improved traffic 
after a slow start earlier in the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is little evidence of inflationary pressures. Food prices in 
general are stable. Gasoline prices continue below year-earlier 
levels. Housing prices are stable across most of the district, 
though up somewhat in the larger urban areas. New wage settlements 
are reported to include small increases in direct wages, although 
health care costs continue to drive up total labor costs to firms.
