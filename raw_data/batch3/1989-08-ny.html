      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pattern of developments in the Second District continued to be 
mixed across sectors. Some retailers reported sales well above plan, 
while others experienced demand that met or fell below targeted 
levels. Upstate New York reports on new orders, production, and 
general business conditions indicate some leveling off. 
Nevertheless, more respondents continued to report gains in these 
areas than reported declines. Office leasing activity in the 
District has maintained a moderately strong pace. The pace of 
homebuilding activity has been uneven across the District, and based 
on a survey of small- to medium-sized banks, demand for residential 
real estate credit has weakened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results at District department stores were mixed during June. 
While some retailers reported sales were well above plan, others 
experienced demand that just met or fell below targeted levels. 
Over-the-year gains in June ranged from 0.2 percent to 9.5 percent 
among District retail contacts. Women's and junior apparel, 
accessories and cosmetics continued to be in strong demand and men's 
departments showed some improvement from their earlier weakness. In 
contrast, home furnishings and appliances were generally weak. 
Partial results for the first half of July indicate some slowing may 
have occurred in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of one store, which had stocks well above desired 
levels, department store contacts described their inventories as 
being in good shape. In one case, this was due to unusually heavy 
markdowns, which were being continued in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity in the District has been mixed in recent 
weeks. A glut of homes in the resale market continues to be cited as 
a major deterrent to homebuilding in downstate New York and northern 
New Jersey, but a slight pickup was noted as a result of lower 
mortgage rates. Many observers believe that existing home prices 
will need to be lowered considerably more before current owners can 
sell and "move up" to new homes. By way of contrast, homebuilders in 
several upstate New York communities are currently quite busy after 
an unusually rainy spring, which slowed things down, and home prices 
continue to rise in response to strong demand. With regard to the 
outlook, projects have recently been proposed for 4700 new moderate 
income residential units in Brooklyn and 7000-10,000 units in 
Queens, and a survey in Monmouth County (N.J.) projects the need for 
some 33,000 new units to be built in that area over the next few 
years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity has continued at a moderately strong pace 
since the last report as Manhattan's largest lease of the year was 
signed for space in a 40-story midtown building scheduled for 
completion in 1992. Vacancy rates declined in several parts or the 
District including northern New Jersey and Suffolk and Westchester 
counties (N.Y.). Rates moved higher in some other areas, however, 
including downtown Manhattan where downsizing or merging financial 
firms are adding to the available supply of office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Reports on Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      June surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester suggest 
some tendency to a flattening out in general business conditions, 
orders and production with an increased majority reporting "no 
change" in these various categories. Nevertheless, improving 
conditions are still reported by substantially more firms than are 
reporting a deterioration. Noticeably fewer purchasing managers 
reported higher input prices in June. Concerning the outlook, both 
the monthly Rochester survey and a semi-annual survey by the 
Manufacturers Association of Central New York showed a large group 
in the percentage of respondents expecting a further improvement in 
business conditions over the next three to six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      June unemployment rates of 4.2 percent and 5.0 percent in New Jersey 
and New York, respectively, were again below the national average. 
Nevertheless, the growth in second District nonfarm employment has 
increasingly lagged the national pace since l986. In large part this 
results from continued declines in manufacturing employment in the 
District. In addition, some nonmanufacturing industries are growing 
more slowly than elsewhere in the nation. As a result of this and 
other developments, much discussion is going on in government and 
private circles regarding what can be done for the region to 
maintain its competitive position.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several new projects were announced or undertaken in recent weeks. 
The Mahwah, New Jersey, United Parcel Service broke ground for a 
computer and telecommunications center which will be part of a $1.4 
billion investment in its worldwide operations. In Monmouth County 
plans have been announced for two large mixed-use projects which it 
is hoped will revitalize an old resort area. Ground was also broken 
in northeastern New York for a $50 million mall scheduled to open 
next year, and downstate plans were announced for a major expansion 
of the New Rochelle mall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Based on a survey of small- to medium-sized banks in the Second 
District, demand for residential real estate credit has softened. 
While interest in second mortgages remains strong, demand for 
primary mortgages is modest or falling. According to the bankers, 
adjustable rate mortgages still appear more popular than fixed-rate 
ones, especially those with first-year discounts. Several reasons 
were suggested for the softening of real estate loans. Some bankers 
said that the real estate market may have overexpanded and is now 
undergoing an adjustment period. Other reasons given were: continued 
uncertainty about the outlook for financial markets, relatively high 
interest rates, and the slowdown in the national economy. Most of 
the surveyed bankers characterized their local economies as strong, 
however, and reported that employment levels were very high. They 
forecast continued but slower growth in the future for their 
communities. In general, the respondents were not worried about 
inflation with many stating that its current rate is not high enough 
to warrant concern. Most anticipate that inflation will continue at 
relatively moderate rates during the next year.
