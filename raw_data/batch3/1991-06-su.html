      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions appear to be improving modestly in much of the 
nation. Retail sales are up moderately in some districts. 
Manufacturing is gaining strength in some regions and industries, 
although several districts report weaker foreign demand for some 
manufactured goods. Prices are generally steady to up slightly at 
both the wholesale and retail levels. Home purchases continue to 
strengthen, but homebuilding has picked up in only a few regions. 
Mortgage lending continues to be the only source of strength in loan 
demand. Delayed planting could reduce production of some crops. 
Stable oil prices and low natural gas prices are keeping oil 
drilling in check.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales vary across districts. While there are no reports of 
substantial improvement, the overall situation is somewhat brighter 
than that described in the last Beige Book. A few districts describe 
gains as slight or moderate, while others report lackluster sales. 
Richmond reports a slight decline in sales, and Atlanta notes that 
spending increases of recent months have stalled. Sales are uneven 
in several districts, with soft goods selling better than consumer 
durables. But sales advances in the Chicago district were led by 
housing-related durable goods. Unseasonably warm weather has brought 
improved sales of summer goods in the Northeast, but skepticism 
remains about future gains. Retailers in several districts are also 
concerned about future sales gains in light of shaky consumer 
confidence and uncertainty about the course of the economy. A few 
districts, however, report optimism about future sales, particularly 
for items related to purchases of both new and existing houses. 
While retailers in some districts are comfortable with current 
inventory levels, others continue to emphasize keeping stocks lean 
and under tight control. Only modest increases in retail prices are 
reported. Most reporting districts say that new car sales remain 
weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity seems to be improving overall, but several 
districts report slower export growth. Prices of inputs are 
generally stable. Philadelphia reports activity picking up in most 
major industries, and Boston notes a recent pickup in both sales and 
orders. Cleveland says that manufacturing output appears to have 
bottomed as capital goods industries near a trough, but New York and 
San Francisco report continued slow activity. Steel industry 
respondents see little change in production, with gradual 
improvement in domestic markets offset by softer export markets. St. 
Louis reports mixed activity with some firms expanding but many 
still contracting due to defense cuts spreading to smaller firms. In 
the Chicago district, consumer durables producers are doing better 
than heavy equipment producers. Automobile production is improving, 
as is production of goods going into new homes. Weakness continues 
in the production and sales of capital goods. Dallas reports that 
oil field machinery production has declined slightly due to 
decreased domestic drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      Views of the outlook vary among respondents, with stagnation 
expected in the Boston district until early 1992 but healthy gains 
expected in the Philadelphia district for the rest of this year. New 
York respondents see no significant turnaround before late summer, 
while Cleveland and Richmond respondents are optimistic for the 
second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The improvement in home sales reported in the last Beige Book 
continues and is being translated into increased construction 
activity in some areas. While buyer interest and purchases still are 
found mainly in the market for existing homes, reduced inventories 
of new houses are leading to increases in starts in several parts of 
the Midwest. In the Atlanta district, tight lending conditions are 
restricting the rebound in residential sales and construction. And 
in the St. Louis district, new construction remains mixed in spite 
of lower inventories of unsold homes. Nonresidential construction 
remains weak. Little commercial construction appears to be under 
way, as vacancy rates are high and leasing activity sluggish. 
Construction activity is being supported by public projects in the 
Atlanta and Richmond districts, but Dallas reports a significant 
slowdown in most types of public construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank lending continues to be weak in the eight districts reporting 
on financial developments, despite a pickup in demand for home 
mortgage loans. Much of the strength in mortgage lending stems from 
refinancing rather than new purchases. Demand for business and 
consumer loans is weak, except for some modest strength in consumer 
lending in the Cleveland and Kansas City districts. While sluggish 
growth in business loans in the Richmond district is attributed 
mainly to week loan demand, some supply restraints were also noted. 
Small and mid-sized banks in the New York district report slower 
repayment for all types of consumer loans. Some respondents expect 
continued sluggish growth in lending even after the recession ends.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Extreme weather conditions in several districts have hampered spring 
planting. Production estimates are being lowered for several crops. 
Heavy rains have delayed spring planting in parts of the Atlanta, 
St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts. Crops affected 
include cotton, soybeans, peanuts, rice, corn, and grain sorghum. 
Dry conditions in west Texas and the Texas panhandle have reduced 
production estimates for the areas wheat and cotton crops. Richmond 
reports generally favorable agricultural prospects, and Minneapolis 
notes that conditions are good in the Dakotas. Kansas City reports a 
high level of farm income, with strong cattle prices continuing to 
reduce the impact of weak crop prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil drilling in the Dallas and Kansas City districts has declined 
despite stable oil prices. The decline stems partly from low natural 
gas prices, which are down 20 percent from a year ago.
