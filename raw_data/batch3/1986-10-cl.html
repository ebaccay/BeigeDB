      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The regional economy during September has remained relatively 
stable. The outlook for the region is less optimistic than 
previously reported with the majority of respondents to a recent 
survey predicting no change. Economic indicators are generally mixed:  
Retail sales and housing have declined slightly; orders and inventories 
are mixed; and capital, borrowing and employment plans are down. 
Despite overall regional economic doldrums, some metropolitan areas, 
such as Columbus and Cincinnati, are experiencing healthy 
expansions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales during September were slightly lower than reported for 
the previous month. In addition, the composition of sales has 
changed; retailers report that sales of hard goods considerably 
outpaced soft goods sales. Retailers attributed this change to the 
increase in housing sales earlier in the year. Looking toward the 
holiday season, the Christmas sales outlook is more pessimistic than 
any reported in the last three years, especially for the Northeast 
portion of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domestic auto dealers in the Fourth District reported that sales 
have been driven primarily by the recent incentive programs. Most 
dealers reported a 20-25 percent increase over the same period in 
1985. Sales surged immediately  after the announcement of low 
interest rate financing, tapered off during September, and then 
jumped again right before the incentives expired.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several dealers mentioned that the even lover 2.1 percent and 2.9 
percent financing arrangements stirred the market again, after the 
previous round of incentives had list their appeal. The incentive 
program apparently lowered dealers' inventories of 1986 models, 
below normal carry-over levels, and non-GMC dealers said that levels 
of 1987 models were very tight. Import dealers reported that the 
domestics' incentive programs helped to increase import sales by 
about 10 percent. even though they did not offer similar financing 
rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      August unemployment in Ohio rose by 0.5 percentage points since July 
to 8.5 percent of the civilian workforce, compared to the national 
rate of 7.0 percent. The rate still remains below the 9.2 percent 
level of a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total employment in Ohio rose by 0.2 percent from the previous month 
and by 3.1 percent for the year ending in August. Employment in the 
fifteen largest MSAs in the district rose 0.1 percent during August 
and 2.8 percent from a year ago. Employment changes were mixed in 
the largest metropolitan areas. Cincinnati and Columbus recorded 
greater than average growth (0.5 percent and 0.4 percent change 
since last month), while Pittsburgh lost jobs (0.6 percent) and 
Cleveland remained virtually unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      In most cases, nonmanufacturing employment has risen at the expense 
of manufacturing employment. In Ohio, a 4.8 percent employment gain 
in nonmanufacturing since last year was more than enough to offset a 
2.0 percent decline in manufacturing employment. The service 
industries are the strongest component of employment growth in Ohio. 
The 7.4 percent increase in the service sector brought it within 
50,000 jobs of overtaking manufacturing employment. Wholesale and 
retail trade also increased employment substantially (by 5.2 
percent); this sector cow employs 9,000 more workers than does the 
manufacturing sector in Ohio.
     </p>
     <p>
      Surveys of both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies reveal 
plans to hire slightly fewer workers in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Once again, the region's manufacturing outlook is mixed. Employment 
was relatively steady over the past few months, but remains far 
below its level during the peak of the last business cycle peak. 
Orders in consumer durable and capital goods are up, but orders in 
materials and services and technology are down. At the same time, 
inventories of consumer durables are higher, while material and 
services and technology are lower. Companies have revised downward 
their plans for capital expenditures in the coming quarter and are 
also scaling back their borrowing plans. However, a high proportion 
of companies surveyed are planning to cut inventories in the coming 
months in anticipation of a decline in sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel industry employment in Ohio during August fell by 5 percent 
from the previous month. The decline was considerably worse in 
Pittsburgh (15 percent) whereas Cleveland's employment remained 
stable. However, reported production increases of 10 percent in the 
Pittsburgh area during September may cushion the sharp employment 
decline experienced in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Much of the difference in employment experience had to do with the 
location of USX steel facilities that have been shut down since 
August 1. In some parts of the district, the USX strike has been 
beneficial to workers employed by competing steel producers. For 
example, LTV, which is operating under Chapter 11 protection, is 
enjoying a considerable increase in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the overall decline in manufacturing employment and union 
wage concessions, weekly earnings among production and non-
supervisory workers in manufacturing rose by 1.5 percent in Ohio for 
August, compared to a 0.5 percent increase for the U.S. Average 
hours worked rose by .6 hours, which is similar to the national 
change.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity in the Midwest shows clear signs of slowing down. 
However, the activity in most housing markets in the district 
remains higher then a year ago. Some areas, (in particular, 
Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati) report considerably more building 
and sales than do other areas of the district. Conditional on 
mortgage rates, housing market participants forecast moderate 
housing activity in the Midwest through the rest of 1986 and into 
1987. Housing activity in the District appears to be very sensitive 
to interest rates since the region is not experiencing substantial 
immigration or demographic changes. Those interviewed foresee a 
housing boom only if mortgage rates fall below 9 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lenders report shallow demand for the adjusting rate mortgage 
because most lenders refuse to discount these products enough to 
induce borrowers to accept them. This is consistent with the fact 
that most borrowers perceive the current level of mortgage rates as 
the trough in long tern mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall loan demand has improved at district banks, primarily, 
because of the strong demand for consumer installment credit and 
mortgage loans. Consumer installment loans increased at an annual 
rate of over 25 percent, and real estate loans rose 16 percent. 
Business loan demand, on the other hand, was sluggish, and 
commercial and industrial loans fell at an annual rate of nearly 7 
percent over the last six weeks.
