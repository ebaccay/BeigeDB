      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy continued to recover in June and early 
July. but at a slower pace than in May. Establishment survey data 
indicate that the recovery in District employment has been better 
than the national average, although recent reports on District labor 
markets were mixed. Retailers indicated that consumer spending 
growth remained sluggish but positive. Manufacturing activity 
continued to lead the District's recovery, and increased motor 
vehicle production is expected to make a significant contribution to 
industrial production in the third quarter. District housing 
activity regained some momentum after recent declines in mortgage 
interest rates. Bank lending in the District continued to improve in 
recent weeks, although gains were concentrated in new residential 
mortgage loans and refinancing. Timely rains have alleviated the 
drought concerns of District crop farmers, while conditions faced by 
livestock farmers were mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Establishment survey data indicate that District employment through 
May had recovered roughly one-fourth of its recessionary downturn, 
but more recent reports on labor markets were mixed. The employment 
component of most District purchasing managers' surveys generally 
continued to move higher in recent months, reaching levels 
consistent with stable or modestly increasing manufacturing 
employment. A private survey showed improvement in firms' hiring 
expectations for the third quarter, with reports for firms in the 
Midwest exceeding the national average. Some individual 
manufacturers reported plans to make significant employment 
increases in coming months. However, new hiring continues to be 
countered by the effects of previously announced layoffs, and there 
was little slowing in layoff announcements in District newspapers. 
Help-wanted advertising around the District has shown modest 
improvement in recent months, while initial claims for unemployment 
insurance gradually moved higher in most District states in June and 
early July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending growth was flat to slow in most areas of the 
District in June and early July. One large retail chain reported 
that sales in District markets were mixed, but year-over-year 
comparisons generally strengthened after some softening in trend was 
noted early in the second quarter. This contact reported that 
inventories were again in line with plan. after the unplanned 
increases noted in recent months. Another large retail chain 
reported that sales in District markets softened during June and 
early July, after exhibiting strength (relative to the national 
average) through most of last year and into 1992. Consumers' efforts 
to pare debt levels continued to dampen sales, according to this 
contact, although renewed strength in mortgage refinancing was 
expected to contribute to improvement in sales during the rest of 
1992. A survey of retailers in Illinois and Indiana indicated some 
loss of momentum during May, while a retailers' association in 
Wisconsin stated that its membership continued to be relatively 
insulated from demand weakness in other parts of the country. 
Reports from auto dealers and manufacturers indicated that retail 
sales closure rates continued to move upward in recent months. One 
of the largest auto dealers in the District reported that sales and 
traffic strengthened through the end of June. However, this contact 
noted that business softened in recent weeks, following the release 
of the unemployment rate for June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to lead the District's recovery 
through June and early July. Purchasing managers' surveys in 
Chicago. Detroit, Milwaukee, Iowa, and Western Michigan generally 
indicated continued gains in production and new orders. Slower 
growth was suggested by several of these surveys during June, but 
the Chicago survey for July suggested expansion picked up further 
upward momentum, led by production and new orders. Reports from 
individual manufacturers were mixed, with strength concentrated in 
production of consumer durable goods. An appliance industry 
representative reported that industry shipments growth increased 
during the second quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, while 
orders continued their gradual recovery through June. One appliance 
manufacturer reported that orders and shipments have exceeded 
expectations thus far in 1992, although some concern with customer 
inventory building was also noted. Steel production in the District 
has been flat in recent months, although one manufacturer noted that 
orders were building somewhat faster than normal seasonal patterns, 
citing strength in orders for steel used in autos, appliances, and 
residential building. Several contacts noted that third quarter 
motor vehicle production plans are solid, calling for a significant 
increase from the second quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on capital goods production were mixed. A large truck 
manufacturer reported that heavy-duty truck orders and production 
continued to exhibit marked improvement in recent months. This 
contact stared that orders from customers in the District have been 
exceeding the national average. A large electronics firm reported 
modest but consistent improvement in orders through June, citing 
renewed strengthening in the market for computer hardware. Several 
capital goods producers noted that weakness in domestic orders was 
at lent partially offset by export gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from housing industry contacts were generally positive, with 
renewed strength in sales and construction following recent declines 
in mortgage interest rates. One of the largest realtors in the 
District reported a record month for June, in part due to market 
share gains. A realtors' association stated that existing home sales 
had strengthened since early July. A homebuilders association 
reported that strong construction gains earlier in the year had been 
followed by some softening in recent months, with relative strength 
noted in home improvement activity. One homebuilder stated that 
cyclical swings in activity have been concentrated in the upper end 
of the market, and reported renewed strength in demand for higher-
priced homes following recent declines in mortgage rates. A realtor 
stated that housing starts may be exhibiting higher volatility due 
to lower inventories of land held by homebuilders. A large 
manufacturer of plumbing and furniture products stated that orders 
were still increasing, albeit at a decreasing rate, while shipments 
in the second half of the year were expected to continue to improve. 
Increased residential building activity and highway construction has 
generated consistent improvement in cement shipments in the District 
for the past five months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending by District banks continued to improve, with gains 
concentrated in residential mortgage lending. Many contacts noted 
that recent declines in mortgage rates have again stimulated 
refinancing activity, although new mortgage lending also rose in 
recent weeks. Reports on commercial and industrial lending activity 
were mixed. A middle-market lender reported that credit line 
utilization in June and early July remained relatively flat, and 
stated that capital spending among its customers had been 
insensitive to interest rate changes. Another middle-market lender 
reported that borrower demand softened again in recent weeks. 
Several law firms involved in loan contract negotiations reported 
increasingly aggressive lending postures among banks, but a pickup 
in borrower demand remained relatively sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Frequent and extensive rains throughout the District during July 
have offset earlier drought concerns and significantly enhanced the 
condition of growing crops. Reflecting this, an unusually high 
proportion (about 85 percent) of the corn and soybeans in Illinois, 
Indiana and Iowa was rated "good" or "excellent" as of July 20. 
However, the frequent rains have also delayed the completion, and 
the quality, of the District's wheat harvest. Low temperatures 
continue to slow the pace in crop development and add to the risk 
that a frost could yet cause damage to fail-harvested crops. 
Conditions for the District's livestock farmers are mixed. Following 
a sharp downturn last year, milk prices have rebounded considerably 
this year. However, the continuing upswing in pork production will 
weigh heavily on hog prices this fall and well into next year. The 
latest estimates show hog numbers are up 5 percent from a year ago 
and 10 percent from two years ago, both in District states and 
nationwide.
