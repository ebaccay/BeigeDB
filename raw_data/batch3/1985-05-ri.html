      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District appears to have retained 
much of the momentum lost earlier in the year. There has been some 
pickup in the manufacturing sector where most of the earlier slack 
has appeared, and nearly all other areas of activity are holding 
their own at quite high levels or making further gains. The only 
area in which activity has slowed in recent weeks is automobile 
sales. Overall, however, consumer activity continues very strong, as 
do construction, mining, and tourism. Furthermore, the earlier lull 
in the District is not generally perceived as commensurate with the 
slowing of growth recently reported at the national level. In many 
respects the District has lagged the U.S. economy during this 
recovery, and perhaps some catching up is underway. Loan demand, 
apart from auto loans, continues strong. Progress in the farm sector 
is being impeded by unusually dry weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The earlier deterioration of conditions in District manufacturing 
has been arrested, and even reversed in some sectors. New orders 
hive picked up, as have shipments, and order backlogs have 
stabilized. There seems to have been some further accumulation of 
inventories at the manufacturing level, primarily in materials, but 
the rate of accumulation slowed markedly from previous months. There 
is still some concern that current levels might be excessive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite this generally positive overview, however, conditions across 
the manufacturing sector are by no means uniform. Much of the recent 
improvement may well be in a relatively few sectors. Forest 
products, building materials, and furniture all appear to be doing 
quite well, and machinery and equipment are at least holding their 
own. Elsewhere, conditions are less buoyant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal production, however, is off to another good start in 1985, 
despite having had a few bad weeks as a result of severe winter 
weather. Weekly production is near year-ago levels, and year-to-date 
is only slightly below. Exports have improved, especially in the 
metallurgical segment which contributed so much to last year's 
outstanding performance in the industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The consumer remains a major force propelling business activity in 
the District. Despite some recent softening in automobile sales, 
consumer activity is almost uniformly described as strong to very 
strong. Apart from autos, the strength is essentially across the 
board. Non-durables, durables such as furniture, and services, 
especially those related to tourism, are performing well. Tourism 
is, in fact, a surprisingly bright spot in the District at present. 
Even relatively optimistic forecasts of tourist trade are being 
exceeded in many areas. Also, there seems to be a modest move 
underway to get away from the discounting that became so widespread 
in late 1984 and carried over into early 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity also remains a major positive force in the 
District economy. Activity in the commercial and residential sectors 
is almost uniformly strong, although activity remains slightly 
weaker away from the metropolitan and tourist centers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity has been very encouraging to most industry 
participants. With construction quite strong and sales keeping 
market supplies moderate, the prospects for continued strength in 
residential building are quite good. Also, the surprising strength 
of tourist activity has spurred what was already a very active hotel 
and other facilities sector in the tourism centers. In addition, 
hotel, office, and shopping center construction remains very strong 
in most of the District's metropolitan areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions continue to experience moderate to 
strong growth of loan demand. Once again, apart from automobile 
loans, the gains have been generally across the board. There is no 
evidence of any strains developing as institutions meet this growing 
demand for credit, and there does not seem to be any expectation 
that such strains will develop over the next several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Problems continue to confront farmers in the Fifth District. A lack 
of rainfall during the spring has delayed the planting of some crops 
and is causing those already planted to develop slowly. Price levels 
of crops and livestock continue to be under downward pressure as 
weak export demand results in large domestic supplies of farm 
commodities. Cash flow is tight, as lower incomes and limited 
borrowing ability are barely adequate to service the debt loads 
facing farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to a recent survey of District agricultural lenders, loan 
repayment rates from farmers are becoming more sluggish than in 
1984. In addition, bankers foresee financial stress increasing 
throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Expectations
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Expectations around the District remain neutral to slightly 
positive, although there is evidence of modest improvement in recent 
weeks. That improvement, however, generally reflects the improvement 
in local market conditions and does not seem to carry over into the 
outlook for national business activity.
