      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity continues to grow. Retailers are more 
upbeat about the holiday season than they were previously, and car 
sales are still very strong. Most surveyed firms report increases in 
sales, orders and employment. Residential construction and home 
sales have slowed somewhat from their year-ago levels. Loan demand 
at District banks is rising modestly. District cotton farmers report 
a small crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Preliminary reports suggest that post-Thanksgiving holiday sales 
were brisk in many areas, despite some weather-related problems. In 
a pre-Thanksgiving survey of retailers, most contacts noted sales 
increases of at least 3 percent over the same period last year. 
While discounting is becoming common in Louisville, it is not being 
used much elsewhere. Most report that inventory and staff levels are 
up in anticipation of a strong holiday season. Stronger local 
economic conditions are cited as the main reason for the high 
expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car sales throughout the District continue to show strength. Many 
dealers report 10 percent increases over the same period last year, 
with some in Memphis reporting slightly stronger growth. Trucks and 
minivans continue to sell very well. Louisville continues to 
experience extremely strong sales in both foreign and domestic 
models. Inventory shortages, however, have cut into the sales volume 
of newer models. Overall, a strong fourth quarter is expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District firms continue to observe moderate growth, as sales, orders 
and employment increase. Minor cutbacks are still occurring, though. 
Contacts from various manufacturing and distribution firms say sales 
are up, in some instances by double digits, over the same period 
last year. For example, a contact in the burglar alarm and security 
industry reports that males have increased 42 percent. Contacts in 
the wood products, building supply, truck transmission and conveyor 
manufacturing industries cite sales increases of between 7 percent 
and 8 percent. A die casting concern reports a 4 percent increase, 
while a metal salvage company reports a 33 percent increase. A 
pharmaceutical company disclosed that increases in sales have led to 
10-hour workdays and regularly scheduled Saturdays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms are also experiencing strong orders and shrinking inventories. 
One contact in the tractor industry claims that inventories are at a 
35-year low, owing partly to few suppliers remaining in the 
industry, one of which is undergoing a major reorganization. A firm 
in the air conditioning and heating industry reports that business 
has unexpectedly rebounded, after a downturn early in the third 
quarter. Orders to medical suppliers are booming according to a 
contact at a regional health center. Most firms expect slight 
increases in employment within the next month or two.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two District areas of particular strength are northwest Arkansas 
(Benton and Washington counties) and northwest Mississippi (Tunica 
County). In northwest Arkansas, the regional unemployment rate has 
fallen more than 1 percentage point over the past year, and new home 
construction is booming. In northwest Mississippi, riverboat 
gambling has turned one of the nation's historically poorest 
counties into one of its fastest growing. A third casino is 
scheduled to open in December, and four more are under construction. 
More than $1 billion in construction has occurred in the area in 
1993. Area firms are having difficulty finding workers because of 
the boom. Monthly sales in the county during the third quarter were 
almost double last year's sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Layoffs at some firms temper the generally positive news. In 
northeast Mississippi, for example, the cancellation of a NASA 
contract eliminated 1,900 construction jobs and 1,500 other jobs 
that would have been created had the facility been completed. A 
public utility in Kentucky plans to lay off almost 300 unionized 
workers because there is not enough work. An oil company will cut 
almost 150 jobs to reduce costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Fate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District residential construction has slowed somewhat in the last 
several months, although year-to-date activity is still well above 
that of one year ago in most areas. Builders in St. Louis are 
struggling to keep up with the backlog created by an unusually wet 
summer. Sales of existing homes are mixed. In some areas, recent 
sales and year-to-date sales are still above those of 1992 and on 
track for a record year; in other areas, the pace of sales activity 
has slowed substantially in recent months. Average sales prices of 
existing homes are up in most areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A November survey of senior loan officers at large District banks 
indicated that loan demand continues to strengthen in portions of 
the commercial and retail markets. Increased financing needs for 
inventory, plant and equipment were cited as reasons for a slight 
uptick in commercial loan demand by large corporate customers. Most 
respondents noted a pickup in consumer installment loan demand, 
primarily for automobiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The fall harvest is nearly complete, although substantial rainfall 
in some areas has delayed the soybean harvest. Expectations of a 
substandard crop became a reality for many District cotton farmers; 
in parts of Arkansas and Mississippi, the yield on this year's crop 
was approximately half the average yield. The price of cottonseed, 
an oilseed similar in nature to soybeans, has risen significantly in 
recent weeks because of this year's smaller soybean crop, which will 
reduce the supply of soybean oil. Seeding of the winter wheat crop 
is nearly completed, with the emerging crop in mostly good 
condition. Although Mississippi's pecan crop is reportedly one of 
the largest in recent years, its quality is said to be below 
average.
