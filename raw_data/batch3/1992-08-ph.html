      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Third District in late July appeared 
mixed. While manufacturers continued to report growth, other sectors 
were sluggish. Reports from area manufacturers indicated that orders 
and shipments were on the rise although unfilled orders and 
employment were just steady. Most retailers said sales were running 
just even with or below the pace set this spring as well as in early 
summer of last year. Sales of summer apparel, in particular, were 
well below plan. Some discount stores, however, were achieving 
relatively good year-over-year gains. Bankers generally described 
loan demand as weak. While some institutions reported growth in home 
equity and consumer lending, on balance loan volume is virtually 
flat at major banks in the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community reflects 
current trends. Manufacturers forecast continued gains in orders and 
output but they do not expect order backlogs to mount. Retailers 
anticipate some improvement in the fall, but many do not expect a 
healthy sales pace to take hold until next spring. Bankers generally 
do not anticipate an increase in loan demand soon. They say both 
business firms and consumers appear reluctant to incur more debt and 
are unlikely to step up borrowing even when the pace of economic 
activity quickens.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued to move up in 
July, on net; nearly one-third of the industrial firms contacted 
reported improved business, and nearly two-thirds said business was 
steady. On balance, manufacturers indicated that new orders and 
shipments were rising. Order backlogs appeared to be unchanged 
overall, and inventories were up marginally. Producers of nondurable 
goods generally gave better reports than did makers of durable 
goods. In particular, metals producers and nonelectrical-machinery 
makers noted some recent slippage in shipments and orders. On 
balance, manufacturing employment was unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of the manufacturers contacted for this report expect 
business to continue to improve over the next six months. They look 
for increases in orders to be matched by increases in shipments, 
leaving order backlogs virtually steady. Firms with plans to step up 
hiring and capital spending outnumber those that anticipate cutting 
back employment or capital expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices remain generally stable, according to area 
manufacturers. Despite the current increase in business, three-
fourths of the plant managers surveyed said that both input and 
output prices have been steady recently, and they expect price 
stability to persist into next year at the least.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers gave mixed reports in July. Most of those 
contacted for this report said sales were running just even with or 
below the rate achieved in the spring months of this year and in 
July of last year. Auto dealers indicated that the sales rate in 
July slipped from June but remained above the year-ago pace. Some 
specialty stores and discount stores were faring better than the 
overall trend. In general, however, there were more reports of 
softness than strength. Sales of summer apparel were generally 
running below plan, and some merchants said their inventories of 
these goods were above desired levels. Merchants noted heightened 
competition as they have undertaken more promotions to maintain 
planned sales levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several store executives believe that sales will be weak for the 
year as a whole and that it will be difficult to maintain 
profitability. While many Third District merchants are looking to 
the fall for the first signs that consumer spending will begin 
trending up, some believe that a healthy sales pace will not be 
restored until 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finance
Third District bankers contacted in late July generally said loan 
demand was weak. A few indicated that consumer loans and home equity 
loans were up at their institutions, but total lending was flat. The 
most recent drop in mortgage rates has prompted an increase in 
mortgage applications, much of it for refinancing, but bankers said 
the volume of applications has not been as great as it was when 
rates fell at the beginning of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial bank loan officers do not foresee an increase in loan 
demand soon. Several said that both business firms and consumers 
appear reluctant to take on new debt. Some bankers also believe that 
loan demand will not rise strongly even when economic activity 
accelerates; they say businesses will be able to increase output 
significantly without having to borrow to expand capacity, and 
consumers will use growing incomes to improve their household 
balance sheets.
