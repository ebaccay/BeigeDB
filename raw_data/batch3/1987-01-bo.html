      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the First District enjoyed strong year-over-year 
holiday sales. Manufacturing activity, on the other hand, remains 
flat. Export sales have increased, but the improvement is small. 
Orders of capital equipment from the auto industry have fallen 
sharply. Although some retailers report that vendor prices are 
rising faster than a year ago, others see no acceleration. The 
prices of manufacturing inputs are stable. Commercial construction 
activity is said to be down from the level of the past two years, 
but still high by the standards of earlier years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Christmas selling results in the First District were mixed; but 
among those contacted, the weakest year-over-year sales increase 
still exceeded 5 percent on a comparable stores basis. Some 
retailers enjoyed increases ranging as high as 25 percent. Several 
respondents noted that the season started slowly but became almost 
frenzied in the last week or so; margins suffered at stores that 
responded to the early weakness with price reductions. Electronics, 
VCRs, TVs, and microwave ovens continued to sell well. Selected 
apparel categories picked up. Pre-holiday toy sales showed 
significant growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are said to be in good shape. A number of stores have 
made significant efforts in the last year to reduce inventory 
levels. Several of those contacted reported that post-holiday 
inventories are no greater than last year even though they are 
supporting significantly higher sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some merchants report domestic and foreign vendor prices rising 
somewhat faster than a year earlier, others note very little change. 
One of those facing rising import prices plans to shift from 
Japanese suppliers to Korean. Another said that even after sizable 
price increases six months ago (which have since leveled off), 
foreign hard-goods suppliers offer better quality relative to price 
than domestic competitors. One firm expects its import prices to 
increase more in 1987 than in 1986; this firm orders up to a year in 
advance and by buying foreign currency when the orders are placed, 
it locks in exchange rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers continue to report difficulties in finding high-quality 
employees in the tight New England labor market, even as they reduce 
staff after the holiday season. This situation gives them confidence 
that the region's consumer sector will remain robust in 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most manufacturing respondents in the First District report that 
business remains flat. However, in the metalworking and machinery 
industries there has been a substantial falling-off in orders from 
auto makers. Various manufacturers of capital goods report that the 
chemical industry is increasing orders, defense demand remains 
strong, but orders from the oil and gas industry remain depressed. 
Several contacts in the computer industry have experienced moderate 
increases in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Exports have picked up, but the improvement is modest. Europe 
accounts for most of the gains. In addition, several manufacturers 
of large-scale capital goods are experiencing increased success 
competing against Japanese and German suppliers in third country 
markets, particularly in the Far East. Most manufacturing 
respondents do not see any lessening in import competition, but a 
representative of the textile industry reports that the prices of 
European products have increased and U.S. mills have regained a 
little market share. None of the firms contacted is shifting 
production to the United States to take advantage of the lower 
dollar. On the contrary, several are expanding overseas operations, 
in some cases with the intention of exporting to the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers in the First District do not expect 1987 to be much 
different from 1986. Seeing little growth potential, they are 
focusing attention on cost containment. Many have reduced employment 
levels in the past year; several are continuing to do so. 
Administrative staffs are being reorganized and reduced. 
Manufacturers are also continuing to cut inventories through the use 
of more computerized controls and just-in-time procedures. 
Respondents are reasonably satisfied with their progress in reducing 
inventory levels, but they are trying to bring them lower still. 
With respect to capital spending, most contacts plan to spend about 
the same in 1987 as in 1986. Two themes were heard, often from the 
same individuals: 1) approval standards are very stringent and 2) if 
the project will yield substantial productivity gains, it will be 
approved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of inputs, whether imported or domestic, are not rising to 
any significant degree. One exception is the price of raw wool from 
Europe. Manufacturers also report a continued inability to raise 
their own prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The commercial real-estate market is healthy for the most part, 
according to local agents. Boston, despite the addition of a 
significant amount of new commercial space, still enjoys one of the 
highest occupancy rates of any city in the country. Agents in most 
areas in the region are reporting a strong market for office space. 
Construction in this sector continues but at a level somewhat below 
that of the past two years. Where over-building has teen reported, 
absorption rates are said to be catching up with vacancy rates. 
Retail space is tight in many suburban and prime downtown locations. 
Other than the current expansion of some rural shopping malls, 
little retail construction is underway. Reports were mixed for 
industrial real estate. While some agents report high vacancy rates, 
others suggest an even match between supply and demand. Industrial 
space in some locations has priced itself out of high occupancy by 
charging retail rents for industrial footage. Other industrial sites 
are being converted to research and development and other uses that 
generate higher revenues.
