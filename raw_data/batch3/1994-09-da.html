      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continued to expand in late July and August. 
Growing strength in the service sector compensated for a slight 
deceleration in manufacturing orders. Despite slowing, manufacturing 
output was still strong. Construction and real estate activity 
remained robust, but new home sales and buyer traffic were less than 
in the second quarter. Retail sales were up, but competition 
remained stiff. Energy activity was slower than expected and below 
last year's level. Bankers said that loan demand was growing but not 
as fast as they would like. Agricultural producers expect overall 
production to be higher than last year. although there has been some 
damage to the cotton crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing orders decelerated slightly but remained strong, 
particularly for paper, electronics, chemicals and refining. Slower 
homebuilding caused a decline in orders for construction-related 
products, such as lumber, metals, brick and cement. Despite the 
slowing, however, contacts in these industries said that sales were 
still relatively strong. Lumber prices were unchanged, although one 
contact said that higher inventories would probably lead to price 
declines. Demand for corrugated boxes was up sharply, pushing up 
selling prices and causing a shortage of liner board. Demand for 
other paper products also was strong, and contacts expect rising 
input costs will force them to raise prices soon. Demand remained 
very strong for electronics and telecommunications equipment. 
Inventories were low for some of these products, but selling prices 
continued to fall. Automobile and computer manufacturers created 
heavy demand for semiconductors and integrated circuits. Producers 
are increasing capacity of these products although contacts said 
that capacity was not increasing fast enough, and input prices would 
probably stop falling in the next few weeks. Apparel manufacturers 
said that sales had decelerated recently. Demand for food and 
kindred products continued to be above last year's level, and 
several food producers said that they had been hiring. Less than 
expected drilling activity kept oil field equipment manufacturing 
weak. In contrast, District refineries were operating near capacity. 
Contacts said that refining margins were very good but had weakened 
in recent weeks with falling gasoline prices. Demand for chemicals, 
particularly ethylene and propylene, was outstripping available 
capacity. Heavy contract commitments limited deliveries of these 
commodity chemicals to spot markets, and their prices were rising 
rapidly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business services accelerated and many firms were hiring. 
Temporary service and trucking firms reported the strongest 
activity. Temporary firms reported slightly higher fees, but most 
contacts said that competition was keeping prices unchanged. Some 
contacts reported difficulty hiring workers but wages were not 
increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales were up overall although sales along the Mexican border 
were still slower than expected. Continued entry of high volume 
discount retailers was keeping competition stiff, and several 
contacts said that Texas store-for-store sales here weaker than the 
nation. Automobile sales decelerated but year-to-date sales were 
above a year ago. Dealers said that tight inventory of some models 
may have affected sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate activity remained strong but new home 
sales and buyer traffic were down from the second quarter. Most 
homebuilders revised their outlook for the year downward, even 
though new and existing home inventories remained tight. New home 
prices were unchanged but builders were offering more discounts, 
such as free pools. High occupancy rates and rising rents continued 
to spur apartment construction. Commercial construction also was 
increasing, mostly for retail space. Rents for suburban office space 
were higher but rents continued to be weak in most downtown areas. 
Labor shortages were reported in some construction trades.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy activity was slower than expected and below last year's 
level. District drilling did not increase seasonally, and foreign 
activity remained weak. Weak demand for gasoline, and a further 
understanding of the political situation in Nigeria, pushed down oil 
prices from $20 to $17.50 per barrel. The decline in oil prices was 
expected, but contacts had not expected a decline in natural gas 
prices. Weak demand and heavier than expected Canadian imports 
pushed down natural gas prices to near $1.60 per thousand cubic 
feet. Contacts had mixed views about the near-term outlook for the 
energy industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers reported that loan demand was growing but not as fast as 
they would like. Competition for loans remained intense. Contacts 
said that banks were cutting fees and offering special services to 
attract borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural producers expect production of corn, sorghum, rice, 
peanuts and soybeans to be higher than last year. Cotton production 
is estimated to be about the same as last year, but there have been 
heavy crop losses around Lubbock. Livestock remained in fair to good 
condition across the District. July commodity prices were higher, 
pushing the Texas All Crops Price Index up 4.6 percent from a year 
ago. Prices for beef cattle, calves, and hogs continued to decrease, 
however, causing the Livestock and Livestock Products Price Index to 
fall 12.4 percent below the previous year.
