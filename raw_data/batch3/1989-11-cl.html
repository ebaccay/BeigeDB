      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists who attended this Bank's outlook meeting on October 20 
expect that growth of output will be sustained at least through the 
end of 1990, accompanied by very little moderation in inflation. 
Retailers are cautiously optimistic over sales for the balance of 
this year. They note consumers are highly responsive to sales 
promotions, which supported apparel and new car sales in recent 
months. Reports from capital goods firms suggest easing from peak 
rates of activity early this year. Growth of bank loans continues to 
be relatively slow, and some respondents view the latest easing in 
the federal funds rate as being too accommodative, but probably not 
enough to result in a reduction in bank lending rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Prospects
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists who met at this bank recently to discuss the economic 
outlook for 1990 still expect that the economy will continue to grow 
at below its potential growth rate through most of next year, but 
the rate of inflation will hardly improve from this year. The 25 
forecasters expect real GNP growth this quarter at about a 1.4% 
annual rate (a.r.), at a 1.7% a.r. in the first half of 1990, and at 
2.5 percent in the second half. The GNP implicit price deflator is 
expected to increase at a 4.5% a.r. this quarter, 4.2% in the first 
half of 1990, and 4.0% in the second half. Several of the group 
asserted that it is difficult to achieve a lower inflation rate 
because of regulations that contributed to rapid increases in 
services prices. The output and price outlooks were virtually 
unchanged from June, except that there appeared to be more 
uncertainty over the outlook now than last June. Only two 
forecasters still expect a mild contraction in 1990, while the few 
who previously expected a contraction now expect mild growth in 
output through 1990. The latest drop in stock prices was judged to 
have little, if any, negative effect on consumer or business 
spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers appear cautiously optimistic about sales prospects 
for the balance of this year. They pointed out that the better-than-
expected retail sales in recent months were not across-the-board. 
Retailers noted the sensitivity of consumer spending to sales 
promotions, which stimulated sales of apparel and new cars in recent 
months. A national retailer reported year-to-year sales increases in 
consumer appliances, but only because of aggressive pricing that 
apparently weakened sales of a regional chain of appliance stores. A 
national retail chain plans much larger inventories for this holiday 
season than last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers of domestic and imported new cars reported mixed consumer 
behavior in August and September. A few dealers of domestic cars 
reported their sales in September were "very good," which greatly 
improved their inventory position. A few other dealers, however, 
reported flat sales and price incentives were insufficient to reduce 
their inventories. October sales so far have been lackluster, and 
most auto dealers appear reluctant to carry large inventories of 
1990 models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers of both high-tech and traditional capital goods producers 
reported either a slower growth or outright declines in orders and 
production in recent months. Orders for office machinery have fallen 
from both export and domestic customers, according to a major 
producer. A materials supplier to the electronics and office 
equipment industries reported that the decline in orders appears to 
have leveled out, although orders have not turned up yet. Their 
operating rate has been reduced by about 5 percentage points from 
last year. A high-tech producer of industrial controls reports that 
orders and shipments last quarter were the best so far this year, 
partly because of new products and also because of a catch-up in 
deliveries from earlier this year, when shortages of computer chips 
caused shipment delays. Declines in orders for communication 
equipment since mid-1988 apparently ended, but further declines for 
electronic components are expected into 1990, according to another 
producer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some traditional capital goods producers report a more-than-expected 
slowdown in business. Construction machinery sales have been 
slackening in response to weakening in residential and 
nonresidential construction. Heavy-duty truck orders, which were at 
peak levels late last year and early this year because of 
anticipated price increases, slumped during the summer months and 
did not revive in September as much as expected, suggesting a 
relatively soft first quarter production schedule.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank directors and economists generally report slow demand for 
loans, although loans at a moderate-size bank rose 9% last quarter 
from a year earlier. Bank profits last quarter ranged from 
satisfactory to very good, according to bank respondents. A bank 
economist commented that the Federal Reserve has been very 
accommodative in response to the latest stock market decline. The 
easing in the federal funds rate was interpreted by one economist as 
inconsistent with bringing the inflation rate down. In his view, 
interest rates are unlikely to come down much until the inflation 
rate is reduced. Some bank economists expect that bank lending rates 
not be adjusted downward until the fed funds rate eases to about 
8.5%.
