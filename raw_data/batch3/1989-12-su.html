      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Federal Reserve districts describe economic activity as stable 
to modestly expanding, though two note some recent softening. 
Consumer spending has varied among districts. Strength has been 
mostly confined to nondurable items, while sales of autos and other 
durables have generally been weak. The majority of districts report 
some softening in manufacturing activity but there are pockets of 
strength. Construction is strong or improving in the West and 
Midwest but somewhat sluggish in other areas. Agriculture has 
improved in much of the country and several resource industries have 
been expanding. Those districts that reported on price developments 
generally noted flat to modestly increased input prices, with 
several mentioning the continuing escalation of medical insurance 
costs. Loan demand at commercial banks varied by type and region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have been mixed among the districts. Sales were 
described as on target or healthy in the New York, St. Louis. 
Minneapolis and San Francisco districts. Boston, Cleveland and 
Philadelphia reported that sales were about even with year-earlier 
levels while Richmond and Dallas noted some slowing. Most districts 
that commented on Thanksgiving weekend sales reported virtually no 
change in the pace of sales relative to a year ago, but Atlanta 
experienced double-digit gains at that time. Among items mentioned 
as selling well in several districts were apparel, jewelry, 
cosmetics and toys. Unseasonably warm weather hampered sales of 
winter apparel in several areas, however, and most districts noted a 
weakness in sales of autos and other big-ticket items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories were reported at satisfactory levels in Atlanta, 
Minneapolis, New York and Philadelphia, but are higher than desired 
in Boston and Chicago. Retailers in Boston, Minneapolis, 
Philadelphia and Richmond expect this holiday season to equal last 
year's while those in Kansas City and St. Louis appear to be 
somewhat more optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some slowing in manufacturing activity has occurred in most areas. 
While conditions in Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco were 
mixed, shipments and orders in Boston were flat or down compared 
with a year earlier. Philadelphia notes a continuation of the 
downtrend that began during the summer and Richmond and St. Louis 
also report a decline in manufacturing activity. In Cleveland, where 
the pace of industrial activity had been strong during the first 
nine months of the year, some easing has recently occurred and 
Kansas City notes a slowing of sales, though most plants are 
operating near full capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Weakness in the auto industry and among its suppliers was most 
commonly cited as a major factor in the manufacturing slowdown. 
Softness was also reported in the computer, electronics and defense 
industries in Minneapolis and in the furniture, textiles and apparel 
industries in Richmond.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the nonauto sectors of the transportation equipment industry some 
gains occurred. Cleveland noted an upturn in orders for heavy-duty 
trucks and several districts reported strength at aerospace-related 
firms. Cleveland and Chicago report expansion in the industrial 
machinery industry, while firms producing oilfield equipment and 
chemicals in Dallas increased their sales. Several food processing 
plants in the San Francisco district plan to expand and Atlanta 
reports that capital spending continues in the chemicals, metals, 
wood and pulp, and industrial equipment industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction is reported to be strong or improving in the West and 
Midwest but somewhat sluggish in most other areas. Housing starts in 
Kansas City have increased over last year and sales in Minneapolis 
were slightly higher. San Francisco reports that construction and 
real estate activity are strong or improving in most of the 
district, while in Chicago residential building is still good though 
the pace has slowed somewhat. Atlanta and Richmond note some 
weakness in residential construction activity, however, and Dallas 
reports that activity remains far below the levels of the mid-80's, 
though there are now tentative signs of expansion. Home sales in 
Boston were the same or slightly lower than in 1988 with homes 
remaining on the market longer and prices declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction and real estate activity also is mixed, 
Boston, Atlanta and Minneapolis report some weakness in the 
commercial market and New York and St. Louis note some recent 
increases in vacancy rates. However, office leasing has been 
relatively strong in New York, and Atlanta and Chicago both mention 
continuing strength in industrial construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions have improved in much of the nation. 
Minneapolis reports that both wheat and barley production were 
double last year's level and Kansas City report that corn and 
soybean yields were generally normal. Most of the winter wheat crop 
in Kansas City is in good condition though dry weather could present 
some problems. San Francisco, Chicago and St. Louis report an 
increase in agricultural exports, and farmland values continue to 
rise in Chicago and Minneapolis. Dallas reports that drought 
persists in south Texas and along the Gulf coast and that cattlemen 
have reduced herds. However, in the northern part of the Dallas 
district, winter wheat planting and the corn harvest are both on 
schedule.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among natural resources industries, exploration for natural gas is 
boosting drilling activity in Kansas City, and Dallas reports that 
the oil and gas industry is optimistic about expanding next year. 
Richmond notes that coal prices are strong and coal production in 
West Virginia has been at a record level. Minneapolis and Richmond 
report robust activity in the lumber industry, and the mining and 
metals industries are strong in San Francisco and Minneapolis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for commercial bank loans remains varied by type and among 
regions. San Francisco reports strong loan demand in most areas 
though the rate of growth seems to have slowed from its earlier 
robust pace. Bankers in both Kansas City and Philadelphia note a 
recent increase in total loan demand, with business, consumer and 
mortgage loans up in Kansas City but only business loans up in 
Philadelphia. Some types of consumer lending are still strong in 
Atlanta but commercial lending is down. Richmond reports an overall 
softness in demand affecting both business and consumer loans.
