      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fourth District continues to recover, 
albeit slowly, and business sources generally expect further 
improvement over the near term. Consumer spending has shown little 
sign of sustained strengthening, and retailers remain cautious about 
their order and inventory plans for the balance of the year. The 
revival in manufacturing continues to lead activity in the District, 
with the automotive and steel industries expecting their output this 
quarter to be the best of the year. Manufacturers' inventories are 
judged to be close to desired levels. Loan activity, except for 
mortgage refinancing, remains soft, and small businesses report 
credit is available.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Region
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recovery in the Fourth District continues slowly. Total employment 
in Ohio rose in September for the fifth of the last seven months. A 
further but slow expansion in employment is suggested in the latest 
Ohio composite index of leading indicators, which rose for the sixth 
consecutive month in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a recent survey of small businesses by a commercial bank in the 
District, nearly half of the 600 respondents expect business to 
improve further over the next three months, and a roughly similar 
proportion expect no change. Only 8 percent expect a worsening. 
Manufacturers are the most optimistic about the short-term outlook, 
while fewer then one-half of retail, finance and service respondents 
expect better conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is little indication of a step-up in retail sales, although 
several retailers believe that their sales have been better in the 
District than in some other regions. September sales fell from 
preceding months, resulting in some unwanted inventories, according 
to a few retailers. Some others believe that they were able to clear 
stocks of summer merchandise, and that their inventories are at 
about desired levels. Several complain about excess retail capacity, 
and do not expect much improvement in retail sales until employment 
and income improve. Consequently, they are cautious in purchase and 
inventory plans for the upcoming holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers contacted appear to be a little more optimistic about 
near-term sales prospects than they were late this summer. Several 
report that orders for new model cars have been slightly above a 
year ago. A late September, early-October rise in new car sales, 
apparently aided by widespread and generous price incentives, 
encouraged dealers who were concerned earlier that consumers might 
resist the latest price hikes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most manufacturers report a continuation of the recovery in output 
that began last spring. Auto producers are reported to be planning a 
higher rate of car production this quarter than last, although 
schedules of some producers have recently been trimmed because of 
fewer-than-expected dealer orders. Still, production plans include 
some inventory rebuilding in view of the lower than usual levels of 
car inventories for this time of year, but output will be closely 
geared to dealer orders, according to auto sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel mill operations in the District have been boosted in recent 
weeks to the best levels of the year because of the higher auto and 
appliance orders and some rebuilding of depleted steel inventories. 
Although the operating rate in the steel industry has climbed to a 
recent 77 percent of capacity nationally, some mills in the District 
are reporting operating rates in the mid-80s. A nearly-full order 
book for flat-rolled steel products has lengthened deliveries to 
late 1991 and early 1992. Steel warehouse centers have also stepped 
up orders, possibly because of the recently announced price 
increases that are expected to be sustained, following a declining 
trend in steel prices in recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in the tire industry has been mixed and less-than-expected, 
especially for original equipment tires. The weak market leads some 
producers to believe that the September tire price increases will 
not last very long.
     </p>
     <p>
      Generally, capital goods producers believe that the trough in their 
industries probably occurred in the spring, although revival has 
been slow. Machine tool builders complain that orders continue to 
drift downward, although at a reduced pace from earlier in the year. 
A supplier of industrial equipment to the machinery industries 
reports that orders bottomed last May, but have not improved enough 
to materially change operations. Orders for industrial controls also 
reached a trough in the spring quarter, and sales rebounded last 
quarter and are expected to rise even more this quarter, according 
to a large producer. Another capital goods manufacturer reports a 
slow revival in orders from a 1991:IQ recession low for both 
machinery and industrial consumable products. Finally, heavy-duty 
truck orders continue on a jagged, upward trend since early this 
year, according to a major supplier to this industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers' inventories are generally believed to be close to 
desired levels. Except for some spotty rebuilding in steel and tire 
inventories, however, most respondents do not anticipate much of a 
buildup of inventories in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is still little sign of a pickup in business or consumer 
installment loans, although further recent declines in mortgage 
rates have induced a revival in mortgage loan refinancing. In 
general, thrifts report that loan commitments outstanding during the 
late summer declined from earlier in the summer, and that loans for 
speculative building of single-family and multiple-family units are 
virtually non-existent. Depositories have continued to cut interest 
rates on deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks generally report no pickup in commercial and industrial loans, 
but installment loans have spurted for those banks that have offered 
rates competitive with auto finance companies. Some banks report 
they are still not soliciting new commercial construction loans, 
although inquiries have also "dried up" this summer, according to a 
lender that specializes in small commercial developments.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of small businesses in the District state that credit is 
available. lending standards have not tightened in recent months, 
although some report that banks appear to be less aggressive in 
seeking loans. They also believe that there is an adequate number of 
lenders available to small businesses in their regions. Auto dealers 
report that floor plan financing for 1992 models has not been more 
difficult to obtain, although some report that banks are looking 
more closely at their financial condition than in the past.
