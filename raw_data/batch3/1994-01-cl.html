      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 19, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       General Business Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The indicators of economic activity in the region remain decidedly 
positive. Employment, production, consumer spending, and credit 
demands all improved during the fourth quarter with considerable 
strength in the construction and industrial sectors. Capital goods 
producers in the District report continued strong growth in orders 
and production, despite softness in European markets. Although few 
manufacturers report plans to hire additional workers in the 
immediate fixture, many are operating at, or very near, capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Ohio, employment grew by nearly 3-1/2% in 1993, outpacing the 2% 
increase nationally. However, virtually all of the state's 
employment gains occurred during the final two months of the year. 
Jobs growth in Pennsylvania was a more moderate 1% last year. 
Unemployment in the District was just below the national rate (6.2% 
and 6.3% in Ohio and Pennsylvania, respectively, compared with 6.4% 
nationally). The jobless rates are all down about I percentage point 
from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Though showing increases for three consecutive months ending in 
October, manufacturing production growth in Ohio continued to trail 
the nation for the year as a whole, rising 3.3% compared with 5.1%. 
Purchasing managers report rising new orders and production through 
November. In Cleveland, 55% stated that new orders were higher 
during the month, compared with 29% in Cincinnati and 33% 
nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtually all of the District's major capital goods producers were 
reporting continued strong orders, particularly in the automotive 
area. However, defense-related cutbacks have been felt in the 
region, and export markets, particularly western Europe, have 
slackened considerably. The performance of the District's export 
markets remains an important question mark in the outlook for 1994. 
Nevertheless, domestic capital-goods demand remains very strong, and 
most firms were thought to be operating near capacity. All of the 
producers we contacted noted rising backlogs.
     </p>
     <p>
      While some manufacturers indicated little upward price pressure, 
most were reporting higher costs, particularly for materials such as 
steel scrap, and many expected planned 1994 price increases to 
stick.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonauto retail sales in the Fourth District continue to outperform 
the nation. Most observers say consumer attitudes were better this 
year than last, and consumers were more willing to use credit cards 
or to finance purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Somewhat in contrast to the 1992 holiday season, much of the recent 
increase in Ohio retail activity appears to have occurred at 
department stores, although performance varied considerably by 
establishment. While discounters and off-price stores achieved small 
sales gains, and furniture and appliance stores did well, only 
specialty retailers seemed to actually lose sales on a year-over-
year basis. Apparel sales here, as nationally, were noted to be 
particularly weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers are still reporting thin profit margins-many reduced 
prices significantly prior to Christmas. Although retailers were not 
caught short on inventory this holiday season (as most were last 
year), many described stocks as merely adequate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers appear to be optimistic about consumer spending this year. 
Even apparel sellers believe that retail sales will likely 
strengthen in the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District motor vehicle dealers are considerably merrier than 
they were a year ago with year-end sales, profit margins, and 
inventory positions all reported to be improved. Although the end of 
the year has traditionally been slow for motor vehicle sales, many 
District auto dealers reported double-digit increases over 1992. The 
strongest postings belong to the domestic model dealers, although 
sales of Japanese models were also significantly higher. Dealers 
note that sales gains are being achieved with fewer price discounts 
than in the previous few years, and many managers report that profit 
margins are up and that buyers are seeking more options.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dealers cite a variety of reasons for their strong year-end 
performance. Most say that improved income and jobs prospects 
resulted an more consumer optimism than at any time since the 
recession. Domestic model manufacturers say that price increases on 
many of the 1994 models have been modest and that interest rates 
continue to be very favorable. Leasing is still a popular option.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demands around the District were apparently rising at year's 
end, with virtually every major credit category showing some 
improvement. While refinancing activity is still high, it seems to 
have dropped off a bit during the last several weeks. Net new loan 
activity, even for mortgages, was reported to have improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer loan demand was characterized as solid, particularly for 
automobiles. The overall increase in consumer borrowing furthers a 
strengthening pattern that became evident last summer. Commercial 
credit is reported to have picked up surprisingly in the fourth 
quarter, although some of the improvement may be a result of 
increased floor-plan activity due to the rise in retail sales.
