      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District business community in early October 
suggest that overall economic activity has been slower recently than 
it was in late summer. Manufacturers indicated that business was 
still moving up, but at a slower pace than in previous months. 
Retailers reported that sales remained sluggish, and auto dealers 
said sales were very slow. Bankers noted a continuing decline in 
business lending and some said that consumer lending, which had been 
steady through the summer, turned down in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook is mixed. Manufacturers continue to express a high level 
of optimism, while the view ahead is dim in other sectors. Retailers 
do not expect to post real gains in sales for this year's fourth 
quarter compared to last year's. Auto dealers are pessimistic for 
the new model year. Bankers anticipate a continuing downward trend 
in financing activity for both businesses and households. Many 
business contacts cite low confidence as a deterrent to expanded 
spending by firms and consumers, and they say the factors required 
to restore confidence are less restrictive conditions for business 
credit and a healthier employment situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing
A majority of Third District manufacturers contacted in early 
October reported that business was running at a steady pace. Based 
on these reports, it appeared that shipments from area plants were 
increasing slightly, on balance, while new orders were declining 
marginally. Approximately half of the manufacturers surveyed said 
they were cutting inventories and one-third indicated they were 
maintaining them at stable levels. Employment appeared to be 
somewhat weaker than in recent months; although approximately two-
thirds of the industrial firms contacted were holding to steady 
employment and working hours, nearly one-fourth were cutting 
payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although recent indications are that the upward trend in the 
region's goods-producing sector was slackening, most of the 
manufacturers polled for this report were optimistic that further 
improvement is likely. Three-fourths expect increases in orders 
during the next six months and two-thirds anticipate stepping up 
shipments. Despite these forecasted gains in output, employment 
plans at plants in the Third District call for no change in the work 
forces, on balance, although a small increase in hours is possible. 
Capital spending could get a boost as one-third of the firms 
surveyed indicated they will increase expenditures for plant and 
equipment over the next six months while half will hold to steady 
rates of spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally indicated that sales in September 
were just even with or slightly below the level of last September, 
in current dollars. The year-over-year comparison appeared to be 
relatively better for discount stores than for department and 
specialty stores--except for toy stores, where there were some 
reports of good sales growth. Most store executives said they were 
satisfied that their inventories were in line with current and 
expected sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District merchants contacted for this report generally did not 
expect any improvement in the pace of sales in October, and they 
were nearly unanimous in giving very subdued forecasts for the 
Christmas shopping season. The consensus of expectations is that the 
best that can be hoped for is flat or very slightly better sales, in 
dollar terms, this year compared to last. Some retailers suggested 
that solid improvement will not take hold until next spring at the 
earliest. They describe the consumer as reluctant to step up 
spending while the economic outlook remains uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most auto dealers reported that unit sales in September were well 
down from a year ago, and many said sales were the lowest in many 
years for the month of September. Even dealers who managed to 
achieve steady unit sales said dollar sales were insufficient to 
maintain profit margins. In general, dealers' forecasts for the 1992 
model year are very pessimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers reported that total loan volume outstanding 
continued to decline in September and early October, with declines 
in business and consumer credit and near stability in real estate 
based loans. Commercial and industrial lending continued to fall 
off, according to bankers, as a result of low loan demand and banks' 
conservative approach to new business lending. Consumer loan volume 
outstanding has varied week-to-week recently, but most of the 
bankers contacted for this report said the trend has been down. 
Several bank executives said they believe consumers are making 
efforts to pay down debt, especially on credit cards. In contrast, 
revolving home equity credit volume has been stable and outstandings 
for other real estate lending have been virtually steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers generally believe the current downward trend in lending will 
continue until confidence is restored among businesses and 
consumers. Some bank loan officers noted weakening financial 
condition in the small business sector that portends a decline in 
financing activity at these types of firms. Nonetheless, a 
stabilization or turnaround is possible for business lending in 
general, according to some bankers, if interest rates fall further. 
These bankers said that lower rates could encourage some of their 
potential borrowers to implement investment plans. A turnaround in 
consumer loan demand is dependent on an improved employment 
situation and a return of consumer confidence, in the view of most 
Third District bankers.
