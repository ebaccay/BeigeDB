      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 30, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of expansion in the Second District's economy may have 
slowed somewhat since the last report. The latest purchasing 
managers' surveys continue to show most firms reporting improved to 
stable conditions, but a smaller share than in recent reports, and 
some department stores have recently experienced an over-the-year 
decline in sales. The pace of homebuilding remains slow for the most 
part, but a pickup occurred in commercial real estate activity. 
Commercial and industrial loan demand at small and medium-sized 
banks in the District has been slow to moderate, though a few loan 
officers reported some strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of sales at District retail stores was quite varied in 
recent weeks. Two retail chains reported that October sales declined 
from a year earlier although some improvement occurred as the month 
progressed. On the other hand, one chain had a large over-the-year 
gain which was attributed primarily to increased promotionals this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reflecting the differing sales results, reactions were also mixed 
concerning the level of inventories and the ability to meet sales 
targets. Those retailers with sales below plan and excessive 
inventories intend somewhat more aggressive promotionals in the 
weeks ahead, while others anticipate no change in strategy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of our contacts reported some pickup in sales of women's 
apparel from the slow pace earlier this year, and some noted that 
unusually cool weather spurted outerwear sales as well. With regard 
to the outlook, retailers are moderately optimistic about the 
upcoming holiday season but generally do not anticipate large over-
the-year gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent purchasing managers' reports suggest some slowing of the 
District's economic expansion occurred in recent weeks. In both 
Buffalo and Rochester the percentage of purchasing managers 
reporting improved business conditions declined, and the percentage 
reporting a worsening increased. Nonetheless, by far the majority of 
firms-90 percent in Rochester and 85 percent in Buffalo-continue to 
report stable to improved conditions, and those in the Rochester 
survey anticipated little change over the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates in the District remain below the national average 
with October readings of 4.2 percent in New York and 3.9 percent in 
New Jersey. As was true nationally, rates in the District have 
fluctuated within a fairly narrow range the past several months. The 
October-to-October rate decline in New York was virtually the same 
as the national average, but in New Jersey where last October's rate 
was already very low, the year-to-year decrease was slight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Few new major projects were announced in the District since the last 
report. However, western New York was buoyed by some recent 
developments. Two "upscale" New York City department stores 
announced plans to make their Buffalo area debut in a new shopping 
mall now under construction there-further indication of Buffalo's 
comeback from its earlier loss of several manufacturing firms. In 
addition, a major supermarket chain plans to open three large 
superstores in Buffalo and Niagara Falls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of homebuilding in the Second District remains slow for the 
most part though some upstate New York communities continue to 
report strength. In the Fort Drum area, for example, builders are 
busy on both military and nonmilitary housing and activity around 
Buffalo exceeds the year-earlier level. In most of the District, 
however, activity has been subdued, with home prices remaining high 
and the resale market slow as a result. Several plans for affordable 
and retirement housing have recently been unveiled, though, and 
these could help reactivate the housing market to some extent next 
spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pickup occurred in District commercial real estate activity 
recently. During October the midtown Manhattan market experienced 
its highest level of leasing activity since July 1986, and downtown 
Manhattan also registered more strength than had been seen since the 
stock market crash. The pace of leasing activity has also been 
moderate to good in other parts of the District. However, vacancy 
rates have shown little change because of a sizable supply of office 
space coming on line in many areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial and industrial loan demand at small and medium-sized 
banks in the Second District is currently reported as slow to 
moderate, though a few loan officers report some strength. Those who 
have witnessed a slackening attribute it to seasonal factors and to 
concern about the economy, particularly the budget and trade 
deficits. One officer stated that in an environment of uncertainty, 
borrowers are reluctant to take on additional debt. Most respondents 
said that the increased level of interest rates in recent months has 
had little effect on business loan demand. The bankers anticipate 
that conditions at their banks will hold constant into early next 
year. Business loan portfolios at these banks currently consist 
almost solely of short- to intermediate-term loans, the definition 
of which varies among respondents, but is generally less than five 
years. Recent changes in the mix of short- versus long-term loans 
favored the former. All of the respondents stated that their banks 
had not purchased any of the merger and acquisition loans which are 
now on the secondary market. One officer commented that the pricing 
of these loans was not attractive enough to entice smaller banks to 
learn about the unfamiliar new packages.
