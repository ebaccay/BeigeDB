     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pattern of economic activity in the Fourth District has changed 
little since the last Beigebook. District employment rose slightly 
in May, although manufacturing employment was unchanged. Cars and 
soft goods continue to sell well, while big ticket department store 
hardgoods are beginning to recover from weak sales in mid-spring. 
Manufacturing production remains flat, with output strong in 
automobiles and weak in steel. Firms continue emphasis on cost-
cutting modernization rather than expansion. Multi-family 
residential construction remains volatile because of tax law 
uncertainty while office construction is being reduced because of 
excess space. Business loan demand has been flat while real estate 
and consumer installment loan demand has been good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ohio's unemployment rate fell from 9.0 percent sa to 7.7 percent sa 
in May. A slight rise in employment was accompanied by a large drop 
in the labor force, which is a phenomenon not witnessed in ten years 
of data. Therefore, some analysts agree with the direction but not 
with the magnitude reported. Pockets of high unemployment in the 
District in many cases are attributable to continuing weakness in 
mining and agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retailers report continued sales growth, although 
most mention brief periods of weakness in early May. Car sales 
remain strong. Dealers continue to have problems stocking popular 
domestic models and report no excess inventories. Import dealers 
have had an especially difficult time obtaining cars. Some dealers 
feel the market is becoming more competitive, but most think little 
additional discounting is possible. Although some consumers 
purchased new cars in April and May specifically because of below-market interest rates that recently ended, dealers expect strong 
sales to continue as long as rates in general do not rise and 
personal income does not falter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to auto dealers, department stores report that sales of 
big-ticket items like furniture and appliances have been weak since 
mid-April. These items are beginning to recover and retailers 
believe this may be due to the arrival of tax refunds. Apparel and 
other soft goods continued to move exceedingly well and sellers 
expect this trend to continue. Retailers are optimistic about the 
rest of 1985. Inventories are at desired levels and most stores do 
not expect to cut prices further. They hope to recover some of their 
margins lost to earlier discounting by a continued drop in their 
costs for some goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Investment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of manufacturing firms in the midwest indicates new orders 
are increasing slightly faster than in the first quarter but 
inventories are being decreased. Planned capital spending in 1985 
exceeds the amount spent in 1984 but by a substantially smaller 
margin than in the March survey. Surveys of manufacturing firms in 
the Cincinnati and Cleveland areas show little change in production, 
new orders and inventories. The consensus of the three surveys is 
that prices paid and received are changing very little.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers of automobiles and automobile and truck parts report 
that their capital spending is almost entirely for modernization 
rather than expansion of capacity. Even when a new plant is built it 
is usually to replace an old, inefficient plant. One manufacturer of 
truck parts reports that orders are being stretched out but not 
cancelled. The firm's cash flow is weakening, so the firm may cut 
back its spending on plant and equipment. Despite a sharp increase 
in imports, an auto producer will not cut prices because it is 
operating at full capacity. Major steel producers continue in 
distress. Prices remain soft, imports high, and profits low or 
negative. Most major steel producers are reducing their costs but
the benefits seem to go into lower prices rather than higher profit 
margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing market participants expect a moderate rebound in housing 
activity in this District during the second and third quarters. As a 
result of a substantial recovery in listings and closings, realtors 
have cancelled previous plans to scale down operations. Although 
builders expect at least a two-quarter housing rebound, they have 
positioned themselves to minimize downside risk and thus will forego 
potential profits if the housing reversal is stronger or longer than 
anticipated. Mortgage lenders are less optimistic than realtors 
about the duration and strength of the rebound. Builders expect 
volatility in multi-family housing to continue in this District 
until there is less uncertainty over tax-reform legislation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office construction in the District's major cities has been robust 
since 1980, resulting in an oversupply of office space. 
Consequently, all of this District's major cities are currently 
experiencing a substantial downtrending or complete stoppage in new 
contracts for office construction, which is expected to persist over 
the next three to four years. Generally speaking, the office 
construction market is best characterized as an "orderly buyers' 
market," inasmuch as prices are being discounted 10 percent to 20 
percent but suppliers are not panicky.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District loan demand has been mixed with loan outstandings at large 
banks registering a slight decline over the past month. Business 
loan demand has been flat, and contacts anticipate continued 
softness for commercial and industrial credit into the Summer. On 
the other hand, the demand for real estate and consumer installment 
loans has been quite good, and contacts expect consumer loan demand 
to remain relatively strong, particularly with lower and falling 
interest rates.
