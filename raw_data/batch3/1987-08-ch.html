      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity in the Seventh District continues to expand. 
Contacts appear more optimistic about the near-term outlook. 
Purchasing managers in Chicago and Milwaukee reported further 
improvement in June. Total employment growth in District states from 
the end of 1986 to May about equaled that in the U.S., seasonally 
adjusted. District steel mills are operating at capacity for some 
products and at high levels for others. In response to slower car 
sales and high inventories, auto makers have cut production, but 
truck sales and output are strong. Contacts continue to report 
rising demand for some types of business equipment. Nonresidential 
construction is slowing in some areas, including Chicago suburbs, 
but continues strong in downtown Chicago and in Michigan. 
Residential construction has trailed 1986 since the strong first 
quarter, and the rest of 1987 is projected at a high level but below 
last year. Retail sales of seasonal merchandise have been boosted by 
hot weather, and home improvement products are also reported selling 
well. Farmland values are edging upward, reversing a six-year 
decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Managers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Chicago and Milwaukee purchasing managers' reports show continued 
expansion in activity through June. Both groups report further 
increases in output, orders, and inventories, accompanied by rising 
prices. The Chicago report indicates slower growth of orders than 
earlier in the year with backlogs and employment unchanged after 
earlier increases. Milwaukee, in contrast, saw faster growth of 
orders and backlogs, and rising employment. Both reports have been 
more favorable this year than in 1985 and 1986, with the improvement 
particularly sharp in Milwaukee.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Chicago-area steel mills are operating at capacity for sheet 
products used in the automotive, appliance, and construction 
industries. Production of structural steel has slowed but by less 
than usual in the third quarter. The market for steel plate has 
tightened. Steel service centers have been setting sales records. 
Price increases have continued to be reported for various steel 
products, reflecting improved demand from some sectors, rebuilding 
of low inventories, lower imports in response to higher prices for 
foreign steel and the Administration's trade restraint program, and 
cuts in domestic steelmaking capacity due to plants being closed in 
recent years and not reopened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As expected, extended shutdowns for model changeovers are being 
scheduled in the auto industry to cut inventories. Car sales have 
continued to trail last year's levels. Permanent as well as 
temporary cutbacks in auto production are having a particularly 
sharp impact on industrial activity in southeast Michigan, where the 
industry is heavily concentrated. However, a knowledgeable contact 
thinks forecasts of a Michigan recession with double-digit 
unemployment in 1987 or 1988 are unduly pessimistic. Buyers continue 
to substitute vans and other light trucks for cars. Sales of heavy 
trucks are strong. A supplier projects a 16 percent rise in 
production of heavy trucks this year, to 4 percent above 1985. In 
contrast with cutbacks in car output, an Indiana truck plant is 
adding a second shift and 1,100 workers. Unions are expected to 
emphasize job security in negotiations on new contracts in the 
industry; management is expected to prefer bonus or profit-sharing 
plans over increases in base pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports indicate rising demand for various types of equipment, but 
continued weakness in other lines. A producer of diesel engines is 
working overtime to fill orders from truck makers, and backlogs have 
increased. Demand for diesels from other sectors is a little 
stronger, except from makers of farm equipment. A steel supplier is 
seeing increased orders from makers of railcars (up from a very low 
level), construction equipment, and pressure vessels used in the 
chemical process industry. Buying of machine tools, volatile from 
month to month, remains weak, hurt by auto industry cutbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contracts for construction of nonresidential buildings in the 
District, in square feet, during the first half of 1987 were about 
even with last year. A further sizable rise in Michigan was about 
offset by a large decline in Illinois. Commercial construction 
continues strong in downtown Chicago. New large buildings continue 
to be announced, additional structures are being planned, and more 
announcements are expected. Commercial building has slowed 
substantially in Chicago suburbs. A steelmaker notes an upturn in 
buying of pipe for use in oil and gas well drilling, and strength in 
construction of gas pipelines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction contracts for residences in the District states during 
the first half were above a year earlier, in contrast with the U.S., 
which was lower. However, the rise in the District was entirely in 
the first quarter, helped by unusually mild weather. Higher mortgage 
interest rates since late March and uncertainties over possible 
future rate declines have caused potential home buyers to wait. 
Mortgage rates have eased since May, to 10 percent or a little 
lower, for 30-year fixed-rate loans. Inventories of used homes for 
sale in the Chicago area are low, and lending activity has slowed. A 
number of housing projects are expected to start soon in this area. 
Residential building for the rest of the year is expected to stay at 
a high level but below 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Chain Store Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Exceptionally hot weather has encouraged buying of seasonal 
merchandise, according to a contact at a large retailer. Sales of 
home improvement items have been doing well. Higher prices, 
particularly for women's and other apparel, have added to the dollar 
volume of sales. These higher prices are attributed less to the fall 
in the dollar than to bilateral trade agreements sharply limiting 
growth of U.S. apparel imports from Asian countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Preliminary results from our latest survey of agricultural banks 
show that, on average, District farmland values rose about 1.5 
percent in the second quarter. Banks from each of the five District 
states reported on increase. This marks the second consecutive 
quarter of modest increases, reversing the six-year slide that 
extended through 1986.
