      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Analysts in the District generally expect further moderate economic 
expansion, nationally, in 1986. Our information on District 
conditions suggests that this region will continue to trail the US. 
Auto and light truck output will remain strong early in 1986. Heavy 
truck sales and production have declined. Steel production continues 
weak overall, but may be helped by tighter restraints on imports. 
Weak demand has persisted for most types of mechanical capital goods 
produced in the District. Construction, residential and 
nonresidential, continues vigorous in the District relative to 
recent years, but well below good levels of the 1970s. Backlogs will 
support nonresidential building activity near recent levels well 
into 1986. Consumer spending for general merchandise, through early 
January, is viewed as disappointing. Although the District's 
agricultural situation remains bleak, farm commodity prices have 
risen in recent months from low levels, federal farm income and 
price support programs have been extended, and the rate of decline 
in land values has slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook for the District
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recovery in economic activity in the District has generally trailed 
the U.S. over the past 3 years. This pattern appears likely to 
continue in 1986. The star performer in the District, since the end 
of recession in 1982, has been motor vehicles, but further expansion 
in this sector in 1986, if any, probably will be small. Surveys 
suggest that investment spending for capital goods produced in the 
District will be sluggish in 1986. Steel production, heavily 
concentrated here, may benefit somewhat if import restraints are 
tightened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto production plans for early 1986 suggest a good level, about the 
same as last year. But strong car sales increasingly are dependent 
on cut-rate financing and other inducements, as in the current 
round. One respected District analyst expects a small decline, about 
2 percent, in total unit auto sales in calendar year 1986. Domestic 
makers may experience greater pressure than this if the Japanese 
"voluntary" quota on auto exports to the U.S. is enlarged or ended 
after March 31. Truck sales have been setting records, but strength 
is mainly in light trucks, with imports up most strongly. Sales of 
heavy trucks have weakened in the last half of 1985, but may have 
stabilized.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With inventories reduced to very low levels and imports below last 
year, steel prices have been firming. The lower value of the dollar 
and efforts to curb imports seem to be having some effect. Demand 
for steel remains generally slow, with 1986 expected to be similar 
to 1985. Strength is concentrated mainly in motor vehicles, light 
construction, and service centers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for most types of mechanical capital goods has remained weak, 
but did not deteriorate further in 1985. An exception is farm 
equipment, which continued to decline. In 1986, cuts in capital 
spending are expected for electric power generating equipment, 
mining equipment, and oil and gas development. Sales of food 
processing machinery have picked up slightly. A new wave of paper 
plant construction is reported to be getting underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity in the District was hampered more than 
normally in November and December by bad weather. Contract backlogs 
for commercial buildings, highways, and apartments are large in the 
Chicago area. This work is proceeding in 1986. Demand for Chicago-
area smaller manufacturing buildings has about exhausted the 
overhang of good, well-located unsold units. Among District states, 
the rise in nonresidential construction contracts in 1985 was 
strongest in Michigan, while Iowa showed essentially no growth. 
Nonresidential construction in the District is still well below 
levels of the late 1970s, compared with an increase in the U.S.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing construction continued to increase in most District centers 
in 1985, while the U.S. probably was flat to down slightly. But the 
pace of residential construction in the District as a whole is only 
about half of good levels of the late 1970s. In recent months, 
expansion has been strongest in Michigan, while activity has slipped 
further from low levels in Iowa. Existing home sales have been 
vigorous in the Chicago area, with little price appreciation. Fixed-
rate, 30-year mortgages are being quoted by Chicago-area lenders 
with nominal interest rates as low as 10 1/2 percent, low compared 
with levels of the past 6 years. Adjustable-rate loans are being 
offered with first-year rates down to around 8 1/2 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Large District retailers report that December sales, on a same-store 
basis, were flat to up slightly. An industry analyst described 
December and early January sales as disappointing and slow. 
Inventories have been kept low, and sales may have been hampered as 
a result. Catalog stock-outs were high (in-store sales lost due to 
low stocks cannot be measured). Appliance sales have been strong, 
especially home laundry, ranges, and refrigerators. Sales of 
microwave ovens, which have soared in recent years, are believed to 
have peaked in 1985. Inventories of appliances are in good balance 
except for a sizable stock of room air conditioners left over from a 
cool summer. Airline fare wars have intensified, with little 
response in terms of added traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent developments have cast a more favorable light on an otherwise 
bleak picture for the District's agricultural sector. Federal 
legislation enacted December 23 extends farm income and price 
support programs for five more years and paves the way for financial 
assistance to the troubled Farm Credit System. Problems in the most 
troubled district of the FCS—Omaha, which serves Iowa—apparently 
have eased. Farm commodity prices, although still at low levels, 
have been on an uptrend in recent months. Crop prices in particular 
have been buoyed by record movements of grain under federal price 
support loans and by weather-related crop setbacks in the Southern 
Hemisphere. Land values in the District continued to decline in the 
fourth quarter, but the rate of decline apparently slowed. Observers 
increasingly believe land markets may bottom in 1986.
