      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall District business conditions improved slightly in recent 
weeks, although activity in many sectors remained sluggish. Retail 
sales increased somewhat, but manufacturing was unchanged. Activity 
at District ports was mixed. Residential real estate continued to 
improve, but commercial real estate was lackluster. Credit 
conditions were unchanged at District financial institutions, while 
state tax collections showed strength in most jurisdictions. In 
agriculture, fall harvesting neared completion in most areas of the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer Spending
Our regular survey indicated that retail activity strengthened 
somewhat in recent weeks. Shopper traffic and sales, excluding big-
ticket items, apparently increased, as did wholesale and retail 
prices. No change was reported in employment or capital 
expenditures. Wages generally were unchanged, although a few 
respondents indicated that wages rose.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers were upbeat about recent business conditions and foresaw 
improved prospects for the next six months. Respondents said general 
business activity increased both in their areas and in the United 
States. Looking ahead, retailers expected increases in most 
indicators, especially sales and shopper traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers indicated that District factory activity held steady 
during the past month. Respondents noted little change in most 
indicators, although they reported lower levels of order backlogs 
and apparently paid higher prices for raw materials. Respondents 
cited government regulation as the most important problem they 
faced.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers were sanguine about their prospects for the next six 
months. Increases in most indicators were anticipated, but raw 
materials inventories and the number of workers were expected to be 
unchanged. Finished goods inventories were expected to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports--Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk)--reported that imports were higher in 
October than in September while exports were generally lower. 
Compared to a year ago, import activity was generally higher and 
export activity remained about the same. During the next six months, 
exports were expected to increase at Charleston but to remain 
unchanged at Baltimore and Hampton Roads.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the District indicated that 
tourist activity in November was unchanged from October but was 
below year-ago levels. About half of the respondents reported that 
fall bookings were about even with a year ago while most other 
respondents reported declines. Regarding the outlook for the next 
several months, respondents were evenly divided between those who 
expected tourist activity to improve and those who expected activity 
to be unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone indicated 
that credit conditions were little changed over the last six weeks. 
Respondents stated that both commercial and consumer loan demand 
were steady. Rates on commercial loans were unchanged while those on 
consumer loans were lower. Banks noted that mortgage loan rates 
Increased recently and that home mortgage activity slowed because of 
lessened home refinancings. Some nonbank institutions continued to 
report that stringent examination standards hampered their ability 
to lend to creditworthy customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of realtors suggested that activity in the 
residential market continued to improve in most of the District, 
although increased buyer apprehension apparently slowed activity in 
some areas. Home prices remained steady. New home sales were 
stronger than existing home sales in the Carolinas and in the 
Washington, D.C. area, while the reverse occurred elsewhere in the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the commercial real estate market generally remained 
sluggish, but realtors indicated that leasing activity improved. 
Vacancy rates in the office and retail markets fell slightly because 
of the absorption of existing space. In the Columbia, South Carolina 
area, several new shopping centers were under construction, but 
little new commercial development was reported elsewhere.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Government Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tax revenues continued to grow in District states according to 
forecasters contacted by telephone. In several states, tax analysts 
suggested that Income tax withholding collections were running at 
higher levels than state employment figures would suggest, which 
indicated that state employment figures may have understated actual 
job growth. Several tax forecasters reported increases in tax 
collections from retail and real estate sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Forestry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Analysts reported that crop conditions improved in recent weeks. 
Favorable weather allowed completion of fall harvesting across most 
of the District, although rain continued to hamper activity in South 
Carolina. Preliminary estimates indicated record or near-record corn 
yields.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumber industry contacts reported strong demand and prices for 
hardwood lumber. Furniture manufacturers, both in the United States 
and abroad, apparently were the primary source of the increased 
demand. Industry contacts indicated that lumber prices rose in 
response to stronger demand and tougher government regulations on 
lumber suppliers.
