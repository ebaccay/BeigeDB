      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District business conditions generally weakened in recent weeks. 
Tourism during the first month of summer was not as strong as in 
past summers. Retail sales fell, but retail inventories were 
essentially unchanged. Manufacturing activity softened, and 
manufacturers' optimism about future prospects waned somewhat. Price 
increases were widespread—for producer inputs and for wholesale and 
retail merchandise. Activity at District ports was mostly unchanged. 
Bankers reported lower interest rates and steady loan demand but a 
decline in the quality of loan applications. In agriculture, crop 
conditions improved and District lenders said they were seeking new 
agricultural loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated that summer tourist activity has been lower this 
year than in the last several years. About two-thirds of the 
respondents reported a decline in tourism while about one-fourth 
noted little change. Respondents attributed the decreases in 
activity to the mid-week July 4th holiday and the sluggish economy. 
About half of those contacted said that their August bookings were 
even with last year's while 40 percent reported declines. One-third 
of the respondents expect tourist activity to decline in coming 
months; one-fourth look for an improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to our regular mail survey of District retailers indicated 
that sales in the first two weeks of July were slightly lower than 
in the last half of June. About 40 percent of the retailers reported 
that their sales were down while about one-third said they were 
higher. Big ticket sales as a share of total sales slipped in early 
July from June levels; 40 percent of the retailers reported declines 
while four percent reported increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of merchandise rose while inventory levels were mostly 
unchanged over the period. Almost half of the respondents reported 
that they had raised their prices in the past month, and nearly 60 
percent indicated that they had paid higher prices for goods at 
wholesale.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey showed that District manufacturing activity 
slowed in early July from early June. More respondents indicated 
decreases than increases in shipments, new orders, order backlogs, 
the length of workweek, and the number of employees. In our last 
survey, these categories had been mostly unchanged. Inventories of 
materials fell while inventories of finished goods rose slightly. On 
a more positive note, new orders for exports rose somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      When asked to indicate the most important problem facing their 
firms, more than half of the respondents identified poor sales. Poor 
sales seem to be particularly pronounced in the textile and 
furniture industries. One textile firm said weak sales had pushed 
profits down, and another noted that several textile plants had 
closed this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers' views of current conditions in the national 
economy mirrored their own business activity. Almost two-fifths of 
the respondents said they believed economic activity in the nation 
had declined compared to a month ago. Looking forward, respondents 
remained optimistic but were somewhat less so than earlier this 
year. A majority still expect increases over the next six months in 
their shipments, new orders, the workweek, and new orders for 
exports. They look for backlogs of orders to be unchanged, but 
expect inventories of materials and of finished goods to shrink. 
Over one-third expect national economic activity to increase in the 
next six months while 27 percent look for a decline. In our June 
survey, however, 80 percent expected the nation's economy to turn up 
in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There was little change in port activity overall in the District. 
Reports received from the three major District ports--Hampton Roads 
(Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimore--showed exports were higher in 
June than in May at Charleston, lower at Hampton Roads and about the 
same at Baltimore. June export activity was also mixed compared to a 
year ago with shipments higher at Hampton Roads and unchanged at 
Baltimore and Charleston. Imports rose in June from May levels at 
Hampton Roads and Charleston but fell at Baltimore. June import 
activity was about the same as a year ago at both Baltimore and 
Charleston, but lower at Hampton Roads. Port representatives expect 
the ratio of exports to imports to rise during the next six months 
at Hampton Roads, fall at Charleston and remain unchanged at 
Baltimore.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by phone reported that 
loan activity had been steady since mid-July. Slightly more 
institutions reported increases than decreases in loan applications 
since mid-July, and respondents expect their lending to pick up in 
the weeks to come. Almost 40 percent of those contacted, however, 
said that the quality of loan applications had fallen over the past 
month, and only one respondent reported better quality applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reductions in interest rates were reported by many respondents and 
most expect further reductions in the weeks ahead. Lower interest 
rates on loans were reported by 46 percent of the respondents and 
none reported higher rates. About three-fourths of those surveyed 
expect the rates they charge on loans to decline in the near future 
and none look for rate increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Widespread rainfall in July brought relief to District crops that 
had been severely stressed by June's heat and drought. In most areas 
crops were recently rated in generally good condition, although in 
some parts of South Carolina they were still short of moisture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Preliminary results from a July 1 survey of District agricultural 
lenders show that over three-fourths of the respondents were 
actively seeking new farm loans. Four-fifths of the respondents said 
that the availability of funds was greater than usual at their 
institutions, but 28 percent characterized loan demand as less than 
usual compared to eight percent who reported it to be greater than 
usual.
