      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       June 17, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>

      Summary
Economic activity in the Fourth District continues to expand slowly. 
District respondents believe that economic growth will be sustained 
in both the District and the nation, despite the recent slowdown in 
retail sales and housing. Retailers attribute the flatness in May 
and early June sales to unseasonably cool weather. Manufacturing 
output has been reviving and is expected to strengthen further next 
quarter as a result of inventory rebuilding and a broad-based pickup 
in capital goods and automotive industries. New mortgage loan 
activity eased in May and early June, following a stronger-than-seasonal rise earlier this year, and business loan demand is shoving 
only scattered signs of strengthening.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in the District continues to be mild and uneven, but 
respondents expect a stepped-up pace of business over the next few 
months, led especially by manufacturing. In Ohio, the unemployment 
rate rose to 7.3 percent in May, because the labor force increased 
more than employment. The composite leading indicator for the state 
rose for the third straight month in March, which suggests to some 
analysts that the pace of activity in coming months will accelerate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nationally, total output is forecast to increase at about a 3 
percent rate accompanied by a similar rate of inflation, from 
1992:IIIQ to the end of 1993, according to the June survey of Fourth 
District economists. The group anticipates a gradually improving 
consumer sector, but has shaded predictions for nonresidential 
construction from last January because of a longer-term correction 
in commercial building.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer Spending 
Retail sales in May and early June were generally flat, but several 
retailers believe that the unusually cool weather this spring has 
dampened sales of seasonal goods, including women's and men's 
apparel and garden supplies. Some are concerned that inventories of 
seasonal merchandise may expand more than desired, which will result 
in greater-than-usual clearance sales before and after the July 4 
holiday. Nevertheless, most retailers believe that consumer spending 
will continue on a slowly rising trend through the balance of the 
year. Except for the disappointing showing of seasonal products, a 
large retail chain reports that sales of home furnishings and major 
appliances in the last two months have posted sizable year-over-year 
gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District respondents estimate that production in 1992:IIQ 
will rebound from declines in the last two quarters. Some of the 
revival is attributed to an ending of the runoff in inventories, and 
in some industries, to a slight rebuilding of stocks in response to 
improving sales. Only scattered recalls of workers who were laid off 
have taken place in recent months, and several manufacturers, while 
more optimistic about their sales outlook than earlier in the year, 
still have not lifted a freeze on hiring. More anticipate, however, 
that they will add rather than lay off workers in the third quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      A variety of "traditional" capital equipment producers report recent 
increases in profits, production, and orders, although unfilled 
orders have begun to increase in only a few industries. Producers of 
components for heavy-duty trucks, industrial controls, industrial 
equipment, and electrical motors and equipment all report a slowly 
reviving order book in recent months that is boosting production 
this quarter from last, and that is anticipated to support a 
somewhat stronger pace of industrial production next quarter than 
this.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers in the District estimate their operating rates at 
about 83 to 85 percent of capacity, which is a little better than 
their predictions for this quarter a few months ago. They note 
improving orders from the appliance, automotive, and steel warehouse 
centers, but demand for construction steel remains weak. A steel 
producer reports that higher domestic content in new cars and a 
higher share of domestic steel consumed by the transplant firms are 
supporting a rise in orders from the auto industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales and production in the third quarter are anticipated to 
rise to a 6.5 million to 6.7 million annual rate, and to a 7 million 
zone in the fourth quarter, according to some automotive analysts. 
Factory orders are said to be somewhat higher than dealer sales, 
although dealers contacted acknowledge that they will promptly cut 
back orders if sales prove to be slower than they now anticipate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lenders in the District report a less-than-seasonal increase in new 
mortgage loans in May and early June. Nevertheless, new loan 
applications are generally well ahead of the pace of a year earlier. 
A few major thrift institutions have recently lowered interest rates 
for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to 8-1/4 percent, and a few 
lenders are offering even lower rates. Mortgage loans for new and 
existing homes are said to be strong for houses in the $150,000 to 
$200,000 price range, but are described as being "very weak" for 
homes priced over $400,000. Loan refinancing has accounted for about 
20 percent of loans recently written, which is well below the 
proportion earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers contacted report growing loan demand for mortgage and home 
equity loans, but only scattered evidence of strengthening in 
commercial and industrial loans. Those few banks that are reporting 
slowly rising demand for business loans also expect an accelerating 
pace in the months ahead in response to an anticipated step-up in 
inventory building.
