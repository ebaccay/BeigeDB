      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions remain weak in California, but are improving 
moderately in other District states. In California, particularly in 
the south, cutbacks continue in aerospace and defense-related 
manufacturing, state government, and higher education. Tourism has 
also fallen in southern California following the Los Angeles riots. 
Outside of southern California, moderate improvement is reported in 
non-defense manufacturing, residential construction, retail trade, 
and agriculture. The strongest conditions remain in Utah and Idaho. 
Exports to Latin America and Pacific Rim countries are growing 
moderately, except to Japan where a weaker economy has reduced 
demand for several District products. Overall business sentiment has 
improved since our last report. Little upward pressure is reported 
in wages and prices, although the proportion of contacts expecting
lower inflation has decreased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expectations of Twelfth District business leaders improved 
since our last report. Over half of our respondents now expect the 
real economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate of at 
least 2.5 percent. This proportion is up from one-third in April. In 
contrast, almost no respondents expect output to decline during the 
next four quarters, compared to 5 percent in April and almost 33 
percent in January. Most respondents expect improvement in 
investment, consumer spending, and housing starts. Although few 
respondents expect inflation to accelerate, the proportion expecting 
a reduction in inflation has fallen to one-fifth from over one-half 
in late 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts report little upward pressure on wages and prices in 
District markets. Wage increases are reported in be in the 3 to 3.5 
percent range, with smaller increases reported for some public-
sector workers due to budget cutbacks. Price changes are reported to 
be modest except for health care and insurance. In California, 
gasoline prices in April were up 15 percent from a year earlier, 
partially as a result of new environmental restrictions. In Utah, 
gasoline prices were reported up about 10 cents a gallon since 
April. Aviation fuel prices, however, are reported down during the 
past two months. Lumber prices peaked in April and are now off one-
third. Standing timber prices, however, have not come down as much 
as end-use product prices. Prices of materials are reported stable 
or declining slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts with major retailing operations report gradual improvement 
in department and discount store sales across much of the District, 
but sluggish conditions in southern California. A contact in Idaho 
reports some increase in customer traffic for auto dealers, but 
continued "spotty" sales. Consolidation in the legal profession is 
beginning to taper off in Washington, with one contact projecting 
some moderate new hiring by the end of 1992. Demand for 
telecommunications services is weak, particularly in southern 
California. A media contact in California reports that advertising 
activity seems to be picking up, although it is still below last 
year's level. State government budget problems in California 
threaten layoffs of state workers and in public higher education. In 
Hawaii, tourism was down 6 percent in April from a year-earlier, 
driven by an 18 percent decline in mainland visitors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Violence in Los Angeles has led to the loss of over 5,000 retail 
jobs in the area. Over the longer-run, tourist activity is a major 
concern. Hotel occupancy rates have fallen and massive summer 
reservation cancellations are reported by some hotel managers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cutbacks in aerospace and defense-related industries continue across 
the District. Job reductions of 6,500 are projected for Boeing this 
year in Washington, and McDonnell Douglas has announced the closing 
of a 2000-worker production facility in southern California. Defense 
cutbacks have been felt even in the robust Idaho manufacturing 
sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of defense and aerospace, conditions are improving modestly. 
A machinery manufacturer in Utah reports that construction equipment 
sales are better this year, with only a few final sales lost due to 
recent labor disputes. Conditions in the electronics manufacturing 
sector are improving modestly, with no capacity constraints or 
inventory problems reported. Employment emphasis in electronics has 
switched from downsizing to holding steady. Pronounced weakness, 
however, is reported in orders from Japan for electronic components, 
leading to layoffs in Arizona. Continued demand for electronic 
components is reported from other Pacific-Rim nations. California 
high-tech firms exporting circuit boards and other electronic 
components are finding a strong market in Taiwan, where computer 
assembly work is active.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A contact in the timber industry reports that lumber and plywood 
sales are down, as are product prices, and that inventory levels are 
adequate-to-high. Orders for paper products and for boxes were 
strong in April and May. In early 1992, lumber exports were down 21 
percent from a year earlier, and shipments to Japan (America's 
largest overseas market) were off 22 percent. Exports of printing 
and writing paper, however, were up 30 percent. Exports of fishery 
products have improved somewhat, but overall demand and prices for 
seafood remain weak. New orders for export grain have slowed, but 
exports of other agricultural products to the Pacific Rim and Mexico 
are reported strong. Export demand from Japan, however, has fallen 
for produce and beef. Citrus fruit crops in California have 
rebounded strongly from last season's freeze damage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity varies substantially across 
District markets. Utah and Idaho are experiencing a boom in 
residential construction, with single-family starts up 39 and 65 
percent, respectively, in the first four months of 1992 from a year 
earlier. Home sales activity is reported mediocre-to-good in Alaska, 
but home construction is flat. In Arizona, a contact reports that 
while residential sales activity has risen during the past year, 
mortgage loan applications for new purchases have declined 
noticeably in recent weeks. In the Puget Sound area, residential 
real estate is characterized as improving slowly. Closed sales, 
however, declined markedly between February and April. In Hawaii, 
home sales are brisk in lower-end markets (below $350,000), but slow 
in more expensive markets. Bids for public sector construction 
projects in Hawaii are coming in much lower than anticipated. The 
housing market in California is reported mixed. New home 
construction remains relatively weak, while sales of new and 
existing homes have rebounded somewhat from the weak conditions of 
late 1991. Commercial real estate conditions remain depressed in 
southern California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, contacts in financial industries report slightly 
improving conditions. The banking industries in Utah and Idaho 
continue to enjoy favorable business conditions. Mortgage and 
consumer loan demand is very strong, while commercial loan demand is 
stable. A contact in California reports modest improvement in 
consumer and business loan demand, although overall loan demand 
remains weak. California savings and loans are experiencing an 
uptick in lending. Mortgage applications in the Puget Sound area 
have cooled from the refinance-driven pace, but are leveling out 
about eight percent ahead of last year. Loan demand in Oregon is 
reported strong for single-family mortgages. Financing for 
residential construction is reported available, but land development 
loans are difficult to find.
