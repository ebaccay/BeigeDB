      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy showed some modest improvement in 
recent weeks. Retailers had sales gains that were generally higher 
than expected end residential construction continued strong. 
Business activity was stable to improved, while some seasonal pickup 
in the demand for office space occurred. As the general level of 
interest rates has declined, small District banks report increased 
pressure to reduce their lending rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was stronger than expected at a number of District 
stores during August and September, and retailers reported sales 
gains well above target. Sales were bolstered by domestic tourists 
who continued visiting the District to view the refurbished Statue 
of Liberty, and by foreign buyers responding to the dollar's 
decline. As a result of strong sales, inventories are currently at 
or below desired levels in each of the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      During August, over-the-year sales growth in the District ranged 
from 10-20%, while September gains were in a 10-15% range. One 
retail chain attributed a better-than-average showing among its 
stores in the District to more favorable local weather and fewer 
major economic problems such as those currently affecting the farm 
and oil regions. Among those items generally cited as in strong 
demand recently were hone furnishings, men's and women's apparel, 
and various kinds of accessories.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to the outlook, a recent survey (conducted by a national 
accounting firm) of some 250 upstate retailers indicated widespread 
optimism concerning sales gains and control over inventories in the 
fall and holiday seasons.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The improved tone in the Second District's economy continued during 
recent weeks though few additional gains have been noted. Purchasing 
managers in the Rochester area, for example, report that their 
economy remains strong with 88 percent of them characterizing 
general business conditions as stable or improved in September. And 
in the Albany area, while some businessmen described the local 
economy as plateaued, others pointed to a pickup in business 
conditions during the third quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall employment has expanded further in the District, though the 
manufacturing sector continues to contract. The September 
unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey were 6.1 percent and 
4.7 percent, respectively, well below the national average. In 
addition, the over-the-year declines in the New York and New Jersey 
unemployment rates of half a percentage point surpassed the 0.1 
percentage point national decline. Concerning the future, with 
Congress currently debating whether or not to fund further 
production of jet trainer planes at Fairchild Republic, considerable 
apprehension exists among the 3500 Long Island employees whose jobs 
at that plant are at stake.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of activity among District homebuilders is still vigorous 
with apparently no letup in sight. Builders are encountering no 
shortage of buyers, though in some areas they continue to have 
difficulty in completing construction on time. Skilled labor remains 
in short supply in these areas and the problem may worsen since many 
summer workers have returned to college. Home prices continue rising 
and, reportedly as a result, for the first time in several years 
some upstate builders are engaged in speculative construction. Since 
demand remains strong, these builders prefer to sell after 
completion in anticipation of securing a higher price than could be 
obtained by signing a contract in advance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some seasonal pickup in commercial and industrial leasing activity 
has occurred in recent weeks, but conditions in the Second District 
have otherwise shown little change. Leasing activity in downtown 
Manhattan reportedly is somewhat stronger than in midtown as demand 
for space in new financial district buildings remains strong. A more 
than ample supply of office space remains in northern New Jersey and 
Fairfield and Westchester counties. However, Westchester has 
recently been experiencing a flurry of leasing activity as several 
large firms from outside the county have taken space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small and mid-size banks in the Second District report increasing 
pressure to lower their lending rates as other interest rates have 
declined. In part, the pressure exists because many bank loans, such 
as corporate loans, commercial mortgages, and some consumer loans, 
are directly linked to the prime rate. In addition, competition has 
been particularly strong for home equity and automobile loans. 
Despite a lowering of their home and auto loan rates, however, 
several banks have found their share of these markets considerably 
reduced. Moreover, as rates on business and consumer loans declined, 
so did the spread between interest earned and that paid on deposit 
accounts. As a result, surveyed banks have been lowering the rates 
they pay on variable rate accounts-CDs, NOWs and money market 
accounts. Most expect a further narrowing of the interest rate 
spread as their higher earning securities and mortgages mature. 
Consequently, some banks are considering lowering rates on "fixed 
rate" accounts, such as passbook savings, despite widespread 
reluctance to pursue this option.
