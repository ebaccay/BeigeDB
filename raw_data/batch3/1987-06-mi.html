      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In the second quarter the Ninth District's economy showed signs of 
continued improvement. Employment conditions strengthened early in 
the quarter. Consumer spending didn't grow by much, but neither did 
it weaken. Other improvements were noted in agriculture and 
resource-related industries—both of which have been weak spots in 
the district's economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's labor market continued to improve. In Minnesota, 
seasonal job growth helped lower the unemployment rate to 4.6 
percent in April. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, the 
unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent—its lowest April rate since 
1979. Increases in non-manufacturing jobs in the Twin Cities offset 
continued layoffs in manufacturing there. Also indicative of 
continuing strength in Minnesota labor markets, initial unemployment 
claims during May fell 8 percentage points below year-earlier 
levels. In addition, the Minneapolis help-wanted advertising index 
rose in April to a level 18 percentage points higher than a year 
earlier, corroborating the view of Bank directors that the Twin 
Cities labor market is tight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other district states also experienced heightened job growth. During 
April, employment rose and unemployment rates fell in the Dakotas 
and Montana. In South Dakota, durable goods manufacturing increased, 
and the April unemployment rate in the Sioux Falls metro area fell 
to only 2.7 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite firm labor markets, relations between labor and management 
have been a concern at some major companies. A number of strikes 
have troubled the meatpacking industry and have affected 6,700 
workers in South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska. One such 
strike is reported at a large meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail spending on general merchandise grew moderately in recent 
months. One large retailer reports that its combined sales for March 
and April reached levels 10 percentage points higher than a year 
ago. Another diversified chain reports a slightly larger increase 
over the same months and notes that its sales promotions during May 
were also well received by consumers. Although inventory levels have 
not been too low, a few retailers mention that offshore deliveries 
from Asia have been slow. One Bank director notes that the rate of 
retail price inflation has been low. Bank directors continue to 
report lackluster retail sales in smaller cities and towns dependent 
on agriculture and oil extraction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Motor vehicles sales have recently slowed. One large domestic 
manufacturer reports that its district sales were about 20 percent 
lower this May compared to May 1986. However, last May's sales were 
unusually high, so the recent decline wasn't overly severe. Another 
manufacturer says its late-May sales picked up and have been 
particularly strong in the Dakotas. Both manufacturers report that 
District inventories are normal for this time of year. Bank 
directors report that sales were slow in western parts of both 
Montana and Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing markets continued to be quite active in the district. In the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, housing permits were 17 percent 
higher during this year's warm April than in April 1986. Multifamily 
home construction was particularly strong. One Bank director notes 
that housing still remains affordable. But realtors are worried 
about future sales in light of recent increases in mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture conditions have continued to improve somewhat in recent 
months. Crop conditions have been generally excellent, with early 
growth stimulated by warm weather and recent rains. A Bank director 
from North Dakota observes that conditions have been good through 
much of that state—even in the usually dry area around Bismarck. In 
Minnesota, most of the earlier moisture deficiency has been remedied 
by recent rains. A Bank director from South Dakota notes that more 
rain is needed in some parts of that state, though. Crop prices, 
while still relatively low, have risen recently. Wheat prices have 
increased particularly sharply, and corn prices have also increased. 
These increases will save the federal government some money on its 
farm payments programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compared with major crop production, conditions for meat-animal 
production continue to be more favorable. In Minnesota, prices for 
May lambs were the highest on record. A Bank director reports that 
cattle prices were still good. And members of this Bank's Advisory 
Council on Small Business, Labor, and Agriculture report that the 
hog market looks promising through August, and that farm income 
generally is on the rise. In fact, a big hog production facility is 
planned for the area around Pierre, South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some good news is reported in most major resource-related 
industries. Higher copper prices have helped the important White 
Pine copper mine on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Bank directors say 
the gold mine there is also doing well and that two new gold mines 
may open in South Dakota. Coal producers in Montana may be helped by 
a cut in severance taxes. While the oil industry is still in the 
doldrums, permits for oil-drilling increased a bit in North Dakota. 
Finally, demand for many district wood products remains solid.
