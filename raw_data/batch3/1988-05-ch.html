      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity has continued to expand in the District. 
Employment growth in the year through February was about even with 
the nation, apart from sizable cuts at Michigan auto and parts 
plants and in related manufacturing industries. Chicago purchasing 
managers reported further increases in output and orders through 
March, accompanied by longer delays in deliveries of goods ordered 
and widespread price increases. However, a large diversified 
manufacturer reported that increases in prices paid for its inputs 
recently have been less widespread. Contacts see strength in orders, 
production, and shipments across a range of manufacturing 
industries. Firms in the District continue to gain from the fall in 
the dollar since early 1985, both in competition with imports and in 
export markets. Although some companies in this region face loss of 
business due to military spending cuts, defense procurement is more 
heavily concentrated in other regions. Employment cuts aimed at 
increasing efficiency continue to be reported. Farmland values in 
the District rose further in the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With auto inventories back in line with sales, following production 
cuts and a sales upturn in the first quarter, domestic car 
manufacturers plan to boost second and third quarter production 
above a year earlier. Truck sales continue robust, and second shifts 
are being added at two pickup truck assembly plants in the District. 
A maker of medium and heavy trucks has raised its sales forecast for 
the year. Export markets for heavy trucks are reopening. Auto makers 
are predicting total motor vehicle sales this year only slightly 
below the 1987 pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Order books at steel mills in the District are full for the second 
quarter, and the third quarter is being booked. Small steel users 
report an inability to get firm price quotes and delivery dates. The 
stronger-than-expected auto market has improved the outlook for 
shipments of steel this year to motor vehicle manufacturers. Demand 
for structural steel is very strong, reflecting in part the upturn 
in construction work on factories. Japanese auto and parts plants 
under construction in the U.S. are reported being pushed toward 
rapid completion. Investments in paper plants, heavy users of steel, 
are increasing. Steel fabricators are backlogged into the third 
quarter and in rare instances the fourth quarter. Buying of steel by 
equipment makers has strengthened further. Steel service center 
business continues strong. Inventories are thought to have been 
rebuilt to desired levels at some service center customers whose 
stocks were low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Machinery
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand has strengthened for numerous types of machinery. A supplier 
of components to equipment manufacturers reports stronger demand 
across a range of industries. Capital spending is described as 
"booming." Export orders continue strong. A large machine tool maker 
reports very favorable sales prospects, helped by the lower dollar 
which has contributed to reduced import penetration. Orders for 
construction equipment have risen substantially. Buying of food 
industry machinery is said to be doing well, and special industry 
machinery is up moderately. Sales of farm equipment this year have 
been sharply above the depressed year-earlier pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction contracts (in square feet) and shipments of 
building materials—concrete, cement, and gypsum board—in the first 
two months of 1988 were well below a year earlier in the five 
District states. More normal weather and resulting construction 
delays, after last year's exceptionally mild winter, may have 
accounted for a large portion of the decline. However, the decline 
may also be a result of many desired purchases of new or upgraded 
homes having been completed in recent years; the small number of 
listings of existing homes with Chicago-area real estate brokers is 
viewed as evidence of this. Mortgage interest rates have been 
relatively favorable; fixed-rate 30-year loans were offered in the 
first quarter at interest rates as low as 9.5 percent (plus 3 
points), though they have since generally risen to 10 percent or 
higher. First-year interest rates on adjustable-rate loans are also 
edging up in the Chicago area, from around 7 percent to 7.25 
percent. Nonresidential building contracts in the District states 
were modestly higher in total reflecting increases in Indiana and 
Wisconsin. Industrial construction will be higher this year, 
including work on steel mills in Indiana, paper plants in Wisconsin, 
and warehouse facilities around Chicago. Public works projects, 
large and small, are also expected to be strong. Prices of some 
construction materials have fallen reflecting slower markets, 
overall, and ample capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the District reported mixed results for February and 
March, attributed to weather and the early Easter. A survey of 243 
stores in Illinois and northern Indiana showed sales in February 2 
percent below a year earlier. However, sales in February 1987 were 
strong, reflecting the warm weather. Retail inventories are viewed 
as in good shape. Credit delinquencies have been falling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our latest survey of agricultural banks shows that farmland values 
rose further in the first quarter. District land values, on average, 
were 3.5 percent higher at the end of March than at the end of 1987, 
and 11.5 percent above a year earlier. The largest increase was in 
Iowa, where farmland values averaged 19 percent higher than in March 
1987. Little or no increase was reported for Michigan and Wisconsin 
land values over the past year. Farmers in the District plan to 
increase planted acreage this year by 3 percent for corn and 2 
percent for soybeans. Spring field work in most areas of the 
District is behind the accelerated pace of the past two years, but 
ahead of normal.
