     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts report modest economic growth, with particular 
strength in New England and weaker conditions in the Dallas and 
Kansas City Districts. Few District reports cite economic impacts 
from the stock market decline last October. The Christmas retail 
season appears to have been satisfactory nationwide, with modest 
dollar sales gains over last year's levels. In some areas, however, 
discounting reduced profit margins significantly. Agriculture and 
forest products industries have seen improved conditions in recent 
months, with higher prices and strong export demand for many 
products. Manufacturing orders and production have strengthened 
considerably in recent months, due in part to expanding exports. 
Inventories have accumulated for many raw materials and finished 
products. Construction and financial activity are mixed, both among 
different types of activity and among regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts report 5 to 10 percent gains in the value of 
Christmas sales over last year's level, with St. Louis and Dallas 
near the bottom of the range, and Boston and New York close to the 
top. Boston and Minneapolis report that surveyed retailers held 
profit margins steady, but reports from New York, Atlanta, St. 
Louis, and Dallas indicate that heavy discounting in those Districts 
cut into many stores' profit margins. Retailers in the Philadelphia 
area report that stores' profit margins on imported products are 
being squeezed between rapidly increasing costs and consumer 
resistance to higher prices, so these stores increasingly are 
turning to domestic suppliers. In contrast, Boston area retailers 
report that domestic suppliers are unable to meet their needs, so 
the falling dollar will cause them to switch to suppliers whose 
currencies have not appreciated with respect to the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on retail inventories are mixed, with about equal numbers of 
Banks reporting inventory accumulation and inventory depletion.
     </p>
     <p>
      December auto sales are reported to be weak in the Kansas City, 
Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and auto inventories have 
accumulated in these areas as a result. In contrast, Cleveland and 
Atlanta report satisfactory December sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity is reported to be strong in all Districts, 
with increased orders and, in many cases, increased backlogs as 
well. Currently, a large western aerospace firm has more than two 
years' worth of orders for commercial aircraft on its books.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cleveland and San Francisco report that exports continue to be 
largely responsible for their regions' increases in manufacturing 
activity, and respondents noted changes in relative prices that 
should lead to further improvements. A Cleveland area business now 
is able to sell machine tools to various Asian countries for the 
first time, and respondents in the San Francisco District reported 
sharp increases in foreign equipment prices during early January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from most Districts indicate increased inventories of raw 
materials and manufactured products. Several automobile plants in 
the Chicago and St. Louis Districts have been closed temporarily to 
control inventories. However, Richmond reports stable inventories of 
finished goods, and respondents to the Kansas City survey generally 
are satisfied with current inventory levels. Airplane inventories at 
western aerospace companies are very lean, due in part to strong 
export demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers in many Districts note increases in input and output 
prices, with steel prices up dramatically. Several Districts report 
problems obtaining sufficient supplies of some raw materials, 
particularly steel products, and some textile and apparel producers 
in western Tennessee are having difficulty finding sufficient 
workers for their rapidly expanding operations. Kansas City reports 
that, despite shortages of quality steel materials, most materials 
are readily available and few respondents noted bottlenecks in labor 
or plant capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The lower exchange value of the dollar continues to stimulate demand 
for many U.S. products. As a result, exports of several agricultural 
and forest products are up, depleting inventories in some cases. 
Prices for soybeans and some other major products have risen. Price 
increases for poultry in the Texas area are widely expected in the 
wake of extensive snow damage to poultry operations. The outlook for 
the energy sector remains weak, with a number of analysts 
increasingly "bearish" about energy prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding and real estate activity were seasonally slack during 
late 1987 in most of the nation, but have resumed modest activity 
levels in New England, New York, and Minnesota since the new year 
began. The winter slowdown, coupled with continued economic 
uncertainty, has reduced housing sales and construction in the 
Atlanta District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity continues mixed, with several 
Banks reporting continued high vacancy rates and slow building 
activity. The New York Bank reports that the turmoil in the 
financial markets apparently has had little or no effect on office 
leasing outside the New York Metropolitan area, but that activity 
has slowed in downtown and midtown Manhattan, and on Long Island. 
Atlanta reports that high absorption and a cutback in development in 
1987 caused a significant drop in Orlando's office vacancy rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In New York City, additional cutbacks are taking place in the 
brokerage and banking sectors as a result of both the stock market 
crash and basic restructuring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Application for consumer loans are weak overall, with significant 
declines in the rates of growth reported in the New York, 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Seattle areas. Some banks 
attribute the current weakness in part to declines in applications 
for car loans, and none attribute it to the stock market crash.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for mortgages is weaker than it was last year in most parts 
of the country, partly due to vigorous refinancing activity last 
year. Several western bankers report that demand for home equity 
loans was strong throughout 1987, and Atlanta reports that 
homeowners drew down home equity lines to finance Christmas 
purchases. In the suburbs surrounding New York City, demand for home 
equity loans generally is weak.
