      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Fourth District economy continues to expand slowly, but 
significant sectors of weakness remain. General merchandise sales 
are rising slowly while new car sales are high but flat. The 
unemployment rate is falling. Manufacturing output and orders are 
rising, but manufacturing employment is falling. Price behavior 
appears mixed. Oil, and coal prices and production are down. 
Problems continue in agriculture. House construction and sales are 
robust as is mortgage refinancing activity. Bank commercial and 
industrial loans are down and expected to remain weak while consumer 
installment lending is growing slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in this District report generally small spending increases 
during the first quarter, particularly during the month of March. 
General merchandise sales in current dollars, as reported by three 
major District chains, were roughly 4-6 percent above year-ago 
levels. Although general merchandise inventories have risen since 
year-end 1985, none of the chains expressed concern over current 
inventory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the District are showing high, but relatively flat 
sales trends. Total domestic new-car sales in the Northern Ohio 
region during the first quarter were up only 1.4 percent from the 
year-ago level. Unlike the national experience, imported new-car 
sales in the Northern Ohio region have been accelerating in recent 
months. Sales of Ohio-made Hondas (included as "imports" by local 
reporting agencies) have been particularly strong this year. All of 
the domestic auto dealers contacted report new-car inventories were 
well above average at the end of March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unemployment rate in Ohio averaged 8.4 percent (s.a.) in the 
first three months of 1986, down 0.5 percentage points from a year 
earlier. The national unemployment rate remains lower but fell only 
0.25 percentage points over the period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Output of manufacturers in this District continues to increase, but 
the rate of expansion has slowed. Despite this gain, more firms are 
reducing than increasing employment. Raw material and supply 
inventories are flat while finished good inventories continue to be 
drawn down. Firms report prices paid for raw materials and supplies 
are falling slowly but transaction prices for manufactured products 
sold are rising more rapidly than at any time in the last 12 months. 
Incoming orders are rising at an increasing pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major food manufacturer reports his product prices are declining. 
Paper prices are up. There have been some production cutbacks in the 
tool and die business, but the plastic molding business is 
improving. Aluminum prices have risen because inventories have been 
reduced substantially and demand has improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Oil exploration activity in this District is off sharply, and a 
major oil firm is shutting down stripper wells. Coal production is 
slowing, and the price of coal is weakening.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The horse industry in Kentucky is in the midst of a shake-out as 
demand is weak. Many horse producers are overextended and many large 
farms are for sale. Grape and potato producers in this District have 
not been as adversely affected as agricultural producers in other 
regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The high level of housing activity in this District continues 
unabated, and market participants expect the strong pace to persist 
through year-end. A major builder in the District reports that 
traffic and new orders are up 25 percent overall and up 50 percent 
in some markets. The builder fears that house construction may be 
escalating so rapidly that important materials shortages will occur, 
but so far the firm has experienced only minor shortages. The 
builder also reports that its average price on homes sold is up 10 
percent from a year ago despite no increase in list prices, because 
many homebuyers are adding amenities now that financing costs have 
fallen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors report that closings surged in March and April and that the 
inventory of listings is falling to low levels because of a severe 
drop in new listings. In this region, the composition of homebuyers 
has continued to shift toward first-time buyers who now constitute 
over 40 percent of buyers, up from 30 percent a year ago. The trend 
toward shorter-maturity mortgage loans is growing stronger, as more 
buyers demand 15-year mortgage loans. The period from application to 
closing of mortgage loans has increased from a normal range of 30 to 
45 days to 45 to 90 days, because of increased volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lenders in this District report that mortgage lending is up 
over 100 percent from a year ago. At some institutions, refinancings 
represent as much as 80 percent of mortgage volume. Few lenders are 
actively marketing their adjustable rate mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to have weakened at District banks recently. 
Total loans outstanding at large banks fell over the past month. 
Commercial and industrial loans were down, while real estate and 
consumer installment lending inched up. Growth of consumer 
installment lending continues to taper off and is now at less than a 
6 1/2 percent annual rate at large banks in this District. Contacts 
acknowledge the softness in loan demand and do not expect much 
improvement in the immediate future, despite the recent cut in the 
prime rate. One contact reports underlying weakness in business 
lending and expects it to continue over the next several months.
