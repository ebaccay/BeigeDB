      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District business conditions were uneven but, on balance, improved 
between mid-September and late October. Retail sales rose, and 
manufacturing activity edged higher. The residential real estate 
market improved somewhat, although the commercial real estate market 
remained sluggish. Tourism declined and was expected to remain weak 
throughout the fall. Activity at District ports fell. Loan 
conditions were unchanged, and District governments reported that 
tax revenues were meting their projections. In agriculture, slow-
maturing summer crops delayed harvesting activity and the fall 
planting of small grains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey indicated that District retail activity 
improved in recent weeks. Respondents reported that sales and 
shopper traffic increased and that retail prices rose. Retailers 
indicated that employment was steady, but employee wages increased. 
Inventories apparently declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents were optimistic about their prospects for the next six 
months. They expected increases in all indicators except employment, 
which they believed would be unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers indicated that District factory activity strengthened 
slightly during the past six weeks. Respondents saw little change in 
most indicators, but they reported increases in shipments, new 
orders, and exports. Prices paid for raw materials rose, but the 
prices received by manufacturers were unchanged. Excess capacity 
continued to plague District manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers were upbeat about their prospects for the next six 
months. Manufacturers expected increases in orders, shipments, and 
backlogs. Increases in employment, capital spending, and prices were 
also anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the District indicated that 
tourist activity for October declined compared to September and to a 
year ago. Respondents reported that fall bookings were below those 
of a year ago, primarily because of fewer convention bookings. 
Looking ahead, respondents expected tourist activity to remain weak 
throughout the fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports--Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk)--indicated that both imports and exports 
were lower in September than in August. Compared with a year ago, 
however, imports and exports were generally higher. During the next 
six months, exports were expected to increase at Charleston but to 
be unchanged at Baltimore and Hampton Roads.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone indicated 
that credit conditions were little changed in recent weeks. 
Respondents reported that commercial and consumer loan demand were 
steady. Rates on commercial loans were unchanged while rates on 
consumer loans were lower. Banks noted that residential mortgage 
activity, consisting mostly of refinancing, strengthened in 
September but weakened in October. Respondents reported that 
mortgage loan rates began to rise significantly in mid-October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential activity picked up modestly during the past six weeks 
according to a telephone survey of District realtors. Home prices 
were stable, and respondents noted that sales of homes in the mid-
to-low price range, particularly to first-time homebuyers, were 
strong. The market for upscale homes, however, apparently remained 
soft. The residential market in Raleigh, North Carolina, was 
characterized as particularly strong, and the strength was 
apparently spilling over into the nearby Durham market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial activity remained sluggish, but realtors suggested that 
leasing activity had picked up somewhat in many areas of the 
District. The absorption of commercial space improved, particularly 
in suburban areas, but respondents noted that little new commercial 
development was underway. Leasing activity in Washington, D.C., 
however, decreased because of reduced demand for space by government 
agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Budgets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Government analysts contacted by telephone indicated that third 
quarter tax revenues were close to estimates in most District 
jurisdictions, lessening the likelihood of budget shortfalls. 
Revenue growth in West Virginia and in the District of Columbia, 
however, remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tax receipt growth varied by jurisdiction and type. Personal income 
withholding tax collections increased substantially in most District 
states. Sales tax collections, compared to a year ago, were stronger 
in Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia, steady in South Carolina 
and West Virginia, and weaker in the District of Columbia. Corporate 
tax receipts, however, were reported to be lower in several 
jurisdictions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural analysts reported that the harvest of summer 
crops was progressing more slowly than normal in some states. 
Harvesting of corn continued to be hampered by the slow maturing of 
the crop because of unseasonably cool weather. Soybeans also were 
maturing late, delaying their harvest and increasing the risk of 
frost damage. Tobacco harvesting was almost complete, and yields 
were about normal. Small grain planting was underway, but progress 
was slowed by the delays in harvesting summer crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock was reported in good condition. A large hay crop and good 
pasture conditions were expected to provide adequate forage for the 
winter months.
