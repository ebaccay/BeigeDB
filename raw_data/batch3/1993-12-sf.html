      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic weakness persists in California. Much of the rest of the 
Twelfth District, however, shows signs of solid economic growth. In 
California, manufacturing, construction, trade, and financial 
sectors remain sluggish. Economic activity also lags in western 
Washington, reflecting retrenchment in aerospace, and in Hawaii, 
reflecting a weak visitor industry. Oregon and Arizona, however, are 
experiencing modest growth in the construction, trade, and financial 
sectors. Furthermore, the economies of intermountain states continue 
to grow at a robust pace. Business sentiment has improved since our 
last report, and expectations for holiday retail sales are good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders improved from our 
October report. Three-quarters of the respondents expect the real 
economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate at or 
above trend growth. This proportion is up from two-thirds in October 
and one-half in August. Most other respondents expect the economy to 
expand, but at a rate below trend. Respondents from California and 
western Washington expect their regions to have slow growth relative 
to the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity is reported improving. The weakest conditions are in 
California, where contacts report flat to slightly improving 
consumer confidence and retail sales. For example, one national 
retailer reports strong sales in October at its stores outside of 
southern California. Another national retailer, however, reports 
that California sales are "showing signs of life." Several contacts 
mention very strong retail sales in both Utah and Idaho. Automobile 
sales in these states are surging, and spot shortages of new 
domestic cars and light trucks are reported. Consumer confidence in 
these states is excellent, and merchants are expecting significant 
increases in holiday sales over a strong performance last year. 
Consume confidence, and expectations for the holiday season, are 
also reported improving in Arizona. Optimism also is reported among 
retailers in Oregon. Reports from the Puget Sound area are mixed. 
One contact reports that the recent Asia-Pacific trade conference 
generated significant visitor industry activity. The contact also 
reports high levels of activity in retail and restaurant 
establishments. In contrast, another contact cautions that the 
holiday retail season will be subdued due to expected further 
layoffs in aerospace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in service-raised industries are mixed. Potential health 
care reform is reported to be leading to consolidation among health 
care providers. Contacts indicate that law and accounting firms are 
reducing overhead through early retirement. In California, passage 
of a sale tax extension is expected to assist local government in 
the short run. A recent voter initiative in Washington is likely to 
limit state government spending and lead to restructuring in the 
next year. In contrast, fiscal conditions are good in state and 
local governments in Utah and Idaho.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is mixed in the District, with lingering 
weakness centered in aerospace and defense-related industries. 
Layoffs in these sectors continue in several district states-with 
southern California and western Washington most affected. Sluggish 
conditions are also reported in California's machinery, metals, and 
construction-related manufacturing industries. One contact notes 
that the District's aluminum industry is suffering from an over-
supply of ingot from foreign suppliers. Primary domestic aluminum 
producers are reducing capacity, and aerospace companies are 
benefiting from significant price reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other manufacturing industries show signs of improvement. Some types 
of cable television distribution equipment is reported in short 
supply, with some larger companies having bought out the complete 
stocks of some suppliers. Sales by western food processors of peas, 
corn, beans, and pumpkins are reported very strong due to a 
shortfall from the Midwest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts report a generally favorable outlook for agriculture. 
Weather conditions in the Midwest are reported to have raised prices 
for grains, corn, and beans. Abundant lettuce supplies are reported. 
The cotton harvest is about complete with average yields and 
somewhat lower prices than a year earlier. Conditions in the seafood 
industry are reported poor. Heavy crude oil prices in California are 
reported declining. Orders for wood products remain firm, with 
inventories very low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District construction and real estate markets are mixed. Sluggish 
conditions persist in most real estate markets in southern 
California. Sales in the high-end residential market remain weak-and 
commercial vacancies are reported very high. A contact in Los Angels 
reports that federal aid is stimulating the construction of low 
income housing. In the central valley of California, a contact 
reports steady sales of entry-level housing-but sluggish conditions 
for higher-priced housing. The housing market in western Washington 
is reported stable--with steady sales and firm prices. In Oregon, 
conditions in the construction industry are improving. Contacts in 
Utah and Idaho report some capacity and supply constraints in 
residential construction, but nothing that will be disruptive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Varied conditions are reported across District financial markets. A 
contact with a large California bank reports that the industry 
continues to feel the effects of recession-with business loan demand 
remaining weak and overall credit demand remaining lackluster. A 
contact in the thrift industry in southern California reports 
continued weak credit demand due to soft real estate conditions. In 
Arizona, a contact reports that consumer loan demand remains strong, 
and that commercial loan demand finally shows signs of reviving. A 
contact from the Puget Sound area reports a strong banking sector, 
although the level of mortgage refinancings may recede from its 
current high level. Healthy growth in deposits and loans are 
reported in Oregon.
