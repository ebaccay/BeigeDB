     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Since year's end, conditions have not changed much in the Ninth 
District. Early in the first quarter, employment grew slightly. 
Overall, consumer spending growth was modest, with the exception of 
large gains in housing. Resource-related industries remained mixed, 
with good performance in the wood products sector but poor 
conditions in the energy sector. The agricultural outlook has not 
improved. Agricultural banking issues dominated the district's 
finance sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, district employment conditions stopped deteriorating early 
in the first quarter, but they may now be declining in the oil-
producing regions. In February, district states' unemployment rates 
hardly changed at all, and total employment grew in Minnesota, the 
Dakotas, and Montana during that month. But employment in durable 
goods manufacturing continued to falter. In Minnesota, this was 
largely due to a downturn in computer equipment manufacturing. Due 
to recent declines in oil prices, North Dakota's unemployment rate 
rose in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail purchases of general merchandise grew moderately. Although 
two department store chains in the district sold more than planned 
during the first quarter, sales at both slowed early in April. The 
chains' credit sales have been growing rapidly and are now being 
scrutinized for signs of deteriorating quality. Inventories were not 
excessive at either chain. Two big discounters report good sales 
generally throughout the district. However, bank directors say sales 
have been spotty outside the Twin Cities metro area, with flat sales 
in parts of Montana and western North Dakota but growing sales at a 
large shopping mall in Duluth, Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of motor vehicles have leveled off and may even be below year 
earlier levels. For one large domestic manufacturer, district car 
sales were running 16 percent below last year's level, while its 
truck sales were down 4 percent since a year ago. New car sales were 
weak in both western Montana and Bismarck, North Dakota, but were 
good in Fargo, North Dakota, and Pierre, South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity has been generally quite strong. Realtors report 
that more homes were sold during March in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
area than during any other previous month. Requests for FHA 
appraisals in the Twin Cities were also higher in March than ever 
before. Lower mortgage rates have also been spurring house sales in 
other parts of the district, including western Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist spending at district ski resorts was mixed this winter. 
Business at some big Montana resorts was harmed by late starts and 
high winds. Resorts on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan also had a 
less-than-desirable season, according to a Bank director. But 
another director says a resort in northeastern Minnesota that 
usually loses money actually turned a profit this winter. In 
preparation for the summer season, many Minnesota resorts are 
expanding their facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions among the district's resource-related industries remained 
mixed. The wood products industry has been doing well. One Bank 
director notes that waferboard production has been going strong and 
that its price has firmed; another mentions that a new fiberboard 
plant on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan should eventually employ 
300 workers. However, wood suppliers for such plants are receiving 
low prices for their products. Low prices are also plaguing the 
district's energy sector. As a result, active oil and gas drilling 
rigs are almost nonexistent in North Dakota and Montana. Although 
coal production in Montana has increased, coal prices have dropped.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions remained poor in the agriculture sector. This Bank's late 
March survey of rural bankers in the district found little cause for 
optimism. The surveyed bankers say their customers' net farm 
earnings and farmland values fell below year-earlier levels. The 
Minnesota farm price index didn't rise from its low level in 
February. Wet weather has impeded early field work in Minnesota, 
although the moisture should help crops grow later. Drought 
conditions affecting the wheat-growing area of northeastern Montana 
have eased.
     </p>
     <p>
      The U.S. agriculture department's dairy herd buy-out program has 
received much attention.. Nearly 10 percent of Minnesota's dairy 
farmers will be paid a total of $145 million to shut down operations 
for at least five years. The participation rate was lower in 
Wisconsin, according to a bank director. The buy out spurred many 
farmers to sell off their cows, at least temporarily lowering cattle 
prices and infuriating ranchers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finance
Agricultural banking issues predominated in the district's finance 
sector. A group of seven rural Minnesota banks announced a program 
for reducing interest rates on farm loans secured by real estate, 
The Minnesota legislature enacted an interest buy-down program for 
farm loans, and participation has been so heavy that the program's 
budgeted funds have already run out. However, Minnesota's governor 
has promised continued funding for the program.
