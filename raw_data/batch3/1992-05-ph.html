      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District during April appeared to 
be just steady overall, although there were some signs of 
improvement. Positive indications came from manufacturers, who 
generally noted a second consecutive month of growth in both 
shipments and orders, and realtors, who reported that home sales 
were picking up and prices were firming. A weaker situation appeared 
to prevail in retailing; most Third District merchants contacted for 
this report experienced a drop in sales in March and April compared 
to January and February. In the financial sector, bankers generally 
described total loan volume as flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is generally 
positive, albeit restrained. Manufacturers expect continued 
improvement and they are planning modest increases in hiring and 
capital spending. Retailers hope for a rebound in the second half of 
the year, but they expect only slow growth once a recovery in sales 
gets underway. Bankers forecast moderate gains in lending in the 
second half, primarily to businesses as capital spending is stepped 
up. Realtors anticipate sustained improvement in residential markets 
provided mortgage rates do not continue to rise, but they expect 
commercial markets to remain weak for some time to come.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On the basis of reports from industrial companies in the Third 
District it appeared that manufacturing activity was picking up in 
April. More than a third of the firms contacted for this report said 
their business was improving and nearly half said business was 
steady. Companies in nearly all major manufacturing sectors in the 
district noted improvements in orders and shipments; the exceptions 
were food processors and makers of rubber and plastic products who 
noted declines. Overall, Third District manufacturers were 
maintaining steady employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly two-thirds of the manufacturers polled for this report 
predict continued improvement over the next six months. On balance, 
they forecast gains in shipments and new orders; they also expect 
order backlogs, which have been stable, to increase. While 
approximately half of the firms queried said they would hold 
employment and capital spending level over the next two quarters, 
more than one-third plan to add workers and more than one-fourth are 
scheduling increased capital expenditures during the period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Third District retailers indicated that sales in March and 
April ran below the pace of January and February. Several also said 
that sales were off compared to March and April of last year. 
Retailers said sales of furniture, home furnishings, and other hard-
goods were running closer to expectations than were sales of soft 
goods. Apparel, in particular, was described as weak; and merchants 
attributed this partly to a late Easter and unseasonably cold 
weather, and partly to the lack of a clear fashion trend in women's 
wear.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus forecast among Third District retailers is that 
recovery will be slow and erratic. While some look for the beginning 
of an upturn in the third quarter, others believe solid improvement 
will not take hold until next year. In the meantime, store 
executives indicated they will be focusing their attention on cost-
cutting, including employment reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers also experienced a sales slowdown in March and April. 
On balance, they expect unit sales for this year as a whole to just 
match last year's results.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District bankers in late April indicated that 
total loan volume outstanding at major banks had been essentially 
flat in recent weeks, with gains in residential real estate lending 
offset by declines in business and consumer loans. However, several 
bankers said they expected residential loan growth to taper off as a 
backlog of refinancing applications is worked down. Prospects for a 
modest increase in commercial and industrial lending appeared to be 
improving, according to bankers. Several mentioned that their 
regular borrowers were considering expanded capital spending plans 
for the near future, and several bankers indicated that their 
institutions were or would be stepping up marketing efforts to 
potential business borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential realtors contacted in April generally indicated that 
home sales were running above the year-ago pace. Some said that the 
pickup in sales began in March, largely for moderately priced new 
homes, and that sales of existing homes and higher-priced houses 
were increasing in early April. It was also noted that, compared to 
last year, houses seemed to be selling more quickly after being 
listed, and at their offering prices rather than at discounts. 
Realtors generally were optimistic that the pace of sales would be 
maintained for the rest of the year if mortgage rates do not 
continue to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate markets did not appear to be 
sharing the improving health noted in residential markets. Demand 
for industrial and retail space was described as particularly weak 
by brokers. Commercial brokers continued to describe the market for 
office space as soft although some noted that vacancy rates were 
declining in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity, overall, appeared to be flat. While some 
slight gains were indicated in residential and public construction, 
commercial building activity remained at a low level.
