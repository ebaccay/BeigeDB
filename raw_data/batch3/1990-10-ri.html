      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 31, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity generally weakened further in early 
October, and the attitudes of businesses about the near-term outlook 
became more pessimistic. Retail and manufacturing activity slowed. 
Starts of new commercial buildings were virtually at a standstill. 
Loan demand was weaker at District financial institutions, but 
interest rates were little changed. On the brighter side, export 
volume rose at District ports and the District's farming sector was 
generally healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to our regular mail survey of retailers suggested that 
retail sales—including sales of big ticket items—declined in early 
October. Most stores also reported declines in shopper traffic and 
many retailers indicated that they had trimmed employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Department store executives reported that they had reduced their 
sales projections and expected to hold down their employment and 
advertising this Christmas season. These retailers and others 
surveyed were pessimistic about the outlook for their businesses and 
local economies, and the national economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey of manufacturers showed decreases in their 
shipments, orders, and employment in early October. Nearly half of 
the respondents identified poor sales as their most important 
business problem. Rising crude oil prices apparently contributed to 
sales declines; about three-fifths of the respondents said that 
their sales were adversely affected by the boost in oil prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most surveyed manufacturers reported higher raw materials costs, but 
few had raised the prices of their finished products. Their 
inventories of materials and finished goods had changed little from 
the levels reported in our previous survey in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers' assessments of current business conditions and their 
outlook for the near term were more pessimistic in October than in 
August. Most respondents believed that economic conditions in their 
local areas and in the nation had weakened in early October; only a 
few expected business conditions to improve in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Coal
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District coal production and prices have remained relatively stable, 
unlike in earlier periods when they rose sharply along with the 
price of oil. The reason for this stability, according to our 
contacts in southwest Virginia and West Virginia, was that most oil-
burning electric utility companies converted to coal in the 1970s so 
that little additional conversion was now possible. Also, utility 
companies reportedly were heavily stockpiled with coal because the 
summer was not as hot as usual. Coal industry executives expect some 
upward pressure on coal prices, however, from increased export 
demand. At the port of Hampton Roads (Norfolk), coal exports were
said to be near a record pace in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports received from District ports—Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads—showed that export volume rose from the prior month 
at all three ports, while import volume was generally unchanged. 
Also, port representatives continued to expect exports to grow 
faster than imports over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the commercial real estate and banking sectors indicated 
that high vacancy rates and tighter loan standards have virtually 
halted new construction starts in the District. According to 
managers of office buildings and industrial parks, projects now 
underway were generally funded by loan commitments made more than 
six months ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of District financial institutions indicated 
lower demand for consumer and commercial loans in early October than 
in September. Lenders attributed the weaker demand to uncertainty 
resulting from Mideast tensions, the lack of a Federal budget 
accord, and slower growth in the domestic economy. Nearly all 
lenders reported no change in their loan rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Preliminary results from a survey of District agricultural bankers 
suggested that the area farm economy was generally healthy going 
into the peak harvest season. Most bankers contacted reported that 
farmland values had risen this year in their areas, but only one in 
six expects further increases in the next three months. Funds 
available for agricultural loans were at normal or above-normal 
levels at 90 percent of the reporting institutions, and a similar 
proportion reported that agricultural loan repayment rates were 
normal or above-normal. Collateral requirements for farm loans, 
however, were higher than usual at about one-fourth of the banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heavy rainfall throughout the southern and western portions of the 
District delayed harvest activity somewhat—especially of soybeans—during the second week of October. Preliminary estimates indicate 
that soybean yields in the District may be somewhat lower than 
average due to a dry September.
