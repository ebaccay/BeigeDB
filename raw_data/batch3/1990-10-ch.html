      <strong>
       October 31, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District economy continues to expand slowly, although several 
contacts expressed concern about future growth. Consumer spending 
still appears stronger in the Midwest than in the nation as a whole. 
District manufacturing activity is rising, although several sources 
reported some new weakness in export markets. Capital investment 
planned for 1990 generally is being completed, but additional 
caution is being expressed about spending plans for 1991. Financing 
for new "speculative" construction projects has virtually ceased, 
according to several District sources, while projects that have 
received financing continue to move ahead. Some manufacturers have 
begun attempting to raise prices to reflect higher oil costs. 
Several contacts noted that buyer delinquency rates have risen 
slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales generally continued to be stronger in the District than 
in the nation as a whole, although some problem areas persist. A 
general merchandise chain reported slightly better than expected 
same-store sales growth in September, and an economist for the chain 
noted that spending on household durables grew faster than the 
company-wide average. Sales were reportedly weak, however, in areas 
of Michigan and Indiana that are linked to the auto industry. An 
analyst for a national discount chain stated that company sales 
experienced a year-over-year decline nationally in the first two 
weeks of October, after sales growth slowed consistently (in nominal 
dollars) over the five months ending in September. Traffic and sales 
volume in District stores were generally stronger than the company's 
national average, except in the Detroit area. Industry inventories 
are being watched closely, according one retail analyst, and efforts 
are being made to limit ordering to items that are out of stock.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales continue to show surprising strength, although car buyers 
still expect rebates. One of the largest motor vehicle dealers in 
the Seventh District reported continued sales growth in September 
and early October, with little change in mix. The dealer attributed 
some of the strength to aggressive promotion and market-share gains. 
However, heavily leveraged dealers are increasingly cautious in 
committing to inventory and promotions. An economist for a major 
domestic automaker stated that dealers continue to receive much of 
their inventory financing from auto producers, but are ordering 
cautiously. This contact also noted that there was little evidence 
of substitution of cars for light trucks since the oil price 
increase. Still, a soft economy is expected to reduce car and truck 
sales by about a half a million units (at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate) in the fourth quarter from earlier expectations, 
according to this economist.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continued to expand, on average, 
with strength in steel, auto, and industrial equipment production 
offsetting new softness seen in agricultural equipment and 
electronic components production. An economist with a major Midwest 
steel producer stated that industry order books for the fourth 
quarter were "virtually full," with no sign of an increase in order 
cancellations. While auto industry inventories are generally 
considered low, an analyst stated that fourth quarter auto 
production probably will be down from the relatively strong third 
quarter. An economist for a manufacturer of agricultural equipment 
stated that October sales continued to look "terrible," following 
weakness that began in August both for the company and the industry. 
However, this company's sales of industrial products in the District 
rose on a year-over-year basis, as well as on a seasonally adjusted 
month-to-month basis from July through September. An analyst for a 
major District producer of electronic components reported that order 
growth for his company's products had peaked in midsummer, and 
growth is expected to continue to slow in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area purchasing managers' surveys exhibit mixed conditions. The 
index produced by the Chicago area survey showed expansion in 
September, compared to the decline indicated by the national survey. 
In contrast, the Milwaukee and Detroit surveys showed weakening 
activity in September. One contact suggested that the Detroit 
weakness was due in large part to uncertainty prior to the 
resolution of labor negotiations between auto producers and the UAW.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several District sources reported that exports, which have been a 
significant contributor to the relative strength in the Midwest 
economy, showed signs of softening recently. An analyst with a 
manufacturer of moving equipment stated that retail sales of its 
products outside of the United States had weakened over the past two 
to three months. An economist with a major manufacturer of 
agricultural equipment reported that overseas sales also had begun 
to trend downward in recent months, particularly in much of Europe. 
On the other hand, a large District manufacturer of equipment and 
supplies reported that export growth was continuing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Investment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital spending plans for 1990 are generally proceeding on 
schedule, although increasing uncertainty is being expressed about 
plans for 1991. A major District manufacturer of machine tools 
reported that the company's sales to and orders from the auto 
industry remained strong through September. This contact expected 
continued growth over the near-term, as domestic producers continue 
retooling. Sales outside the auto industry remain relatively weak, 
although the weakness developed before the onset of the Middle East 
crisis. An economist for a major producer of basic materials used in 
construction reported little change in the company's own project
schedules, noting that the company's largest project was, if 
anything, being accelerated. However, an analyst for a large 
District producer of a wide variety of capital equipment cited a 
recent decline in sales, as well as a flattening in orders, for 
customers producing in cyclically sensitive sectors. A bank 
economist stated that customer feedback indicates that capital 
projects underway are being completed, while there is some new 
reluctance to commit to start-ups that begin next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of contacts stated that financing for new "speculative" 
construction projects had virtually ceased for both commercial and 
multifamily development. Many carefully researched projects continue 
to move ahead, however, particularly in the food processing, 
pharmaceuticals, and energy industries, as well as in public 
infrastructure. An analyst with a District manufacturer of moving 
equipment stated that sales to construction markets in the District 
have held up well. While construction markets in the District have 
been reported as generally outperforming the national average this 
year, two contacts reported data for August that show this relative 
strength receding, both in construction contract awards and in 
cement industry sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Chicago real estate agent described the local housing market as 
"surprisingly strong." While homes are on the market longer and 
prices are not rising as fast as a year ago, sellers and holding 
firm on price, according to the realtor, and volume is still up over 
last year. One large realtor reported that first-time home buyers 
may be more active recently, calling it a 'buyers market', in part 
because mortgage rates are relatively low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District sources indicate that some manufacturers have begun trying 
to increase prices in order to compensate for higher crude oil 
prices. An economist for a major District manufacturer reported 
increased usage of "temporary surcharges" covering transportation 
costs and energy-intensive materials. An auto industry analyst 
stated that it was "too early to tell" whether the oil price 
increase would spread through production costs to auto prices, 
noting that automakers stockpile oil and hedge their exposure to 
volatility in energy costs. An analyst with a manufacturer of 
agricultural machinery reported the price of its own products had 
not been raised since the recent escalation in oil prices began. 
This contact also stated there had been little change in the prices 
of many purchased materials, principally because of weakness in the 
markets for the final product.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several contacts indicated that borrower repayments had slowed 
slightly. A consumer credit analyst for a major District lender 
reported a small rise in delinquency rates over the past two months, 
principally in unsecured and revolving credit. This contact stated 
that the rise in itself was not alarming, but noted that there 
appears to be a growing proportion of consumers not accounted for in 
delinquency rates because of increasing personal bankruptcy filings. 
An economist with a manufacturer of farm equipment and consumer 
vehicles reported a rise in delinquencies by consumers of 
recreational vehicles, but little change in the delinquency rates 
for buyers of agricultural and construction equipment. An analyst 
for a manufacturer of moving equipment stated that delinquencies 
experienced by the company's finance subsidiary had climbed since 
late summer.
