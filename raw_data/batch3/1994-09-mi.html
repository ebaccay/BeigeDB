     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy remains robust. Construction and 
manufacturing are strong. Metal mining shipments are growing and oil 
and gas drilling is above 1993 levels. Output of forest products for 
construction remains high, and beleaguered paper mills are 
benefiting from price increases for some products. Crop and 
livestock production is above year-earlier levels. Vehicle sales 
continue to be very good, but general merchandise retailers may have 
reached a plateau. The summer tourist season has been excellent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment levels continue higher than year-earlier levels in all 
parts of the district and unemployment rates are lower. Some firms 
report difficulty in finding skilled employees, particularly in 
metropolitan areas. But there is little upward pressure on wages or 
prices except for petroleum products and newsprint.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As has been true for more than a year, construction is one of the 
strongest sectors of the Ninth District economy. Residential 
building in the Minneapolis - St. Paul area in July was over 4 
percent above 1993 figures. "Buyers are still coming out and, 
although they may be more cautious, they are nevertheless buying," 
reported a builders spokesperson. Similar conditions prevailed in 
most metropolitan areas across the district. "We are on a record 
year," said a Sioux Falls. S.D., association representative, "the 
higher interest rates really haven't hurt activity." Furthermore, 
commercial and heavy construction continues to expand. Publicly let 
contracts in Minnesota and the Dakotas through July are 2 percent 
higher for 1994 than 1993, but 23 percent above 1992 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing continues to grow. News media and district directors 
report good manufacturing sales, particularly by machining and metal 
fabricating businesses and by producers of construction-related 
products. Producers of farm implements and industrial machinery also 
reportedly have good business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales prospects are generally good for the Ninth District's natural 
resource-related industries. Ongoing strength in construction 
continues to undergird the forest products industry. Producers of 
plywood substitutes, windows and millwork are particularly busy. 
Reported increases in market prices for newsprint offer some relief 
for the beleaguered paper industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prospects are good in the metal mining sector. One Minnesota iron 
mine, idled for a year after a labor dispute, is back in full 
production and other mines report strong shipments. A Minnesota 
industry spokesperson said, "We expect a 43 million ton year in 
1995," roughly 6 percent above 1994 shipments. Oil production 
continues to erode in North Dakota and Montana, but drilling 
activity through mid-summer is generally above 1993, reportedly in 
response to higher oil prices. A Montana official noted that a new 
law lowering taxes for horizontally-drilled oil wells had caused a 
spurt of drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural production in the Ninth District is above 1993 levels 
in most categories. Excellent harvests of major crops are expected, 
not only in comparison to 1993, but also relative to five-year 
averages. Wheat production in Montana is apparently down somewhat 
from 1993's record, but very good relative to the 1988-1993 average. 
Wheat output is also expected to be down slightly in South Dakota 
but up strongly in North Dakota and Minnesota. North Dakota and 
Minnesota anticipate a doubling of dry bean production compared to 
1993 and a 10 percent increase in sugarbeets. In all states corn and 
soybeans are generally in very good condition. Minnesota corn and 
soybean crops will break previous records by 5 percent to 10 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The numbers of livestock on farms and slaughtered remain high 
compared to year-earlier levels and longer term average levels. 
Cattle prices have recovered slightly from lows set in July, but hog 
prices have been essentially steady since June. Given the production 
cycles for cattle and hogs, output can be expected to remain high 
through the remainder of 1994. Minnesota and Wisconsin milk 
production in July was slightly below 1993 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      But any impetus to farmers' personal or business spending as a 
result of increased production may be limited by widespread declines 
in farm prices. A midsummer survey of agricultural credit conditions 
showed that more Ninth District bankers expected decreases rather 
than increases in farm capital spending in the third quarter. In 
spite of these expectations, farm machinery sales have been good 
thus far in 1993, a North Dakota implement dealers representative 
said. "The biggest limitation on sales is the inability of dealers 
to get as much as they want."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales remain generally strong for the district as a whole, 
but with some indications of softening of general merchandise sales. 
Vehicles continue to sell well in all areas. One representative of a 
state auto dealers association said, "We don't see any slowdown, it 
is a very good year." Mall managers in both Dakotas say that 
customer traffic and sales remain very strong. And a news report 
from Grand Forks, N.D., described retail sales there as very good in 
spite of a decrease in Canadian shoppers. But a Minneapolis-based 
retail chain reported August sales only slightly above 1993 and 
described retail conditions as slowing. And a representative of a 
regional retail chain said, "Sales are not as good as earlier in the 
year."
     </p>
     <p>
      Pleasant weather and successful marketing enabled Ninth District 
tourism businesses to enjoy a busy summer. An official in the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan reports motel/hotel traffic in August up 5 to 
6 percent over last year. Northern Wisconsin resort owners and 
campground operators laud this summer as the best in five years, 
according to a local newspaper. Businesses near Duluth, Minn., 
report double digit increases over last year's rainy summer. Visits 
at South Dakota campgrounds are up about 5 percent for July and 
August compared to 1993, and several South Dakota tourist 
attractions reportedly will set attendance records this year. Major 
attractions in Montana claim single digit increases to slight 
declines, staying close to last summer's record pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets reflect a strengthening district economy. Summer 
employment numbers continued to climb in all district states and 
generally remain nearly 3 percent above comparable 1993 figures. 
Unemployment rates remain well below year-earlier levels. In 
Mankato, Minn., where the unemployment rate is 2 percent, a Job 
Service director said, "It's definitely an applicant's market." And 
in other urban areas such as Sioux Falls and Rapid City, S.D., Grand 
Forks and Fargo, ND., and Eau Claire, Wis., job growth reportedly is 
strong and some firms are experiencing difficulty hiring skilled 
workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, directors and industry sources report little wage or price 
pressure. Hourly manufacturing earnings in Minneapolis-St. Paul are 
up barely 1 percent from a year ago. Petroleum prices have 
increased, with most motor fuels 5 to 8 cents above year-earlier 
levels in August. Newsprint prices reportedly have also risen.
