     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity has continued to increase in most of the 
districts, but at a slow and uneven pace. Boston, Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and 
Dallas all reported some improvement, ranging from a slightly more 
positive tone in Boston to a modest expansion in St. Louis. 
Developments in New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco were 
described as mixed, with improvement in some sectors and 
sluggishness in others. Retail sales grew in most districts though 
the extent of the gain varied. Activity in the manufacturing sector 
apparently lost some momentum in much of the nation as several 
districts noted a slower pace of expansion or declining demand. An 
improvement in residential construction and sales was noted in 
several districts, with gains generally concentrated in the low-to-
middle-income range of single-family housing. Several districts have 
reported a slight increase in overall loan demand. Cool and damp 
weather continued to delay harvests in much of the nation although 
yields on many crops were very good. The few reports received this 
time on wage and price developments referred to generally stable 
conditions, though with scattered price increases reported on a few 
individual items.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports indicate that retail sales improved in most areas 
in recent weeks, though the extent of the gain varied. Moreover, 
some retailers stated that the selling climate remained difficult 
and that discounting and other promotional efforts were needed in 
order to achieve the latest increases. Sales gains varied from 
slightly improved in Boston and Philadelphia to markedly improved in 
Cleveland. Sales of nondurables were strong in New York, Atlanta, 
and Kansas City while Philadelphia and Cleveland registered gains in 
most items. Retail activity remained sluggish in California, 
however, as defense-related employment cutbacks continue. Districts 
reporting on automotive sales were evenly divided between those 
experiencing some softness and those with a pickup in demand. With 
the exception of some excess auto stocks, retail inventories remain 
at generally satisfactory levels in most districts at this time. 
Respondents in four of the districts expect at least somewhat higher 
holiday sales this year than last. Tourist activity has slowed in 
the Richmond District, primarily because of fewer convention 
bookings, but remains a bright spot in Atlanta and Minneapolis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the manufacturing sector apparently lost some momentum 
in much of the nation as several districts, including Atlanta, 
Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia, noted a slower pace 
of expansion or declines. Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas and the San 
Francisco District outside of California noted some improvement, 
however. Aircraft and defense goods, nonelectrical machinery, rubber 
and plastic products and primary metals were cited as products for 
which demand has slowed. Respondents pointed to the weakness in 
foreign economies and dampened consumer confidence in this country 
as sources of concern. On the other hand, manufacturers of building 
supplies, carpeting and other home furnishings have seen an increase 
in demand as a result of the post-hurricane rebuilding in the South 
and an uptick in housing demand in some other areas. Dallas reports 
strong demand for fabricated metals and electrical and electronic 
machinery and San Francisco notes that demand from Latin America and 
Pacific Basin countries is supporting manufacturing activity in that 
district. St. Louis reports that manufacturing employment gains 
continue to outnumber reports of losses. With regard to the outlook, 
Boston states that manufacturers are cautiously optimistic, and 
those in Philadelphia believe that the upturn which began last 
spring is still on track. Manufacturers in Cleveland are optimistic 
about the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An improvement in residential construction and sales was noted in 
several districts with gains generally concentrated in the low-to-
middle-income range of single-family housing. Boston reported that 
the real estate market has stopped declining in most New England 
states and that the volume of sales is up substantially from a year 
earlier. Cleveland and St. Louis noted that residential contracts 
and permits were well above the year-earlier pace and Richmond 
reported strong sales to first-time homebuyers. Single-family 
homebuilding is providing the only source of strength in the Dallas 
construction industry as was also the case in Kansas City. In 
Florida, a good deal of hurricane-related residential rebuilding is 
now taking place. San Francisco reported sluggish sales and 
declining prices, particularly on more expensive homes, in 
California and a big jump in foreclosures in the southern part of 
the state where defense-related job cutbacks are still occurring. 
However, stronger residential markets exist in other district states 
such as Oregon, Utah and Idaho. A majority of districts noted that 
multi-family housing starts have been flat. Most banks report 
relatively slow nonresidential construction activity, a major 
exception being Minnesota where there has been a substantial 
increase in awards for infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and 
water/sewer construction and where the building of casinos and new 
motel space is underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several districts have reported a slight increase in overall loan 
demand in recent weeks. Mortgage refinancing activity, however, 
seems to have peaked in a number of areas. Philadelphia noted that 
some banks saw a recent pickup in commercial and industrial loans 
and that consumer lending was level or increasing. Atlanta banks 
reported loan demand as flat or slightly higher with some increase 
in consumer loan activity. A few large banks in Cleveland saw a 
step-up in business loans in recent weeks though, as in several 
other districts, the most active part of the market continued to be 
residential mortgages. St. Louis and Kansas City also reported a 
recent increase in loans outstanding with business, real estate and 
consumer loans up in St. Louis and most categories stronger in 
Kansas City. Overall loan demand remained sluggish in New York where 
demand for business loans declined, and Dallas noted a softening of 
loan demand that some bankers attributed to business borrower 
caution about the near-term economic outlook. Financial conditions 
were mixed in the San Francisco District. There was weakness in 
California, where consumer loan demand continues to drop and 
commercial loan demand is weak, but brisk demand for mortgage loans 
in Utah from consumers upgrading their housing and from continued 
migration into the state. With regard to the outlook, bankers in 
Dallas expect business loan demand to rise slowly and Miami 
anticipates some increase in loan demand from the process of 
hurricane rebuilding. Philadelphia bankers say the outlook is 
uncertain and none predicted accelerated growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cool and damp weather continued to delay harvests in much of the 
nation. In Richmond the harvesting of summer crops and the planting 
of small grains were slower than normal as unseasonably cool weather 
delayed the maturing of corn and soybeans. Minneapolis notes that an 
unusually cool and wet growing season delayed crop maturity and 
continues to retard harvest operations, but that yields for all 
major crops except soybeans are generally excellent. Cool weather 
also impaired the growth of late-planted crops in Dallas and 
production estimates have been reduced slightly as a result. In 
Kansas City, however, corn, soybean and milo yields are generally 
larger than normal while cotton and peanut yields are near normal. 
In addition, the planting of winter wheat is nearly complete in that 
district and the crop is generally in good condition. The soybean 
harvest was at a near-normal pace in the Chicago district except in 
Michigan where rain slowed harvesting. Progress with the corn 
harvest has been considerably slower than normal due to the high 
moisture content of this year's crop. The cotton harvest in St. 
Louis was hampered by adverse weather conditions, but good to 
excellent yields are reported for corn, soybeans and rice. 
California reports that while parts of the district are experiencing 
drought, sunny weather has helped tree crops such as apples and 
cherries whose production is well above last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mining has been lackluster in Minneapolis with low prices for gold 
and copper and slack demand for iron ore. Aluminum production 
remains high in California despite sharply falling prices but the 
output of forest products continues low. The surge in domestic 
demand for plywood resulting from recent hurricane damage has 
apparently subsided and shipments to Japan and other Pacific Basin 
countries remain down.
