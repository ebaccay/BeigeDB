     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 19, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity is expanding more slowly or declining in most 
Federal Reserve districts, but several districts report continued, 
modest growth. Weakness is most apparent in the northeastern and 
mid-Atlantic districts. Although patterns of consumer spending vary 
widely among districts, rates of increase are generally slowing. The 
districts' assessments of manufacturing activity range from moderate 
expansion to absolute declines. On average, however, there seems to 
be little movement in orders or production. Signs of a construction 
downturn are widespread, but not universal. While drought persists 
in some agricultural areas, soil moisture conditions are good or at 
least improved in most reporting districts. So far, the recent 
increase in oil prices has not affected domestic oil and gas 
drilling. Several district reports of credit markets focus on soft 
loan demand and some district banks offer examples of tighter credit 
conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales patterns vary widely among districts, but growth 
appears to be ebbing. While Minneapolis cites "good" sales 
increases, Atlanta and Boston note flat to modest expansion. New 
York and Philadelphia report absolute declines in dollar volumes 
from a year earlier. Sales of big ticket items are said to be 
particularly soft, but clothing sales continue to show strength in 
some districts. Several districts mention the negative impacts of 
higher oil prices. Despite demand weakness in some districts, most 
retailers say their inventories are at desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are up in Minneapolis and Cleveland but are weak or 
slowing in Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. One 
district says that credit tightening has caused some potential auto 
buyers difficulty in finding financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for manufactured products shows little overall change in 
either direction. Minneapolis and San Francisco characterize their 
manufacturing sectors' performances as mixed, while growth in 
Atlanta is moderate except for construction and auto-related 
products. Orders to Boston, Richmond and Philadelphia firms are 
down, and sales have not changed lately in the Dallas District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales patterns differ greatly among industries. Atlanta, Chicago, 
Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco mention strength in demand for 
primary metals, while Boston and Dallas note weakness in orders for 
computer, and some construction-related products. Some districts 
report increased producer uncertainty about future demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      In some cases, export demand appears to be stronger than domestic 
sales. Richmond notes exports of manufactures as among the few 
district manufacturing indicators that are not negative. Minneapolis 
says that strong foreign demand for producers' equipment has more 
than compensated for declines in domestic orders. In the Boston 
district, however, export sales are below a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to changing costs of operation, a number of districts 
cite rising freight costs in the wake of energy price hikes. Several 
districts, including Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago report 
increasing prices of inputs, but Atlanta reports prices of 
industrial commodities as steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      References to declining construction activity and weakening real 
estate markets are common. Increases in homebuilding in the Dallas 
and Minneapolis markets are exceptions, but Minneapolis also notes 
marked declines in overall construction contract values in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area. While Kansas City mentions recent upturns 
in housing starts, homebuilding there remains below a year earlier. 
According to the San Francisco report, construction activity is 
slowing in many parts of the west. Moreover, Boston, Chicago, St. 
Louis and New York all refer to weakening residential construction 
or weak housing sales and Cleveland notes high office and retail 
vacancy rates. Several reports say that respondents expect continued 
construction weakness in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on agricultural production are generally positive, in part, 
because the soil moisture problems mentioned in the last beige book 
have ameliorated. In the Richmond District, rainfall in August was 
mostly above normal and soil moisture levels are now said to be 
adequate, but the dry weather in June has lowered corn yields. The 
Dallas District reports that rainfall has improved soil conditions 
there. Crop conditions are also good in the Chicago, Kansas City and 
Minneapolis districts. Inadequate soil moisture continues to impede 
crop development in portions of the St. Louis district. The St. 
Louis and Dallas districts discuss the negative effects upon rice 
prices of the embargo on sales to Iraq. St. Louis also notes that 
recent increases in freight and insurance costs have discouraged 
exports to other Middle Eastern countries. Several district reports 
mention generally falling grain prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite marked increases in oil prices in the wake of Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait, reporting districts say they have seen few 
effects on drilling so far. Dallas and Kansas City note recent 
declines in drilling activity, although the rig count remains above 
a year earlier in both districts. Moreover, industry observers in 
both districts say they do not expect the recent price shock to have 
much of an effect until oil prices remain high for an extended 
period and natural gas prices rise as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reporting districts say that lending activity is soft. Atlanta, 
Cleveland, and Philadelphia all mention recent slowdowns in lending, 
while New York notes signs of weaker demand for business loans. St. 
Louis cites slow loan growth at the large banks, but Kansas City 
district bankers report moderate increases in loan demand - 
including demand for commercial and industrial, consumer, and home 
mortgage loans. Financial organizations in several districts note 
tightening credit policies for at least some borrower groups. Banks' 
and thrifts' concerns over the viability of economic growth is said 
to have discouraged some lending.
