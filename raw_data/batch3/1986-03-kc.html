      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 20,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Both current economic activity and the economic outlook have 
improved recently in the Tenth District, apart from the difficulties 
of the agricultural and energy sectors. Retailers report improved 
sales and expect further increases. Auto dealers remain optimistic 
about 1986 sales. While inventories of materials inputs are 
generally satisfactory, some retail inventories are still viewed as 
too large. Host area homebuilders expect further increases in 
housing starts, as mortgage demand increases with further rate 
declines. Tenth District banks report increased deposits but little 
change in loans. Agricultural lenders continue to deny credit to a 
significant proportion of farm borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for sales, prices, and inventory purchases appears 
bright. Retailers report moderate to strong increases in sales over 
year-ago levels and flat to slightly improved sales over the last 
three months. Women's apparel and fine jewelry sales have been 
strong. Sales are expected to rise moderately through 1986. Prices 
have been reduced slightly and are expected to stabilize. Inventory 
levels are satisfactory to heavy, leading retailers to expect steady 
to slightly reduced inventory purchases for the remainder of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although auto sales are below year-ago levels, dealers are 
optimistic about 1986 sales. Good credit market conditions are 
helping auto sales. Most dealers report adequate inventory levels, 
although some report that inventories are too high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most purchasing agents surveyed experienced a slight increase in the 
prices of their major inputs over the year ago period, and they 
expect prices to increase by 2 to 4 percent during the remainder of 
1986. Although some firms are satisfied with current materials 
inventory levels, most have been trimming inventories in recent 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area homebuilders report that starts of single family dwellings have 
increased over the year ago period, while multi-family starts have 
declined. Sales of new homes are above year ago levels, and new home 
prices have remained steady. Most area homebuilders expect housing 
starts to increase slightly during the remainder of this year. 
Housing materials availability is good, prices are steady, no slow 
delivery problems are reported, and these conditions are expected to 
continue throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan institutions give mixed reports regarding current 
savings inflows relative to a year earlier, but they expect savings 
inflows to increase slightly during the next quarter. Mortgage 
demand has increased, primarily because the demand for refinancing 
has increased. Mortgage demand is expected to increase further 
during the upcoming spring and summer home buying season. Mortgage 
rates have been declining, and most respondents expect rates to 
remain at their current level or fall a little further. Most savings 
institutions have not taken advantage of the opportunity to reduce 
the minimum deposits on MMDA's, Super NOW accounts, and 7-31 day 
CD's.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand was mixed and total deposits were higher at Tenth 
District banks compared with a month earlier. Consumer loans, 
commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans, and 
agricultural loans were generally constant. Commercial real estate 
lending decreased at most of the banks surveyed. Tenth District 
bankers did not change their prime rate during the last month, but 
more than half of those surveyed expect their prime rate to fall in 
the near term. Most respondents either lowered their consumer loan 
rates during the last month or anticipate lowering those rates in 
the near future. Total deposits rose at Tenth District banks, with 
MMDA's and seasonal increases In IRA's and Keogh accounts leading 
the way. Most respondents report higher or unchanged levels of large 
CDs. NOW accounts and small time deposits typically were constant. 
Passbook savings accounts and demand deposits were unchanged or 
lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many commercial lenders in the district have nearly completed credit 
reviews of their farm borrowers, but the results are mixed. On 
average, bankers reported that 6 to 8 percent of their farm 
borrowers will be denied credit this spring, a percentage at least 
as high as a year ago. However, bankers in some states said a lower 
percentage of their farm borrowers would be denied credit, 
apparently because a large number of bad loans were written off 
during the past year. Farm Credit System outlets in the district are 
less than halfway through their credit reviews, but reported that 
perhaps 10 percent of their farm borrowers will not get credit this 
spring. Both the Farm Credit System and commercial banks referred 
more of their farm borrowers to the Farmers' Home Administration 
(FmHA) than a year ago. Because it is extremely difficult to qualify 
for direct loans from FinflA, referred borrowers have been 
encouraged to apply for FmHA loan guarantees.
     </p>
     <p>
      All lenders surveyed had acquired a substantial amount of farm real 
estate through foreclosure. Most bankers reported that they would 
sell acquired property if they could do so without taking a loss. 
Only a few lenders said they are selling land as soon as possible 
after foreclosure, regardless of price. Others expressed concern 
about "flooding the market." In the meantime, many banks are leasing 
acquired farmland.
