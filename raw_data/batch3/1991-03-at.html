      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from businesses contacted in February were more mixed than 
has been the case in recent months. While manufacturing activity 
levels were below or barely equal to those seen a year ago, several 
retailers and residential realtors have seen either a bottoming out 
or slight pickup in recent weeks. Producers in construction- and 
transportation-related industries reported no signs of improvement. 
Some current offset in the generally weak construction sector is 
provided by work on a number of large industrial and government 
projects, and rising home sales. Industries related to agriculture 
and energy are experiencing growth or remain stable. Oil price 
declines this year have allowed some farms to restore profit margins 
and others to lower prices. Reports from bankers indicate that 
consumer and commercial lending remains sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that sales dropped dramatically during the first 
week of the Gulf war but that they rebounded after that time. 
Overall, retailers said that January and early February retail sales 
fell below or only equaled last year's levels. Contacts reported 
that durable goods sales continued to decline, and a few contacts 
noted a drop in their historically strong catalog business. Most 
merchants said they were cautiously ordering durables because they 
expected sales to be lackluster at least until spring. However, 
discount stores continued to report strong sales, particularly for 
nondurables, and were ordering more aggressively than last year. 
Auto dealers, meanwhile, have reported improved sales recently 
following an initial deep plunge at the beginning of the war. An 
Atlanta dealer emphatically said "we have seen the bottom." The 
convention business in Atlanta and Orlando is reported to be down 
while New Orleans' convention attendance levels are up slightly from 
"solid" year-earlier figures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers in several important regional industries report declining 
or flat sales in January and early February compared to year end; 
they say that soft orders suggest that improvement is not yet 
imminent. Declining orders caused a heating and air conditioning 
company to reduce its 1991 sales forecast by 5 percent recently, and 
cut its employment level by 10 percent. Home furnishings 
manufacturers, textile and auto producers, and auto parts 
manufacturers say that they are responding to bleak sales with 
further layoffs and plant closings. A jet engine parts maker, 
previously producing near capacity, reports that expected airline 
and military spending cuts will result in a significant number of 
layoffs at its southeastern plants. Formerly strong exports of pulp, 
paper, and chemicals now are reported to be softening. This export 
slowdown is reflected in a report by a power generation equipment 
producer which indicates that new orders from pulp and paper 
producers are down. Generally, businesses report cutbacks in capital 
spending, though a majority say these are temporary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other significant industries report stable or growing sales. 
Producers of military boots and camouflage apparel say their order 
backlogs have lengthened and that they are expanding their work 
forces in order to fulfill growing military demand. Contacts say 
that stronger markets for agricultural products have strengthened 
sales of fertilizer and other farm supplies. A sugar processor says 
that its 1990 sales were up 18 percent from 1989. A poultry-
processing firm reports that stronger demand for its product by fast 
food stores has bolstered production and sales. Oil producing 
activity reportedly has remained stable throughout the steep price 
swings of the past half year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers report flat business and consumer loan demand in January and 
early February compared to the last reporting period, and attribute 
it to a general lack of confidence in the economy. Contacts say that 
commercial loans were flat because firms have maintained low 
inventories and reduced capital spending. However, a major regional 
bank's working capital lines are reported to be growing due to its 
easing of credit terms. Banking contacts say that lending conditions 
still are tight for some borrowers, particularly for real estate 
development. Borrowers representing stable industries such as 
utilities report that credit market conditions are favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction and homebuilding activity across the region 
remain at levels well below those of a year ago and of recent 
months. Commercial construction, except for a number of industrial 
projects, was described as "dead" by a large building materials 
manufacturing company that has already cut its work force by 30 
percent over the past year. According to other contacts, a number of 
large highway and other government construction projects that are 
underway across the region should offset some of the weakness in 
commercial construction. Additionally, realtors report improvements 
in existing home sales in January and February, and they indicate 
that overall home sales probably have bottomed out.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent oil price declines have been passed through to customers in 
industries with automatic adjustment clauses such as utilities and 
some transportation companies. Others, however, are still putting 
through lagged adjustments to earlier increases. Prices for 
fertilizers and some other energy-intensive products are even 
reported to be rising. Contacts in some transportation companies say 
they are rebuilding previously squeezed profit margins. A 
refrigeration machinery company contact reports that his suppliers 
seem to be benefiting from lower energy costs and are holding prices 
steady. Business contacts generally report easing wage pressures. 
Technical workers such as welders still are reported to be scarce in 
Louisiana while there is a growing pool of plumbers, electricians, 
and other building trades workers in the region due to 
construction's decline.
