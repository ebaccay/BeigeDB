      Beige Book Report: San Francisco

     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Twelfth District remain mixed. In 
California, activity has stabilized at a low level and shows signs 
of improvement in some areas. In Idaho, Nevada, and Utah, states 
which have experienced very rapid growth, activity remains high, but 
business leaders generally expect more moderate growth over the 
coming year. Currently, retail sales appear to be increasing, and 
demand for services is holding up. Manufacturing conditions continue 
to improve. Agricultural output is expected to be high this season. 
Real estate and construction activity remains strong overall, 
particularly outside California, but residential sales and 
construction have slowed recently in some areas. Loan demand remains 
strong in most of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District business leaders generally remain optimistic, but 
they expect some slowing in interest-sensitive sectors, such as 
housing and business investment. For the national economy, about 
half of the respondents still expect growth to exceed 2 1/2 percent 
during the next four quarters. For most of the district outside 
California, regional growth is expected to exceed the national 
average However, most California respondents still expect growth 
there to remain weaker than for the nation over the next four 
quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of some further improvement in retail and service sector 
conditions were received from most of the District. Retail sales 
increased moderately in California's Central Valley and Orange 
County, and sales also were up slightly in Los Angeles. In the 
Intermountain states, retail sales remained strong, especially for 
durable goods. New car sales in Idaho were up 12 percent in July 
from the level of a year earlier. In Idaho, Oregon, and Utah, auto 
dealers are concerned that slow deliveries of some 1995 model year 
cars might create shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism remains strong in most of the District. Car rental agencies 
in Salt Lake City rented their entire inventory for each of the 
first three weeks of August. In California, tourism has been strong, 
reportedly buoyed by an influx of foreign tourists who are taking 
advantage of the continuing weakness of the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maritime industry business is stable. Some weakness in employment is 
reported in other service-providing industries; a California 
telecommunications utility reports further downsizing of employment, 
as rapid technological advances permit investment in better 
equipment at lower prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      More broadly, labor demand appears to be accelerating a bit in the 
District, as indicated by reported increases in help-wanted 
advertising at newspapers. Outside of California, some labor markets 
show signs of tightness. An Oregon bank reports increased difficulty 
filling part-time positions. A multi-state construction firm reports 
that the shortage of skilled construction workers is worsening. A 
Utah retailer reports unusual increases in wages for entry-level 
jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing conditions appear to be improving, although activity 
remains at low levels in some industries. One aerospace supplier 
reports that its backlog has increased in the past twelve months, 
but the backlog remains well below the level of two years ago. A 
computer manufacturer reports strong orders, partly in response to 
continued price cuts. An electronic components manufacturer reports 
that increasing wages have not been passed on to prices, as rapid 
productivity growth has held down unit labor costs. Aluminum 
manufacturers are reported to be operating at 85 to 90 percent 
capacity, with order lead times increasing and ingot prices up 36 
percent from the beginning of the year. Pulp and paper product 
orders continue to strengthen; inventories are reported low and
prices are up sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural production appears to be increasing, but farm income is 
being held down by weak prices for some crops. Idaho's potato crop 
is reported excellent despite drought conditions. A bumper crop of 
grain is reported to be holding down prices, and the outlook for the 
corn crop is especially good. Beef production, as measured by the 
weight of cattle in feed lots, is strong. In California, prices for 
grapes and tree fruits have fallen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Uncertainties created by domestic mining law reform are reported to 
be driving some mining exploration activity overseas. In Nevada, 
several mining exploration offices have closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In parts of the District, real estate and construction activity 
appears to have slowed a bit in recent months. In some areas, home 
sales are reported to have slowed recently from the rapid pace set 
earlier this year. In the Intermountain and Pacific Northwest 
states, reports suggest that the slowing of home sales is 
concentrated at the higher end of the market. A slowing of home 
sales also is reported for California's Central Valley. In Northern 
and Southern California, increases in existing home sales are 
reported, although overall prices are relatively flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity generally remains strong outside California. 
In Seattle, commercial occupancy rates are increasing, and there is 
a growing shortage of light industrial facilities. In southwestern 
Utah, Idaho, eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington, residential 
construction has remained particularly strong. Single-family home 
construction is reported to have slowed recently in a few areas, 
particularly Portland and Salt Lake City. In California, both 
residential and commercial construction activity remain low. In 
Southern California, rents for commercial real estate still are 
weak, but occupancy rates have improved somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking conditions generally are strong, with a slight 
slowdown in mortgage lending being softened by a shift towards 
adjustable-rate loans. Banks in California's Central Valley are 
reported to be doing well, with good deposit growth and modest loan 
growth. Credit supply conditions in Northern California are 
competitive. Outside California, commercial and consumer loan growth 
is reported rapid in Arizona, steady in Nevada, and leveling off in 
Utah.
