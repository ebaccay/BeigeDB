      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 3, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District economic conditions have been generally good. The 
employment situation has been very good throughout the district. 
Consumer spending has been generally strong, although automobile 
sales have declined sharply. There has been some concern about 
rising prices. Conditions in resource-related industries have been 
good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The employment situation has been very good throughout the district. 
The unemployment rate in Minnesota in February was 4.9 percent, 0.2 
percentage points lower than in January and 0.1 percentage points 
lower than in February 1988. The unemployment rate in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area dropped to 3.8 percent In 
February from 3.9 percent in January. Although labor market 
conditions are generally strong in Minnesota, a large computer 
manufacturing company closed its supercomputer division located in 
St. Paul and dismissed approximately 800 workers. The move was part 
of a nationwide cutback by the firm, which cost 3,100 workers their 
jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The unemployment rate in North Dakota was 5.3 percent in February, 
down from 5.8 percent in January and 5.7 percent in February 1988. 
The unemployment rate in South Dakota was 4.5 percent In February, 
slightly lower than the 4.6 percent rate of February 1988. The 
unemployment rate in Montana was 6.4 percent in December 1988, up 
from 6.0 percent in November 1988. The unemployment rate in the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan was 11.2 percent in January, up from 9.7 
percent in December 1988 but down from the 13.9 percent rate in 
January 1988. A director notes that labor markets in western 
Wisconsin are tight, especially in the service sector, and that 
unemployment rates in the area are at their lowest levels for this 
decade.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending on general merchandise has been fairly strong. One 
retailer reports strong sales in February and March with some signs 
of softening in early April. Another retailer reports that sales in 
March were up 14 percent over March 1988 and that year-to-date sales 
were up 15 percent from the comparable period of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car sales were down sharply from last year but truck sales held 
their own. Dealers for one domestic manufacturer report that car 
sales in March were 27 percent lower than in March 1988 and year-to-
date sales were 15 percent lower than in the comparable period last 
year. However, they report that truck sales were 12 percent higher 
in March compared to March 1988 and 0.07 percentage points higher on 
a year-to-date basis. A dealer in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
metropolitan area who sells cars from a number of manufacturers 
reports that the first three months of 1989 have been the worst in 
over twenty years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity has been stable. The number of new housing permits 
issued in Minnesota was 24 percent higher in February than in 
January, although it was down 20 percent from February 1988. Home 
sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were 11.4 percent higher in 
March from a year ago, although they were up only 1.2 percent on a 
year-to-date basis. Reports from Montana and South Dakota suggest 
that although new construction is slow, a substantial number of 
houses are being remodeled and upgraded.
     </p>
     <p>
      A director surveyed several firms in a number of industries, from 
manufacturing through wholesaling, retailing, and contracting, and 
found that over 50 percent of the firms projected an increase in 
sales for the next year. Manufacturing firms, in particular, were 
very optimistic, In addition, two of the five manufacturers who were 
separately contacted reported plans to expand capacity this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is some evidence of inflationary pressures in the Ninth 
District. An index of prices received by Minnesota farmers was 3 
percent higher in March than in February and 18 percent higher than 
in March 1988. Unleaded gasoline prices in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
metropolitan area were 12 percent higher In April than a year ago. A 
director reports that manufacturers have recently raised prices 
fairly sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in resource-related industries have been generally good. 
Reflecting the rise in prices received by farmers, the average value 
of Minnesota farmland rose by 9 percent during the year ending July 
1988. Farmland values rose in all parts of the state except 
northeastern Minnesota. The greatest gain, 17 percent, was in the 
southwestern part of the state. Agricultural areas throughout the 
district reported adequate snowfall in the winter. Soil moisture 
levels were slowly recovering from the effect of last year's 
drought. Flooding in the Red River Valley of North Dakota has 
increased soil moisture content in that area. However, farmers in 
South Dakota continued to be concerned over low soil moisture 
levels. The district's lumber industry continued to enjoy strong 
demand for its products. The major problem facing the lumber 
industry has been ensuring adequate supplies of raw materials. 
Environmental concern has delayed logging activity. A large paper 
products manufacturer plans to expand its facilities in Minnesota, 
adding about 190 permanent jobs and employing up to 2,000 people 
during construction. Mining activity in Montana and the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan continued to be strong.
