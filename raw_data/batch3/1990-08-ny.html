      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments have been mixed to somewhat soft in the Second District 
economy since the last report. On the positive side, District 
unemployment rates have remained below the national average. 
Retailers have had varied sales results. Despite a decided pickup in 
office leasing activity, vacancy rates in Manhattan have moved 
somewhat higher and homebuilding activity has weakened in much of 
the District. Based on a survey of small and medium-sized banks, 
demand for both residential and commercial real estate loans is 
weaker than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of District department store sales was mixed in recent 
weeks. Some contacts reported that sales were well below plan but 
results at other chains met expectations. Moreover, sales in Buffalo 
and some other upstate areas are reportedly being bolstered by an 
influx of Canadian buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      During June, over-the-year changes in sales ranged from -7.3 percent 
to +7.4 percent. Some New York City retailers with disappointing 
results expressed concern that the local economy may be in a 
downturn and were not optimistic about any near-term improvement. 
One cited the continuing layoffs at banks and brokerage firms, the 
disarray in the retail industry, and the weak real estate market as 
major factors in the slowdown.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of home furnishings and men's apparel were most frequently 
cited as weak, while over-the-year gains in some types of women's 
apparel were widespread. Inventories remain satisfactory due 
primarily to careful monitoring. Some stores in bankruptcy or with 
substantial debt noted an improvement in their level of stocks due 
to less reluctance on the part of manufacturers to supply them. In 
Manhattan the space vacated on Fifth Avenue by a recently failed 
chain has just been leased by the largest department store company 
in France.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity in the Second District weakened somewhat 
further in recent weeks. Upstate New York areas where the pace of 
construction had previously remained strong are now reporting a 
slowdown and the New York metropolitan area and northern New Jersey 
showed no improvement. While the shortage of credit for acquisition 
and construction loans appears to be spreading, several respondents 
stated that the continuing glut of homes for resale is also a major 
deterrent to new construction. Prices on resale homes have declined 
but apparently are still unacceptably high in many cases. Demand for 
lower priced, "affordable" housing remains strong however, though 
the available supply is limited.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite a decided pickup in office leasing activity during recent 
weeks, in part because of declining rents and other concessions, 
vacancy rates in both midtown and downtown Manhattan moved somewhat 
higher primarily as a result of a continuing contraction by 
financial service firms and the relocation of some companies to 
other areas. Elsewhere in the District, vacancy rates have recently 
declined in Fairfield County and have stabilized in Westchester 
County and northern New Jersey as a result of strong leasing 
activity and a slowdown in new office completions. Since few new 
office projects are being proposed given the more than ample supply 
of space in the District, a shortage of credit seems to be less of a 
problem in this market than among homebuilders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates in June were unchanged from May and 
remained somewhat below the national average. New Jersey's rate was 
4.8 percent and New York State's 5.1 percent. The employment 
situation is even stronger in western New York where the 
unemployment rate declined in May to 4.6 percent in Buffalo and 3.6 
percent in Rochester. However, two recent announcements cast a cloud 
on the employment outlook. Fisher-Price Toys plans to close a 
Buffalo area plant by the beginning of November, eliminating more 
than 700 jobs. In addition, Maxwell House plans to close its coffee-
processing plant in Hoboken, New Jersey, that city's largest 
industrial employer with 600 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The June Rochester purchasing managers' survey described local 
conditions as stable. With regard to the outlook, 47 percent of 
respondents expect conditions to improve over the next three months 
compared with only 9 percent in June 1989. In Buffalo the percentage 
of purchasing managers reporting a rise in output increased while 
the percentage of firms with higher new orders showed little change 
from May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Based on a survey of small and medium-sized banks in the Second 
District, demand for both residential and commercial real estate 
loans is weaker than a year ago. Two bankers stated that local real 
estate prices are inflated and that the market is currently 
undergoing an adjustment. With regard to supply, a majority of 
bankers characterized their real estate lending practices as tighter 
than three months ago. Although only two had changed their 
qualifications for accepting loans, many are placing more scrutiny 
on existing qualification requirements. In particular, several banks 
are evaluating property appraisals more carefully and one banker 
reported placing an increased emphasis on the cash flow and net 
worth of borrowers. Only two bankers have lowered their maximum 
loan-to-value ratio, and none of those surveyed had changed the 
spread between the interest rate they charge on real estate loans 
and their benchmark rate. Three bankers reported declines in real 
estate loans as a share of all loans at their institutions. One 
mentioned that his bank had increased its advertising for consumer 
installment lending, hoping that it will be a safer market in which 
to make loans. Several bankers noted that an oversupply of 
commercial and residential development has led to an increase in 
both commercial and residential vacancy rates over the past year and 
that real estate prices have fallen as well. Two bankers stated that 
the drop in prices may result in a leveling off or perhaps a slight 
increase in real estate loan demand over the next year.
