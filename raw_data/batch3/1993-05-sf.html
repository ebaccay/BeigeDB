      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakness in California continues to hold down overall District 
economic activity, but generally favorable conditions are reported 
in most other District states. In California, job cutbacks in 
aerospace and defense-related manufacturing are combining with 
recently proposed military base closings to hurt consumer confidence 
and economic activity in many areas. Conditions remain sluggish in 
the state across a broad range of industries. Layoffs in aerospace 
also are slowing growth in western Washington. Outside of these 
regions, growth is reported in several sectors, with the strongest 
conditions reported in eastern Washington, Utah, and Idaho. Overall 
business sentiment was little changed from our last report but 
remains generally favorable, and recent rains have improved District 
agricultural prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders, which had 
improved steadily since the last half of 1992, is showing some signs 
of leveling off. Two-thirds of our respondents now expect the real 
economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate of at 
least 2.5 percent. This proportion is down from three-quarters in 
March but up from one-half in January and one-third in November. In 
general, contacts from Idaho, Oregon, and Utah expect their regions 
to perform slightly better than the national average. Most contacts 
in California and Washington, however, expect their region to 
underperform the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer sentiment remains weak in California, with several contacts 
reporting that concern over job security is negatively affecting 
consumer spending. One national retailer reports that retail sales 
are continuing soft; April looks slightly better than March, but the 
West Coast trend is definitely softer than in the Midwest or East 
Coast. Contacts in California report that small retail and service 
establishments near military bases are nervous about their long-term 
prospects. The visitor industry in southern California is reported 
to be depressed. In northern California, a contact reports that 
layoffs are continuing in the legal services industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Somewhat stronger conditions are reported in most other District 
markets, with consumer confidence noticeably more robust than in 
California. Contacts report stable or strengthening conditions in 
Idaho, Utah, and Oregon. In Idaho, for example, new vehicle 
registrations during March were up 26 percent over a year earlier. 
In Washington, however, consumer confidence is reported down due to 
aerospace cutbacks, adversely affecting retail trade and sales. A 
contact in the Washington legal industry also reports weak 
conditions. A contact in eastern Washington, however, reports that 
the region is benefiting from increased federal spending on nuclear 
cleanup projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cutbacks in aerospace and defense continue to dampen District 
manufacturing activity-particularly in California and Washington. 
Most recently, a major defense manufacturer announced the further 
consolidation of production activity from several sites in southern 
California to Tucson. The move will result in the transfer of 2,000 
workers by the end of next year and ultimately eliminate more than 
6,000 jobs company-wide. In Washington, cutbacks at Boeing are 
proceeding. Newly announced airplane orders from China, however, are 
partially offsetting weak demand from domestic airlines. A contact 
in the aluminum industry reports high inventories and soft prices of 
aluminum, due to both weak demand and increased supply from Russia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stronger conditions exist in other sectors. A contact from Silicon 
Valley reports that orders are strong in several segments of the 
electronics industry, although there are signs that the peak in 
growth rates may be past. Contacts from Idaho and Utah report both 
strong demand and tightening inventories for heavy and construction 
equipment. No major delivery problems are reported, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent precipitation has improved prospects for irrigation water in 
several states. Grazing conditions are reported excellent, and 
livestock conditions are good. Prices are reported strong for cattle 
and several other agricultural products. Capacity constraints have 
eased in lumber and plywood, with lumber price dropping 20 percent 
from the March peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District nonresidential real estate and construction shows some 
signs of bottoming out, although activity remains depressed in 
several markets. A contact in southern California reports little 
change in conditions, with commercial construction activity down 
nearly 50 percent from three years ago. In northern California, a 
contact reports that rents have stabilized, and that commercial real 
estate prices should be at or near the bottom. In Utah, the overall 
office vacancy dropped from 21 percent to 16 percent in the Salt 
Lake City market, showing considerable absorption over the past 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The residential sector is showing more strength. Home building in 
southern Arizona is reported very strong, in part due to the shift 
of aerospace jobs from southern California to Tucson. Contacts also 
report that Utah and Idaho are experiencing a continued boom in 
residential construction and sales. Some shortage of lumber and 
construction labor is noted. In California, contacts report some 
pick up in real estate activity due to lower interest rates and 
decreased home prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mixed conditions are reported across District financial markets. In 
California, contacts report continued weak loan demand. A contact in 
Washington reports a sharp drop in commercial and agricultural loan 
requests in the last two quarters. In contrast, contacts report that 
the banking industry in Arizona continues to show significant 
improvement and that conditions in Utah remain strong. In Oregon, a 
contact reports increased demand for credit during March and strong 
profits.
