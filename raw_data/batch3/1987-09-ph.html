      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy is showing signs of moderate expansion in 
August. Manufacturing activity expanded and factory employment has 
increased for the second month in a row. While reports from 
retailers vary, most are satisfied with the year-over-year gains 
they have achieved this summer, and auto sales, although down from 
last year, have picked up in recent weeks. Commercial bankers 
indicate that business and real estate lending is growing, but 
consumer lending has slowed recently. Realtors say commercial 
markets are generally healthy but residential sales have declined as 
fewer houses are coming on the market. Both residential and 
nonresidential construction are slowing from the substantial pace 
set in the last few years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is for further 
modest growth. Manufacturers expect expanding activity, although 
they are not planning major increases in payrolls. Retailers are 
cautiously optimistic for fall. Commercial bank credit officers 
foresee steady growth in business lending but expect consumer loan 
volume to remain relatively flat. Commercial realtors believe the 
new office space coming on line in the next few years will be 
absorbed without seriously weakening the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's industrial sector is making gains, according to the 
latest Business Outlook Survey. Nearly 39 percent of the local 
manufacturers polled in August reported that business picked up from 
July, only 7 percent noted a slowdown, and 55 percent said they were 
operating at a steady pace. Durable goods producers and non-durables 
goods makers reported similar business conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most measures of industrial activity were giving positive readings 
in August. New orders and shipments rose, and delivery times 
increased fractionally for the first time this year. Employment 
posted another gain in August, building on July's increase. Although 
79 percent of the companies reported steady payrolls, 17 percent 
added workers, while only 4 percent made cuts. Local manufacturers' 
order backlogs did not share in the general improvement, however, 
remaining virtually unchanged from July, overall. On the price 
front, most of the August survey participants are holding the line 
for their own products; and, although 37 percent say prices for 
purchased goods have gone up since July, 61 percent reported no 
change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, local manufacturers have mostly positive views. 
Forty-two percent of the August survey respondents predict 
improvement over the next six months, 39 percent expect steady 
conditions, and 20 percent anticipate a slowdown. On balance, area 
industrial companies foresee increases in orders and shipments, but 
they do not expect order backlogs to grow; and, despite recent gains 
in employment, survey respondents are not planning for further 
significant changes in payrolls. With regard to prices, nearly two-
thirds of the respondents predict a further rise in input costs over 
the next six months, while only about one-third plan to raise the 
prices of the goods they make.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales reports from Third District retailers in late August varied 
from "extraordinarily good" to "below plan," although few merchants 
expressed disappointment with results for the summer as a whole. 
Most product lines are performing well, but store officials say the 
late date for Labor Day this year appears to be delaying back-to-
school purchases. Store officials say they are guardedly optimistic 
for the balance of the year, and most will enter the fall with 
relatively lean inventories. They expect consumers to put off 
Christmas shopping until late, a practice that has taken hold in 
recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers say sales for the year so far are below last 
year's pace, with the exception of a few popular models; but 
increases in gross revenue (total sales less cost of cars) have 
helped to keep dealer net profits from slipping as much as unit 
sales. Sales have picked up in recent weeks in response to the 
latest round of manufacturers' financing incentives.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth at major Third District banks continues to moderate. 
Growth has been slowing since February, and in early August total 
volume outstanding was approximately 7 percent above the year-ago 
level. Real estate lending remains strong, but growth in commercial 
and industrial lending has been moderating, and consumer lending has 
actually declined. Personal loan volume outstanding in the first 
week of August was nearly 2 percent below the peak level in May. 
Bank lending officers say consumer installment lending, in 
particular, has been declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial bank credit officers expect business lending to grow 
moderately over the next few months, and some believe faster growth 
is likely with improving conditions for the region's manufacturers. 
All are in agreement, however, that competition in middle market 
lending is strong and that net interest margins will remain under 
pressure as more regional banks focus on this market and reduce 
their participation in loans to larger borrowers in the national 
market. For consumer lending, there is a consensus that little 
growth can be expected; bankers generally believe consumers will 
bring their spending into line with personal income and make fewer 
credit purchases in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although commercial construction in Delaware is declining sharply as 
the state's recent office building boom passes its peak, commercial 
construction and leasing is healthy in most parts of the Third 
District. Several new office buildings have been completed in the 
Philadelphia central business district this year and more are 
scheduled for completion over the next three years. Realtors say the 
new buildings are being leased relatively easily. Older buildings, 
however, are losing tenants at a rate that slightly more than 
offsets increases in occupancy of new buildings, resulting in a 
small increase in the total office vacancy rate. Nevertheless, most 
realtors believe the new space coming on the market in the next 
three years will be readily absorbed and that overall vacancy rates 
will not rise to glut proportions.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Third District suburban areas office vacancy rates are stable or 
declining as leasing activity picks up and construction slows down. 
Following on office and residential development in the suburbs, 
hotel and retail space is now in demand. Realtors say recent and 
prospective completions of major highway links in the suburbs are 
boosting interest in all types of commercial real estate in these 
areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contractors in some parts of the Third District say housing starts 
have fallen due to labor shortages, with the number of skilled 
framers, carpenters, and construction superintendents in particular 
falling short of demand. Residential building permits have been 
declining in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but have risen 
substantially in Delaware. Residential realtors say sales of both 
new and existing homes are tapering off as fewer houses in both 
categories are being put on the market. They report that selling 
prices continue to rise.
