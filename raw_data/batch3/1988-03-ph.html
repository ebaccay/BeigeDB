      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy in early March was making only modest 
progress. Manufacturing activity was advancing marginally and retail 
sales were level with, or slightly above, the pace of the year-ago 
period. Auto sales are considerably higher than they were in early 
1987, although the increase is less than dealers had expected. Banks 
report very little growth in consumer loans, but note an improvement 
in commercial lending; real estate lending remains strong. 
Commercial real estate markets are softening in some suburban areas 
but are otherwise healthy. Residential real estate activity is 
picking up slightly and builders report a good sales rate at new 
projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations in the Third District business community are mixed, but 
the overall outlook is for a continuation of current trends. 
Retailers expect the pace of sales to accelerate modestly from 
spring through fall, achieving an annual increase between 3 and 10 
percent. Auto dealers believe cars will sell at about the current 
rate for the rest of the year. Bankers expect continued strength in 
real estate lending and look for a modest increase in business loan 
demand, but they expect consumer lending to remain flat. Real estate 
agents say home sales will run at a good pace this year if mortgage 
rates do not rise above current levels, and builders expect new home 
sales this year to match last year's rate, although they are not 
optimistic that housing demand will carry strongly into 1989. 
Manufacturers have the most negative forecast: in February, surveyed 
manufacturers turned pessimistic, on balance, for the first time in 
nearly eight years, and they have held to this view in March. Local 
industrial firms expect slower business in the next six months, and 
they may reduce employment accordingly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial activity in the region is moving up marginally, according 
to preliminary results of the March Business Outlook Survey. Twenty 
percent of the manufacturers covered by the survey are stepping up 
operations, 70 percent are running at a steady pace, and 10 percent 
are cutting back. Nondurables manufacturers report relatively more 
improvement than durable goods producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specific measures of industrial activity are mixed. In March, new 
orders increased marginally, but shipments increased at a faster 
pace; consequently, order backlogs fell slightly. However, the 
pickup in shipments allowed manufacturers to work down inventories 
somewhat this month. Manufacturing employment continues to grow: 
more firms reported adding workers than cutting back in March, 
marking eleven consecutive months of rising payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to prices, half of the March survey respondents report 
rising input costs and half say they are steady; for their own 
goods, 25 percent are charging more while 70 percent are maintaining 
steady prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District manufacturers turned pessimistic in 
February and remained so in March. For the first time in nearly 
eight years anticipation of slower business is more widespread among 
surveyed companies than expectations of improvement. Survey 
respondents also forecast a level rate of new orders and shipments, 
a further decline in order backlogs, and a weaker employment 
situation in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retail sales an early March were running level with 
or slightly above last year's pace, roughly according to merchants' 
plans. Store officials said their inventories were in line with 
sales. Some reported taking delivery of spring merchandise earlier 
than usual to get discounts offered by suppliers; none reported 
undesired buildup of stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants are cautiously optimistic for the year ahead; they expect 
the pace of sales to be mild in the spring and move up through fall, 
with sales for the year as a whole 3-10 percent above 1987. Plans to 
add or remodel stores are being considered by many area retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers said sales in January and February ran above sales in 
the same months in 1987. Dealers said the year-to-year improvement 
is more than just a rebound from the particularly low sales of the 
prior year period and reflects healthy demand for new cars. Although 
they have scaled back the 1988 sales estimates they made last year, 
they are optimistic that the current rate of sales can be maintained 
for the balance of the year, even without manufacturers' incentives.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan growth at major Third District banks picked up in 
February after a pause in January. Lending officers say business 
loan demand has rebounded recently and they are receiving more 
inquiries from business borrowers. Consumer lending is growing 
weakly. Bankers say credit card lending is flat while other types of 
personal installment lending are advancing fractionally. Several 
banks have been promoting personal auto leasing recently, and these 
efforts have boosted this form of consumer finance. Real estate 
lending continues to grow at a strong pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers expect current lending trends to continue. They foresee some 
further growth in commercial and industrial lending, but expect 
consumer lending to remain flat. Real estate lenders expect real 
estate loan volume to be strong for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate agents described most markets as healthy in early March, 
with commercial leasing generally steady and residential sales 
picking up. Commercial real estate markets in the Third District are 
active although some pockets of softness are beginning to appear. 
Commercial real estate agents say office supply and demand in the 
central business district of Philadelphia are roughly in balance; in 
suburban locations the picture is mixed. Vacancy rates are rising in 
areas where construction has been extensive and falling in areas 
where the pace of building has been slower. Lease concessions are 
now common in relatively overbuilt areas, and developers in these 
areas have postponed starting dates for new projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for industrial buildings is strong through most of the Third 
District. As major highway projects in the region near completion, 
companies from outside the district are locating new warehousing and 
distribution centers to take advantage of improved transportation 
links.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate markets in the Third District are generally 
healthy. Sales activity slackened in January, but real estate agents 
contacted at the end of February said home sales were increasing by 
what appeared to be more than a seasonal amount. Some agents said 
houses in the higher price ranges were not selling as quickly as 
lower priced houses; and their forecast calls for average selling 
prices to rise, but not by as much as they did last year. 
Nevertheless, real estate agents believe the residential market will 
remain healthy, barring any upward thrust in mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential builders contacted in early March generally report new 
house sales running at a good pace, and some are unable to complete 
houses as quickly as buyers would like. Overall, developers in the 
Third District expect sales in 1988 to be around last year's level; 
however, they are not as optimistic for 1989, and some large 
companies are trimming their long-range development plans.
