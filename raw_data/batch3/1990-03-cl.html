      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in the Fourth District expect a slightly improved pace 
at overall economic activity this quarter from last. They expect 
some let-up in food and energy prices, but a 4 percent underlying 
inflation rate is expected to persist, at least for the next several 
quarters. The worst of the slowdown in manufacturing activity is 
believed to have passed. Interest rates are still expected to ease 
over the next few months, but not as much as was thought a few weeks 
ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents describe the economy as being sluggish or in a 
growth recession, but they expect a gradual strengthening in output 
over the next few quarters. Despite mixed signals about the economy, 
the respondents generally have not changed their outlook for 1990 
and do not believe that prospects for a recession have increased. 
They believe that some of the special factors that accounted for the 
weakness in overall output in recent months, especially auto output 
cutbacks and the Boeing strike, are already providing some impetus 
to the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents believe that the latest surge in food and energy prices 
has about run its course. They see encouraging signs in the latest 
easing in crude oil and gasoline prices. The spike in those prices 
is judged to be temporary, originating from a convergence of special 
factors involving supplies. Declines in spot prices for crude oil, 
fuel oil, and gasoline are taken as evidence of rapidly improving 
supplies that will probably lead to further declines in crude oil 
prices over the next several weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest spurt in food prices was partly in response to the freeze 
last December. Produce, milk, and processed fruit and vegetable 
prices are easing. Some other prices, however, including cereals, 
some dairy products, and coffee, all rose much more than expected 
last quarter, and have been sticky on the downside. If those prices 
ease more, overall food prices could increase in a 4 percent to 4 
1/2 percent range this year, similar to recent years, according to 
an industry source.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the expected easing in food and energy prices, the 
prevailing view is that inflation will hold at about a 4 percent 
rate over the next several quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers are becoming more optimistic because sales in February 
were somewhat better than they expected. Sales are on an improving 
trend instead of being flat, according to one retailer. They assert 
that retail prices have been flat to moderately higher in recent 
months, and are likely to remain under downward pressure as some 
retailers cut higher-than-desired inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents believe that the worst of the slowdown in 
manufacturing output has passed and that a slight decline in 
production this quarter will be followed by a slight pickup next 
quarter. Production in February is generally believed to have 
rebounded from the January decline. Automotive output revived, and 
most traditional capital goods industries are still on a slowly 
rising trend that is offsetting softening in some high-tech 
industries, especially office computers and communications 
equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing managers in Cleveland and Cincinnati report higher output 
and production for the second consecutive month in February, and 
commodity prices in the Cincinnati area firmed for the first time in 
the last eight months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some of the cautiously optimistic tone about manufacturing stems 
from the auto industry. New car inventories have been brought down 
substantially since year-end 1989 and should be in a normal range by 
the end of March. Production in February and March is expected to 
rise to about a 6 million to 6.5 million unit annual rate from the 
4.1 million rate in January. Dealers in the Fourth District expect 
to step up orders for second quarter delivery because of their 
improving inventory condition. Big Three auto dealers attribute the 
better sales level of this quarter than last to the incentive 
programs. Although they report that captive finance companies have 
been tightening credit standards in response to the high percentage 
of loan defaults last year, they believe commercial banks are still 
making credit readily available for both consumers and dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers continue to operate at about 80% of capacity. 
Production is expected to increase next quarter because of rising 
seasonal demands, some pickup in the auto industry, and less 
inventory liquidation by steel warehouses. Spot prices are described 
as weak, and prices in export markets are so depressed that some 
domestic producers have decided to withdraw from that market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Profit margins in manufacturing have been deteriorating, especially 
in the auto and related industries and in computer and office 
machinery industries, and are characterized by some as recession 
margins. The erosion, however, doesn't necessarily imply a 
retrenchment in capital spending. A steel producer reported that 
modernization plans are still on schedule, and a capital goods 
producer pointed out that cash flow is a key to investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists contacted still expect some easing in interest rates as 
market fears about inflation lessen and the economy continues on a 
slow growth path. Some economists, however, expect that interest 
rates may not recede as much as they previously thought because of 
rising interest rates abroad. Some banks and thrift institutions in 
this District report that their lending policies have been 
tightening. Nonperforming loans in this region rose last year but 
were still well below the national average. A thrift institution 
observed that new regulations that affect lending to any single 
builder probably are not constraining new construction because there 
appears to be ample funds available to credit-worthy builders.
