      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions remain satisfactory in most parts of the West, 
although western business leaders' expectations about national 
growth continue to be subdued. Wage and price trends have not 
changed appreciably during the past two months, with few sectors 
reporting increases beyond 5 percent. Several service sectors are 
experiencing strong growth, while retailers report generally 
satisfactory conditions. Information about manufacturing industries 
suggests that overall activity is flat, with strength in some 
sectors offset by weakness in others. Conditions in resource 
industries are little changed. Despite worrisome trends in aggregate 
real estate and construction data for the West, markets in most 
areas, particularly those away from the coast, exhibit robust 
activity. The pace of activity at financial institutions varies 
within the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Western business leaders' expectations continue to reflect caution 
about national economic growth. Two-thirds expect slow real GNP 
growth during the next twelve months, while 4 percent now expect a 
national recession. Respondents are relatively upbeat about the 
prospects for improvement in the trade balance, but expectations 
regarding consumer spending and business investment have 
deteriorated somewhat during the last two months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      War and price trends have not changed appreciably during the past 
two months. Current increases cluster in the 4 to 5 percent range, 
with few larger rises reported. However, some service-sector firms 
continue to face a shortage of entry-level workers, which is putting 
significant upward pressure on their pay scales. Some employers note 
that, while wages are rising by less than 5 percent, the cost of 
benefits rose 8 to 15 percent during the last year. An electronic 
equipment maker reports stable prices despite heavy pressure on 
profit margins. Prices of several resource products, including 
wheat, corn, and some forest products, have fallen in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The trade and service sectors continue to be major contributors to 
economic growth in the West. Strength as reported across a broad 
range of service sectors, with particularly robust activity in 
health care, business services, and software. For example, one large 
software company plans to add 1,000 workers during the next year. 
The economies of Phoenix and Tucson are benefiting from recent or 
planned support facilities for national communications, credit card, 
and airline firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers report satisfactory conditions, although for many 
growth is somewhat slower than in recent years. However, one major 
retailer notes that sales have showed significantly during the last 
two weeks. Auto dealers report that new vehicle sales are soft, 
while used cars and trucks continue to sell well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Newspaper advertising volume is mixed. Reports from southern 
California indicate that help-wanted advertising is running below 
last year's levels, while a Seattle-area paper reports that 
employment advertising rose by more than 10 percent during the past 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports about manufacturing industries suggest that overall activity 
is flat, with strength in some sectors offset by weakness in others. 
Growth is reported in the Puget Sound ship-building industry, and 
sales of heavy equipment have risen sharply during the past year in 
most parts of the West. Some respondents report that delivery times 
for their supplies have fallen significantly, which they attribute 
to a combination of increased production and weak demand in other 
parts of the country. Several defense contractors with operations in 
the West have announced layoffs or plant closures in recent weeks. 
Order backlogs for commercial aircraft continue to grow, but the 
region's largest manufacturers are cutting their work forces to cut 
costs or enhance productivity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in resource industries are little changed. Farm 
conditions are good overall, although low water supplies continue to 
cause concern in many parts of the region. The salmon run in Bristol 
Bay (Alaska) was twice as large as was expected. The long-
anticipated deterioration in logging and lumber is becoming more 
apparent in the Northwest, as reduced home-building activity at the 
national level reduces demand and environmental concerns restrict 
supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Information about overall conditions in western construction and 
real estate markets suggests significant deterioration during the 
past year. However, such aggregate statistics are dominated by 
cooling in coastal California from the boom levels seen a year ago, 
and by changes in the geographical composition of real estate 
activity. In most other parts of the West, home sales are robust and 
prices are rising, in some cases significantly. Las Vegas and 
Sacramento are particularly vigorous at present, with parts of 
Oregon, eastern Washington, Idaho, and Utah close behind. Arizona 
markets continue to be troubled, as absorption of current 
inventories proceeds slowly. Some respondents from California, 
Washington, and Arizona complain that tighter credit is restricting 
construction activity in those markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity at financial institutions varies within the District. For 
example, some lenders report slack loan demand, others report slower 
growth in loan demand, and still others report accelerating growth. 
Most bankers report that delinquencies are down or low. A few small 
businesses complain that tighter credit conditions are hurting their 
ability to do business. However, bankers themselves disagree about 
the extent of the tightening and its impact on lending activity.
