      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic trends in the Ninth District continued to be favorable this 
spring. Unemployment declined again, and consumer spending held up 
surprisingly well. Some important new construction projects were 
announced. The forest products and mining sectors benefited from 
increased demand. Except for excessive dryness, agricultural 
conditions remained stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions remained favorable in the last few months. 
Minnesota's unemployment rate dipped to 3.8 percent in April, its 
lowest rate in more than eight years. The state's initial 
unemployment claims were about 3 percentage points lower this April 
than in April 1987. In Montana and North Dakota, unemployment rates 
were also estimated to have fallen significantly in April. For South 
Dakota, March data show that job growth continued, with 
manufacturing leading all other industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail spending on general merchandise has borne up well recently. 
One retail chain reports that its department stores' sales in the 
district were 9 percent higher this May than last. Another chain 
reports that Memorial Day sales were brisk and that its sales were 
up 14 percent so far this year. This chain is continuing to remodel 
some stores while building additions to others. Contrary to 
experience over the last few years, sales growth has not been 
confined to just major metropolitan areas. A Bank director notes 
that retail sales were holding up well in most North Dakota cities, 
with spending by Canadian visitors helping retailers in Minot and 
Grand Forks. Inventories are at acceptable levels, and no 
significant credit problems have been reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      Motor vehicles continued to sell well throughout the district this 
spring. The car and truck sales of one domestic manufacturer were 
around 10 percent higher during the first three weeks in May than 
they were a year ago. Another domestic manufacturer reports that its 
truck sales were up by even more than 10 percent during May. Smaller 
dealers in outstate areas have done particularly well this year, but 
sales at larger dealers in metro areas also surged in May. The rapid 
sales growth has left inventories a bit tight.
     </p>
     <p>
      While housing activity this spring fell from its record-setting pace 
of a year earlier, sales haven't been bad. In April, the total value 
of homes sold in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area was only 6 
percent lower than in April 1987. A representative of Minnesota 
realtors observes that the market to be "healthy across the board." 
Supporting this claim elsewhere, a reporter in Sioux Falls, South 
Dakota, observes that the city's housing market was "stable, but not 
booming."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several significant construction projects have been announced 
recently. A large computer company released plans to add 76 stories 
of office space to downtown Minneapolis. A financial forms maker 
chose a St. Paul suburb (over five other sites outside the district) 
as the location for a large office and factory complex, which could 
employ another 1,500 workers. Contracts for the construction of 
public infrastructure in Minnesota were up substantially this March, 
while contracts awarded for other types of construction were down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      More favorable news was generated by the district's important forest 
products and mining sectors. A paper industry consultant notes that 
the paper business has been booming, with all Minnesota mills 
running "flat out." Prices for printing paper are particularly firm. 
More paper machines may be installed later this year. Plants 
producing waferboard, a paper-based building material, are also 
running at full tilt, although prices are weak. After five years of 
hard times, the district's iron ore industry is recovering a bit. 
During April, iron ore shipments from Duluth and Superior to steel 
mills across the Great Lakes were 27 percent higher than a year 
earlier. An iron ore facility in northeastern Minnesota will recall 
around 80 laid-off workers to reopen a production line last used six
years ago. Iron ore output is also up in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, 
where hiring has sometimes exceeded the number of workers laid off. 
And in Minnesota a plan has been spawned to convert abandoned iron 
mine pits into farms for salmon and trout production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Excessive dryness has become a major concern for district farmers, 
although most other developments have been favorable. Topsoil 
moisture is short in Minnesota, northern South Dakota, and eastern 
North Dakota. But a Bank director from Montana reports that some 
rains in May helped a lot in that state. More favorably, prices of 
important district crops and livestock have risen. The Minnesota 
farm price index rose in April. The price received for wheat rose 10 
cents over the previous month. A Bank director from North Dakota 
notes that soybean prices have been particularly strong, and another 
from Montana notes that cattle prices have reached record levels. 
Through mid-May, grain exports shipped from Duluth and Superior ran 
three times higher than last year. But a director from Wisconsin 
reports that dairy milk production has grown to levels that preceded 
the federal herd buy-out programâ€”a program intended to curb 
excess production.
