      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District business activity continues to expand, but with apparently 
greater growth in production than in consumption. Retail sales 
increased at a much slower pace in March and April than in the 
previous two months, particularly for automobiles and apparel. 
Severe weather in mid-March contributed to the mediocre performance, 
but retailers also point to consumer caution about the future course 
of the economy as an underlying factor. Manufacturers continue to 
report strength in orders, backlogs, and production. Producers of 
steel, heavy truck components, and many types of capital goods 
indicate near-capacity operations. Most of the higher production 
schedules are being met through productivity gains and overtime, but 
a few respondents report hiring a limited number of additional 
workers in order to accommodate a rising backlog. Financial 
institutions cite a moderate increase in overall loan activity, 
mostly as a result of refinancing both home mortgages and existing 
business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retailers report that sales growth has fallen off 
the pace set during the first two months of the year. Traffic in 
March and April has been relatively slow for this time of year, and 
sales have been flat. Many respondents blame unseasonable weather, 
pointing specifically to the mid-March blizzard. Even the positive 
influence of an early Easter could not offset the storm's 
devastating effects on consumer spending. While most retailers agree 
that better weather will revive consumer activity, they still 
express concern that consumer confidence may remain subdued by the 
slow pace of the areas economic recovery. The lackluster sale of 
big-ticket items, such as motor vehicles, reflects consumers'
caution. Even with low interest rates and ample credit available, 
dealers expect a modest 5 percent year-over-year improvement during 
the remainder of the all-important spring selling season. Apparel 
retailers mention that they may discount spring/summer seasonal 
items a little earlier than usual, but most respondents are 
comfortable with their current inventory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A growing number of manufacturers report new orders and backlogs. 
They uniformly estimate further increases in production this quarter 
over last and believe that they have ample capacity to accommodate 
higher production schedules. Some of the tightest conditions are 
reported by the steel industry: Operating rates range between the 
low 80s for some specialty producers and near capacity for producers 
of flat rolled steel. The high operating rates and full order books 
have sustained a general price increase for many steel items. 
However, some producers report that orders for future delivery have 
slowed in recent weeks, making further price increases less likely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of truck components also report near-capacity operations, 
as new orders in March again exceeded expectations. Backlogs 
continue to climb rapidly, and heavy-duty truck production for 1993 
now appears to be running at a rate close to the previous peak year 
in 1988. Stronger-than-expected demand for some automobile and light 
truck models and options has strained capacity and created 
bottlenecks at a few Big Three parts and assembly plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of capital goods and special industrial and 
telecommunications equipment also cite better-than-expected orders 
and backlogs last quarter. For example, a manufacturer of equipment 
for depository institutions reports sizable increases in orders so 
far this year relative to last year, resulting in an additional 
shift at one plant. Some consumer goods producers also note a step-
up in sales and production since late 1992. Sales of vacuum cleaners 
rose at a double-digit rate last quarter, and output of major 
household appliances held at about the previous quarter's level. For 
machine tools, however, orders continue on an irregularly rising 
trend because of further weakness in the aerospace and commercial 
aircraft industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers in the District continue to stress that they can meet 
rising production schedules over the next several months without 
resorting to significant employment increases. Despite higher 
backlogs and operating rates at the end of last quarter, producers 
of truck components, depository institution equipment, industrial 
supplies, and steel expect few, if any, new hires or employee 
recalls. Some believe that their higher production schedules can be 
met through productivity gains and overtime, and a few are relying 
on outside contractors. Several producers emphasize that their long-
term goal continues to be greater productivity per unit of sales and 
output and are cautious about hiring in response to short-run rises 
in demand, in light of high employee benefits costs. Yet, some 
respondents report limited gains in payrolls. A capital goods 
producer, now operating some of its lines at capacity, plans to hire 
in order to accommodate a rising backlog. In addition, selected auto 
assembly and parts facilities report hiring additional workers, 
although they stress that new employment is the last resort after 
overtime has been exhausted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers expect only replacement hiring at this time, as they 
anticipate increased productivity and overtime hours to accommodate 
sales growth in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rising loan activity continues to be concentrated in home equity and 
mortgage loans. Several lenders report that the volume of mortgage 
refinancing is still virtually at capacity, although the pace of 
increase has leveled off at some banks. A large thrift, however, has 
experienced what may be another record month for refinancing. For 
new mortgage loans, a few depositories note a somewhat more than 
seasonal pickup in April, but most thrifts and banks indicate less 
than usual strength. Some banks, particularly larger ones, report a 
slight increase in business loans, which is aided primarily by a 
strong demand to refinance existing loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several large banks state that savings deposits, especially 
certificates of deposit, fell sharply again in April, with some 
indicating a bigger decline than in March. A few large and mid-sized 
thrift institutions, however, report that aggressive pricing and 
marketing programs have generated growth in their deposits in April.
