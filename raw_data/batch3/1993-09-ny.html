      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, economic developments seemed slightly more positive in 
recent weeks, although some negative reports continued to be 
received. Sales results varied widely at District retail stores 
during July and early August Respondents reported no noteworthy 
change in homebuilding activity in recent weeks, and now expect 
housing starts to top last year's relatively low levels, though not 
by much. In the commercial real estate market the sale of a nearly 
vacant new office building in mid-Manhattan reportedly elicited more 
interest and sold for a higher price than many had expected. New 
York's unemployment rue decreased to 7.5 percent in July from 7.8 
percent while New Jersey's rate held steady at 6.9 percent Most 
senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks indicated 
no recent change in their willingness to lend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results varied widely at District retail stores during July, 
and early August data indicated a continuation of this pattern. Fans 
and air conditioners were strong sellers in July as most of the 
District experienced record-high temperatures, and other items for 
the home also fared well. Sales of women's apparel and cosmetics 
were strong at some stores but quite weak at others. Some retailers 
attributed their lower apparel sales to the fact that they had 
smaller-than-usual stocks on bend for this year's July summer 
clearance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales changes ranged from -14 percent to +18 percent 
but despite several negative results, only one chain stated that 
inventories were somewhat worrisome. Stores were fairly evenly 
divided between those falling below and those exceeding plan. One 
chain with lower-than-expected results had moved a large promotional 
event from July to August and apparently underestimated the impact 
this would have on July sales. Several respondents were cautiously 
optimistic about the outlook, citing a continued lack of consumer 
confidence as the reason for their caution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents report essentially no change in homebuilding activity in 
recent weeks. Some nosed a slight slowing of traffic and sales but 
stressed the fact that traffic has exhibited an up and down pattern 
over a period of time. The IBM layoffs have begun to have a negative 
impact in the Hudson Valley area, however, with an increasing number 
of homes being added to the resale market. Uncertainty about the 
economic outlook and concern about job security were factors 
mentioned as continuing to dampen demand for new homes in several 
other parts of the District as well. Low interest rates and stable 
home prices are sustaining some demand, however, and credit seems 
somewhat more available than had been the case, particularly for 
large builders. Housing starts are expected to top last year's
relatively low levels throughout the District though not by large 
amounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the commercial real estate market the recent sale of a 42-story, 
nearly vacant new office building in mid-Manhattan reportedly 
elicited more interest and sold for a higher price than many had 
expected. The buyer, Morgan Stanley, noted that a number of its 
businesses have been growing and that the new building will fit in 
with its expansion plans. Some other financial services firms in 
Manhattan also have already increased or plan to increase their 
space when negotiating new leases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New York's unemployment rate decreased to 7.5 percent in July from 
7.8 percent in June while New Jersey's rate held steady at 6.9 
percent, just above the national average. While employment has 
continued declining in the District, the recent pace has been 
modest. Moreover, a recent BLS report noted that, despite its 
employment doldrums. New York City wages and salaries grew by a 
sizable amount in 1992 even when the highly-paid Wall Street firms 
are excluded. New York State payrolls also rose in 1992, though by a 
smaller amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      The July surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
indicated some improvement among manufacturers in those areas. 
Rochester had a sizable increase in the percentage of firms stating 
that general business conditions were better 38 percent in July from 
20 percent in June. A higher percentage of Buffalo firms reported a 
rise in output in July and, though the percentage with a gain in new 
orders fell, the percentage with the nine or increased new orders 
rose.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's employment outlook was dimmed by several 
announcements of future job reductions. The largest of these were 
IBM's planned cutback of another 35,000 and Kodak's additional 
downsizing of 10,000. Smaller cutbacks of 3000 and up to 1500 are in 
the offing for Johnson and Johnson and New York's Empire Blue Cross. 
Most of these numbers pertain to worldwide operations and no 
information is currently available as to the local impact. On a 
smaller scale, Martin Marietta will cut almost 500 Albany-area jobs 
and will decide by October whether to close any of several other 
plants in New York which it acquired in its recent purchase of GE's 
aerospace division.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the District indicated that they are as willing to lend as they were 
two months ago. Loan rates decreased slightly in the last two months 
as roughly half of the surveyed loan officers reported moderately 
lower rates while the rest reported theirs unchanged. Overall loan 
demand was reported to be generally stable. Approximately three-
fifths of the respondents reported steady demand while the remainder 
was evenly divided between those with higher and lower demand. With 
regard to specific categories, most surveyed loan officers reported 
that demand for consumer loans was unchanged and that mortgage 
demand and refinancing activity remained stable over the last two 
months. Business loan demand showed continued signs of sluggishness 
as two-thirds of the respondents indicated stagnant demand while 
others noted only slight increases or decreases. In addition, 
approximately 90 percent of respondents reported either no change or 
a moderate decline in loan delinquency rates during the last two 
months.
