      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District developments continued mixed in recent weeks. 
Department store sales results varied widely in June though most 
contacts reported better-than-expected gains. Office leasing 
activity showed some further improvement and several areas 
experienced a decline in vacancy rates. Conditions in the 
residential construction market have been somewhat mixed, however, 
and unemployment rates rose in June to their highest levels since 
the early 1980s. Most loan officers surveyed at small and midsized 
banks noted no change in their willingness to lend but lackluster 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results at District department stores varied widely in June 
though most contacts reported better-than-expected gains. The 
targeted levels were quite modest in some cases, however, and one 
chain had results that were below both plan and substantially below 
its year-earlier level. When compared with June 1991 changes ranged 
from -11 percent to +l7 percent with most stores reporting gains 
between 4 and 9 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite unusually cool weather, demand for men's and women's 
clothing was strong and one chain experienced its best Father's Day 
week in four years. Furniture and other household items also sold 
well. As a result of the generally positive sales results, 
inventories at most department stores were on or somewhat below 
plan. With regard to the outlook, respondents were still fairly 
cautious though they were hopeful that visitors to New York's 
Columbus quincentennial celebration and the Democratic convention 
would provide a significant stimulus to July sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential Construction and Real Estate
Conditions in the residential construction market have been somewhat 
mixed in recent weeks. Homebuilders in two western and central New 
York areas reported a good response to this year's spring home shows 
with considerably better sales than a year earlier and some pickup 
in new orders as well. Sales were also off to a good start at a New 
Jersey site where 81 homes will soon rise. In other areas, however, 
activity was reportedly slow as consumers remained reluctant in 
response to continued layoffs and economic uncertainty.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity showed some further improvement as firms 
continued to avail themselves of lower rents and other concessions 
in order to upgrade their quarters. Several observers noted that, as 
commercial space is becoming more competitive with outside areas, 
some firms are canceling plans to relocate and opting to remain in 
the District instead. As a result of these developments several 
areas, including Long Island, northern New Jersey, Westchester 
County and mid-Manhattan, have experienced a recent decline in 
office vacancy rates, although these rates remain at high levels. A 
major exception was downtown Manhattan where firms moving to newer 
buildings marketed older space and the vacancy rate rose.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates rose in June to their highest levels 
since the early 1980s and, at 9.2 percent in both New York and New 
Jersey, are now the second highest among 11 large states. New York's 
rate jumped from 7.9 percent in May while New Jersey's was up from 
9.0 percent in May. While these seasonally adjusted state 
unemployment rates often show monthly volatility, their current high 
level and the continuing decline in nonfarm employment suggest to 
some analysts that the recession in the District has not yet run its 
course. Moreover, the outlook is dimmed by recent announcements of 
additional employment cutbacks ahead. In upstate New York, for 
example, Smith Corona will be moving to Mexico within the next year, 
eliminating almost 700 jobs, and a footwear producer will be moving 
to Arkansas by the end of August eliminating another 145 jobs. On a 
more positive note, a pharmaceutical company employing 650 which had 
planned to relocate has instead decided to remain in the District 
and two manufacturing companies have just signed contracts with 
federal government agencies and could expand employment. In 
addition, the construction industry will receive a boost from a new 
$235 million mixed-use tower for which land is being cleared in 
Manhattan's Lincoln Center area. Much of the building, which will 
cover an entire square block and have 38 floors of apartments, 
together with 8 floors of office and retail space, has already been 
sold or preleased. Reports from purchasing managers in June showed 
some improvement in general business conditions in Rochester and 
stability in Buffalo.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in the 
Second District indicated that their willingness to lend remained 
steady relative to two months ago, but the demand for loans was 
lackluster. Both consumer and residential mortgage demand were 
mediocre. The few respondents mentioning an increase in the demand 
for residential mortgages attributed it primarily to refinancing 
activity. However, the demand for business loans was reported as 
steady to somewhat higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents reported no change in delinquency rates during the 
past two months. Virtually all officers reported lowering their 
deposit rates but noted there was no outflow of deposits. Rather, 
deposits generally shifted from maturing certificates of deposit 
into more liquid savings accounts, as customers avoided being locked 
into low long-term rates.
