      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity strengthened somewhat during the past six 
to eight weeks. Retail sales continued to improve, and manufacturing 
activity picked up after several months of little change, although 
employment was flat in both sectors. Tourist activity increased, the 
demand for loans rose slightly, and both residential and commercial 
real estate activity improved modestly. Coal production fell in West 
Virginia as the result of a coal miner strike. At District ports, 
imports and exports declined. Agricultural harvesting was completed 
after having been delayed by wet weather; in the seafood industry, 
the oyster harvest was poor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey indicated that District retail activity 
improved in late January and the first two weeks of February. 
Retailers reported increased shopper traffic and sales, including 
sales of big-ticket items. Capital expenditures by retailers 
strengthened, but inventories were unchanged. Employment was steady 
to slightly lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      Survey respondents were optimistic about their prospects for the 
next six months. They expected sales, shopper traffic, and 
employment to rise. In addition, they anticipated some increases in 
wages and in wholesale and retail prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers indicated that District factory activity improved 
during the past month after remaining flat since November. 
Respondents to our regular mail survey reported increases in most 
indicators of manufacturing activity, although they noted that 
employment and levels of raw materials inventories were little 
changed. Manufacturers continue to be optimistic about the next six 
months, expecting most indicators, except inventories, to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the District indicated that 
tourist activity in recent weeks was higher than in December and a 
year ago. Respondents, especially those at mountain resorts where 
skiing weather was good, reported that bookings and tourist spending 
were above a year ago. Over half of the respondents expected tourism 
to improve further during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone indicated 
that credit conditions improved over the last six weeks. Respondents 
said that commercial and consumer loan demand strengthened slightly 
and that commercial and consumer loan rates were steady. Banks noted 
that residential mortgage demand--both for new loans and 
refinancings--picked up when home mortgage rates fell sharply over 
the last six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      About half of the commercial loan officers surveyed reported that 
regulatory requirements had hindered their ability to make loans, 
while most of the residential mortgage and consumer loan officers 
reported that regulation had not restricted their activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports--Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk)--indicated that imports and exports were 
lower in January than in December and a year ago. Exports were 
expected to pick up at all ports during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate analysts surveyed by telephone reported that residential 
activity remained strong during the past six weeks. Housing sales 
were steady in most price ranges but higher for homes in the mid-
price range. Housing starts declined, mainly because of an unusually 
wet January. One analyst reported that large builders in some parts 
of the Carolinas were unable to meet demand for low-priced homes 
because of a shortage of building lots.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home prices rose in some areas of the District. Most District 
analysts noted that new home prices had not yet reflected higher 
lumber prices except In South Carolina. Analysts expected higher 
lumber prices to push up new home prices soon, however, and they 
anticipated that some homebuyer Interest would then shift from new 
to existing homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate activity in the District picked up during the 
past six weeks. Vacancy rates declined, particularly in the office 
and industrial markets. Despite lower vacancy rates, relatively 
little new construction was reported. Where building activity was 
underway, virtually all of the space was pre-leased. District 
commercial leasing and construction activity continued to be 
strongest in the Carolinas, particularly in the Charlotte, Raleigh, 
Columbia, and Greenville/Spartanburg areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Government Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Government analysts contacted by telephone reported that recent 
state revenue collections had met projections in most District 
states. Inflation-adjusted revenues were growing in all District 
states except West Virginia, where they were flat, and in the 
District of Columbia, where collections were down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Coal and Timber
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Coal production for the week ending February 13 in West Virginia was 
10 percent below year-ago levels because of a strike by coal miners. 
The decreased production had not affected electric utilities, 
however, because of the large coal stockpiles held by both the 
utilities and the coal companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      In West Virginia and the Carolinas, industry contacts reported that 
the demand for softwood and hardwood lumber remained strong. Even 
though timber-cutting was active, some wood product firms apparently 
cut back their operations because of difficulty in obtaining logs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Seafood
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in agriculture and in the seafood industry were mixed. 
Dry conditions in late January helped farmers complete harvesting 
activity that had been delayed by persistent rains during December 
and early January. Also, a cold snap in mid-February apparently 
benefited fruit trees in the Carolinas by preventing a premature end 
to their winter dormancy. Crop prices, however, remained below year-
ago levels, and farmers were concerned that continued low crop 
prices would depress their 1993 crop cash receipts. In the seafood 
industry, the winter harvest of oysters was unusually poor, 
according to District watermen.
