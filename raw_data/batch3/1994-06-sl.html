      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 22, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity continues to expand vigorously as 
contacts report growth in both employment and sales. Defense-related 
firms, though, reported some layoffs. Contacts also report minimal 
cost pressures and see future price increases as unlikely. Retailers 
and auto dealers report generally brisk sales and are optimistic 
about the second half of the year. While recent increases in long-
term interest rates have slowed residential construction activity 
somewhat, they have not had much effect on home sales, which remain 
robust. Consumer and business loan demand continues to rise at 
District banks. Favorable crop conditions are reported in most areas 
of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District firms report strong growth, citing plant expansions and 
sales increases. In some places, particularly in St. Louis, contacts 
are beginning to report shortages of available workers, forcing some 
to offer higher wages. This shortage is reflected in St. Louis' low 
April unemployment rate, 4.8 percent, its lowest since July 1979. 
One contact said that his firm had trouble retaining newly hired 
employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth is occurring in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms 
in all parts of the District. For example, two poultry processors 
report new plants opening in Kentucky, one initially bringing 850 
jobs, and the other bringing 1,300. An apparel maker will also move 
to Kentucky and employ 600 by year's end. Contacts in western 
Tennessee report the opening of a new auto parts plant, employing 
500 workers, and the expansion of a paper factory, adding 200 
workers. A greeting card company, expanding into northeast Arkansas, 
will employ 250 workers. Because of a new contract, a St. Louis 
corporate services firm hired an additional 400 workers. A heavy 
equipment dealer says demand has outpaced supply, creating severe 
shortages but leading to sales increases of more than 20 percent 
over last year. Other contacts also report sales increases over last 
year and expectations that this will continue at least through next 
quarter. For example, a building supplies company and a pallet 
manufacturer both report sales increases of 15 percent, while a die 
casting company's sales grew 10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domestic markets remain strong for most products, particularly 
animal feed, although some slowdowns in the hospitality and metal 
plate products industries were noted. Reports about foreign markets 
vary with company and destination. Most say that overall exports are 
weak with only the Pacific Rim countries as a source of rising 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most reports of layoffs in the District are defense-related. An army 
base reports it will lay off about 250 civilian employees by the end 
of September because of restructuring within the military. An 
electronics company producing engines and other parts for defense 
aircraft laid off 100 white-collar employees because of spending 
cuts, and a missile producer will eliminate about 240 positions 
because of scheduled production decreases. Separately, the catfish 
industry reports that nationwide shortages of catfish are causing 
firms to release workers. One firm laid off its entire night shift 
of 295 people.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most discussions with area business people suggest that cost 
pressures are minimal. In general, the largest average reported 
increase was about 3 percent. Many of these contacts state that 
increased foreign competition prevents them from increasing prices 
on their products. Some even stipulated that when presented with 
opportunities to raise prices, they decided not to. In addition, 
some claim they can now find their raw materials overseas when there 
is a shortage domestically, which helps to keep prices down. The 
consensus among contacts was that District wage increases are 
running between less than 1 percent and 3 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers throughout the District report moderate to strong sales in 
recent months, with some contacts reporting increases as large as 25 
percent over one year ago. Most contacts report that recent sales 
have met or exceeded their expectations, and most are optimistic 
about the second half of 1994. Auto dealers also report strong 
sales, and most expect sales growth at or above its current pace 
over the remainder of 1994. Rising interest rates have had a minimal 
effect on sales thus far. Truck and sport utility vehicle sales are 
particularly strong. In addition, sales of imports have picked up 
some of the momentum they had lost in recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Though residential construction activity remains brisk in most parts 
of the District, some areas are reporting a slowdown, which contacts 
attribute to recent increases in mortgage rates. Still, the single-
family housing market can be characterized as strong, with sales of 
new and existing homes at or above last year's pace. A shortage of 
homes for sale, rising prices and quick turnaround are reported in 
many areas. Some areas also report a shortage of skilled tradesmen 
for construction jobs, which is further adding to backlogs 
previously built up because of weather delays and strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bankers report continuing improvement in consumer and 
commercial loan demand. While refinancing activity has come to a 
standstill, mortgage lending is still relatively strong, with 
consumers increasingly showing a preference for adjustable-rate 
mortgages. Commercial loan demand from small businesses is 
especially strong. Some bankers report that deposit growth is not 
keeping pace with loan demand growth, which is increasing funding 
costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crops appear to be in mostly fair-to-good condition across the 
District. In parts of Illinois and Missouri, however, an outbreak of 
insects has affected the wheat crop, and in parts of Arkansas the 
cotton crop has suffered some herbicide damage. Moreover, some 
contacts report a significant upsurge of European corn borer 
activity in parts of the Midwest. In general, soil moisture seems 
adequate, although drier conditions are becoming increasingly 
prevalent in many areas.
