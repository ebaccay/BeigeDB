      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Twelfth District are reported to be 
sluggish, but western business leaders' outlook for future economic 
conditions improved for the first time since August 1990. Price and 
wage increases remain moderate throughout the District. Retail sales 
slowed substantially immediately following the outbreak of the Gulf 
War, but activity has picked up since then. Manufacturing activity 
is mixed in the West, with some firms reporting increased orders for 
war-related products. The District's agriculture and forest product 
industries continue to face difficult conditions. Construction and 
real estate activity remains slow in much of the West. District 
financial institutions report a drop in loan demand in the past 
several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic outlook of western business leaders improved slightly 
in February, although expectations about future economic growth 
remained pessimistic. Seventy-three percent now foresee a national 
recession in the coming year, compared to 81 percent in January and 
75 percent in November. Expectations about business investment, 
housing starts, and consumer spending improved for the first time 
since last August. Business leaders' outlook for inflation continued 
to improve, with 53 percent now expecting inflationary pressures to 
ease in the coming year. Almost 60 percent of respondents now 
project improvement in the foreign trade balance during the next 
twelve months, compared to 29 percent in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from throughout the Twelfth District indicate that prices 
have stabilized recently, and wage increases remain moderate. Prices 
have declined for many agricultural and natural resource products, 
including livestock, wheat, timber, natural gas, and oil. Increases 
in prices for department store merchandise remain in the 3 to 4 
percent range. Health care costs, however, continue to rise at a 15 
to 20 percent rate. Recent union contracts for a wide range of 
industries in the Northwest brought wage increases from 2 to 4 
percent. Wages in financial institutions are reported to be rising 
at or below last year's rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District retail trade activity declined sharply immediately 
following the outbreak of the Gulf War in mid-January, but many 
reports indicate a slight rebound since then. One District auto 
dealer reported that sales came to a halt for 3 or 4 days after the 
start of the war, but that showroom traffic has picked up recently. 
Similarly, department store sales softened in mid-January, but also 
have improved in recent weeks. The war reportedly further eroded 
consumer confidence, leaving buyers more cautious. Reports indicate 
that Southern California continues to post the weakest retail sales 
in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rise in consumer uncertainty also has affected the tourism 
industry in some parts of the West. In Hawaii, tourism has dropped 
off sharply, leaving the hotel occupancy rate down approximately 30 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's media industry is facing difficulties as a result of 
weakening economic conditions and the war. Newspaper advertising, 
particularly national accounts, continues to fall off significantly 
at the same time that costs are rising as a result of expanded Gulf 
War coverage. Television advertising also has dropped off, as 
advertisements were canceled at the start of the war, and expanded 
network coverage cut into available advertising spots.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the West is reported to be mixed. Defense-
related manufacturing remains weak overall, although some companies 
report a pick-up in activity related to the Gulf War. War-related 
orders range from engines for missiles to processed food products. 
Several District manufacturers report increasing interest from 
overseas buyers, including Eastern Europe, Latin and South America, 
and the Middle East. Business investment plans for many 
manufacturing firms in the District remain cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Difficult conditions continue for the District's agriculture and 
forest products industries. The fifth year of drought in California 
will result in reduced production of field crops and increased 
production costs. Higher feed prices and lack of adequate grazing 
land will force cattle into feedlots early, lowering livestock 
prices. California farmers with access to Colorado River or 
Sacramento Delta water, or who have their own wells will likely come 
through the drought in good shape. For many others, reduced 
production may be partially offset by rising prices for their 
products.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's wood products industry continues to weaken in 
response to slow economic activity. Western lumber production is 
reported down 24 percent in the first five weeks of 1991 from the 
same period a year ago. Orders and shipments of pulp and paper 
products also are reported off significantly from last year. Soft 
demand has left prices lower, with lumber prices down 8 to 12 
percent, and pulp and paper prices off 19 percent from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some firms in the Northwest with expertise in oil spill clean-up 
will be involved in the effort to handle the spill in the Persian 
Gulf.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity remains weak in much of the 
West. In California and Washington, both commercial and residential 
construction continues to soften. Developers report increasing 
difficulty in obtaining financing for real estate projects. Slowing 
real estate sales have cooled housing prices in Los Angeles and 
Seattle. In Salt Lake City, however, home prices and rental rates 
continue to rise. New apartment buildings in Oregon report vacancy 
rates of less than 2 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial institutions in the District report difficult conditions. 
Loan demand in much of the West has slowed significantly. Bankers 
admit to tightening credit standards, and report that highly 
leveraged companies and speculative real estate projects will face 
difficulty obtaining credit. The bankers insist that loans are 
readily available to borrowers with strong balance sheets and solid 
cash flow. Many reports suggest that weak economic conditions 
combined with closer regulatory scrutiny have caused this tightening 
of credit standards.
