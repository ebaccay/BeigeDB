     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments of recent weeks have not altered the outlook for the 
economy and for inflation, according to Fourth District respondents. 
They are optimistic that nonresidential fixed investment will 
increase more this year than last because of further strengthening 
in traditional capital goods industries. Retailers, buoyed by much 
stronger-than-expected spending since last fall, are optimistic over 
consumer spending at least through the spring. Financial industry 
respondents do not yet see signs of slower loan growth because of 
higher interest rates. Thrifts are very competitively pricing CDs, 
although many experienced another loss of deposits in February.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents still expect a slightly slower growth rate in output 
this year than last, and a slightly higher inflation rate. Even the 
most optimistic of the forecasters remain confident about their real 
GNP forecast of slightly more than 3% growth this year. One 
respondent, however, expects that there are downside risks to his 
slower growth forecast if interest rates continue to rise, and 
another believes that higher interest rates make his forecast of no-
growth late this year more plausible.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Further upward cost/price pressures especially in manufacturing, are 
expected in 1989 by most respondents. Steel prices are expected to 
rise further this half before weakening later in the year, and 
strong demand for heavy-duty trucks, bearings, and special industry 
machinery is expected to boost prices more in 1989 than in 1988. 
Many manufacturers are expected to operate at or close to capacity, 
and will attempt to pass through higher costs of materials incurred 
last year when conditions may not have been as favorable. Wage rates 
in retailing are rising because of a shortage of workers. An 
alternative view of inflation, however, anticipates moderating 
inflation because supply will increase faster than demand and energy 
and food prices will increase less this year than last.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital goods prospects for l989 are strong, especially for 
traditional capital goods industries. The bearings industry is still 
operating at full capacity and may be allocating its output for most 
of the year. Some industrial equipment producers are also operating 
at or close to capacity, with orders and backlogs still rising. 
"Boom" conditions mark the heavy-duty truck business, with operating 
rates the highest since the late 1970s. A producer of motors and 
engines reports that the surge in orders last quarter has continued 
into February and March, although operations are not close to full 
capacity. Nevertheless, their orders and shipments will be several
percent higher than they previously forecast. Strength in most 
traditional capital goods industries has led one economist to 
conclude that his forecast of a 6% increase in real nonresidential 
fixed investment this year could be on the low side. Industry 
respondents generally do not expect that higher interest rates will 
dampen capital goods at least this year. They uniformly report that 
tightness in capacity is being met by productivity improvements and 
"de-bottlenecking."
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers have been operating at or near capacity, and expect 
to continue to do so at least through the second quarter. Flat-
rolled steel products are still on allocation, although there is 
excess capacity for steel consumed by the construction and petroleum 
industries. Lead times are lengthening to as much as 10 weeks 
because of strong orders that may reflect hedge-buying. Steel 
respondents expect that a let up in consumption and in inventory 
buildup in the second half will ease pressures on operating rates 
and end the allocation of steel now in tight supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonautomotive retailers have been surprised by strong sales since 
last fall, which they expect to continue at least into the spring 
months. Inventories, however, will be built only cautiously. A major 
retailer reported that sales strength continued in February, and he 
expects March and April sales will show about the same rate of 
increase. Another retailer is concerned that further increases in 
interest rates will choke demand because of the link between 
consumer debt and interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers report February sales were averaging a little below 
average for this time of year and assert that publicity about rising 
interest rates has begun to affect sales. Many auto dealers are 
offering special financing plans at below-market rates. Dealers are 
generally optimistic over spring sales, however, unless interest 
rates continue to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Higher interest rates apparently have had little visible effect on 
borrowing activity. Most lenders believe interest rates on loans 
have not risen enough to slow loan growth, although some bank 
economists expect that the latest jump in interest rates, especially 
mortgage rates, will slow borrowing later this year. According to 
one economist, the only apparent effect of higher interest rates so 
far has been in trade rather than in domestic demand; he still 
expects a 3% real GNP growth rate this year, with a considerably 
slower second half because of higher interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thrift institutions experienced another net deposit outflow in 
February, although not as severe as in January. Even some large, 
well-capitalized thrifts have outflows nearly as large or larger 
than in January. A large thrift reversed its massive January outflow 
in February, but solely on the basis of its newly introduced CD that 
is competitive with Treasury bill yields. Another experienced its 
second successive monthly net inflow of deposits by very aggressive 
pricing of its CDs.
