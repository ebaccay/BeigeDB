      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District are increasingly concerned that 
the inflation rate for 1990 will exceed 4%. Consumer spending in 
recent months has been better than any retailers expected. A 
strengthening in manufacturing output is generally expected to be 
mild. Respondents suggest there is little evidence of a "credit 
crunch" in the Fourth District, although credit standards are said 
to have tightened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The surge in consumer prices in March has led many respondents to 
believe that the 4% rate of inflation they expected for 1990 may be 
too low. Some expect that the increase in the GNP implicit price 
deflator was in a 5 percent to 6 percent range last quarter, 
although moderation in price increases is widely expected this 
quarter. A common concern seems to be that commodity prices continue 
to firm gradually, and service prices have been accelerating. Some 
point out that the hike in the minimum wage will add to wage costs 
especially in the trade sector of the economy. Moreover, food prices 
this year could increase more than the average in recent years 
because of environmental restrictions on use of herbicides that can 
constrain yields and output.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers' descriptions of sales in recent months range from "better 
than expected" to "very strong." One retailer reported that even 
furniture and appliance sales were "good," although consumers are 
resisting higher prices. Apparel sales were especially strong 
despite the surge in prices in February and March. A retailer 
asserted that the price hikes were associated with consumers buying 
higher quality goods and with new fashions. Others stated that 
retailers are trying to restore profit margins that deteriorated 
badly during the Christmas season. In addition, higher raw materials 
prices and the increase in the minimum wage have added to retail 
costs and prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      With both the level of sales and profits better than expected last 
quarter, retailers appear guardedly optimistic about near-term 
prospects. There is some concern, however, that some sales last 
quarter may borrow from the second quarter, and that demand for 
household goods may soften because of further weakening in housing. 
In general, retail economists still expect about a 2% increase in 
real consumer spending this year from last.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto producers and dealers have mixed reports on sales and 
prospects. For some, retail sales in February and March rebounded 
enough to bring inventories down to a desired level. April sales so 
far have been soft despite generous incentives. Dealers report floor 
plan costs have been held down because of smaller inventories this 
year than last, and some report shortages for some mid-sized cars. 
Profits are still being strained because incentives and marketing 
costs are said to average as much as $1200 per car and are 
considerably higher for mid-sized cars. Incentives on some Japanese 
cars have increased by about $500.00.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District respondents generally agree that the worst of the 
production cutbacks are over, although most expect strengthening 
this quarter and next will be mild. Low-technology producers of 
industrial and electrical machinery equipment expect only a few 
percent increase in output over the next few quarters. Auto 
production is rebounding from a poor first quarter, and cutbacks in 
second quarter plans are being rescinded, although output is still 
expected to be slightly below a year ago. Steel producers are 
raising their forecasts of production slightly for 1990 from earlier 
this year. Auto bookings for the second quarter have picked up from 
the first quarter, and steel warehouses have stepped up orders, 
probably in anticipation of a small increase in sheet steel prices 
announced for July. Also, the volume of imports has been less than 
expected and exports a little larger than expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production and shipments of machine cutting tools continue to rise 
but solely on the strength of backlogs that have been dwindling 
rapidly because of the lag in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      An expected revival in heavy-duty truck business has been slow to 
develop. Orders in February fell below the low of last August, and a 
comeback in March only matched the relatively low average of last 
fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cincinnati Purchasing Agents report orders and production rose for 
the third successive month in March, and commodity prices firmed 
again after several months of decline. A commercial bank shows that 
durable goods manufacturers expect a rebound in their business 
following declines in the previous three-month period
     </p>
     .
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents suggest there is little evidence of a credit crunch in 
this District. There are, however, reports of some tightening of 
credit standards. Nonetheless, lenders report that credit is 
available to qualified borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small business firms in the District reported no awareness of credit 
restraints, although perceptions are that some lenders are 
tightening credit standards. Only one small business firm reported 
that banks are not lending, especially for commercial real estate 
because of depressed prices due to high vacancy rates. Several new 
car dealers reported some tightening in credit standards by both 
banks and thrifts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small builders apparently have not been shut off from credit, 
although FIRREA legislation has made it more difficult to obtain 
sufficient credit from a single lender. Thrifts contacted assert 
there is no lack of funds in the mortgage market for qualified 
builders and buyers, and reported that their loan volume so far this 
year exceeds the same period last year. They acknowledged that the 
15% limit on loans is an inconvenience to some builders and 
developers. Several banks in the District also reported that their 
loans so far this year exceed last year, although some tightening in 
credit standards has taken place in view of rising office vacancy 
rates, foreclosures, and nonperforming real estate loans.
