      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District picked up in November 
according to contacts in major business sectors. Manufacturers noted 
increases in shipments and new orders although they continue to 
report declines in employment. Retailers generally indicated that 
both customer traffic and sales remained on an upward trend, and 
most of those contacted in late November said business was running 
at or above the pace they had expected for the month. Third District 
bankers noted an increase in demand for commercial and industrial 
loans. They said they continued to originate a large number of 
residential mortgages but applications for both refinancing and 
purchase mortgages had dropped sharply in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, most of the Third District business contacts polled 
for this report anticipate continuing improvement at a modest pace. 
Manufacturers generally expect the upward trend in orders to remain 
intact, boosting order backlogs and prompting some increases in 
employment during the next six months. On the basis of the current 
pace of sales, retailers have raised their expectations for the 
Christmas season. Many believe that sales for this holiday period 
will exceed last year's by a better margin than has been the case in 
recent years. Some express caution for 1993, however, as they expect 
potential tax increases, if they are enacted, to dampen consumer 
spending. Bankers expect both loans and deposits to move upward 
through next year, although they expect the rate of increase to be 
slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District picked up in November, 
according to reports from area industrial companies. While around 
half of those contacted said business was steady, just over one-
third indicated that they had stepped up shipments and were 
receiving more new orders compared to the prior month. The gains 
appeared to be spread among most of the major industry groups in the 
region with the exception of textile producers and manufacturers of 
transportation equipment who noted declining shipments and orders. 
Despite the indications of improvement Third District manufacturers 
report that order backlogs are just steady and that employment has 
slipped, on balance. Area industrial companies continue to report 
that prices for both inputs and their own products are generally
stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, managers at Third District industrial plants are 
optimistic. More than two-thirds of those contacted for this report 
expect increases in shipments and orders over the next six months, 
and nearly one-third anticipate rising order backlogs. While a 
majority plan to keep employment levels steady, one-quarter indicate 
they will step up hiring and extend working hours. An equal number 
are scheduling increases in capital spending for the next six 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Third District retailers contacted in late November said both 
customer traffic and sales were on the rise, and the trend appeared 
to continue through Thanksgiving weekend. While some merchants said 
sales at their stores were running below the rate for which they had 
planned, most indicated that business was picking up to meet or 
exceed anticipated levels for this time of the year. The recent 
gains have led many Third District merchants to raise their 
expectations for the Christmas shopping period. Several said they 
believe the year-over-year gains could exceed those of the past 
several years. Some retailers expressed caution for 1993, however. 
These merchants said sales growth could stall if personal income 
taxes are increased next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from major Third District banks in November indicated that 
overall loan volume outstanding was moving up slowly, representing 
an improvement in loan demand from the situation that has prevailed 
throughout most of this year. Bankers said lending was on the 
increase in three major credit categories--business, consumer, and 
real estate loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several bankers noted that demand for commercial and industrial 
loans was rising and that banks were competing aggressively for new 
business loans in the region. While the actual pace of growth was 
described as slow, bankers said the demand was coming from a broad 
range of companies, including middle market and small businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers gave mixed reports on consumer lending, but it appeared that 
consumer loan volume was increasing, on balance, at Third District 
banks. Several bankers said a significant number of their customers 
were consolidating installment credit into home equity loans. 
Nevertheless, these bankers said total consumer-oriented lending was 
increasing at their institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the bankers contacted for this report said they were 
continuing to book residential mortgages at a strong pace in 
November, but most also said that new applications for refinancings 
and purchase mortgages had fallen sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, the balance of opinion among Third District bankers 
interviewed for this report was that both loan volume and deposits 
will grow in 1993, albeit slowly. Most bankers said they expect only 
modest increases in funding needs in the near future and they 
anticipate that net interest margins will remain at or only slightly 
below current levels.
