      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms report increases 
in both production and sales since the beginning of the year. Some 
cite strong export activity as a major source of demand. Many 
manufacturers are comfortable with current employment levels. 
Residential construction activity and both new and existing home 
sales remain above their year-ago levels. Business and consumer 
loans outstanding have increased since the beginning of the year, 
while real estate loans have declined, primarily because of 
refinancing activity and pay-downs. Southern pine lumber producers 
report that orders are up substantially from year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      More than three-fourths of District manufacturing contacts report 
that sales are up since the beginning of the year. Sales increases 
range from 5 percent for plumbing and heating and cooling equipment 
to more than 13 percent for an aerospace-related equipment business 
that has converted some of its defense technologies into consumer 
goods. A maker of hydraulic parts and equipment reports that exports 
are booming, especially for oil reclamation equipment. A contact in 
the food distribution industry, however, is concerned that the 
recent increase in sales is another false start.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders have exceeded expectations for many firms. Another maker of 
hydraulic parts reports a current backlog equal to about 80 percent 
of current annual volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many contacts say they currently are comfortable with employment 
levels but see some prospects for hiring in the near future. 
Producers of hydraulic equipment expect to hire as demand, 
especially from foreign firms, increases. An Indiana appliance 
producer will add 1,800 hourly employees this spring because of 
increasing foreign demand. A Kentucky poultry processor announced an 
expansion that will add 300 jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some firms continue to contract, however. Large defense-related 
firms continue to reduce employment as government and foreign demand 
fall. St. Louis will lose one of its three auto plants, which 
employs about 3,800 workers, by the end of this year. In addition, a 
pharmaceutical company in Indiana eliminated more than 200 jobs as 
it reduced the size of its company. Many small manufacturers report 
difficulty obtaining bank financing. In particular, they are 
concerned about their dwindling lines of credit; as they pay down 
credit lines, banks are concurrently lowering their caps.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonmanufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several District nonmanufacturing firms report increased sales as 
well. Retailers have seen consistent gains in year-over-year sales, 
with some department stores reporting double-digit increases. This 
has translated into higher levels of retail employment, especially 
in St. Louis. In addition, a retail holding company will relocate 
its headquarters to the St. Louis area, bringing about 400 
employees. Since the beginning of the year, plumbing contractors 
have experienced close to a 5 percent increase in sales after two 
years of decline. Most of this increase has come from residential 
and public works projects. Public utilities also expect steady 
growth over the coming months from increased residential 
construction. Employment in the St. Louis health care industry has 
continued to expand in recent months. In addition, a mortgage 
company in Missouri, after reducing employment by almost 2,100 
during 1991 and 1992, has been rehiring and is now 500 workers below 
the company's peak level of employment. The District mining 
industry, however, sustained more losses as a Missouri mine closed, 
eliminating 340 jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family home construction and new home sales continue to be 
above year-ago levels in most parts of the District. Prices of both 
new and existing homes are rising. Contacts note that first-time 
homebuyers are still the largest segment of the market, but that 
move-up buyers are increasing in number. Builders are increasingly 
concerned about rising lumber prices, which are reducing their 
profit margins. These higher prices will likely be passed on to 
consumers this spring when lumber stocks are exhausted and activity 
picks up further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to be strengthening. Business loans outstanding 
have increased 1.3 percent since the start of the year at a sample 
of small and mid-sized District banks but have been flat at a sample 
of large District banks. Consumer loans, in contrast, have been flat 
at the small and mid-sized banks and up 1.9 percent at the large 
banks during the same period. Real estate loans outstanding have 
fallen at both groups of banks; contacts attribute the decline to 
the continuation of refinancing activity and the pay-down of 
mortgages by consumers. Mortgage origination activity continues to 
be unseasonably high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The winter wheat crop in the District is reported to be in mostly 
fair to good condition. In a few areas, however, substantial amounts 
of precipitation may have caused damage to the crop. District rice 
producers expect prices to remain at current low levels through the 
first half of the year because of weak export prospects. In general, 
both crop and livestock prices are higher across the District than 
they were in the previous month; crop prices generally remain below 
last year's levels, while livestock prices are somewhat higher than 
a year ago. Southern pine lumber producers report orders are up 
nearly 15 percent from one year ago. Tight supplies are expected to 
keep lumber prices relatively high for the foreseeable future.
