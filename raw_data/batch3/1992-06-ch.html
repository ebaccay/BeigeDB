       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Seventh District generally continued 
to post gains in recent weeks, while conditions in service-related 
industries were more mixed. Reports from manufacturers, supplemented 
by business surveys, depicted a widening of the recovery in the 
District's industrial sector, with renewed gains for capital goods 
producers joining continued strengthening in production of consumer 
durable goods, primarily autos. The lengthening recovery in the 
motor vehicle sector has been accompanied by improved results 
reported by a wide variety of producers of auto parts and capital 
goods. Business-related services offered increasingly optimistic 
reports, while some consumer-related services indicated a slower 
pace from earlier this year. Cool, dry weather has adversely 
impacted the early development of many District crops. Price 
increases generally remained modest, and most contacts noted that 
efforts to raise prices have been strongly resisted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The manufacturing sector continued to strengthen in recent weeks, as 
reports from manufacturers and business surveys indicated further 
gains in industrial activity in the Seventh District. A large steel 
producer reported that orders have been building faster than the 
normal seasonal pattern, and year-to-date bookings are substantially 
above a weak year-earlier period. A manufacturer of hydraulic 
equipment expected a modest but continuing recovery, with a boost 
from Caterpillar's return to production. Strengthening in production 
of off-highway vehicles was also indicated by a motor vehicle parts 
supplier, who stated that orders have turned higher since the first 
quarter. A large chemical producer reported that orders have been 
"very positive." singling out engineered plastics used in 
automobiles. A large manufacturer of machine tools reported that the 
firm's bookings have risen substantially since the beginning of the 
year, with strength in orders from motor vehicle manufacturers 
joined by improvements in demand from producers of industrial 
machinery, farm equipment, and construction machinery. However, 
retail sales of farm equipment remained soft through May, according 
to a large manufacturer, and the firm recently shaved ifs forecast 
for 1992 shipments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent surveys supported anecdotal evidence of further strengthening 
in District manufacturing activity. The composite index for the 
Chicago purchasing managers' survey climbed higher in May, led by 
production and new orders. The new orders component has posted 
marketed improvement in recent months and has risen to levels well 
above those that prevailed prior to the onset of the recession. The 
overall index for the Detroit survey was essentially unchanged in 
May, after climbing to its highest level in the past three years 
during April. Purchasing managers' surveys in Milwaukee, Southwest 
Michigan, and Indianapolis have also been posting results consistent 
with a recovery in recent months. Finally, an April survey of 
metalworking firms indicated solid gains in production, orders, and 
employment with above-average results posted in a key activity 
considered to be a leading indicator for metalworking firms as a 
whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Domestic motor vehicle sales and production generally continued to 
strengthen in recent weeks. One large automaker reported that 
"dealer orders continue to look good," implying production in excess 
of 100 percent of capacity (at straight time) at some plants in 
coming months. Auto dealer optimism has improved faster than actual 
showroom traffic, because closure rates and traffic quality have 
been rising. Another automaker reported that fleet purchases 
continue to take a lower share of deliveries, while program cars are 
accounting for a lower share of the retail sales mix. Used car 
prices, a good coincident indicator of retail sales of new cars, 
have climbed higher over the past few months. Light truck sales have 
exceeded forecast, and there is "no sign of weakening here." One 
producer noted that light truck production has increased 
substantially during 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of improving activity front motor vehicle suppliers 
generally reinforced these observations. For example, one 
manufacturer reported a pickup in sales as well as production 
planning, and the firm has reached the point where "we can't do the 
work we have to do with the labor force we have." A manufacturer of 
power train components stated that its strongest market now is 
heavy-duty trucks, where orders have shown a substantial 
acceleration in the past several months, although efforts to hedge 
against a price increase anticipated later this year may be playing 
a role in recent gains. However, this contact also noted that the 
medium-duty truck market still faces soft demand in some customer 
classes, notably construction contractors and state and local 
governments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business and Consumer Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Suppliers of business-related services reported higher levels of 
activity in May, but some softening in retail sales growth has 
followed a robust first quarter, A large temporary help firm stated 
that "we are very much encouraged by recent trends." Demand began to 
turn up toward the end of last year and momentum has moved higher in 
recent weeks. While the national improvement has been broad-based, 
demand by industrial firms for temporary employees is above-average. 
With its large manufacturing base, employment in the Seventh 
District has been outperforming other regions. After a trough in 
January, industrial power sales in Western Michigan continued to 
post solid increases in recent months, reflecting improvement in 
appliance and motor vehicle production, Another large utility in 
Michigan reported that a leading indicator of business conditions in 
the Detroit area continued to improve through May. One large 
retailer reported that year-over-year sales gains continued to 
soften in recent weeks, although sales of durable goods continued to 
hold up relatively well. Last year at this time, sales were picking 
up after the end of the war, leading to some softening in the 
current year-over-year comparison, but the firm's inventory has 
again risen above plan after progress was reported in shaving it to 
desired levels earlier in the year. Some concern with the effect of 
softening in sales on inventory levels was also expressed by another 
major retail chain, where sales in May and early June were 
essentially flat compared to last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rapid progress in May culminated in a "faster-than-normal" 
completion of the spring planting season for most District farmers. 
However, early-season development of most crops has been slow due to 
cool temperatures and very dry conditions. Northern portions of the 
District were hit by a frost in late May, causing modest damage to 
corn and soybeans and more extensive damage to fruits and 
vegetables. In some cases, farmers may be able to offset the frost 
damage by replanting.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports indicated that price increases, on balance, remained modest 
A steel producer reported that an attempt by the industry to reduce 
sales discounts "fizzled out" in April, but producers are still 
experiencing price increases on purchased materials, and have 
announced the intention of increasing sheet prices in July. A large 
automaker stated that there was little sign of price pressures from 
parts suppliers and does not expect the recently announced steel 
price hike for July to hold. However, new car sales volume (in 
units) has been held back somewhat by a 2 percent quality-adjusted 
increase in prices over the past year, primarily for foreign 
nameplates. An auto parts manufacturer acknowledged some price 
pressures from its own suppliers and, in turn, reported seeking 
price increases from large automakers. Another auto parts 
manufacturer reported that obtaining price increases is "extremely 
difficult." Crude oil and natural gas prices have firmed in recent 
weeks, according to a large refiner, primarily due to increased 
demand. A chemical producer reported that a cyclically-sensitive 
index of product prices has been relatively flat since last August, 
although some strengthening has been evident in recent weeks. A 
large personnel company reported that wage pressures have been 
minimal, and stated that "we don't see pricing coming back," despite 
improved demand in recent months.
