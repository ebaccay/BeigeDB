      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy varied somewhat among 
sectors during recent weeks. General business conditions continued 
to be stable or improved and office leasing remained good in most 
areas. Some slowing in residential construction activity occurred, 
however, and consumer spending was not uniformly on or above plan. 
Small and mid-sized banks reported a decline in primary mortgage 
rates during June and July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of sales at District department stores was mixed during 
June, but for the most part respondents reported results that were 
on or above plan. One retailer with lower-than-targeted June sales 
noted that its stores ran a special promotional in May with very 
strong sales, and this detracted from some of their usual Father's 
Day business in June. Consequently, the chain is viewing the two 
months as a single unit this year, the combined results for which 
were slightly above plan. Overall, June sales among respondents 
ranged from 4 percent to 12 percent above year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Items for which there was good demand in June were apparel of all 
types, not just for Father's Day, and housewares, furniture and 
rugs. Inventories continue to be monitored closely and generally are 
on or slightly above target. One retailer whose chain has had 
higher-than-desired stocks in recent months plans an additional 
promotional In the near future to try to pare inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The improved tone in the District's economic activity continued in 
recent weeks. The Buffalo survey of purchasing managers registered a 
sizable increase in the percentage reporting better conditions while 
in Rochester, for the second consecutive month, no respondents 
experienced a worsening. Both area surveys, however, found an 
increase during June in the percentage of firms reporting higher 
commodity costs following a decline in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several recent developments point to a positive impact on the 
District's economy. The New York Times announced plans to spend $400 
million, its largest capital investment ever, on a new printing 
plant in New Jersey. Estimated to be the size of 20 football fields, 
the plant will ease production constraints at existing sites and 
permit growth of the Sunday edition. Also in New Jersey, Governor 
Kean has just presented plans for a $200 million state center for 
the performing arts to be erected in Newark, plus expenditures of 
about $50 million on other performance facilities in the District. 
In another development, ground was recently broken in Manhattan for 
Shearson Lehman's new office tower which, upon completion, will 
house 1500 new employees together with 5000 workers currently 
employed by the firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A slackening in the pace of District residential construction 
occurred in recent weeks which was described in terms ranging from 
"negligible" to "definitely slower". The main reasons cited for the 
slowdown were a two percentage point rise in mortgage rates in some 
areas and the high level to which land and home prices have risen in 
others. Responses were also mixed as to the near-term outlook. Some 
homebuilders reported a pickup had already begun while others 
anticipated that the slower pace would continue. For the most part, 
however, District builders still expect this year's activity to run 
at or close to the rate in 1986, which for many was a record.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leasing activity in the District's commercial and industrial markets 
generally remains good. Among new undertakings, construction has 
begun on a large mixed-use office, residential and commercial 
complex at a four-acre site in mid-Manhattan which for many years 
had served as a parking lot. A major tenant has already been 
announced for the office skyscraper to be built there. While 
conditions have generally been good, some concern has been voiced 
recently regarding developments in Westchester County and northern 
New Jersey where office vacancy rates remain at 20% or above. 
Leasing activity in much of Westchester has been slow in recent 
months, and while northern New Jersey continues to attract new 
tenants, a spate of newly announced large office projects has raised 
the possibility of increasing vacancy rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small and mid-sized banks in the Second District report that primary 
mortgage rates have mirrored the national pattern, rising during 
April and May and declining by a smaller amount since then. The 
banks attributed the recent decline to consumer resistance to higher 
rates and competitive pressures from other banks. Most banks 
expected that the reduced demand for primary mortgages would put 
additional downward pressure on rates in the near future. However, a 
few respondents thought that rates had stabilized. As interest rates 
rose earlier in the year, the demand for adjustable rate mortgages 
relative to fixed rate loans increased dramatically. This trend has 
reversed itself since interest rates turned down, and the portfolio 
mix now is very close to that at the beginning of the year. Despite 
the lower demand for primary mortgages, banks do not expect that 
home equity loans will be negatively affected because of the low 
rates and tax advantages associated with them.
