       March 10, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic expansion continued in January and early 
February. Labor markets strengthened, with some indications of 
increased hiring momentum. Consumer spending growth held up 
relatively well following the better-than-expected holiday season, 
but adverse weather may have dampened sales in February. Expansion 
in production continued along the pattern of improvement in the 
fourth quarter of 1992, although several producers noted increased 
concern about overseas markets. Reports from banks suggested 
commercial loan demand strengthened in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from recruiting firms, individual companies, and employer 
surveys generally indicated that District labor markets strengthened 
in early 1993. with some indications of increased momentum. A large 
survey conducted by a temporary help company found continued 
improvement in hiring plans among Midwest businesses, with modestly 
stronger plans indicated for the region than the national average. 
After bottoming out in early 1991, the employment component of the 
Chicago purchasing managers' survey reached a five-year high in 
January, then slipped back slightly in February. A number of 
respondents to purchasing manager' surveys in Western Michigan 
reported hiring previously laid-off workers in recent months. A 
January survey of over 150 metalworking firms in the Chicago area 
showed strengthening in employment among respondents, and the survey 
director stated that some businesses are "beginning to scramble to 
try and find people." A number of personnel firms reported that 
client companies increased their permanent hiring of employees 
previously working on a temporary basis. One recruiting firm 
reported a "pretty good pickup" in permanent placements in early 
1993. Increased demand remained centered among small-to-medium sized 
employers, where a recovery began in mid-1992, but this contact also 
said that a "sprinkling" of a recovery was emerging among larger 
companies, and at higher salary levels. One firm noted that 
inquiries from potential employees have declined about 50 percent 
since peaking in the second quarter of 1992. An auto parts and 
industrial equipment manufacturer stated that "we're doing all we 
can to keep from hiring," but employment has been moving higher with 
the current upturn in the firm's business, and is expected to 
continue to go marginally higher in the second half of the year. A 
number of large firms stated that employment gains were not expected 
to follow recent increases in business activity, citing productivity 
gains, and some large companies expect restructuring to adversely 
affect their employment in the District during 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers generally indicated that sales growth held up well after a 
better-than-expected holiday season, although some contacts noted 
that bad weather impacted sales in February. A large department 
store chain indicated that year-over-year same-store sales growth 
improved from January to February, with above-average sales gains 
reported for new seasonal merchandise, household goods, and big-
ticket items in general. This contact stated that it is still 
planning conservatively, however. A retail chain with stores located 
primarily in the Midwest noted modest softening in year-over-year 
sales gains in early 1993, but after a better-than-expected holiday 
season and over a relatively good year-earlier period. A large 
retail chain stated that sales of durable goods, particularly 
appliances, continued to improve in early 1993, although inclement 
weather hurt overall sales in February. This firm's year-over-year 
sales gains reportedly lagged the national average in several 
Midwest markets in recent months. A number of retailers in the 
Detroit area reported better-than-expected sales gains in January, 
and sales held up relatively well in February in view or the bad 
weather. The average year-over-year sales increase for dealers 
surveyed at a recent recreational vehicle trade show in the Midwest 
was over 40 percent. Attendance at a recent auto trade show in 
Milwaukee surpassed the record set last year in spite of bad 
weather, with dealers generally reporting that the share of 
potential buyers in total attendance was higher than it was last 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers' surveys and reports from individual firms 
indicated that expansion in District manufacturing activity 
continued in recent months, in line with the rate of improvement 
seen in the fourth quarter of 1992. The production components of 
purchasing managers' surveys in Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit 
continued to indicate moderate expansion in production in early 
1993. In January, the production component of the Chicago survey 
reached its highest level since 1988, then slipped slightly to a 
still-healthy level of 69.8 percent in February. Production and new 
orders improvement were evident in surveys conducted in Western 
Michigan, and one respondent stated that "our suppliers are getting 
a little arrogant." Output by producers of basic materials used in 
durable goods production continued to move higher, although weakness 
lingered in some markets, and several contacts noted further slowing 
in sales into Europe. A large steel producer reported that a slow 
recovery in orders continued, with above-average strength noted for 
several sectors where District production is specialized, including 
autos, appliances, and industrial machinery. Steel shipments growth 
continued in January, but difficult weather impacted shipments in 
the District in February. A large oil refiner reported that the 
underlying trend in investment spending related to domestic 
exploration remained weak, and a heavy equipment manufacturer stated 
that sales of petroleum equipment have softened worldwide. An 
electronics manufacturer reported continued gains in domestic 
markets in line with those posted in late 1992, but this contact 
stated that "Europe is beginning to look like a basket case." A 
diversified manufacturer noted that weakness persists in overseas 
markets for several product areas, although domestic orders for auto 
servicing equipment have been a bright spot. A large auto parts 
manufacturer stated that demand has been getting stronger over the 
last 90 days, both from the aftermarket and OEM customers. A large 
appliance manufacturer stated that "we had a fantastic fourth 
quarter," also noting that new energy standards induced accelerated 
dealer procurement in the fourth quarter of 1992. A large retailer, 
however, stated that consumer demand remained strong in early 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of large District banks indicated that commercial loan 
demand was unchanged to moderately stronger in recent months, with 
increased demand distributed across small, medium and large 
customers. A middle-market lender stared that loan demand continued 
to pick up, but slowly and "is not yet robust." although loan 
marketing intensified in recent weeks. Another bank reported that 
outstanding commercial loan volume increased in recent months, 
driven by customers' needs for financing growth in inventory and 
receivables. This contact said that commercial loan quality has been 
improving along with borrowers' earnings, but some financing 
challenges remain. Several banks in Michigan reported increased loan 
demand from firms in heavy equipment industries. One large bank in 
the Chicago area stated that commercial lending activity "picked up 
dramatically" in January, citing capital investment by large 
manufacturing firms. Several banks stated that home mortgage 
refinancing picked up renewed momentum. One bank reported a record 
year for new consumer installment lending in 1992, as rising demand 
for auto loans promoted increased strength in lending toward the end 
of the year.
