      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 6, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Sixth District economy continued its spotty expansion in mid-summer with key manufacturing industries very strong, but services 
moderating and construction weak. Strength elsewhere in the U.S. 
economy appears to be dampening migration, especially in Georgia and 
to some extent in Florida. Retail sales have shown renewed 
sluggishness, though recent dealer incentives have sustained auto 
sales. Homebuilding remains soft and nonresidential construction has 
been declining in major regional markets, where inventories of space 
are high. Recent rainfall has improved prospects for crops and 
livestock in many areas earlier affected by the drought. Selected 
industries are producing at capacity and raising prices but wage 
increases are modest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial activity appears to be generally healthy, with several 
export-related industries operating at capacity levels. In textiles, 
demand for carpet is strong; demand for apparel fabric is down, but 
producers expect that dampened imports will lead to stronger demand 
for domestic products. The wood products industry continues to do 
well, with both domestic and foreign demand expected to continue 
growing into next year. Paper and packaging materials producers, 
operating essentially at full capacity, report that they can easily 
pass on price increases. Increased foreign demand is expected to 
offset slower domestic growth for commodity chemicals; producers 
have been expanding facilities, and a new chemical plant was 
recently announced for Louisiana. Producers of specialty chemicals 
used by the paper and electronic industries also are doing well and 
are raising prices. Manufacturers generally are not experiencing 
tight labor markets or significant upward wage pressure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The electrical equipment industry continues to benefit from the 
manufacturing revival as firms add production lines and build new 
factories. The electronics industry is being boosted by demand for 
personal computers and defense-related electronics.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ship building has benefited from major new U.S. Navy contracts, 
which have also boosted demand for regionally-produced steel plate 
and increased employment rolls in Alabama and Mississippi. Steel 
mini-mills are prospering from new business stimulated by the weaker 
dollar, and Increased demand for can sheet has led to the expansion 
of a Tennessee aluminum plant.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the Southeast slowed in August following a mild 
rebound in July; revenue was off from last year for several 
retailers. Although back-to-school sales in the region have not met 
retailers' expectations, the hope persists that fall sales will 
accelerate when the weather cools. In fact, retailers are fairly 
optimistic about the fall season, especially compared to their poor 
experience last year. Few expect a big jump in sales and they 
continue to order conservatively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car sales were brisk in August, helped by moderate model clearance 
incentives. The August volume was lower than a year earlier, when 
bigger incentives strongly boosted sales. Truck sales continue to 
post healthy year-over-year gains. Though Georgia and Florida 
account for about half the region's volume gain, Louisiana and 
Mississippi are pouting the largest percentage gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, nonresidential construction was declining in mid-summer and 
was at its lowest level since last winter. Even the Georgia market, 
which has been posting the highest year-over-year percentage 
increases, has softened. South Florida's office market is notably 
weak, but industrial park construction has picked up as export trade 
booms. Elsewhere, Tampa's huge wave of new construction and 
absorption has begun to subside. However, hotel construction in 
Orlando is booming and the office market has been a bright spot in 
Nashville.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction dropped one-fifth in July from June's 
level, mostly from a slowdown in single family construction. Reduced 
migration continues to exert a drag on housing demand. Multifamily 
housing remains overbuilt in several major cities, including 
Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, and New Orleans. In Atlanta, 
multifamily building permits and construction are up sharply from 
last summer's low levels; there also is evidence of an apartment 
price war. Tampa's condo market is expanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business loans continue to exhibit strength, while real estate 
lending is flat because of the slowdown in home sales and the end of 
the refinancing boom. Consumer lending in Louisiana and Mississippi 
is showing strong growth as a result of vigorous car sales. 
Beginning July 1, legislation permitted commercial banks in 
Mississippi to acquire or be acquired by banking companies in 
Alabama, Louisiana, or Tennessee; the first inter-state deal was a 
proposed acquisition of a Mississippi bank by a Memphis bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism has been one of the best industry performers this summer 
even though there has been little growth over last year. Despite 
reports that travelers are cutting back both on length of stay and 
discretionary spending, Florida anticipates record-breaking fall and 
winter seasons. in Central Florida, the Space Shuttle Discovery is 
providing a strong boost to attendance at the Kennedy Space Center. 
Traffic at Orlando International Airport continues to grow rapidly, 
but the Tampa and Miami airports have reported significant declines 
this summer, primarily the result of flight cutbacks by Eastern 
Airlines. Also, New Orleans expects a drop in visitors and reduced 
hotel occupancy this fall following the spurt accompanying the 
Republican National Convention.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Southeast received badly needed rains in recent weeks; 
the moisture came in time to help a majority of crops. The forestry 
industry continues to experience a roller coaster year as prices of 
many common lumber products have fallen about one-fifth in recent 
weeks after earlier advances. The summer drought improved logging 
conditions and allowed lumber supplies to outrace demand. Fewer home 
starts are limiting demand and enhanced competition from Canadian 
producers, caused by reduced rail rates on Canada's nationalized 
railroads, may also have contributed to price weakness.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal production remains stable while oil production is down 
moderately from last year's level. Oil exploration in the region has 
yielded new discoveries in Alabama and Mississippi.
