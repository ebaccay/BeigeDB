      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the District economy have remained mixed in recent 
weeks. The pace of office leasing picked up in parts of the District 
and the June surveys of purchasing managers in both Buffalo and 
Rochester showed some improvement. The unemployment rate declined in 
New Jersey but rose in New York and further substantial job losses 
are expected in the banking, airline, and government sectors. Many 
homebuilders now expect that sales of new homes this year will be at 
best only slightly improved over the low levels of 1990. June sales 
at District department stores were below year-ago levels though in 
some cases these results were on or above plan. Most officers 
surveyed at small and mid-sized banks reported no change in the 
ratio of business loans to total credit over the last three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      June sales at District department stores were below year-ago levels 
though in some cases these results were on or even above plan. Over-
the-year decreases of from 1.0 to 11.0 percent were attributed to a 
recessionary environment and stronger-than-expected May sales due to 
unusually warm weather which borrowed from June. Most respondents do 
not anticipate much improvement in sales before the fourth quarter 
at best.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of big ticket items remained sluggish at most stores though 
extra promotional activity brought a pickup in furniture sales in 
one case. Items that sold best were various types of men's and 
women's apparel. Despite June's slow sales, most respondents 
reported that inventories were right on target when July summer 
clearance sales began.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After a flurry of home buying activity during the spring, sales have 
become more subdued. Moreover, since much of the earlier buying was 
in the resale market, many homebuilders now expect that sales of new 
homes this year will be only slightly to somewhat improved over the 
low levels of 1990. On the cost side, builders report that lumber 
prices have recently risen, and a shortage of credit for acquisition 
and construction loans continues in much of the District. One large 
builder reportedly faces bankruptcy because of nonrenewal of a loan 
for a sizable development he is constructing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of office leasing picked up in parts of the District during 
recent weeks though vacancy rates remain high in many areas. Leasing 
in midtown Manhattan was the strongest in several months and no 
major blocks of new space were marketed. As a result, the primary 
vacancy rate declined for the first time since last fall after 
several months of no change. While the primary vacancy rate in 
downtown Manhattan was unchanged in June, this followed declines in 
April and May. Office leasing activity has also reportedly improved 
in northern New Jersey, but in some other parts of the District such 
as Buffalo and Fairfield County, Connecticut, vacancy rates have 
been rising, largely as a result of corporate consolidations and 
moves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The June surveys of purchasing managers in both Buffalo and 
Rochester showed some improvement. In Buffalo the percentage of 
surveyed firms with an increase in new orders rose to 27 percent 
from 4 percent in May while the percentage with greater production 
rose to 31 percent from 25 percent in May. More than 30 percent of 
surveyed firms in Rochester reported improved business conditions, 
up from 19 percent in May and 14 percent expected a worsening of 
business conditions over the next three months, down from 26 percent 
in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      The June unemployment rate declined in New Jersey to 6.6 percent 
from 6.8 percent (seasonally adjusted) but rose in New York from 7.4 
percent to 7.7 percent. New York's rate has surpassed the national 
average for the last three months while New Jersey's has been 
somewhat below. The District's employment outlook is dimmed by 
several recent announcements. The planned merger of Chemical Banking 
and Manufacturers Hanover is expected to reduce employment by some 
6,200, with up to 70 branch closings, while further restructuring at 
Citicorp could result in a job loss of another 10,000. In addition, 
the proposed sale of much of Pan Am to Delta is expected to leave 
some 10,000 more District workers without jobs. Government layoffs 
have also begun in New York and New Jersey and thousands of 
additional jobs may be eliminated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior officers surveyed at small and mid-sized banks in the 
Second District reported that their ratio of business loans to total 
credit extended has not changed over the last three months. The few 
respondents noting a change were evenly divided as to the direction.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of the surveyed banks have tightened their credit 
standards over the last three months. Most loan officers also stated 
that the credit quality of their applicants has declined. 
Nevertheless, they say their willingness to extend business loans to 
qualified borrowers has not changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The planned merger of Chemical Banking and Manufacturers Hanover 
would realign the banking market of the District. Their combined 
assets of $135.5 billion would constitute the second largest banking 
company in the nation behind Citicorp with $216.9 billion in assets. 
Their combined deposits would constitute 11.1 percent of the New 
York market behind Citicorp's 12.5 percent share.
