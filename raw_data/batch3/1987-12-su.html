      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts report overall economic expansion with particular 
strength noted in Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. 
Despite general optimism among surveyed firms, there was also 
widespread evidence of increased uncertainty about future growth in 
demand. Furthermore, while the majority of survey respondents said 
that the stock market crash had not materially altered their capital 
spending plans, reports of at least some deferrals of plans appeared 
in a number of District discussions. The manufacturing sector has 
been a prime source of recent expansion in most Districts. Retail 
sales are either flat or only slowly growing in most Districts and 
auto sales are generally sluggish. Construction activity is mixed. 
Mining is strong across a broad spectrum of extractive industries, 
but reports of the possibility of future softening in oil and gas 
drilling expansion were common. The agriculture sector is in a 
generally favorable condition among the Districts. In the financial 
markets, some slowing in the growth of loan demand was often cited.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues to expand. No District reported 
that a majority of surveyed firms had revised capital spending plans 
as a result of the stock market crash. Survey respondents generally 
had positive expectations for the near future. There was clear 
evidence, however, that the stock market crash had led to increased 
uncertainty and to a declining degree of optimism about future 
demands for manufacturers' products. St. Louis, San Francisco, and 
Chicago all cited the declining value of the dollar as a significant 
factor in generating recent manufacturing growth. Cleveland and 
Dallas noted increased demands for steel and St. Louis and Dallas 
mentioned rising demands for electrical equipment and for apparel. 
Despite the generally positive reports for manufacturing, the 
Chicago and St. Louis banks both referred to layoffs at auto 
assembly plants in their Districts and Atlanta reported that 
appliance and furniture producers are concerned that the stock 
market plunge may lead to reduced sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail respondents in most Districts report flat or at best slowly 
growing retail sales. The stock market decline appears to have had 
little effect, even in areas where the drop was cited as a reason 
for slower sales growth. The major effect seems to have been on big-
ticket items. New York, Cleveland, Richmond and San Francisco each 
reported weakness in such items, while Kansas City noted markedly 
lower sales among stores targeting upper income groups. Those 
Districts reporting on them cited reduced auto sales in October and 
November, although Philadelphia respondents said sales were above a 
year earlier. The withdrawal of manufacturers sales incentives was 
cited as the reason for auto sales declines more often than the
stock market drop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity varies considerably among Districts. Chicago 
reported overall growth, while weakening was noted in the Dallas, 
Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts and was expected in the Boston 
District. The drop in the stock market appears to have had a 
depressing effect on New York, Richmond, and Chicago home-buying. 
New York District office space demands remain high despite softening 
in the downtown Manhattan market, while high vacancy rates linked to 
past overbuilding have induced Atlanta District office and 
industrial developers to put projects on hold.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The strength in the mining sector continues across a broad spectrum 
of minerals, but several Districts report recent small declines in 
oil and gas drilling and the possibility of future sluggishness in 
energy extraction. Atlanta cites recovery in the coal industry. 
Minneapolis notes that the boom in gold mining continues and copper 
production is expanding. Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis all 
note that the recovery in drilling is slowing and report concerns 
that future expansion in drilling may cease.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Forestry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reporting Districts note improved prospects for their farm 
sectors, but several noted that recent dry weather has caused 
problems. Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Dallas all report an 
improved farm income outlook. Richmond and Chicago cite widespread 
increases in farmland prices, while farmland prices have bottomed 
out in the Minneapolis District and price movements are mixed in the 
St. Louis District. Agricultural credit conditions are improved in 
most reporting Districts. Some Districts cited problems with soybean 
yields, in part, because of dry weather conditions. Cotton 
production and livestock prices are generally cited as favorable in 
Districts that discussed them. In forestry, demand for wood used in 
paper and pulp is generally up. Lumber demand and prices are down, 
in part, because of seasonal factors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in overall loan demand appears to have slowed in a number of 
Districts. Consumer loans are either growing more slowly or have 
been unchanged at most reporting District banks, although New York 
cited strong demand since the stock market crash. Real estate loan 
expansion was fairly widely noted. Philadelphia and Kansas City 
reported essentially flat business loan activity, while Atlanta 
cited stable to increased loan demand and Cleveland noted recent 
expansions.
