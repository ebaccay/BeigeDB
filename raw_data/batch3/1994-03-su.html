      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Federal Reserve district reports indicate that the economy expanded 
moderately in January and February despite unusually severe weather 
in the East and the Midwest. The weather adversely affected consumer 
spending and construction, delayed shipments, interrupted some 
production, and boosted selected tourism and energy markets, but 
these effects were largely temporary. Manufacturing activity 
increased in most regions and sectors, with the auto industry and 
its suppliers and building products showing the most strength. 
Weather-related retail sales losses were sizable in some areas, but 
elsewhere consumer spending rose steadily; almost all district 
reports suggest that merchants expect solid sales growth in coming 
months. Real estate markets are mostly improving compared with a 
year ago, with exceptions noted in southern California and 
Connecticut. Several districts indicate that rising interest rates 
have slowed mortgage refinancings. In agricultural regions, 
financial distress stemming from last summer's floods is generally 
abating. Overall, only limited price pressures are reported; prices 
of building materials, selected metals, and some chemicals are said 
to be rising, but prices of manufactured products and consumer goods 
generally are not experiencing upward pressure.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although unseasonably cold and snowy weather hampered retail sales 
in two-thirds of the country, districts report that merchants are 
optimistic, expecting sales to increase during the first half of 
1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      The effect of winter weather on retail sales varied considerably. 
Eastern retailers were disappointed, citing substantial declines in 
sales (up to 20 percent) and minimal rebounds after storms. Midwest 
reports of sales performance were mixed, but retailers affected by 
storms expected to recoup sales losses, unlike their eastern 
counterparts. Several districts (particularly Chicago, Minneapolis, 
and Cleveland) indicated moderate to strong sales. In the West, 
retail conditions are generally good; California's consumer spending 
showed modest signs of improvement, except in the Los Angeles 
region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Durable goods are selling well in all districts. Over half reported 
solid growth in car sales and expectations of continued strength 
throughout the spring. In contrast, several eastern districts noted 
sluggish sales of nondurables, particularly apparel. Retailers in 
only one district, Richmond, expect retail prices to rise slightly; 
others anticipate stable prices because of competitive pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Scattered comments on services industries, including temporary 
employment firms, freight forwarders, and utilities, generally 
suggest improvements in economic activity. A few services industries 
in the Chicago district reportedly face shortages of items such as 
cable supplies and broadcast equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      In several districts, the cold weather affected tourism, in some 
cases for better, in others for worse. Richmond reports that both 
ski resorts and beaches in the district are enjoying an unusually 
good season. By contrast, in the Minneapolis district, tourism is 
just starting to pick up, now that the weather has moderated. 
Hawaiian tourism has been sluggish, but advance bookings suggest 
improvement. Despite the earthquake, tourism in southern California 
is also gaining strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The manufacturing sector generally remains on a positive course, 
although severe weather substantially weakened early 1994 growth in 
the Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis districts. Winter storms 
also produced minor setbacks in production, shipments, and/or orders 
for manufacturers located in the Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and 
Dallas districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Durable goods and construction account for most of the advance 
throughout the nation. Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago 
indicate very strong auto-related sales demand, although Chicago 
notes temporary slowdowns as a result of weather and truck-part 
shortages. Some areas also are experiencing growing sales of home 
furnishings, electronics products, or other durables. Even though 
cold weather is delaying some construction, Boston, Atlanta, 
Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas note strong demand for building 
materials and equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cleveland and San Francisco report that defense and aerospace 
markets are damping economic progress; Boston, New York, and Atlanta 
also mention cutbacks. Clothing and shoe business has been slow in 
the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis districts, while energy-
related manufacturing is weak in the Atlanta and Dallas districts. 
Food processing is reported to be sluggish by Philadelphia and 
Dallas, but St. Louis and Minneapolis cite increased demand for 
poultry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts indicate that prices for finished goods have remained 
relatively stable, despite increases for selected materials. Strong 
demand and scattered capacity constraints are contributing to rising 
prices for building products, according to Atlanta, Chicago, 
Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Prices also are increasing 
for some types of paper, chemicals, and metals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost all districts report hiring and capital expansion plans on 
the part of some contacts, especially those supplying automotive and 
construction markets. However, streamlining and caution continue to 
temper general gains in manufacturing employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate markets continue to improve, despite severe winter 
weather in many districts. Construction activity has borne the brunt 
of weather problems, with five districts reporting delays, although 
builders in the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts reported 
little effect on their activity. Philadelphia and Chicago indicated 
that weather temporarily slowed residential sales activity. The Los 
Angeles earthquake will increase demand for residential repair 
services over the next 6 to 12 months and freeway repair will push 
into 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential sales activity is strong or growing in over half the 
districts and three-quarters observed positive developments in 
construction. Sales are reportedly flat only in the Kansas City 
district and California. Price increases for existing homes were 
noted in two districts. Low interest rates were cited as 
contributors to current and expected increases in residential sales 
in several districts. However, contacts from Cleveland and Chicago 
expressed concern that recent sales bursts induced by low interest 
rates might be short-lived.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the commercial side, news is less positive, although construction 
is starting to increase. Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and San 
Francisco reported new construction of industrial and distribution 
facilities, while New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas 
indicated building activity in the apartment market. Demand for 
office space is flat or slowly increasing in the Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas districts. Richmond and Atlanta 
report modest rent increases. Office construction has begun in those 
districts, and in Minneapolis and parts of the San Francisco 
district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial institutions report that higher interest rates slowed 
mortgage refinancings, but in a few districts this slowdown was 
partly offset by stronger demand for home-purchase mortgages. 
Overall loan demand is characterized as stronger by the Kansas City, 
Atlanta, and Dallas districts and described as weaker by New York, 
Philadelphia, and St. Louis. Among loan categories, business loans 
exhibited the greatest strength, with New York, Richmond, Cleveland, 
and Kansas City all registering increases. Increases in auto 
financing were cited by Cleveland and Philadelphia. San Francisco 
reports stronger business loan activity in Washington and very 
strong overall loan demand in Oregon, especially for real estate 
loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dry weather in the Kansas City and Dallas districts has stunted the 
winter wheat crop and reduced the pasturage available for grazing. 
With cold weather also increasing the need for supplemental feeding, 
several districts--Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco-
note rising hay and feed grain prices. Accordingly, producers are 
reducing their livestock inventories, and cattle prices are expected 
to soften, with adverse consequences for farm incomes in cattle-
raising regions. Calving and lambing survival rates are close to 
normal despite the severe weather, according to contacts in the 
Richmond and Minneapolis districts. The financial stress caused by 
last summer's floods generally appears to be easing, although
Chicago district bankers suggest that land values and credit 
conditions still vary with the flood damage suffered.
     </p>
     <p>
      The frigid weather caused a flurry of activity in the energy 
industry. Dallas and Kansas City report that natural gas prices 
rose, and drilling for natural gas increased in the Dallas region. 
Oil exploration fell, by contrast, in the Kansas City and Dallas 
districts, with glutted oil markets keeping a lid on the price of 
crude. While drilling in the Minneapolis district remained 
unchanged, refinery output was significantly above year-earlier 
levels. Minneapolis district contacts expect 1994 to be the best 
year thus far in the 1990s for iron ore production.
