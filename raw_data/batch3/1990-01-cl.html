     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 24, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District respondents believe that the regional and national 
economies are still on a growth path, even if real GNP may have 
shown little or no change, or perhaps declined, last quarter. 
Retailers expect sluggish first-half sales. Some respondents believe 
that the worst of the cutbacks in industrial production are about 
over, although softening continues in some high-tech industries. 
Further declines in interest rates are generally expected by spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The predominant view of the Fourth District panel is that the real 
CNF growth rate last quarter ranged between zero and a 1 percent 
annual rate. They do not, however, believe that last quarter marks 
the beginning of a recession, and most still expect that slow growth 
in output this half will be followed by a revival in growth to about 
a 2.5 percent rate in the second half. One panelist still expects a 
mild recession this half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Last quarter's apparent weakness in spending was led by a cutback in 
consumer spending, especially for new cars. Major retailers report 
that sales during the holiday season rose about 5% to 6% from a year 
earlier, but that the season was as promotional as 1987. They expect 
relatively sluggish sales in the first half of 1990, with 
strengthening beginning in the summer. Inventories are close to 
plans, but still a little high in view of uncertain sales prospects. 
A national retailer is planning to reduce inventories significantly 
through aggressive sales promotions and cutbacks in orders from 
suppliers over the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tone of comments from auto dealers is guardedly optimistic. 
Sales of 1990 models are reported to be about "normal" to slightly 
below normal for this time of the model year, although foreign makes 
have been selling better than domestic cars. Some domestic dealers 
claim that price increases of Big Three cars average about 4% for 
1990 models, partly because of added safety features mandated by 
law, but some foreign car dealers report no price increases for 
their cars. Incentives are again available on a full range of 
domestic cars, but some foreign car producers apparently are 
offering dealer incentives that they expect are sufficient to close 
sales. Domestic car dealers report they have been cautious in orders
for 1990 models in an effort to hold down floor-plan costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some manufacturers believe that the worst is over for cutbacks in 
output, although the extent of an anticipated recovery is uncertain. 
Orders for heavy-duty trucks in the last three months have revived 
from last summer's low, but the recovery is still well below the 
peak levels of 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto production may be slashed to an annual rate of 4.5 million to 
5.0 million units in January, probably the low for the year, because 
of excess stocks and an uncertain sales outlook. Production is 
expected to climb to about a 6 million annual rate in February and 
March, if sales respond to broadened incentives.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel production, which had been at virtual capacity until last 
summer, has been cut to about 80% of capacity. A major producer 
reports that orders are beginning to pick up across-the-board for 
first-quarter delivery, and another expects that production will 
hold at about the level of last quarter through 1990. Lower steel 
consumption, led by weakness in auto output, rising imports, and 
inventory liquidation that will carry at least through the next few 
quarters, are expected to cause shipments to fall several percent 
from last year. Lower volume and further declines in steel prices 
will reduce profitability from last year. Capital spending, however, 
is expected to increase again because of the need for more efficient 
equipment. A smaller steel producer has cut back operations to about 
70% of capacity because of reduced auto schedules and inventory 
correction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders for small electric motors and equipment last month and for 
the fourth quarter were stronger than expected by some producers, 
and orders in January continue better-than-expected from a variety 
of markets. Weakness is centered in automotive and nonferrous 
industries. A larger increase in capital spending this year than 
last is being planned because of the need for additional capacity to 
accommodate the next peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ball bearing orders have eased from the peak in 1989:IIIQ when the 
industry was confronted with long lead times, capacity shortages, 
and double orders. High inventories are now being liquidated, but 
the recent order level is still higher than a year earlier. Plans 
call for a larger increase in capital spending in 1990 than in 1989 
for cost and quality improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some high-tech producers expect further cutbacks in orders and 
output this year from last. Communication equipment is expected to 
soften further this quarter before reviving next quarter. Softness 
in computer machinery, automotive and defense industries has slowed 
growth of semiconductor demand, although orders in December spurted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recent reduction in the prime rate to 10% is expected to be 
followed by another one-half point reduction, possibly by spring, 
according to some bank economists. The latest reduction in interest 
rates, however, is not expected to stimulate much demand for loans, 
which have been sluggish for the past several months. Fixed-rate 
mortgages on 30-year loans are common at rates of about 9.5%, and 
realtors and lenders are cautiously optimistic over the near-term 
outlook for housing.
