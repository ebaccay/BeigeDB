      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 30, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of economic activity in the Tenth District remains 
relatively slow. Many manufacturers report high capacity use rates 
and some have had problems finding skilled labor. Retailers report 
some improvement in sales recently, but automobile sales are steady 
to lower. Housing activity remains slow, with weak sales and high 
inventories of homes. Lower crude prices are leading oil companies 
to reevaluate their drilling programs, but the number of active 
drilling rigs was little changed from August to October. Loan demand 
at district commercial banks has changed little, while deposits have 
increased slightly. Solid farm incomes in spite of the drought are 
being reflected in an active market for new and used farm machinery 
and in strong farmland prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents note a general improvement in retail sales over the 
last three months. Prices are generally steady to slightly higher, 
with most retailers reporting price adjustments primarily in 
response to wholesale price increases. Inventory levels are 
typically satisfactory, although some respondents report continuing 
efforts to reduce their stocks. Retailers are cautiously optimistic 
about future sales. With no "Black Monday" effect, expectations for 
holiday season sales are more optimistic than last year at this 
time. Moderate gains from last year's sales levels are expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents report steady to lower automobile sales over the 
past month, and inventories are reported to be expanding. Adequate 
dealer and customer financing are generally available. Little change 
in sales is expected in the upcoming year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents report that materials inputs prices have risen 
moderately compared with a year ago. Materials arc generally 
available, but some lead times have lengthened. Many respondents 
have been trimming their inventories but now are satisfied with 
current levels. Capacity use rates vary widely across industries. 
However, many firms are operating near full capacity, and some firms 
report problems in finding skilled labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weaker oil prices are causing oil companies to reevaluate their 
drilling programs. October drilling activity was down almost a 
fourth from a year ago, but the average number of active drilling 
rigs in the district rose slightly from 261 in August to 265 in 
October. One respondent noted that exploration and drilling in 
Oklahoma has held up surprisingly well recently, partly due to 
significant gas discoveries in the eastern part of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the housing sector remains sluggish. Homebuilders in the 
Tenth District generally report that housing starts are down 
compared with last year and stable to slightly higher compared with 
last month. Multifamily construction continues to be the weakest 
component. Most respondents report lower sales of new homes, and 
home inventories are considered to be fairly high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents at Tenth District saving and loan institutions 
report that savings inflows are little changed either from a year 
ago or from a month ago. Virtually all respondents expect little 
change in savings inflows in the near future. Mortgage demand has 
slowed recently, partly due to seasonal factors. Mortgage interest 
rates have remained steady or increased slightly recently, and are 
expected to increase further in the next several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District commercial banks report little change in loan demand over 
the past month. Demand for commercial and industrial loans and 
consumer loans was up slightly at a few institutions, while demand 
for most other type of  loans was either constant or down slightly. 
None of the respondents changed their prime rates in the past month, 
and virtually none of them expect any change soon. Consumer loan 
rates were also unchanged at most of the banks surveyed, and no 
change is anticipated in the near term. The behavior of deposits was 
more variable. On average, deposits increased somewhat at district 
banks, with greatest strength in large CDs and small time deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's fall harvest indicates that the 1988 drought was 
generally not as severe in the Tenth District as elsewhere. The 
drought's effect on crop yields also varied widely across the 
district. Although a return to normal weather patterns is likely for 
the 1989 growing season, the drought's lingering effects on next 
year's crops remain of concern. If depleted soil moisture is not 
replenished, 1989 crops will be especially dependent on timely rains 
during the growing season. Soil moisture and autumn rainfall 
generally have been adequate for the early development of the 
recently planted winter wheat crop. But low soil moisture reserves 
are still of concern for corn and soybeans in northern Missouri and 
eastern Nebraska.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most ranchers are expected to maintain their herds through the 
winter months, in spite of high prices for drought-diminished forage 
supplies.  Grazing of the winter wheat crop's early growth has eased 
demand for tight supplies of other forages. But high feed prices are 
still likely to limit any significant expansion in cattle herds 
despite currently high cattle prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drought apparently has had little effect on agricultural credit 
conditions in the district. Most district lenders expect strong farm 
incomes and little change in loan repayment rates. Solid farm 
incomes are already being reflected in an active market for new and 
used farm machinery and in strong farmland prices. On balance, the 
1985 drought appears to have had little adverse impact on district 
farmers or their lenders. And drought diminished crop inventories 
could brighten the farm outlook for the year ahead.
