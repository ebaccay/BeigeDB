      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Ninth Federal Reserve District shows strong 
growth in early spring. Automobile sales are booming and general 
merchandise sales have reportedly increased. Construction remains 
strong in comparison to past years and markets for existing 
residences are tight. Manufacturing sales reportedly continue to 
strengthen. Mining output shows little change, but petroleum 
production in the district continues to erode slightly. With 
favorable weather, the crop season is off to a strong start. 
Livestock numbers remain high and continue to trend slightly upward. 
Employment levels are generally 3 percent above year-earlier levels, 
and unemployment rates remain below the national average and year-
earlier levels. There is little evidence of significant upward 
movement in wages, but employers in sonic regions report difficulty 
in finding qualified new hires. A few manufacturers report 
difficulty in securing some inputs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "One of the best first quarters ever,' said a state auto dealers 
association spokesperson in describing vehicle sales. His assessment 
was echoed by counterparts in other states and verified by Minnesota 
first-quarter new registrations, which were up 6 percent over year-
earlier figures for automobiles and over 50 percent for pickups. In 
South Dakota car and pickup sales were up nearly 19 percent. General 
merchandise sales also appear stronger. "First-quarter sales were 
well above last year's," reported a marketing manager for one South 
Dakota mall. Regional department store chains also reported improved 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism is stable. Winter business in Wisconsin, Minnesota and 
Michigan's Upper Peninsula was slower than normal due to cold 
weather, according to industry officials and a director. But South 
Dakota enjoyed a strong ski and snowmobile season. Industry 
officials are generally optimistic about the summer season; Montana, 
in particular, is gearing up for a very strong season after a recent 
spate of laudatory news articles about that state's tourism 
opportunities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction of all types is very strong across the Ninth District, 
and markets for existing housing are tight in many metropolitan 
areas. March new housing permits in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area 
were 10 percent above 1993 levels. Commenting on the effects of 
recent mortgage rate increases, one building association 
spokesperson states, "We're concerned, but so far all is done is get 
the fence sitters off the fence." Industry sources note very active 
home building in Sioux Falls, S.D., and described the market for 
existing housing as the tightest in years. Residential construction 
is reportedly also robust in Billings, Mont. and Eau Claire, Wis. 
Directors from North Dakota and Wisconsin describe very strong 
commercial building in their areas in addition to active home 
building. Newspapers from Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota 
echo these reports. In Minnesota and the Dakotas, commercial and 
heavy construction contracts through the first quarter were down 
slightly from 1993 levels but still 24 percent above 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District directors note growing sales by small and medium-size 
manufacturing firms. Institutional furniture, farm machinery and 
building components face particularly good sales environments. A 
metal components firm describes good sales growth for automotive, 
appliance and housing-related items but little growth in other 
areas. First-quarter reports for publicly traded manufacturing firms 
show strong growth in revenues and earnings. Industrial use of 
electricity continues to grow above trend in Minnesota and South 
Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District petroleum sector is reportedly suffering the 
effects of low crude prices. A director reports that some existing 
wells are being shut in, and published rig counts are the lowest in 
10 years. Crude production is down about 5 percent from a year ago, 
although refinery throughput is up 12 percent as upgrades at three 
major refineries have come on stream. Non-ferrous metal mining 
output shows little change. Ice packed in Lake Superior near the Soo 
locks continued to impede ore shipping in mid-April but was expected 
to clear rapidly with warmer weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After 1993's difficulties, the 1994 crop season is opening with near 
ideal conditions. Moisture levels are adequate in virtually all 
areas, relatively few areas complain of surplus moisture, and little 
of the flooding that was anticipated earlier actually materialized. 
Crop planting on April 15 slightly lagged long-term averages but was 
generally ahead of year-earlier levels. State agricultural 
statisticians also noted that weather was ideal in the week of April 
18-23 and anticipated that planting of most crops would be well 
ahead of historical levels by the end of the month. Planted acreages 
of most major crops are expected to be steady or up from 1993 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output of slaughter livestock is strong; numbers of livestock on 
farms and slaughter levels show moderate growth from year-earlier 
levels. With higher grain prices, feeding livestock is less 
profitable than a year ago, but industry observers expect numbers to 
continue to grow modestly throughout 1994. However, dairy production 
is down somewhat from comparable periods in 1993 in spite of 
generally higher milk prices. The decline is most pronounced in 
Wisconsin, but Minnesota and South Dakota also show some slippage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, prices and wares
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment shows increasing growth. March non-farm employment 
numbers across the district are about 3 percent above year-earlier 
levels. A director noted that some firms in North Dakota experience 
increasing difficulty in attracting qualified workers. Similar 
problems are reported in areas of South Dakota, Minnesota and 
Wisconsin. Unemployment rates are down from March 1993 levels in all 
states but North Dakota. Excepting Michigan's Upper Peninsula, 
unemployment levels throughout the Ninth District remain well below 
the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors and industry sources report wage increases in the 1 
percent to 3 percent range for both private and public sector 
workers. Price increases have been reported for some industrial 
inputs, including wood particle board and metal finishing chemicals. 
Several firms reportedly have difficulty in securing desired 
quantities of particle board, and there is one report of shortages 
in certain types of steel. Lumber prices remain higher than a year 
ago, while petroleum fuels continue 3 to 10 cents per gallon below 
early 1993 levels.
