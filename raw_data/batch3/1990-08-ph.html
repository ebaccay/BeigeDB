      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity in the Third District appeared to be 
easing somewhat in July, according to reports from business 
contacts. Manufacturers reported a slowdown for the month. Retailers 
generally indicated that sales in July were running below the rate 
that had prevailed in the first half of the year, although they 
thought the decline was largely seasonal, and auto sales were off 
from last year's pace. Bankers reported slowing overall loan growth 
for the month, with some gains in consumer lending while other 
credit categories were nearly flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, the consensus of expectations is that economic 
conditions will remain level. Overall, manufacturers anticipate just 
steady activity over the next six months. Retailers expect slow 
sales during the rest of the summer but they look for a slight 
pickup in the fall. Bankers expect consumer lending to continue 
growing modestly, but they anticipate no significant expansion of 
business lending unless overall economic activity accelerates, and 
they plan continued restraint in real estate lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturing activity slipped overall in July, 
according to firms contacted for this report. While just over half 
reported steady business, companies reporting declining activity 
outnumbered those posting gains by nearly two-to-one. Slower 
business characterized nearly all the manufacturing industries in 
the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, although area firms were stepping up shipments in July, 
other measures of activity indicated that they were operating at 
less than full capacity. Local companies were working down order 
backlogs even though they were receiving new orders at a virtually 
steady pace; and, although most of the firms contacted were 
maintaining employment levels, one-quarter were reducing payrolls 
and nearly one-third were cutting working hours. Decreases in 
delivery times were generally reported, another sign of slackness in 
the manufacturing sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking to the future, forecasts are varied but the balance of 
opinion among Third District manufacturers is that business will 
stabilize at the current level over the next six months. Managers at 
area plants are nearly equally divided among those predicting 
improvement, those anticipating continued decline, and those who 
expect steady activity between now and January of next year. On 
balance, area manufacturers forecast a constant rate of orders and 
shipments through the beginning of next year, and they expect a 
further decline in backlogs and shorter delivery times. Consistent 
with this scenario of slack demand, area firms plan further 
reductions in payrolls and working hours this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally indicated that sales for the year 
through June ran around even with the year-ago period in real terms, 
which was in line with their expectations. Most of the merchants 
contacted in late July said sales for the month had softened 
somewhat, but they considered the falloff to be largely seasonal. 
Store executives generally indicated that inventories were 
appropriate for the current sales pace. In discussing the overall 
inventory situation, some store executives noted that factors were 
continuing to exercise caution in extending credit to suppliers of 
stores that were not shoving clearly healthy sales and profit 
trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      In their outlook for the rest of the year, Third District retailers 
see slow sales through the rest of the summer and a pickup in the 
fall. Some mentioned that they are formulating fairly aggressive 
advertising and promotion campaigns for the second half. While most 
of the merchants contacted for this report expressed guarded 
optimism for their own stores, several said they did not expect 
overall retail performance to improve much for the balance of 1990 
or 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers indicate that their results recently 
have been running in line with the sales rate nationwide, but with a 
good deal of variation week-to-week. Unit sales are off from last 
year's pace so far, and dealers say unit sales for the entire year 
could be as much as 10 percent below 1989's but they expect an 
improvement in dollar sales and profits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers described total lending as growing very 
slowly in recent weeks. Most Third District banks are refraining 
from new commitments for commercial real estate lending while 
permitting drawdowns for borrowers who had made credit arrangements 
earlier. Rank lending officers report little or no growth in other 
business loans outstanding, and they attribute the weakness in this 
category of lending about equally to declining loan demand and 
tightened credit standards. Consumer lending is growing modestly at 
area banks, with increases in credit card balances and home equity 
credit outstanding. Auto loans, however, are described as flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the Third District generally expect loan growth to remain 
weak in the months ahead. Several noted that commercial real estate 
credit outstanding will probably flatten out or decline because 
virtually no new commitments are being made and existing credit 
lines are close to being fully utilized. Bankers do not expect more 
than minor gains in other business lending, despite the recent 
easing in short-term interest rates, unless overall economic growth 
accelerates. Consumer lending is expected to continue growing 
slowly.
