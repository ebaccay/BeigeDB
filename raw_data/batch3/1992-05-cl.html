      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail, manufacturing, and housing respondents in the Fourth 
District are more optimistic than in previous months that the 
renewed recovery will be sustained. Retailers are still cautious, 
however, and do not plan to build inventories. Auto output is 
expected to be a small contributor to overall output growth this 
quarter. Capital goods producers are uniformly encouraged by the 
recent strengthening in orders and profits. Housing appears to be 
increasing more than seasonally so far this spring and, 
consequently, lenders report a rising demand for new mortgage loans, 
but only a scattered pickup in business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       National and Regional Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recent stepped-up pace in the economy leads Fourth District 
respondents to believe that renewed recovery is now on a more 
sustainable growth path than was evident last spring. A few 
forecasters have raised their estimates of total output growth to a 
3.5% to 4% range late this year, but most still expect about a 3% 
growth rate in the fourth quarter of 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Fourth District, a more positive outlook is also apparent in 
view of better-than-expected profits last quarter and the renewed 
strength in orders, housing, and retail sales. Purchasing agents in 
Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati report that gains in 
manufacturing activity during February and March were as strong as 
or stronger than in the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers are now a little more optimistic about near-term sales 
prospects in view of the unexpected spurt in sales earlier this 
year. They are still cautious, however, and are not planning to 
build inventories. Some attribute the January and February surge in 
sales to temporary factors, such as aggressive clearance of winter 
merchandise and income-tax refunds. Sales in April were reported to 
be a little stronger than in March, and have recently been fairly 
good across all lines of merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists associated with consumer goods expect that real consumer 
spending in the second quarter will increase at about a 2% annual 
rate. Most believe that the recovery in consumer spending will be 
more lasting than the revival last spring because of pent-up demand 
and improving household balance sheets, but still do not see much 
sign of a pickup in auto demand this season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the Big Three auto dealers contacted were more positive 
about the spring selling season, while dealers of Japanese nameplate 
vehicles were less upbeat than in our previous survey. Sales of most 
of the Big Three dealers have been relatively stronger in recent 
weeks, partly reflecting another round of price increases for 
Japanese cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents across several manufacturing industries appear more 
confident than in recent months that recovery is again under way. 
The improving attitudes of management reflect a strengthening in 
orders and profits last quarter. Most manufacturers report that they 
are no longer cutting inventories, but neither are they building 
their stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists associated with the automotive industry estimate that new 
car sales and production will improve this quarter from last, and 
that the industry will be a small contributor to overall output. 
Nevertheless, temporary layoffs may continue this quarter because of 
excess stocks of specific models or because of model changeovers, 
according to auto sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers are more optimistic about recovery because 
of' the quickened pace of new orders last quarter. A producer of 
small motors and electrical equipment notes a long-awaited pickup in 
new orders last quarter. A machine tool builder reports total orders 
last quarter were well above those a year earlier, despite a slide 
in export business, and order backlogs have been rising for the last 
several months. A midsize producer of plastic products machinery 
states that sales rose at a double-digit rate last quarter from 
depressed conditions during most of 199l, and profits of an 
industrial equipment producer soared on the strength of a rising 
trend in domestic orders. Heavy-duty truck orders rose sharply in 
February and March, and inquiries since then suggest another good
month in April. Consequently, truck production is expected to rise 
steadily each quarter this year, according to a major supplier. 
Recovery for specialized industrial controls apparently began last 
December, according to a producer who believes that customers are 
gradually adding to capacity rather than simply ordering for 
maintenance. A small producer of metal castings is considering 
hiring more employees in response to a recent strengthening in 
business, and a small producer of electrical motors and parts for 
the mass transit industry reports a surge in both orders and profits 
last quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists associated with capital goods industries expect that real 
investment in producers' goods will increase at annual rates at 
least 5% to 7% quarterly from this quarter through the balance of 
the year because of revival in traditional capital goods industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production and operating rates in the steel industry were somewhat 
better than expected last quarter, but that performance was masked 
by continued weakness in steel prices and a cutback in steel 
capacity by a major steel producer. Industry sources expect steel 
orders and production in the second quarter to be marginally higher 
than in the first quarter, although recovery is still characterized 
as anemic because of weak prices and revenues.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity in the District shows signs of a better-than-
seasonal increase, according to several mortgage lenders and 
builders. Housing starts in the Greater Cincinnati area in March 
were about double the level of a year earlier, and both starts end 
sales in the Cleveland area so far this spring are running well 
ahead of totals a year ago. A large mortgage lender described the 
market for houses below $175,000 as strong. Land acquisition loans 
and loans for speculative building are said to be still difficult to 
obtain, but lenders apparently have ample funds available for 
builders of single-family homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks and thrifts report a step-up in new mortgage loans and 
tapering demand for refinancing from earlier this year. A few large 
banks also report a pickup in commercial and industrial loans, 
especially for auto dealers, but consumer paybacks on installment 
loans still exceed new loans. One lender notes that commercial real 
estate activity began picking up in April after a slower-than-
seasonal period from last December through March. Several small 
banks blame a tepid economy for the weak consumer and business loan 
activity.
