      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continued to expand through the summer, according 
to reports from businesses in most Federal Reserve Districts. 
Regions that have been lagging are generally said to be doing better 
while most of the stronger areas saw growth plateau. The expansion 
in consumer spending is seen as healthy, albeit decelerating, and 
retailers' expectations for holiday sales are generally favorable. 
Summer tourism activity has generally been strong, outpacing last 
year's levels. Most manufacturers around the country continued to 
report at least moderate strength. Single-family home sales were 
seen as slowing modestly in most Districts, with home construction 
easing in some areas. At the same time, commercial real estate 
conditions were generally described as improved. Overall bank loan 
demand appears to be modestly increasing, but higher interest rates 
are reported to be slowing real estate lending in most areas. There 
are more reports of tightening labor markets than before, though 
wage pressures are still described as modest. Industrial materials 
prices edged up further, but businesses say that competitive 
pressures continue to restrain price increases on finished goods. 
Farm contacts report that crop conditions in most agricultural areas 
are favorable and point toward an excellent fall harvest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales reports are mixed but generally positive. The majority 
of retailers report that sales continue to grow, while some 
characterize conditions as slow. St. Louis retailers saw year-over-
year sales growth of 4 to 5 percent, but these figures fell short of 
their expectations. Stores in both the Atlanta and Philadelphia 
Districts reported that back-to-school sales were mixed. Contacts in 
the majority of Districts suggested that retail prices were 
remaining stable because of intense competition. Expectations for 
the holiday season are generally good. Retailers in the Atlanta, 
Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts expect modest 
increases over last year's sales figures, while both Boston and 
Philadelphia contacts were hesitant to predict results for the 
remainder of the year. Retailers in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas 
City Districts say that they are expanding inventories for the 
upcoming holiday season, while those in New York believe that 
inventories are about right.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers in most Districts report that demand is strong, 
but those in Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis say 
that a limited supply of autos on the lot is restricting sales. 
Dallas dealers report that although sales have slowed they are still 
above year-ago levels. The Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis 
Districts expect sales to remain healthy as long as inventories hold 
out.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity over the summer has been generally good. In the 
Minneapolis District, hotel/motel occupancies, campground, and 
attraction traffic were above last year's levels. Tourism was 
especially strong in Boston, boosted by large conventions and 
international visitors. Traffic on Mississippi's Gulf Coast was 
reportedly heavy because of casino gambling attractions, but Florida 
tourism officials remain concerned about a sustained slowdown in 
visitor arrivals. Most of the San Francisco District saw an influx 
of foreign tourists taking advantage of the level of the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steady to improving factory activity characterized most Districts' 
reports and comments on the near-term industrial outlook remained 
upbeat. Most firms are operating at high levels of capacity in the 
Kansas City District, and manufacturing activity remains vigorous in 
Chicago amid reports that capacity restraints are limiting 
production in some cases. Auto-related activity has rebounded from 
the summer slowdown in the Cleveland District, and suppliers to that 
industry note solid production gains in August. Forecasts by plant 
managers are generally positive in Philadelphia, where producers of 
durable goods report improving conditions. Firms in the St. Louis 
District note moderate growth, and those in Minneapolis say that 
producers of industrial machinery, farm implements, and 
construction-related products are posting strong sales. The San 
Francisco and Boston Districts commented on strong orders for 
computers, while electronic and telecommunications equipment demand 
is growing in Dallas. Although factory activity is mixed in Atlanta, 
most industrial contacts there expect to see increasing orders over 
the next few months; activity is currently rising at paper and some 
textile mills. Boston, Dallas, and Atlanta report that suppliers to 
the auto and light truck industry increased production in August, 
and in some cases expanded operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of manufacturers of heavy equipment and building materials 
have announced capacity expansion projects in the Chicago District. 
In the Kansas City region, manufacturers purchasing construction 
materials, such as cement and lumber, are facing longer delivery 
times. Dallas reports that the demand for chemicals is outstripping 
available capacity. Although overall manufacturers' shipments and 
new orders have evidently slowed in the Richmond District, exports 
have increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Less positively, some industrial sectors have shown little 
improvement. One aerospace supplier in the San Francisco District 
reports that its backlogs have increased in the past year, but they 
remain well below levels seen two years ago. Atlanta says that 
regional military contractors see orders declining and are concerned 
about future prospects. Manufacturing increased at a sluggish pace 
in Richmond and factory orders decelerated slightly in the Dallas 
region. Boston and Atlanta manufacturers indicate that orders for 
some types of apparel and textiles remain weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the whole, service firms saw increased demand in most Districts. 
Dallas reports that demand for business services accelerated there, 
with temporary staffing and trucking firms noting the strongest 
gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in most Districts note a slowdown in single-family home 
sales. At the same time, the New York and Richmond Districts 
continue to report little change. Home prices are reported to be on 
the rise in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, 
while contacts in the Dallas and Richmond Districts report prices 
remain unchanged. However, in Dallas, although home prices are 
steady, builders were said to be offering more discounts and 
incentives, such as free pools. Home builders in the Chicago, Kansas 
City, and San Francisco regions said that residential construction 
slowed, while those in the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, 
and St. Louis Districts said the pace of such construction had 
increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nationally, commercial real estate agents report improving 
conditions. However, realtors in the downtown areas of Dallas and 
Boston note that markets in those cities remain particularly weak 
while the surrounding suburbs are improving. Construction of retail 
stores is dominating the markets in the Atlanta, Dallas, and 
Richmond Districts. Multifamily occupancy rates and rental rates 
have been on the rise throughout the Atlanta and Dallas Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks around the country reported that overall loan demand was 
steady or up modestly. Business lending was the strongest, with only 
banks in the St. Louis District reporting softer loan demand. 
Several contacts noted, however, that competition for commercial 
loan customers was intense. Consumer lending was said to be stronger 
in the Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and St. 
Louis Districts, while bankers noted decreases in the Atlanta, New 
York, and Richmond Districts. Real estate and mortgage lending 
activity is down in most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets seem to be steady or tightening in all areas. San 
Francisco reports that, outside of California, labor demand appears 
to be accelerating a bit in the District. Worker shortages are said 
to be growing increasingly frequent in the Chicago District and some 
contacts in the St. Louis and Atlanta Districts were also having 
trouble finding qualified workers. Temporary placement firms 
reported rising wages in the Chicago District and shortages of 
skilled construction and clerical workers in several Districts are 
putting upward pressure on area wages. Price increases have been 
reported for inputs of raw and intermediate materials. Prices of 
industrial commodities and building materials continue to trend 
upward in the Chicago and New York Districts. Atlanta contacts note 
that price increases for raw materials are becoming more wide 
spread, especially for paper, metals, and building products. 
Respondents in Philadelphia and San Francisco also report an upward 
movement in industrial prices. Boston and Dallas firms say that 
prices are increasing for fiber and paper, respectively. Minneapolis 
respondents see little pressure on prices except for petroleum 
products and newsprint. The competitive environment is holding 
finished goods prices down, according to contacts in Atlanta and 
Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farm sources say crops for the upcoming fall harvest are generally 
in good-to-excellent condition. Yields are expected in the good-to-
record range for most plantings. Reports from Chicago indicate that 
a bumper fall harvest appears to be in store for District farmers. 
In the Kansas City region, corn and soybean yields are expected to 
approach record levels. Farmers in the Dallas District expect 
production of corn, sorghum, rice, peanuts, and soybeans to be 
higher than last year. However, sentiment across the country is that 
farm incomes will not rise with the favorable harvest because of 
lower commodity prices. The forest products industry in the 
Minneapolis District is reportedly being buoyed by continued 
strength in nationwide construction. Dallas reports that the decline 
in oil prices was expected, but contacts were surprised at the fall 
in natural gas prices. Energy-related activity there, as well as the 
Kansas City District, was seasonally slow and below last year's 
levels.
