      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy appears to be generally healthy in April. 
Retail sales, except for automobiles, have been strong, and bankers 
report that overall loan growth in the first quarter was not as 
fast-paced as last year, but still good. Mortgage lending is surging 
due to both refinancings and sales. The manufacturing sector is 
holding steady, although order backlogs have dropped and employment 
has declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is for steady 
or improving conditions in the near term. Manufacturers expect 
business to improve, but they do not foresee gains in employment. 
Retailers expect current strong department store sales to continue 
into the summer. Bankers anticipate steady growth in commercial and 
industrial loan demand, but believe that growth in consumer loans 
will depend on further interest rate reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity in the third District is steady, according to 
the latest Business Outlook Survey. Of the industrial firms surveyed 
in April, 71 percent report no change in the pace of their business 
compared to March, 11 percent say business improved, and 16 percent 
indicate declining activity. Nondurable goods producers appear to be 
doing slightly better than producers of durable goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most measures of industrial activity eased in April. Shipments 
increased, but new orders leveled off, pulling down backlogs of 
unfilled orders. Factory employment fell as well; one-third of the 
companies contacted for the April survey reported payroll cuts, 
while just 12 percent added to workforces. Prices of industrial 
goods in the region are stable. Mare than three-fourths of the 
survey respondents reported no change in the prices of either the 
goods they purchase or the products they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite this month's pause in growth, Third District manufacturers 
are optimistic about the future. In their outlook for the next six 
months, over 40 percent of the firms participating in the April 
survey expect a pickup in new orders and a matching increase in 
shipments. Employment, however, may decline; although half of the 
firms polled intend to maintain current payrolls, 30 percent expect 
to reduce workforces. The rate of capital spending by manufacturers 
in the region is expected to show little change over the next six 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers say recent sales trends have been good. 
Department store officials report that February and March sales were 
above year-ago levels by healthy amounts--more than 10 percent for 
some stores. Discount store sales have been better than expected. 
Some of this improvement is attributed to growing sales of 
appliances and home furnishings coincident with more house sales in 
recent months. Clothing and children's items are also mentioned as 
particularly strong areas. Automobile sales have fallen, and dealers 
say a rebound is unlikely in the absence of even greater 
manufacturers' incentives.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although household debt is high by historical standards, Third 
District merchants believe that consumers are in sufficiently good 
financial condition to continue the current rate of spending into 
the summer. They expect sales to be buoyed by rising real income, 
lower finance charges, and improved cash flow as mortgages are 
refinanced at lower interest rates. Further gains in sales of 
appliances, furniture, and home furnishings are expected in the wake 
of continued strength in the honing market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in early 
April was approximately 13 percent higher than a year earlier. In 
commercial lending, the retail and services sectors account for a 
major share of new loans at this time because financing needs are 
growing as business expands. Loan demand in the manufacturing sector 
is not as strong, and bankers note a fall-off in equipment financing 
as manufacturers postpone capital spending commitments while changes 
in rules on depreciation and investment tax credits are being 
considered by Congress. Lending officers expect overall C&amp;I; loan 
demand to remain strong and say that the current 10-14 percent 
annual growth rate is sustainable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate and construction loan volume is above year-ago levels at 
Third District financial institutions. Residential mortgage 
refinancing activity is brisk, as is mortgage lending for house 
sales. Bankers say they are continuing to lend for commercial and 
residential construction to developers with successful records and 
substantial financial resources, although concern is growing about 
possible increases in office vacancy rates later in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers report that consumer lending is growing, but 
at only about half the rate at which it started the year. The large 
amount of financing supplied by automobile manufacturers in recent 
months is cited as one factor in this slowdown, but area bankers 
generally report a substantial drop in the growth of credit card 
balances as well. Some banks have had no increase in credit card 
outstandings since March. Lending officers and bank economists do 
not think that consumers have reached their debt limits; they 
believe that consumers may be delaying credit purchases in 
anticipation of interest rate reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Third District banks cut their prime rate to 8.5 percent in 
late April. Commercial bank economists think that the prime rate 
will stay at this level for the rest of the year. As for other 
interest rates, most bank forecasts call for a drop of 25-50 basis 
points along the yield curve during the second quarter, followed by 
rising rates as the economy and inflation accelerate in the second 
half of the year.
