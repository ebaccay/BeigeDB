      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In spite of unseasonably cold and snowy weather, the economy of the 
Ninth Federal Reserve District continued to grow in January and 
February 1994. Construction remains strong in comparison to past 
years, and commitments to new projects indicate that the spring and 
summer construction season is likely to be active. Markets for 
existing housing are tight. Manufacturing sales apparently are 
strong and output of building materials has increased. Mining and 
energy output is stable. In agriculture, anticipated plantings are 
up from 1993, and livestock numbers remain high. Consumer confidence 
in Minnesota is at a five-year high, and retail spending throughout 
the district is reportedly vigorous, especially for cars and light
trucks. Winter recreation businesses are generally having a good 
season. Employment levels are 2 percent to 3 percent above year-
earlier levels in most Ninth District states, and unemployment rates 
generally remain below the national average. Overall there is little 
evidence of upward pressure on wages or prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtually all areas of the Ninth District experienced extended 
periods of extremely cold weather and high snowfalls in January and 
February, but the overall economic effects apparently were not 
large. Construction is normally slow in winter, and recent cold 
spells did not abnormally reduce activity. Retail sales were 
reportedly depressed on very cold days, but rebounded when the 
weather moderated. Cold weather made some livestock care more 
difficult, but has not noticeably affected output. A few ski areas 
reported slack business during cold periods, but snowmobiling was 
not reduced, and overall winter recreation activity is good. There 
are concerns about spring flooding along some rivers and that ice 
could delay the 1994 Great Lakes shipping season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sources from all areas of the district continue to report that 
construction is very strong. "Construction for housing and retail is 
already backed up," reported a community leader from Grand Forks. N. 
D. "There are many new home starts and there is a renewed interest 
in multifamily housing,' said an advisory council member from 
northwest Montana. Building industry spokespersons in Minnesota and 
South Dakota indicated that the pace did not slacken appreciably in 
January in spite of cold weather. Markets for existing residences 
were strong in virtually all metropolitan areas of the district. In 
Minnesota and the Dakotas, publicly let contracts in January for 
large buildings and heavy construction were nearly double year-
earlier levels and industry spokespersons expect a busy season for 
medium and large projects. Construction on two $l00 million plus 
buildings in downtown Minneapolis will begin in 1994. And a major 
real estate company noted that office vacancy rates in Minneapolis-
St. Paul stood at 16.3 percent at the end of 1993, down from 20.4 
percent a year earlier, signaling some easing of a prolonged glut.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent newspaper report described sales and earnings growth for 11 
Minneapolis-St. Paul manufacturers as "torrid" and cited a regional 
fund manager who argued that these firms were "beneficiaries of an 
improving economy." Industrial use of electricity continues to grow 
at about twice its five-year trend in Minnesota and South Dakota. 
Two Minnesota-based snowmobile manufacturers reported record sales 
and earnings. Also, Wisconsin chicken processing and brewing firms 
announced that they would double output. New small factories for 
automotive equipment and environmental controls were announced for 
South and North Dakota, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Building-related manufacturing is particularly active; one advisory 
council member from west-central Wisconsin noted that two window 
manufacturers in his town were enlarging their factories. Production 
of oriented-strand board and other wood-based plywood and lumber 
substitutes continues strong in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. 
Demand for sawn lumber from Montana and South Dakota is reportedly 
high, but output remains below historic levels due to limitations on 
timber sales from federal land. Paper output from virgin pulp is 
unchanged from a year ago, but production of paper from recycled 
inputs has raised total production slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crude petroleum production and drilling activity were essentially 
unchanged while refinery output in January and early Feburary was  
about 9 percent above year-earlier levels. Mining shows little 
change from recent reports. Copper and gold output apparently 
remains steady from late 1993. New gold mines continue in the 
planning or permitting process in South Dakota and Montana, but are 
not expected to be in production this year. Iron ore officials 
continue to anticipate that production in the 1994 season will be 
the highest thus far in the 1990s, though there are concerns that 
unusually heavy ice coverage on the Great Lakes will delay opening 
of the shipping season by two weeks or more.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As farmers approach the spring tillage season they are described by 
one extension economist as "guardedly optimistic" about the 1994 
crop season, despite concerns about potential flooding in some 
areas. Favorable prices combined with zero set-aside requirements in 
price support programs point to slightly higher planted acreages 
this year. A major sugar beet cooperative announced that it will 
expand its planted acreage by 5 percent. The National Weather 
Service announced that there was a high probability of spring 
flooding in some Minnesota and Dakota river basins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cattle numbers are higher than a year ago for the district as a 
whole. Hog numbers are largely unchanged. Newspapers reported that 
cold weather caused cattle raisers some difficulties with early 
calving, and there was some speculation that the weather might 
reduce survival of newborn pigs, but there is little evidence that 
production was reduced to any significant degree.
     </p>
     <p>
      In an indication that flood-related financial stress may be easing, 
banker expectations of farm income and spending for the next three 
months rose somewhat from earlier in the year, according to a Ninth 
District survey of agricultural credit conditions at the end of 
fourth quarter 1993. Agricultural interest rates were unchanged to 
slightly down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Retail trade is strong." reported an advisory council member from 
eastern North Dakota whose views are echoed by his colleagues, 
directors and other sources across the Ninth District. He noted that 
retail sales were slow on extremely cold days but rebounded when 
weather moderated. The owner of a Wisconsin chain of auto repair and 
accessory shops reported record sales in January. A consumer 
confidence poll conducted in Minnesota in early February showed the 
highest level since December 1989. The increase was largely 
attributed to statements of increased willingness to spend on 
appliances and other major items. Vehicle sales continue above year-
earlier levels in all states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Winter tourism was strengthening in late February after somewhat 
slower business in late January and early February. Skiing in the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan was down slightly for January and 
February due to cold weather, but out-of-state snowmobilers kept 
their vacation plans in northern Wisconsin. Numbers of both skiers 
and snowmobilers are steady on South Dakota trails compared to year-
earlier levels. Canadian traffic continues to lag in border states: 
one Montana ski resort near the border reported a 7 percent drop 
from last year, though ski business for the whole state was about 
even with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, prices and wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment is generally 2 percent to 3 percent above year-earlier 
levels across the district. A few large layoffs were reported, 
including 600 packing plant workers and 450 medical employees in 
southern Minnesota, but these cuts were partially offset by new 
warehouse, poultry processing, food manufacturing and machine tool 
jobs. With the exception of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, 
unemployment rates in Ninth District states remain well below the 
national average. An advisory council member and a director both 
noted that firms in their areas were experiencing some difficulty in 
attracting good workers, given low unemployment rates. Other 
directors and advisors reported limited wage increases for both 
private and public sector workers. They noted little upward price 
movement, with the exception of lumber, which remains substantially 
above pre-1992 levels. Retail gasoline prices remain 3 to 6 cents 
below year-earlier levels.
