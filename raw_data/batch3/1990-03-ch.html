      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District is slow but improving, 
according to District respondents, with much of the softness coming 
from the auto industry. Retailers report that sales volume is 
strong, enough to suggest that the economy is not currently in a 
recessionary environment. However, production in the auto industry 
continues to be weak, with auto dealers reluctant to increase 
orders. Steel orders have risen, however, as the auto industry gears 
up to reopen plants that were temporarily closed to reduce auto 
stocks. Capital-goods producers report that orders are beginning to 
improve. District construction and real estate activity continues to 
outpace the nation. Movements in agricultural prices are mixed, but 
improvements in farm land values have slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have continued to improve since the beginning of the 
year, although District sales were lagging the nation in early 
February. A major mass merchandiser in the District reports that 
January sales of durable goods, in current dollars, were 3 percent 
above a year ago. Traffic counts in stores were above year-ago 
counts for the first time in eight months. Total company sales in 
the District were up substantially in the first week of February, 
but lagged sales nationwide. An economist in the retail industry 
expects that the dip in housing starts is now over and improvements 
over the next few months will begin to strengthen sales of housing-
related goods. Several retailers report that inventories are high, 
in part because imported goods were ordered early in 1989 in order 
to be available for the Christmas season. As a result, buying from 
manufacturers is constrained and price discounting continues to be 
widespread. However, one retailer stated that the resolution of the 
Campeau Corporations financial situation eased some of the price 
competitiveness among retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the production side, shipments of appliances have been below 
year-ago levels, but producers' inventories are in good shape. A 
producer of a wide range of household appliances reports that 
shipments were down 3 percent in the first six weeks of 1990, 
compared to a year ago. An industry analyst expects shipments to 
rise in the second quarter of 1990 and to continue rising gradually 
throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto production continues to be the major drag on the District 
economy. Car sales dropped in February from the brisk pace in 
January, according to an industry analyst, but stocks (measured in 
days supply) were at near normal levels for February. Some producers 
are reluctant to reopen plants until dealer orders improve. One 
industry economist reported that dealers are overly cautions in 
ordering, fearing a repeat of the overstocking that occurred in the 
fourth quarters of 1989. Sales during the second quarter of 1990 may 
be constrained because dealers will not be adequately stocked for 
the spring season. A shortage of minivans next quarter is also a 
possibility, but production can be expanded quickly if necessary, 
according to one producer. Plant closings were extended in February 
on some mid-sized cars, but most plants in the District are expected 
to be running in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel production was weak in December, but demand since January has 
been improving across a broad base. Inventories were being pulled 
down at the end of last year, because steel prices were falling and 
producers holding steel inventories wanted to avoid paper losses. 
However, shipments to durable-goods manufacturers have begun to edge 
up in recent months after reaching a bottom in November, according 
to a steel analyst. Coated sheet steel is reportedly in short 
supply. Orders are "flooding in" from auto producers and orders from 
appliance producers are also rising. Also, orders for steel used for 
oil and gas drilling and for pipelines were reported to be 
improving. Service centers report that business is good, with order 
volume up so far this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital-goods producers in the District generally report some 
improvement in orders through February. Orders for heavy trucks have 
troughed and are now moving up, according to a supplier of 
components to the industry. Orders of metal-cutting tools, however, 
are down 10-15 percent from a year ago. Also, light industrial 
equipment sales for homebuilding and construction, which declined 5 
percent in 1989, were still on a downward trend in January, 
according to an industry analyst. Farm machinery sales are doing 
exceptionally well, with tractor sales up 15 percent last year and 
still improving. A producer of a wide range of industrial products 
reports a good volume of orders for all product lines, with no 
apparent fall in market demand for their industrial products since 
the beginning of the year. Most of their plants are operating at 
new-capacity levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity started the year briskly, according to 
Chicago-area suppliers to the industry. Strength is across-the-
board, with industrial construction doing well and commercial 
construction described as very strong. A large Chicago-area building 
materials supplier reports that shipments are up 7 percent since the 
beginning of the year and backlogs have been rising. A producer of 
gypsum board reports plants are running close to capacity with 
shipments to both residential and nonresidential construction 
contractors outpacing the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity in the Chicago area shows signs of reviving from 
last year's slump. Warm weather has been a contributing factor, but 
favorable mortgage rates are also cited as important. Mortgage 
applications are 10 percent higher than a year ago, according to a 
Chicago bank. Sales of existing homes in the first two months of 
1990 are far ahead of last year's pace, according to a local 
realtor. Moreover, housing permits for new construction surged in 
January, suggesting continued improvement in housing activity over 
the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent strength in cattle and hog prices has buoyed returns to 
District livestock farmers. Milk prices, after surging to record 
highs in late 1989, are now declining seasonally. The decline may 
pull milk prices down to year-ago levels by spring if milk 
production turns up as expected. Corn and soybean prices remain well 
below year-earlier levels despite relatively tight grain supplies 
both domestically and worldwide. Recent precipitation patterns have 
eased, but not overcome, the low soil-moisture conditions and the 
western corn belt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our latest survey of agricultural bankers indicates that the uptrend 
in District farmland values slowed in the final quarter of 1989. On 
average, District farmland values rose less than 1 percent in the 
fourth quarter and about 6 percent during all of last year. Lower 
crop prices and concerns that the 1990 Farm Bill will scale down 
government farm program benefits have contributed apparently to the 
slower rise in land values.
