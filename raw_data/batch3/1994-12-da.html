     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 7, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continued to rise at a solid pace, although 
contacts in several industries expect activity to soften in the new 
year. Manufacturing orders increased, while activity at business 
service firms accelerated slightly. Retail sales were sluggish but 
strengthened over the Thanksgiving weekend. Higher interest rates 
and economic uncertainty tempered growth in the construction 
industry, although activity is said to be strong overall. Loan 
demand was stable. Steady demand kept district energy activity 
unchanged, while excessive moisture and a late frost disrupted 
agricultural production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Scattered price and wage pressure continued to be reported in 
manufacturing and services, but retailers said selling prices were 
lower. Rents were up for some types of property, but home prices 
stopped increasing despite higher costs for several inputs. Energy 
prices were up slightly, and agricultural prices were lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing orders continued to increase at a solid rate. Demand 
was strongest for electronics, paper, food and petrochemicals. 
Declining housing starts slowed orders for construction-related 
products such as brick and lumber, but producers said they were 
still operating at capacity. Inventories were low for many 
electronics products, and manufacturers said that hiring had led to 
slight wage pressure, but selling prices continued to decline. Sales 
of industrial electrical products were extremely strong, partially 
because of rebuilding after floods in the Houston area. Orders for 
paper products were still strong, although a lack of storage space 
had reduced double ordering. Most paper contacts said they were 
still producing at capacity, and higher costs pushed up selling 
prices. Demand for fabricated metals was unchanged, while orders 
were slightly lower for primary metals. Primary and fabricated metal 
producers reported low inventories because delayed rail shipments 
had caused shortages of raw materials. Rising apparel sales resulted 
in some hiring, but garment finishers continued to report declining 
demand. Demand for oil field services and machinery was unchanged, 
but contacts said cost cutting had increased profits. District 
refining was returning to normal following a break in the Colonial 
pipeline. The pipeline break improved profits briefly, but higher 
fuel oil prices and a seasonal decline in gasoline sales kept 
overall refiners margins weak. Demand for petrochemicals was 
extremely strong, and the industry had not completely recovered from 
the fire and flood on the San Jacinto River, which reduced capacity 
and led to a fifth round of price increases in 1994. Inventories 
were very low for most petrochemicals, particularly propylene. 
Capacity is being added as quickly as possible, although shortages 
of capital equipment are reported to be limiting expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity at business services firms increased at a slightly 
faster rate. Accounting, temporary and legal firms reported an 
acceleration in demand, while demand at transportation firms 
continued to grow at a moderate rate. Demand for corporate legal 
services, such as mergers and initial public offerings, continued to 
increase. Labor market tightness in technical and professional 
fields, such as programming, engineering and word processing, 
resulted in wage and price increases in the temporary help industry. 
Trucking, accounting and communications firms also reported higher 
wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales were soft in early November, but gained strength over 
the Thanksgiving weekend. Most contacts said weekend sales were good 
but not great. Retailers expect good sales over the holiday period. 
Contacts report that price competition heated up in the past month, 
and selling prices remain lower than a year ago. Auto sales declined 
seasonally in October, but remained above a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall loan demand at district banks is reported to be unchanged 
although higher interest rates have curbed demand for construction 
loans, particularly for residential mortgages. Consumer and business 
lending continues to expand, and continued competition from 
alternative credit sources is limiting increases in loan rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity remained strong, but higher interest rates and 
economic uncertainty led several contacts to revise their outlook 
downward. Commercial and retail construction was strong, although 
respondents said economic uncertainty caused some projects to be put 
on hold. Demand for office, retail and industrial space was strong, 
and rents moved up slowly. New home sales and starts dropped in 
October and November. Contacts said new single-family home prices 
stopped increasing, and median existing home prices had fallen. 
Labor shortages are still reported for some subcontracting trades.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steady demand kept district energy activity unchanged. The rig count 
increased seasonally, but remained below last year's levels. Most 
drilling continued to be for natural gas, although oil drilling was 
up slightly. Oil prices were between $17 and $19 per barrel, which 
was slightly higher than the last beige book. Spot prices for 
natural gas remained at low levels, between $1.55 and $1.60 per mcf. 
Storage capacity for natural gas is 94 percent full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rainy weather, flooding and a late frost slowed the agricultural 
harvest. Producers said delays had increased costs. Lower crop and 
livestock prices pushed the October Texas All Farm Products Index of 
Prices Received down 8 percent from 1993's level, and 2 percent 
lower than last month.
