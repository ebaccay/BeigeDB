      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy expanded at a moderate pace in July and August. 
Many respondents reported a pickup in sales and employment. Orders 
are strong in several manufacturing industries. Respondents in 
business service industries reported an increase in business 
activity. Retail sales continued to increase slowly. Homebuilding 
remained strong. Banking respondents said that loan demand picked 
up. The energy extraction industry showed continued improvement in 
response to strength in natural gas prices. Overall, crops in the 
District are expected to fare better than last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturers reported a pickup in orders and an improved 
outlook. Several respondents noted an increase in employment. 
Producers of stone, clay, glass, lumber and fabricated metals 
reported strong gains in orders originating from the residential 
construction sector. Employment was reported to have increased in 
many of these construction-related industries. Orders for 
semiconductors and telecommunications devices were reported to be 
strong and employment levels have increased. Producers of food and 
kindred products said that sales and employment had increased. A 
steel industry respondent noted that orders continued to increase 
even though they recently implemented a price increase. Oil field 
equipment producers said that domestic orders have improved but that 
international drilling remains weak. Paper producers noted an 
increase in orders and employment. The petrochemical producers 
continue to report global overcapacity problems and weak exports. 
Refinery respondents reported that their margins improved slightly 
in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most business service firms reported a pickup in activity and a 
positive outlook. Temporary employment agencies report an increase 
in demand, partly because their clients are resisting hiring full-
time workers, but also because business activity is increasing. The 
demand for part-time workers was broad based, although particular 
strength was reported for the professional fields such as accounting 
and engineering. Several law firms reported increases in employment. 
Accounting contacts said that business activity has picked up over 
the past three months. The main source of growth for accounting 
firms was reported as consulting on methods to increase 
productivity. Advertising respondents said that activity has risen 
because of increased demand from the auto, retail and nondurable 
goods industries. Hotels in the Dallas, San Antonio and Austin areas 
reported high occupancy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales continued to grow slowly. Retailers generally were 
optimistic that sales growth will pick up. Respondents report that 
strong competition within the industry has been restraining price 
increases. Inventories are reported to be back at desired levels. 
Some retailers had experienced an unintended buildup during the 
early summer. Sales along the Mexican border are still below last 
year's levels although there are scattered reports of improvement. 
District auto sales slowed in July but year-to-date sales remain 
above last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction remains strong in many areas of the 
District. Respondents report that new home sales slowed somewhat in 
July but picked up again in early August. Construction is 
particularly strong in San Antonio and Austin, and weak in Houston. 
Respondents report that home sales are likely to remain strong as 
long as mortgage rates remain low.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District oil and gas drilling rig count continues to rise. 
Activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains very strong. Oil prices rose 
to about $18 per barrel in August after falling to $17 per barrel in 
July because of speculation that Iraq would reenter world oil 
markets, and discord within OPEC. Hot weather throughout the 
Southern tier of the United States pushed up natural gas prices in 
the last few weeks of August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most banking respondents reported that loan demand has picked up and 
is up over 1992. Mortgage originations and refinancings remain a 
bright spot. Respondents generally were optimistic about future loan 
demand. Respondents said that competition among banks for the best 
borrowers was beginning to intensify because the larger banks were 
becoming more aggressive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Continued dry conditions in the District have had a negative impact 
on agricultural conditions in many areas. Overall crop production, 
however, is expected to fare better than last year. West Texas and 
areas north of Lubbock are expecting good cotton crops. Dry weather 
is having a negative impact on crop production in parts of central 
Texas. Many pastures have dried out forcing producers to move cattle 
to market. In general, however, cattle ranchers report favorable 
conditions. Higher prices for most livestock and livestock products 
pushed the Texas All Farm Products index slightly higher in July. 
Prices for most crops declined and the Texas All Crops Index was 
10.7 percent below a year ago. Producers were receiving higher 
prices for hay, sorghum and soybeans but lower prices for other 
crops.
