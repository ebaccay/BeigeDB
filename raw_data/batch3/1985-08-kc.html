      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent modest economic growth in the Tenth District is expected to 
continue through the rest of the year. Retail sales have improved 
and are expected to continue to outpace last year's sales. Retail 
inventories have been reduced to satisfactory levels, while some 
further trimming of producers' input stocks is expected. Housing 
starts are lower than a year ago, but falling mortgage loan demand 
is expected to stabilize soon. District banks report mixed loan 
conditions and essentially unchanged deposits overall. The winter 
wheat harvest is nearly complete with yields in most district states 
at or below average compared to other years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers report improving current dollar sales after a weak 
showing in May, with sales of apparel and accessories especially 
strong. Overall, sales in the first half of 1985 are slightly above 
the first half of last year. Sales are expected to continue to run 
slightly ahead of last year. Retail prices have been stable during 
the past three mouths and are expected to remain stable throughout 
the rest of the year. Most retailers have been trimming inventories, 
but are now satisfied with their levels and no significant further 
change is anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Dealers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers report sales very close to year ago levels. 
Financing is readily available for both dealer floorplanning and 
customer purchases. Dealers are trimming inventories to make room 
for the 1986 models. Most dealers expect that total 1985 sales will 
be about as strong as 1984 sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report input prices not much different from a year 
ago. Falling semiconductor prices have benefited some firms and 
falling crude oil prices have helped others. Little further change 
is expected for the remainder of the year. Input availability is 
excellent and is expected to remain so. Materials inventory levels 
range from satisfactory to somewhat high. Inventories are expected 
to be trimmed in coming months or reasons ranging from normal 
seasonal behavior to decreased sales projections.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most homebuilders report sharply lower starts, both single-family 
and multi-family, relative to a year ago. Expectations about starts 
for the remainder of the current year vary widely. Sales of new 
homes also vary considerably as a number of builders report sharply 
lower sales. New home prices have remained stable; inventories are 
described as good to slightly high. Prices of materials are 
generally reported as steady and material availability is described 
as good. Savings and loans institutions report savings inflows 
slightly higher than a year ago. No dramatic change is expected in 
the near future. Most respondents report lower mortgage demand and 
commitments but expect both to stabilize shortly. Mortgage rates 
have remained constant to slightly lower, with a slight decline or 
no change expected in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District banks report mixed loan behavior and largely 
unchanged deposit behavior. Half of the banks surveyed had increased 
consumer loan demand, with the other half reporting unchanged or 
decreased consumer demand. Real estate loan demand was fairly evenly 
divided among increases, decreases, and no changes last month. 
Commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans were either unchanged 
or down. The prime rate has fallen 0.5 percentage point at most 
banks surveyed, with many banks expecting further declines in the 
near term. Consumer lending rates, however, are largely unchanged. 
Deposit behavior last month was, on average, unchanged. Deposits in 
NOW accounts, Super-NOW accounts, money market deposit accounts, and 
small time deposits tended to either increase or remain constant, 
while large CD's and passbook savings tended either to decline or 
remain constant. Demand deposit behavior was more mixed, with about 
equal numbers of respondents reporting increases, decreases, and no 
change.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The winter wheat harvest is nearly complete, with yields in 
Missouri, Kansas, and eastern Nebraska about average. Bad weather 
led to disappointingly low yields in Oklahoma, and low yields are 
also expected in Wyoming and western Nebraska due to dry conditions 
and grasshopper damage. Colorado's wheat harvest produced almost 
twice the normal yield.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions of spring crops and ranges generally are good across the 
district. Corn and soybean conditions are reported good to excellent 
in Missouri, Kansas, and eastern Nebraska. However, corn and 
soybeans in western Nebraska are suffering from extreme dryness and 
grasshopper infestations, while the condition of the Colorado corn 
crop is reported to be spotty. Adequate moisture has provided good 
range conditions in the eastern portion of the Tenth District. 
However, the western part of the district is experiencing extremely 
dry range conditions. Due to poor crop conditions, ranchers in 
Wyoming are moving their cattle to market and selling at discounted 
prices. Cattle are also moving to market in western Nebraska, but to
a lesser degree.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural lenders throughout the district report that land 
acquired by financial institutions through foreclosure or 
liquidation is being moved onto the market with little or no delay. 
Moreover, banks in all district states report that they are taking 
market prices for farm real estate, and often setting no minimum at 
auction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many farm equipment dealers in the district remain in financial 
difficulty. Producers and sellers of farm equipment continue to cut 
back on inventories and number of employees. Farm equipment sales in 
Oklahoma have declined dramatically from the already low levels of a 
year ago.
