      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, economic activity in the Twelfth District continues at a 
healthy pace, although Alaska, Idaho, and Utah do not share in the 
current prosperity, and the pace of construction activity continues 
to weaken in many parts of the District. Consumer spending is 
steady, and high-technology manufacturing activity appears to be 
picking up. Lumber producers continue to enjoy strong prices and 
demand, while oil-producing regions are benefiting from recent price 
hikes. Construction activity continues mixed, among regions as well 
as among building types. Many financial institutions are 
experiencing substantial changes in their portfolio mixes, away from 
consumer credit and toward home equity loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending patterns have not changed appreciably in most 
parts of the District during recent months, with most respondents 
describing overall sales as "flat" or "unchanged." Strength in car 
sales varies geographically, and within market areas sales generally 
are stronger among used cars and smaller cars, including Korean 
imports. In most areas, apparel, housewares, and small appliances 
are selling well. Shopping malls and department stores in southern 
California, Oregon, and Seattle report sales growth and express 
optimism regarding fall sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      An Arizona survey suggests a broad-based decline in purchases and 
planned purchases of consumer durables in that state, consistent 
with the slowing pace of activity there. Consumer purchases since 
the last survey declined in most spending categories, but the 
proportion purchasing home appliances increased from 24 percent to 
31 percent. The proportion planning to purchase automobiles during 
the next six months dropped from 42 percent of the respondents in 
July 1986 to 28 percent in July 1987, while the fraction planning to 
buy electronic products and tools dropped from 43 percent to 33 
percent. Declines of 10 to 15 percentage points also were reported 
for household furnishings and home improvements, with home 
appliances experiencing a smaller decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The long-anticipated turnaround in the semiconductor and electronic 
equipment industries appears to be materializing at last but, in the 
words of one respondent, it is a "slow creep-out rather than a rapid 
turnaround." Orders and shipments are stronger overall, but 
increased demand currently is concentrated in computers and office 
equipment, communications, and instruments. One Portland-area firm 
has announced plans to double capacity at one of its plants, and 
another is re-examining old plans to build a new $130 million 
silicon-wafer plant. Moreover, 17 percent of respondents to an 
Arizona survey planned increased capital spending, an improvement 
from recent quarters when virtually none planned spending increases. 
The same survey revealed that 57 percent of respondents expected to 
increase employment during the coming months, and the remaining 43 
percent plan no changes. However, many firms are increasing 
production by utilizing existing plant capacity and labor resources, 
which has limited plant expansion and additional hiring. In 
addition, continued offshore migration of production, particularly 
of standard memory devices, is limiting U.S. gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several respondents note that exports to both Europe and Japan have 
strengthened. A Washington banker argues that the improvement also 
is due to new product designs and redesigns of existing products 
reaching the production stage, and that continued improvement in 
this area depends critically on activity at large regional 
electronic and electrical equipment firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Idaho lumber mills reported that they were operating at 
capacity, with 6 percent fewer employees than a year ago. Softwood 
lumber exports to Europe and Japan for the first five months of 1987 
were up 16 and 12 percent respectively from the same period in 1986, 
while log exports rose 11 percent. Exchange rate considerations, a 
surge in housing starts in Japan, and increases in log demand from 
China and Korea account for much of the improvement. Canadian lumber 
imports for the first five months of 1987 were 2.8 percent lower 
than they were in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some oil equipment firms finally are operating "in the black," as 
the number of drilling rigs has been increasing for the last eight 
to nine weeks. In Kern County, the number of drilling rigs has 
increased during each of the last four months, and 51.5 percent of 
the rigs are working, compared with only 27.5 percent of rigs a year 
ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and Real Estate
Construction activity in the Twelfth District continues to be mixed, 
with particularly weak activity in economically struggling areas, 
and multifamily construction weakening throughout the District. In 
California, the number of residential construction permits year-to-
date through July stands 11.5 percent below last year's level, while 
the value of nonresidential construction awards for the first seven 
months of the year remains 14 percent above the year-earlier level 
despite deterioration during June and July. The number of housing 
permits and mortgages in the Seattle area has declined in recent 
months, and sales of both new and existing homes have fallen in 
eastern Washington. In Utah, total construction value for the first 
six months of the year was down 15.7 percent from last year's level, 
after June declines of 25 percent in the number of new single-family 
construction permits and 45 percent in nonresidential valuation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Declines in consumer loan volume and in credit card usage compared 
with last year were reported in most parts of the District, but were 
not universal. At a Washington bank, consumer loans outstanding 
advanced at over a 10 percent annual rate between April and July, 
following net paydowns in the first part of the year. Moreover, an 
Arizona banker reports that credit card usage through the first 
seven months of the year rose 21 percent from the comparable period 
last year, and installment credit rose by 6.6 percent over the same 
period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many respondents attributed the general decline in consumer credit 
volumes to the new tax law, which eliminated consumer interest 
deductions, causing increased use of home equity loans and home 
equity lines of credit. An Oregon bank reports that credit card debt 
has grown only minimally, and auto loans have been flat, while the 
use of home equity credit lines has increased by 17 percent in the 
last year. There is little evidence that consumers are drawing down 
savings accounts to purchase durable goods. One large California 
bank reports that its passbook savings volume has advanced 
significantly since December. A community bank in the San Joaquin 
Valley also reports increases in savings account balances, while one 
Arizona bank reports that its savings account balances are up 15 
percent. However, contradictory evidence comes from a southern 
California Savings and Loan, where savings inflows have been weak 
for the last seven months.
