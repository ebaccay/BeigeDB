     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Unfolding national economic trends also are evident in a reading of 
business conditions in southeastern states. Manufacturing activity 
is strong in many foreign trade related activities such as 
agriculture, paper and chemicals. Producers in housing and consumer 
goods industries are becoming concerned about soft demand. Holiday 
spending, while not great, turned out to be better than retailers 
expected in the immediate aftermath of the stock market crash. 
Although construction activity continues to slow, the regional 
economy is comparatively healthy on balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remains brisk for most industries. There is 
no evidence of significant cutbacks in capital spending or orders 
for major regional industries, but consumer goods producers are 
edgy. Textile producers continue to operate at high utilization 
levels, with carpet producers reporting tight labor conditions. 
Increases in prices of imported and domestic clothing plus softening 
demand is resulting in an unwanted apparel inventory buildup at the 
manufacturing level, possibly signaling a production slowdown this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chemical and paper industries are benefiting from higher prices, 
improved domestic and foreign sales, and lessened import 
competition. Strong textile markets also have helped segments of the 
chemical industry, and the cheaper dollar has encouraged foreign 
paper mills to buy U.S. wood pulp. New paper mills and plant 
expansions have recently been announced.
     </p>
     <p>
      Defense related government contracts continue to benefit the region; 
in Huntsville, the new space station contract will eventually add 
2000 new jobs to payrolls. In metals, more than 500 steelworkers in 
Alabama are expected to return to work earlier than originally 
planned and an aluminum smelting plant is returning to full 
production in Tennessee. On the other hand, home appliance 
manufacturers are concerned about scaled-back consumer spending, 
lower housing start levels and rising raw material prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major department stores made slight-to-moderate real gains in 
holiday sales over the previous Christmas but sales at specialty 
stores such as women's fashion shops were disappointing. Retailers 
boosted sales volume by promoting heavily and reducing gross profit 
margins in the process. Efforts to clear excess merchandise in 
January have been hampered by poor weather. Orders and inventories 
for spring sales are conservative and expected to be about the same 
as last year's levels. Many retailers expect to see more discounting 
this spring than last year and a more highly promotional 
environment, particularly in products experiencing the sharpest 
slowdown in spending such as women's sportswear and electronic 
items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers feel that December's sales compared rather well with 
year-end 1986 considering strong tax incentives at that time. Light 
trucks continue to be the star performer offsetting some weakness in 
domestic car models. The geographic pattern of vehicle sales in 1987 
mirrored the overall consumer spending pattern in the Districtâ€”
activity in the eastern part was stronger than that nationally, 
while the western part lagged behind the nation's performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The winter slowdown, coupled with continued economic uncertainty, 
has reduced housing sales and construction. Markets in Louisiana and 
Mississippi are hampered by distressed local economies and 
outmigration as well. Activity is mixed in Tennesseeâ€”Nashville has 
become overbuilt in both single-family and multifamily homes while 
Knoxville's housing market seems to be building momentum. The huge 
Florida and Georgia markets, which were fairly stable in 1987, are 
expected to soften in 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      Analysts expect the widespread commercial construction and leasing 
slowdown to continue this year. The office market, in particular, 
remains overbuilt in most of the large markets. A notable exception 
is Orlando, where high absorption and a cutback in development in 
1987 caused its office vacancy rate to drop significantly. According 
to recent reports, foreign investors' interest and participation in 
Atlanta's commercial real estate market is growing. The Japanese 
have been the most active, but European investors' activity is also 
growing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer and real estate loan growth fell in December, with consumer 
borrowing actually declining in Alabama and Louisiana. The slower 
expansion of consumer credit in the other states reflects a smaller 
increase in borrowing for car purchases. Homeowners also are 
reported to have drawn down home-equity lines to finance Christmas 
purchases. Other residential mortgage financing is sluggish due to 
seasonal factors and low volumes of refinancing relative to late in 
1986. Regional banks are requiring commercial developers to pre-
lease more space to qualify for loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The U.S. cruise industry is growing at a fast clip. Ports such as 
Miamiâ€”currently the world's most used cruise liner portâ€”Fort 
Lauderdale, Tampa, and New Orleans should benefit from this 
increased traffic, which peaks during the winter. The airline 
industry has yet to note any negative impacts attributable to the 
stock market's crash, and the dollar's most recent decline has not 
spurred any noticeable trends in air travel. Airline officials 
anticipate an eventual increase in tourists to the southeast as a 
consequence of the dollar's decline. The air fare war now going on 
in Atlanta and Florida was designed to fill more seats during the 
slack winter quarter. In Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana, business 
travel to attend conventions and meetings during January is running 
ahead of last year's performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining, Agriculture and Forestry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The kaolin industry is prospering as export activity increases and 
demand from paper companies remains strong. In dairy expansion 
projects, prompted by favorable short- and long-tern prospects, are 
underway in Georgia. The phosphate industry continues its recovery 
after several years of poor performance, aided chiefly by a fast-
growing export market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Southeastern crop farmers are enjoying higher prices. Florida's 
citrus industry is especially benefiting from a larger crop and 
stable to higher prices. Forest industries are continuing to 
prosper, with a bright outlook for 1988.
