      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Twelfth District economy continues to grow at a healthy pace, 
and this Bank's survey indicates that condition have improved during 
the past two months. Consumer spending is growing slowly, but car 
sales have improved. Manufacturing, agriculture, forest products, 
and mining continue to post healthy gains. Respondents report that 
prices of many products have risen in recent months, but the 
increases do not appear to be broad-based. Where wages are 
increasing, in most cases the increases are less than 5 percent. 
Real estate activity remains mixed, with strength reported in 
California. Financial institutions report thin profit margins and 
stiff competition for high-quality borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to the Twelfth District business sentiment survey expect 
real GNP growth to be somewhat slower than 3 percent during the next 
four quarters. The proportion of respondents anticipating growth at 
or above three percent has grown since the last survey, due in large 
part to expected strengthening of business investment. As was true 
last time, respondents expect housing activity and consumer spending 
to slow somewhat, while the trade deficit is expected to improve. 
Sixty percent expect somewhat higher inflation, but none expects 
inflation to worsen seriously. Most anticipate no change in the 
unemployment rate, and the remainder are almost evenly divided 
between expecting a higher or lower unemployment rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of consumer spending growth is reported to be stable to 
soft. Although some respondents noted growth rates a little slower 
than they were before October 19, the March pace is reported to be 
stronger than it was in January and February. Some Washington state 
respondents report slight improvement across a broad range of 
products, but spending on big-ticket items such as cars, homes, and 
furnishings is reported to be slow in Arizona. Some southern 
California retailers report sluggish appliance and home decorating 
sales, despite booming new home sales there.
     </p>
     <p>
      An auto dealer reports that domestic new car sales have firmed, and 
current inventories are satisfactory to tight. New domestic truck 
and minivan sales remain strong, with very lean inventories. Sales 
of Japanese imports, in contrast, are soft, with excessive 
inventories relative to sales. As a result, some manufacturers 
increasingly are using incentives to sell these vehicles. The used 
car market continues to strengthen, in terms of both activity and 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, manufacturing activity in the West continues at a healthy 
pace. Aluminum producers have greatly expanded their output in 
response to dramatic price increases. An electronics manufacturer 
reports order and sales improvements of about 10 percent during the 
first quarter of 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, cutbacks in defense spending are beginning to be felt in 
the West. Defense-related revenue at one large contractor fell 18 
percent during 1987. While total sales for this firm are expected to 
set a record in 1988 due to strong demand for commercial aircraft, 
the pace of employment growth seems to be slowing. Job advertising 
patterns also suggest that aerospace employment growth is flattening 
out.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices and general market conditions continue to bode well for most 
western farm products. However, water shortages are a source of 
increasing concern among western farmers, and recent rains have not 
been sufficient to replenish reservoirs in many areas. Livestock 
producers already are suffering. If irrigation is reduced this 
summer, some permanent plantings could be lost, and crop yields 
likely would fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forest products companies and copper mines continue to benefit from 
strong prices and improved cost structures. In addition, oil 
drilling activity ran about 30 percent higher than Its year-earlier 
level throughout the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      More than forty percent of respondents reported little or no 
increases in wages or prices. However, price increases have been 
dramatic for some products, including aluminum, copper, wheat, logs, 
wool, and steel. Finished soft goods from Europe and Japan 
reportedly are prohibitively priced, even for the upscale U.S. 
market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases for intermediate and finished products appear to 
have been less dramatic, although several respondents expressed 
concern about the possibility of substantial increases during the 
next six months. Consumer resistance has kept a lid on apparel price 
increases associated with the dollar's decline. One respondent noted 
that, while U.S. firms are encountering capacity constraints, 
substantial excess capacity abroad is likely to restrain price 
hikes. However, production bottlenecks in lumber and paper have 
shown up in increased newsprint prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wages are increasing in some regions and industries, but rates of 
increase appear to be well under 5 percent in most cases. However, 
the 27 percent increase in California's minimum wage, effective July 
1, could place upward pressure on wages for some California 
retailers, farmers, and service firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity has not recovered to the levels seen during 
September and early October. One large firm reports that sales 
activity improved slightly in March and April, but still lags far 
behind last year's level in most markets, except in California. Real 
estate development in southern California reportedly is continuing 
aggressively, which some attribute to anticipated growth moratoria.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of new homes in Arizona are reported to be slow. The fourth 
quarter of 1987 was the slowest in the last ten years for southern 
Arizona. Commercial, industrial, and multifamily construction in the 
state is reported to be at a standstill, except for some small 
retail projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall loan demand appears to be unchanged, with respondents 
divided as to whether demand is strong or weak, even in similar 
markets. Thrift representatives report extremely thin profit 
margins. They are flush with funds, but competition for quality 
mortgage borrowers is stiff.
