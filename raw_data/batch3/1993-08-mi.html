     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 4, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Moderate growth continues to characterize the economy of the Ninth 
District in spite of adverse weather and flooding in many areas. 
Residential and commercial construction continues above 1992 levels 
and is perhaps the strongest component in the district economy. 
General merchandise and vehicle sales are also good except in areas 
where flooding has slowed retail spending. The tourist industry is 
generally strong in western portions of the district but somewhat 
slow in regions plagued by persistent rains. Price levels are stable 
with no indications of inflationary pressures while labor markets 
show modest improvements in employment levels. However crops, 
particularly soybeans and corn, have suffered extensive damage from 
heavy rains, flooding and cool weather, such losses are likely to 
exceed $1.5 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction continues to be one of the strongest areas in the 
economy. Publicly awarded construction contracts in Minnesota and 
the Dakotas continue to run 25 percent above 1992 levels. 
Residential construction is also strong throughout most areas of the 
district. "Home builders are seeing a steady flow of business this 
summer," said one Minneapolis-St. Paul builders association 
spokesperson. A substantial new apartment project was announced in 
Fargo, N.D. Newspapers also report substantial construction of 
housing in the Black Hills region of western South Dakota, new or 
expanded tourist facilities in northeastern Minnesota and retail 
buildings in Grand Forks, N.D.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In June and July, general merchandise sales appear stronger than in 
April and May. Shopping mall managers in eastern South and North 
Dakota reported traffic up from 1992 levels. A major Minneapolis-
based retailer reported June comparable-store sales up about 4 
percent from 1992 levels and stated that they were encouraged with 
the performance of their moderate-price division. New vehicles 
generally continue as a strong area of consumer spending although 
dealers and industry spokespersons in areas affected by flooding 
report that sales are down for autos and particularly for pickups.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity is generally good for the district as a whole. 
Industry sources and newspapers from Michigan's Upper Peninsula, 
North Dakota and Montana all report a generally good season. Bridge 
crossings into the Upper Peninsula are about 5 percent above year-
earlier figures. There is increased bus tour traffic in both North 
and South Dakota. The tourist season in Montana had a strong start, 
but visits have slowed recently in response to wet weather. In South 
Dakota business appears mixed. A Tourism Department official said 
visits were down in spite of a 12 percent increase in inquiries 
while state park visits are up from 1992. And cool, wet weather has 
slowed tourism somewhat in Minnesota and Wisconsin according to 
industry and government officials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output appears to have grown slightly. Year-to-date 
industrial use of electricity continues above trend. New small 
manufacturing ventures were opened or announced in Williston and 
Westhope, N.D., Menomonie, Wis., and Duluth, Minn. Most publicly-
traded small and medium manufacturing firms continue to report 
improved earnings compared to corresponding periods in 1992. 
District advisory council members report that manufacturers are 
cautious about capital investments, but are buying new machinery or 
upgrading existing facilities to increase output with existing 
staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mining employment is stable while output is rising a bit. One 
western South Dakota gold mine is making a major investment to reach 
a new ore body. And an iron mining firm with operations in the Lake 
Superior region reported that its production and sales were higher 
than 1992 levels and above the firms own earlier projections for the 
1993 season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices, Wages and Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is little evidence of upward pressure on price levels. 
Gasoline prices are well below year-earlier levels. Lumber prices 
have moderated somewhat after sharp increases earlier in the year. 
Advisory council members and Ninth District directors report 
generally stable prices in their businesses or communities and note 
that new public and private sector compensation agreements generally 
include limited increases in wages with most increases channeled 
into health benefits. Employees of a major airline are likely to 
approve an agreement that will significantly cut their compensation 
as the firm struggles to avoid bankruptcy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Non-farm employment is above year-earlier levels in all Ninth 
District states with most of the increase in services and trade 
employment. Unemployment rates declined in Montana, North Dakota, 
South Dakota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. No large layoffs 
were reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Excessive rain and flooding has seriously damaged crops, 
particularly in eastern South Dakota, southern Minnesota and west 
central Wisconsin where corn and soybeans predominate. As much as 10 
to 15 percent of planned corn and soybean acres were never planted 
due to persistent adverse weather beginning in April. In a special 
survey agricultural bankers in these areas expected corn and soybean 
yields to be only about 60 percent and small grains to be 75 percent 
of normal. Ninety-two of 227 counties in Minnesota, Wisconsin and 
South Dakota have already been declared disaster areas. Although 
wheat-growing areas had generally favorable conditions through June, 
recent heavy rains and flooding in eastern North Dakota have raised 
concern about the harvest. Crop development is two to three weeks 
behind normal across virtually all of the district due to 
unseasonably cool weather. And rains have obstructed hay harvesting 
across Wisconsin, pushing hay prices to record levels and squeezing 
net incomes in dairying.
     </p>
     <p>
      But above-normal precipitation has been a boon to cattle raisers; 
pasture and range conditions in the Dakotas and Montana are reported 
to be the best in many years. Irrigation reservoir levels in western 
areas of the district are recovering from declines in preceding 
drought years. Meat prices, especially for beef, continue to be 
generally favorable.
