      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy varied among sectors in 
recent weeks. General business conditions improved moderately and 
commercial leasing in much of the District expanded. Residential 
construction has been somewhat sluggish, however, and retail sales 
have generally been below plan. Small and medium-sized banks also 
report that demand for home mortgages has been weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales at District retail stores have been rather sluggish since the 
last report. This was particularly true in February when all 
respondents experienced disappointing results. Sales improved in 
March, but generally remained somewhat below expectations. While one 
retailer attributed the recent slowdown to continuing resistance to 
the current styles in women's apparel, others noted a more 
widespread sluggishness which they were unable to explain.
     </p>
     <p>
      For February, year-to-year changes in District retail sales ranged 
from -6.7 percent to +2.0 percent, results which ran from slightly 
below to "way behind" plan. Aided by this year's early Easter, over-the-year gains of from 3 percent to 11 percent were registered in 
March—results which ranged from somewhat below to slightly above 
plan. Despite the lackluster sales, inventories are generally 
reported at relatively comfortable levels as a result of close 
monitoring and some aggressive markdowns.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Second District's economy expanded moderately in recent weeks. 
The percentage of purchasing managers recruiting improved business 
conditions in the Rochester survey jumped from 38 percent in 
February to 53 percent in March. The Buffalo survey registered a 
much smaller rise. A much larger percentage of surveyed Buffalo 
firms also reported lower inventories in March than in February.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent developments point to some further strength in the District's 
economy. In Syracuse, General Electric has begun working on its 
almost $1 billion submarine combat system contract which the company 
was awarded by the Navy late last year. In the Buffalo area, Sierra 
Research just received a $100 million award from the Air Force for 
the production of computerized flight inspection systems with the 
possibility of additional support work later on as well. Plans have 
been announced for the construction of several large co-generation 
plants that manufacturing firms hope will reduce energy costs. A 
recent negative announcement was that Grumman Corporation will 
reduce its workforce on Long Island by 2300 employees as a result of 
losing a Navy aircraft bid. With Long Island's February unemployment 
rate at 3.3 percent, observers anticipate that these workers can be 
absorbed without much difficulty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the District's residential construction market has been 
somewhat sluggish due in part to the unusually cold weather this 
spring season. Homebuilders report some recent improvement and 
anticipate much more traffic and interest in the months ahead. 
However, few expect the 1988 pace to match that in recent years. 
Less pent-up demand, a growing shortage of suitable land in some 
areas, and the high level at which home prices seem to have 
stabilized are cited as factors which are expected to contribute to 
some slowing this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of office leasing generally has improved within the 
District. Demand for office space in midtown Manhattan picked up 
substantially in recent weeks, but downtown Manhattan leasing 
remains slow. Elsewhere in the metropolitan area demand is reported 
strong. Some Fairfield County spokesmen state that a real upturn is 
occurring. The relatively few new office projects currently planned 
there and in Westchester County are generating some optimism that 
the high vacancy rates may soon decline. Hotel construction is one 
category in which considerable building is either planned or 
underway—most noticeably in Manhattan where four hotels are 
currently being built and four more are scheduled. Higher rentals, 
relatively high occupancy rates, and a record number of visitors are 
spurring this development.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to loan officers of small to medium-sized banks in the 
Second District, demand for home mortgages is rather weak. Though 
the number of loan applications has recently begun to rise, most 
bankers attributed this to seasonal factors. Some officers, 
especially those in the New York metropolitan area, believe that the 
stock market unrest has made some potential homebuyers wary. Given 
the relatively low mortgage rates, buyers currently prefer fixed-
rate loans. However, most bankers expect that interest rates will 
rise by the end of the summer and demand will shift back to 
adjustable rate mortgages with their typically lower introductory 
rates. Demand for home equity loans is still strong, but 
considerably below last year's level when they were heavily 
promoted. Nearly all respondents believe the high cost of housing 
has resulted in a significant drop in the percentage of first-time 
homebuyers. This trend seems to have become more pronounced in the 
last two years. Increasingly, those in the real estate market are 
either trading up to a better home or buying vacation homes.
