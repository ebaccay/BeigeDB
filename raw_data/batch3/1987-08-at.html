      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Sixth District's economy shows signs of moderate strengthening 
in a number of sectors. Unemployment in the Southeast continues its 
downward trend assisted by sizable job gains in services and a slow 
rebound in manufacturing. Retail sales are rising moderately, and 
tourism is also providing a positive impact. Construction presents a 
mixed picture with pockets of brisk activity interspersed among 
slowing areas. Prospects in agriculture appeared generally favorable 
at mid-July although hot, dry weather again threatened crop yields.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates continue to decline in the Sixth District. The 
May rate of 6.8 percent was the lowest in seven years for the 
region, and the downward trend apparently continued according to 
preliminary June reports. The largest employment gains have been 
posted in the service-producing sectors; however, manufacturing 
employment has improved steadily since the first of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chemical industry is rebounding, aided by the weak dollar and 
low raw material costs. The recent upturn in oil prices has 
encouraged drilling activity, which has stimulated the oil equipment 
industry. Bank directors report that orders and shipments for 
furniture manufacturers remain strong, and consumer purchases of 
furniture are accelerating. Textile inventories are reported to be 
at acceptable levels, and many plants in the region are operating 
near capacity at present.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the District report sales are matching modest national 
gains, on balance. Atlanta sales, according to some retailers, show 
signs of picking up. Florida is the Southeast's best performer, 
while Mississippi and Louisiana are the worst. Georgia, Alabama, and 
Tennessee are performing about on par with the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      District car dealers report mixed trends for June and July as 
foreign car sales outperformed the sluggish movements of domestic 
cars. As in recent months, most dealers handling GM models report 
weak sales and unwanted inventory accumulation. One surprising 
bright spot emerged in New Orleans, where the stabilization of oil 
prices and renewed drilling activity spurred the best June car sales 
performance in that location in four years. Overall, the Southeast's 
new car registrations this year through the end of May were off by 1 
percent compared to the first five months of 1986, while the 
nation's rate dropped by 9 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family building permits in the Sixth District (three-month 
average, seasonally adjusted) declined in May after holding steady 
for three months. However, District realtors anticipate that the 
softening of mortgage rates in recent weeks will boost housing 
activity. The spring uptick in rates discouraged residential 
builders and apparently priced many first-time buyers out of the 
market for new homes. Some have turned to lower-priced existing 
homes, which, contacts report, are generally selling well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Market performance varies throughout the District. Jacksonville 
reports strong sales, and new residential construction continues at 
a healthy pace in the suburbs of Jackson, Mississippi. The worst 
performance is reported in New Orleans, where sales are slow and 
prices are stagnant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Southeast's prolonged slowdown of commercial construction has 
enabled markets to firm slightly. Orlando reports a decline in 
vacancy rates for commercial space, and prices for industrial space 
in Atlanta are strong. Montgomery contacts note active commercial 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan growth at the largest commercial banks edged downward in 
June. Growth of both business and real estate loans slowed, while 
consumer loans grew only slightly. Around 50 percent of the total 
credit available through home equity lines is currently in use, say 
District bankers. While many line holders are using the credit to 
pay off consumer debt, many are also using it to make major 
purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism throughout the Southeast is matching last year's 
performance. Florida leads the District as it benefits from Disney's 
anniversary publicity. The state's hotel occupancy rates have 
increased from last year. There is positive news for Mississippi in 
the revival of tourism In Natchez and Vicksburg and for Louisiana in 
the planning of the Pope's visit in September. Alabama, Georgia, and 
Tennessee are realizing earlier expectations of a good summer 
tourism season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rising exports are gradually offsetting the volume lost from the 
sluggish pace of imports at several District ports. In Miami, for 
example, increased exports to Latin America are more than 
compensating for reduced imports. In New Orleans, port revenues are 
up from last year, and the prospects for continuing gains in export 
cargo and employment are quite promising. In Savannah, exports are 
also gradually rising, led by higher shipments of kaolin to Europe, 
machinery to Brazil, and forest products to many countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The number of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the District rose 
sharply in early July to reach the highest level since April 1986. 
Most of the increase occurred in Louisiana and Alabama. The upsurge 
is in response to higher petroleum prices and expectations of 
improvement in the price of natural gas. Substantial drilling 
activity is occurring in the Gulf of Mexico with plans for further 
exploration and development. Because almost one-third of the 
nation's natural gas supply is located in the Gulf, this area will 
continue to be developed, which bodes well for southeastern 
seaports.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the first half of 1987, District coal production was 11 percent 
less than the same period of 1986, and coal prices averaged 6 
percent lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions in the Southeast are favorable at present, but if 
recent hot, dry weather continues, yields could deteriorate. The 
broiler industry may experience losses as prices have fallen 20 
percent below a year ago in the face of slowing demand and large 
supplies.
