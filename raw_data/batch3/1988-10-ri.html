      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 18, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic growth apparently slowed further in the District in 
September, although manufacturing seemed to regain some of the 
strength that it had lost in August. Our September survey indicates 
that retail sales were flat. Slower rates of increase in prices and 
wages were reported in retailing as well as in manufacturing. Sales 
of new homes declined, as did homebuilding activity. The levels of 
shipments in and out of our District ports were largely unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from other District sectors were mixed. Depository 
institutions indicated little change in commercial loan demand but 
continued strength in home equity loans. Farmers gave uneven reports 
on the fall harvest and were uncertain as to how disaster payments 
will be made. Resort and hotel representatives said this summer's 
tourist activity was above last summer's, but that fall bookings 
were about the same as at this time a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Participants in our surveys were also asked about their expectations 
for the next six months. Among producers, optimism declined for the 
second month in a row, but most still expect business conditions to 
remain the same or improve in the months ahead. Among retailers, 
optimism about the economic outlook remained at last month's high 
level. Most of the bankers contacted expect interest rates to rise, 
but most homebuilders expect mortgage rates to decline. District 
farmers who escaped the worst of the drought expect their incomes 
this year to be above those of a year ago, and they look for further 
income gains next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to our regular wail survey of District retailers imply 
that sales were unchanged in September from August, while other 
indicators of retail activity were mixed. Almost equal percentages 
of retailers reported declines, increases, and no changes in their 
sales. Reports of decreases in employment outnumbered reports of 
increases, but over three-fourths of our retailers indicated no 
change in employment. Inventories were said to be higher by one-
third of the respondents, and lower by one-fifth. About 40 percent 
said they had raised wages in September, compared to about half who 
said they did so in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales activity varied by type of store. Among department stores, 
about 40 percent reported decreases in sales, and about 20 percent 
reported increases. Sales of big ticket items declined in 20 percent 
of the department stores and rose in about 10 percent. Most car 
dealers reported increases in sales, while most furniture stores 
reported no change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most District resorts and hotels contacted by telephone said this 
summer's tourist activity was higher than last summer's. Bookings 
for this fall are about the same as at this time last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand in September according to 
respondents to our regular mail survey. Thirty-nine percent of the 
respondents in the District reported increased shipments and 13 
percent reported declines, compared with 34 and 21 percent, 
respectively, in our previous survey. New orders, employment, and 
the length of the workweek also increased, and the backlog of orders 
declined. Inventories of finished goods were unchanged in September 
while inventories of raw materials declined somewhat. Sixteen 
percent of our respondents said they raised wages in September, 
compared with 20 percent who raised wages in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of manufacturers' materials have apparently continued to 
rise, but the pace of increase slowed for the third consecutive 
month. Fifty percent of our respondents said that prices of raw 
materials increased in September, compared with 61 percent who 
reported increases in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the second consecutive month, manufacturers who said they expect 
decreases nationally in the general level of business activity 
exceeded the number who expect an upturn. Twenty-eight percent 
anticipate a decline in the next six months, while 20 percent 
anticipate an increase. With regard to the outlook for their own 
businesses, 40 percent of the respondents believe their shipments 
will rise in the next six months and 31 percent anticipate declines. 
Producers who foresee declines in their unfilled orders, workweeks, 
and inventories of materials and finished goods outnumbered those 
who expect increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      No clear trend in trade is apparent from the September reports of 
the three major District ports-Hampton Roads, Baltimore and 
Charleston. Shipments in September were up slightly over August 
levels at Charleston, down slightly at Hampton Roads, and unchanged 
at Baltimore. Import shipments remained about the same at Baltimore 
and Charleston, but declined slightly at Hampton Roads.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District home builders' associations surveyed by telephone indicated 
a softening in activity in the housing sector. Builders reported 
that the seasonally adjusted pace of new home sales declined more in 
September than in August. In addition, the level of home building in 
the District apparently declined further from its pace of a year 
ago. While most respondents reported generally slower activity, some 
indicated increased sales of homes priced above $200,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our telephone survey of District financial institutions indicated 
little change in the demand for commercial loans in September. Two 
banks, however, reported declines in loans for commercial 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of the demand for residential mortgages varied widely. About 
the same number of respondents reported increases as decreases. Many 
respondents said the demand for home equity loans remains strong 
despite the winding down of promotional efforts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fifth District farmers gave mixed reports on their fall harvests. In 
the areas of extreme drought, some crops were total losses. A farmer 
from central Maryland reported that corn fields were not worth 
picking in his area. A farmer from North Carolina, however, said his 
state is enjoying an above normal corn harvest. The peach harvest 
was reported to be very good in both Carolinas. Late soybeans in 
Maryland and South Carolina received adequate rain and should yield 
well. District cotton production is up this year, partly because 
more acres were planted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total farm income in the District probably will be higher this year 
than last. Farm production this year is expected to match production 
of last year, which was also a year of drought in the District. This 
year, however, farm prices—including the prices of poultry, and 
those of most crops—have been higher because the drought was a 
national phenomenon that reduced supplies.
