      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions are somewhat mixed in different parts of the 
country but on balance display a weaker pattern. In many of the 
Federal Reserve districts, economic activity appears to have 
declined recently while it has remained sluggish or grown slowly in 
the rest. Several districts report a decline in consumer and 
business confidence and many refer to expectations of continued 
diminution in economic activity. Retail sales, adjusted for 
inflation, appear to have declined below their year-ago levels in 
almost all districts. Manufacturing conditions have weakened in most 
districts. However, soft domestic demand has been partially offset 
by strong export orders. Most districts report continued weakness in 
construction. Several districts report a decline in business loan 
demand as well as some tightening of loan standards by banks. In 
contrast, agriculture is reported to have been doing very well. Crop 
yields have been good and livestock prices have been high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales apparently have weakened in almost all the Districts. 
The dollar volume of retail sales in October was lower than a year 
ago in most of the districts. At best, only slight increases are 
reported in the rest of the districts. Thus, real retail sales 
appear to have fallen from their year-ago levels. The Chicago, 
Atlanta, and St. Louis districts cite sharply lower consumer 
confidence as s key factor in the retail sales slowdown. Several 
districts report that sales of durable goods were particularly hard 
hit. Automobile sales in particular are reported to have weakened, 
except in Dallas. Inventories are generally reported to have been at 
satisfactory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts report that retailers were pessimistic about sales 
prospects for the Christmas season as well as for 1991. However, the 
Richmond district reports unexpectedly strong sales in metropolitan 
areas immediately following Thanksgiving, and the Kansas City 
district reports that retailers expect sales to be steady to 
moderately improved throughout the Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis districts note particular 
weakness in the automobile industry. Weak domestic demand for 
manufactured goods was partially offset by strong export orders. An 
aircraft manufacturer reports that 90 percent of orders were from 
overseas compared to an average of 60 percent of orders during the 
previous two years. The Richmond and Atlanta districts also report 
strong export shipments. Manufacturing inventories have been 
described as under control.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers have expressed concern about business prospects for 
the coming months, The majority of manufacturers contacted in the 
Boston district expect a national recession lasting two to four 
quarters. Business leaders contacted in the San Francisco district 
expect continued deterioration in the national economy. 
Manufacturers in the Philadelphia district, however, expect modest 
increases in orders and shipments over the next six months, and 
manufacturers in the Richmond district were less pessimistic about 
prospects than they had been a month ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts report continued sluggishness in construction 
activity. Residential construction continued to be weak, with 
several districts citing a glut of houses for resale. Atlanta, St. 
Louis, and Minneapolis report a decline in sales of existing homes. 
Nonresidential construction is also reported to be generally weak. 
New York and San Francisco point to an abundant supply of office and 
commercial space as big factors in the slowdown. However, there are 
a few bright spots. New York reports a recent pickup in office 
leasing activity in downtown Manhattan. Chicago reports that 
construction slowdowns are not universal and that development 
continues in communities outside major metropolitan areas in the 
district. Minneapolis reports a recent rebound in construction 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      None of the districts report significant wage pressures. Minneapolis 
reports that medical insurance costs have continued to rise sharply. 
Atlanta reports some easing of medical worker shortages. Dallas 
reports strong demand for service workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of price increases for goods are mixed. San Francisco 
reports price increases in the 3 to 5 percent range, but Boston 
reports that materials prices for oil-based products have increased 
as much as 8 percent. Richmond reports steady finished good prices, 
even for products using oil-based inputs. Several districts report 
expectations of discounting by retailers this Christmas season in 
the face of weak demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the financial sector has been generally softer. Several 
districts report a decline in consumer and business loan demand. 
Almost all districts also report some tightening by banks of 
business loan terms, particularly for construction and land 
development. Reports of banks' willingness to lend are mixed, with 
New York reporting that banks are somewhat less willing to lend but 
with St. Louis reporting no change.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural sector is reported to have been strong across the 
country. Crop yields are generally reported to have been fairly 
good. Partly as a result of these high yields, crop prices have 
fallen recently and reports are mixed on farmers' incomes. However, 
Minneapolis reports that farmers' balance sheets are in excellent 
shape. Several districts note that livestock producers have had an 
outstanding year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil and gas extraction reports show little change in Dallas or San 
Francisco and a modest pickup in Kansas City and Minneapolis.
