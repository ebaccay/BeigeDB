     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District reports indicate that overall economic activity continues 
to expand slowly in April. The agriculture sector reports some 
weather-related damage to specific crops, but drought fears have 
been alleviated by recent rains, and the farm outlook is generally 
optimistic. Natural resource industries are generally reported to be 
healthy, with exploration and drilling holding up well in the oil 
and gas industry. Residential real estate markets remain generally 
weak, but with some specific geographic areas doing well. 
Nonresidential construction is mixed, with public works projects 
supplying some strength. Manufacturing is also mixed, with some 
improvement noted in half of the districts. Plants are still 
apparently operating below capacity, however, and there has been 
little upward pressure on industrial prices. Retail spending has
been growing slowly in general, and merchants are looking for small 
real gains throughout the rest of the year. Auto sales, however, 
remain weak. In the financial sector, demand for loans is varied but 
generally flat, with loans for commercial real estate down in most 
districts. There is little evidence that a general "credit crunch" 
is developing; the majority of businesses say they have not seen any 
change in credit terms and have had no trouble getting credit. Where 
credit tightening by banks and thrift institutions has been noted, 
however, it has mainly affected newer small businesses and the real 
estate industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The cold, wet weather that dominated much of the nation through 
spring took its toll on some crops. Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis 
say apple and peach crops were damaged, in some cases severely, and 
inclement weather has delayed field work and planting in the 
Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts. However, soil 
moisture levels have now reached adequate, or even surplus, levels 
in most areas, with the exception of some parts of the Minneapolis 
district and California. Although winter wheat sustained some 
weather-related damage in the Richmond and St. Louis districts, 
Minneapolis says losses were small in that district, and farmers in 
contact with Kansas City and Dallas are optimistic about the wheat 
crop this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Atlanta and St. Louis say farmers intend to plant more cotton, rice, 
and soybeans this year. Atlanta adds that higher cotton and grain 
prices may bring some previously idled land back into production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although oil and gas prices have fallen from year-ago levels, they 
remain at a level high enough to encourage continued drilling and 
exploration, according to Kansas City and Dallas. Dallas says the 
industry is "healthy"; Kansas City reports that the rig count, while 
down from the February level, is higher than a year ago; Atlanta 
says domestic drilling is holding steady and that no change is 
expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Minneapolis says mining, especially for precious metals, remains 
strong. Atlanta and St. Louis both report increased coal exports. 
Forest product industries are also healthy, according to San 
Francisco and Minneapolis, although concern about environmental 
issues is causing uncertainty about expansion plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing remains weak in most parts of the nation, with multifamily 
activity relatively weaker than single-family activity. Although a 
recent weather-related increase in activity is noted by several 
districts, no signs of a sustained turnaround are evident. Housing 
prices remain generally sluggish and are reported by Boston and New 
York to be falling further; New York, however, indicates that price 
declines are confined to the New York metropolitan area. Real estate 
activity in Michigan has been weak also as a result of softness in 
the auto industry. Pockets of strength in real estate are reported 
in Minneapolis-St. Paul, in parts of California, and in upstate and 
western New York. Although industry representatives expect some 
improvement in 1990, most anticipate a slow year, with sales 
dampened in part by tighter credit standards imposed by banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential activity is mixed. In Atlanta, the office market 
remains "subdued," New York says the pace of leasing is good (but 
that renters are getting significant concessions), and Dallas says 
the nonresidential market is weak. Atlanta and Philadelphia report 
strength in public construction projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is mixed across the nation; a majority of the 
districts report some improvement, or expectations of improvement, 
in the coming quarters. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
Dallas, and San Francisco all indicate that industrial activity is 
increasing. St. Louis says the sector is weak, while Boston and 
Philadelphia report mixed conditions. New orders and shipments are 
up in most districts, although no general upward pressure on 
industrial prices is noted. Those areas that mention inventories 
indicate that they are in line with expectations; no district report 
indicates that stock levels are excessive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chicago says auto production is leading the pickup, despite 
continued sluggishness in sales, and that all auto facilities are 
expected to be operating by the end of April. Cleveland agrees that 
the auto industry is rebounding, but says contacts in that region 
still expect second-quarter output to be lower than a year ago. 
Other strong industries include apparel (Atlanta), steel (Chicago), 
and various capital goods (Chicago). The commercial aerospace 
industry is also among the stronger industries in the Boston and San 
Francisco districts. Atlanta, however, says there is concern in the 
southeast that the industry may soon show weakness in that region as 
a result of possible Defense Department cutbacks. Several Districts 
say auto-related products are still in the doldrums.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the industrial sector is improving. Manufacturers in 
the Philadelphia region say they expect a pickup within six months 
and are planning to boost capital spending. Cleveland's report 
indicates that the "worst of the production cutbacks are over." 
Manufacturers in the Richmond area are also more optimistic; a 
recent survey indicates that developments in Eastern Europe are 
expected to give sales a push over the next two years, but that most 
businesses will benefit later rather than sooner.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales vary by district, but reports generally reflect slow, 
positive growth. Sales growth was strongest in the Cleveland, 
Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts and weakest in 
St. Louis and Dallas. Kansas City says sales are above year-ago 
levels but have been mixed recently. Philadelphia and Chicago note 
that sales gains in their areas have been achieved without resorting 
to promotions or markdowns. Retailers generally say inventories are 
in line with projected sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel has been an especially strong seller in most districts. Hard 
goods, such as furniture, appliances, and other household items, 
while strong in some areas, are contributing less to overall growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for consumer spending also varies by region, but 
retailers are generally looking for modest gains in 1990 as a whole, 
Boston merchants say 1990 will be "difficult," and contacts in 
Philadelphia say they are looking for niches; they do not anticipate 
a broad-based surge in sales this year. Only in St. Louis are store 
managers overtly pessimistic, expecting the softness noted in that 
region to continue throughout the year. There is some concern in 
several districts that unseasonably warm weather led to sales that 
were borrowed, in part, from the second quarter, and that second-
quarter sales will now suffer as a result. In addition, the 
uncertain outlook for the housing sector is blurring the outlook for 
sales of household goods and making many merchants cautious in 
developing projections.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are reported to be spotty but generally weak across the 
nation, and little improvement is expected in the near future. The 
profitability of auto dealers also varies. Atlanta reports that, 
while many dealers are increasing profits and some popular models 
are in short supply, some small dealers in rural areas have gone out 
of business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand varies by district but is generally flat. In 
Philadelphia and St. Louis, loan volume is higher, while San 
Francisco and Kansas City say volume is stable. Richmond reports a 
slight increase in problem loans. Activity in specific categories 
also varies by District. In Philadelphia, business loans, especially 
to manufacturers, are leading the growth noted there, while New York 
says business loans to retailers have been providing strength. In 
St. Louis, business loans in general have been growing, along with 
loans in other categories as well. However, most districts report 
that commercial real estate loans are down because of a number of 
factors: tightened lending requirements, more scrutiny by 
regulators, overbuilding in many markets, and locally sluggish 
economies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although virtually every District cites some specific cases of 
credit tightening by banks, with the most significant action taken 
by New England banks, there is little evidence of a general "credit 
crunch." Many banks have reviewed lending policies in recent months, 
cutting back on loans to the real estate industry and newer small 
businesses, or tightening up lending requirements by increasing 
collateral requirements or shortening loan terms. In addition, many 
builders are having a more difficult time securing financing because 
of the new lending limits in the thrift industry. Still, the 
majority of businesses say they have not seen any change in credit 
terms, and have not had trouble getting loans.
