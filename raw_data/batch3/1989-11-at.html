      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although economic activity in the Southeast has moderated in the 
past few months, there are few indications of any further slowing 
and most contacts expressed optimism for the remainder of the year. 
Manufacturing is continuing to show signs of strength in textiles 
and apparel, petrochemicals, and paper, while transportation 
equipment, construction and construction materials remain weak. 
Consumer spending remains relatively stable with most contacts 
indicating increases smaller than earlier this year and smaller than 
for the same period last year. Sales of household durables, 
especially furniture, continue to be soft with no improvement 
expected. While our contacts continue to mention substantial 
increases in the cost of health care benefits, most reported only 
modest wage or price pressures. Exporters, importers and port 
representatives agree that the recent rise in the value of the 
dollar has had and is likely to have little impact on economic 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts indicate no generalized wage pressures although a few cases 
of upward pressure for entry-level workers were mentioned. A survey 
of Nashville manufacturers revealed that some labor supply problems 
are beginning to appear for quality skilled workers, but they do not 
appear to be serious and have not resulted in wage pressures. A few 
manufacturers, however, indicated that the key to obtaining new 
workers seems to lie in the fringe benefits offered. Several 
contacts report trouble in finding skilled workers in trucking and 
engineering. In settling recent labor contracts, several firms 
reported that the cost of health care benefits remains high and is 
still increasing rapidly. They do not expect any slowing soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several manufacturers are reporting falling prices for inputs such 
as freight charges and raw materials. The price of resins used in 
plastic goods has fallen steadily this year and continues to 
decline. Other producers, specifically producers of paper products, 
are indicating stable input prices and note no change in the price 
of their final product in the past six months, with none expected 
for the rest of the year. In contrast, several land and air freight 
firms report a recent rise in fuel costs. An air freight firm 
revealed that jet fuel prices have risen unexpectedly recently, and 
several trucking firms noted increased fuel costs. Even so, major 
carriers and independents alike still feel compelled to offer 
discounts on freight rates of 30 to 40 percent. Price competition 
among freight carriers is reported to be fierce.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several bankers have reported that both consumer and business loan 
demand remain slow but slightly up from last month. Real estate and 
auto loans remain weak throughout the Sixth District. One banker in 
Atlanta pointed out that the slow commercial loan demand reflects 
caution on the part of business given the uncertain economic 
outlook. Loan quality seems to be improving as banks establish 
tighter loan standards, particularly for real estate development.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in Alabama and Tennessee are holding up well, and 
Florida retailers report that sales are quite strong. Strength is 
apparent for apparel and nondurable goods; demand for big ticket 
items is slow. A furniture retailer reports that sales have fallen 
recently and are down seven percent from a year ago. This is unusual 
because October is normally a strong month. Smaller retailers in 
Miami, however, say that sales were slow all summer and remain so. 
Auto sales have been weak for the past several months across the 
Southeast, and while some dealers said that sales recently were 
unexpectedly strong because of rebates and other incentives, they 
added that these additional sales had probably come at the expense 
of sales next year. A few dealers noted that sales of domestic autos 
had been stronger than of foreign autos.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Office and residential construction has been slow across the 
Southeast for most of this year, and builders expect no pickup soon. 
Bankers report that real estate loans have been growing slowly. 
Builders in Nashville report a five year supply of houses, although 
they say that vacant office space is being absorbed and the supply 
is now below two years. Although the housing market is also slow in 
Florida, demand for homes above $500,000 is still very strong. A 
builder in Birmingham pointed out that most industrial buildings are 
full and that he is planning to build several on speculation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers still are willing to expand capacity in the Sixth 
District. A large paper firm in Louisiana has announced a 
substantial modernization program to begin next year, while a new 
textile plant will be opening on the site of a plant abandoned in 
1986. Several chemical firms in Louisiana and Florida have recently 
announced plans to expand existing plants next year. Although the 
oil and gas industry has started to turn around, firms supplying 
drilling equipment are still delaying plans to expand capacity until 
the strength of the industry's recovery becomes clear.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Exports, Imports, and the Dollar
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Few contacts have reported that the recent fluctuations in the value 
of the dollar have affected their businesses much. A shipper of 
grains and soybeans noted that foreign subsidy programs had more 
impact on trade than did changes in the value of the dollar. A 
dealer in chemicals and fertilizers added that foreign restrictions 
on trade were more important in determining his volume of exports 
than were exchange rate fluctuations. An exporter of sugar said that 
the dollar's appreciation has had no effect on his volume of trade. 
A producer of plastic containers does not expect the higher dollar 
to affect his business.
