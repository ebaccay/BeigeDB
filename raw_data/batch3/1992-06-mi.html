      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the District were generally steady. Labor 
markets continued to show signs of mild improvements. Retail sales 
continued to exhibit growth relative to last year's level, while 
home sales showed some signs of retrenchment after a very strong 
first quarter. Manufacturing was steady to positive in the District, 
while conditions in the construction sector were mixed with poor 
conditions in commercial construction offsetting the strong 
performance of residential construction. Conditions in both the 
agricultural and mining sectors were mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is some evidence that labor markets are modestly stronger. The 
latest reported unemployment rates were generally lower around the 
District. For example, in April, Minnesota's 5.0 percent 
unemployment rate was slightly below its year-ago level, but 
substantially below its March level. Directors report that more 
recent conditions in labor markets continue to show signs of 
improvement. There is also some evidence that labor markets will 
continue to improve. A recent survey of business intentions in 
Minnesota indicated that while slightly fewer firms were planning to 
increase employment than a year ago, fewer firms were planning 
reductions. On net the reduction in declines outweighed the decrease 
in expansions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price and wage increases are reported to be moderate with the 
exception of medical costs and, in parts of the District, 
construction costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending around the District is generally moderate with 
some areas of strength. Major retailers in the District reported 
sales increases among comparable stores in May ranging from 5 to 9 
percent relative to a year ago. Canadian shopping continues to be 
generally strong in areas close to the border, with retail outlets 
in shopping malls reporting year-to-date sales increases of 17 to 30 
percent. However, at least with regard to appliance sales, recent 
new regulations on appliance sales and service by the Canadian 
government are reported to be having some effect on discouraging 
appliance sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales were mixed in May and ranged from up 20 percent to 
down 12 percent relative to a year ago. New truck sales in May 
ranged from up 1 percent to up 14 percent relative to levels of a 
year ago. Auctions of "nearly new" fleet cars are reported to be 
particularly strong in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, attracting 
many bidders and sometimes aggressive bidding. Dealers are generally 
optimistic about new car and truck sales for the remainder of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home sales which were generally quite strong in the first quarter, 
showed some downward adjustment in parts of the District. After a 
record-setting first quarter, used home sales in the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul area dropped 2.7 percent. However, the housing market is 
reported to be booming in parts of Montana, due in part to the 
continuing influx of wealthy out-of-state buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The summer vacation season is only just beginning, but indications 
are generally positive. Glacier National Park is already reported to 
be completely booked for the summer. Bridge crossings over the 
Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula set a record for April, up 
6.2 percent relative to a year ago. Recent changes in airfares are 
expected to have some positive impact through the summer months. 
However, this stimulus to tourism will be less felt in this District 
than in many others, since a high fraction of our District's 
tourists travel by auto.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction was generally strong in the District. 
Permits for single-family homes were up 18 percent in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area relative to a year ago. Some areas, such 
as Great Falls, Montana, report that rising building costs are 
restraining growth. Conditions in commercial construction were mixed 
with the important Minneapolis-St. Paul area continuing to show 
weakness due to the overhang of office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions continued to be steady in the District's manufacturing 
sector. The April level of average weekly hours in manufacturing in 
Minnesota of 40.0, while down slightly from the month before, was 
slightly above its year-ago level. The April level of Minnesota's 
average hourly earnings in manufacturing was up two-tenths of one 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions were mixed in the agricultural sector. The North Dakota 
mid-April index of prices received on farm products was unchanged 
from its year-ago level with crop price increases of 6 percent 
offset by livestock price declines of 7 percent. Moisture conditions 
appear to be mixed in the District. North Dakota's pastures are 
greener than they have been in years, but continuing dry weather 
could change that, while parts of Montana and Minnesota report 
inadequate moisture. Farm land prices were mixed, with the January 
value of land and buildings up 4 percent in South Dakota and down 3 
percent in North Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the District's mining and lumber industries were 
mixed. While mining production generally remains steady, some prices 
have fallen. The price of copper is off by 9 percent since the first 
of the year. Oil production is generally lower in the District, 
though the number of active drilling rigs, while small, is up. 
Concern remains about the availability of timber to District saw 
mills.
