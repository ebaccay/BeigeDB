      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fourth District continues to improve 
slowly. Employment fell in March but there are some indications of a 
pickup in April. Retail sales strengthened in mid-April after a 
month of weakness. Car dealers report a temporary lull in sales. 
Manufacturing orders are strengthening but business is far from 
robust. The housing outlook is improving but builders remain very 
cautious. Business loan demand is flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ohio employment (s.a.) fell slightly in March, while the 
unemployment rate (s.a.) rose for the second consecutive month. The 
unemployment rate for Ohio rose to 9.2% (s.a.) in March, but is 
still below its year-ago level of 10.1% above the national level. A 
survey of manufacturing firms in the greater Cincinnati area reveals 
their employment increased slightly in March. The local index of 
leading economic indicators for Pittsburgh has been essentially flat 
from December through February, indicating little prospect for 
employment growth in the near term for that city. On the other hand, 
Cleveland's index of leading indicators recorded a large increase in 
January and a slight increase in February. A survey of Cleveland 
area manufacturers is validating the early-year growth in that index 
by suggesting that employment rose solidly in April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retail sales weakened in March and early April, but 
recovered markedly in mid-April. Most retailers report that their 
March decline was not as severe as the l.9% drop reported nationally 
and that the Ohio thrift problem has had no perceptible impact on 
their sales. They blame late tax refunds and unfavorable weather for 
recent slack. Retailers expect sales to recover strongly in the 
second quarter; improved weather has already boosted department-
store sales. In anticipation of strong demand, few prices were cut 
in March, and retailers plan even fewer price promotions for future 
months. Stores are largely pleased with their inventory positions, 
although some report inventories are slightly above desired levels 
because of weak March sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers report slightly lower sales, but expect this to be only 
a temporary lull in the strong trend of auto sales. They have been 
moving cars at minimal mark-ups and assert that high sales volume is 
a key factor in allowing them to price competitively. Dealers voice 
concern that factories cannot keep up with their demand for some 
popular smaller models and worry that this problem will grow as 
sales pick up again. Otherwise, most dealers are pleased with their 
inventory positions and plan to increase stocks over the next few 
weeks. All dealers remain confident that consumers will continue to 
assume debt to acquire new cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Local surveys of manufacturers indicate that new orders and 
production have improved from early in the year. However, firms are 
allowing raw-materials and finished-goods inventories to rise only 
very slowly. The chemical industry in southern Ohio continues to do 
well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Machine-tool producers in the District report that demand for 
machine tools is growing in the aerospace, defense, automotive, and 
power-generating equipment industries but remains weak in 
agriculture and construction machinery industries. A major producer 
of machine tools expects rising sales in the second half of 1985. 
Despite this growth, orders are weak relative to the previous peak 
and the firm estimates that 40% to 50% of metal-cutting machinery is 
now imported.
     </p>
     <p>
      The steel industry remains in difficulty. One District firm has 
narrowly averted bankruptcy proceedings, and reports losing money on 
its carbon steel operations despite operating its mill at 90% of 
capacity. Another has filed for protection under Chapter 11, and 
another recently laid off about 350 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major producers of capital goods believe spending on plant and 
equipment is not likely to be slower in the second half than the 
first half of 1985, despite the results of the recent survey of 
spending plans. Analysts in this District attribute the first 
quarter softness in PDE spending on computers to be a result of 
IBM's introduction of two new models, weakness in sales of personal 
computers, and a reaction to excessive levels of purchases in 1983 
and 1984. They expect a pickup in computer purchases this quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for housing in this District is more optimistic than a 
month ago. Market participants anticipate a moderate rebound in 
housing activity during the second and third quarters, but are not 
expanding their business operations, nor do they plan to do so even 
if housing activity sustains its strength for the next two or three 
quarters. The consensus mortgage rate outlook is that rates will 
retain relatively flat until autumn.
     </p>
     <p>
      A nationwide realty firm reports that listings and closings for 
existing homes in the first quarter matched last year' s record-
breaking first quarter pace, and in April exceeded March's higher-
than-expected level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Builders remain extremely cautious, as orders were down 10% to 15% 
in the first quarter. They have indicated that for the most part 
they will build only those houses for which they have firm orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fixed rate mortgages will remain popular with borrowers unless fixed 
rates rise substantially. Because of high rates of mortgage 
delinquencies and foreclosures, mortgage insurers recently raised 
down-payment requirements slightly and also raised premiums on 
insurance renewals. According to the experience of one lender, 
neither of these actions has materially affected customer ability to 
buy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District loan demand has been mixed. Loan outstandings in all major 
categories at District banks fell over the past month. Consumer 
installment loans registered the largest decline and business loan 
volume was down marginally. While lenders acknowledge the flatness 
of business loan demand they report fairly strong consumer loan 
demand. The general decline in consumer loans at banks is attributed 
to aggressive nonbank competition for auto loans rather than weak 
loan demand. Captive finance companies of some auto manufacturers 
have been offering below-market loan rates on several models. 
Contacts expects consumer loan demand to remain quite good and 
business loan demand to pick-up in the next few months.
