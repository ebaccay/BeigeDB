      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District business activity continues to improve. Consumer spending 
is stronger than retailers expected after the December buying spree, 
with spring apparel and household durables selling particularly 
well. Orders and production schedules for many manufacturers, 
including steel, autos, and capital goods, are higher this quarter 
than last. Increased production and orders have led some companies 
to rehire workers, but employment gains still lag far behind output 
growth. Lenders report an increase in credit-card use and mortgage 
refinancing, but little growth in business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales continue to be stronger than retailers 
expected, with sales reported to be 5% to 10% higher than last year 
at this time. The post-holiday performance has been particularly 
impressive because the companies interviewed have not been 
discounting prices heavily, as inventories of leftover winter goods 
are low and early orders for spring merchandise were conservative. 
Demand for spring fashions is significant, and consumers appear 
particularly interested in new design items as opposed to basic 
apparel. Retailers see this trend as indicating that consumers are 
moving beyond basic needs to more discretionary items. Durable 
goods, including high-end entertainment electronics, have also been 
moving well. Pittsburgh area retailers point to an improving new 
home market as a major source of increasing demand for household 
durables, such as furniture and appliances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Motor vehicle sales continue to improve, with truck sales faring 
better than autos and Big Three models outselling their foreign-
nameplate counterparts. Dealers say that sales are generally up over 
last year, but that improvement is gradual. Every dealer interviewed 
reports a favorable inventory position. Stocks vary widely between a 
60-to-120 days' supply, reflecting different stages of spring 
inventory buildup.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital goods producers generally anticipate continued and 
broadening strength in orders and production this quarter from last, 
with weakness mainly in the aerospace industry. Orders for 
industrial controls in January and February rose more than was 
expected late last year, but controls and instruments for the 
electric utility industry eased in January following the best 
quarter of the year last quarter. One producer suspected that some 
customers may be holding back on orders pending the outcome of 
energy tax legislation. Heavy-duty truck suppliers also report that 
orders during February are off the strong pace set during the last 
half of 1992. One supplier points to the effect of the proposed 
diesel fuel tax on marginal truck buyers as a reason for the 
slowdown in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto manufacturers anticipate a nearly 7% year-over-year improvement 
in U.S. motor vehicle sales during the first quarter of 1993. Most 
of the expected increase in demand continues to be in light trucks 
and sport/utility vehicles, although some of the newly designed car 
models are selling exceptionally well, according to industry 
sources. With dealer inventories well under control, factory orders 
have been rising with greater vehicle demand. The three U.S-based 
automakers expect March assemblies to meet schedules that call for 
an increase of more than 20 percent over a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      District steel producers report that the surge in new orders since 
late last year has continued into February, which has led to rising 
backlogs of unfilled orders and stretching out of deliveries. Some 
producers report that order books for flat-rolled steel producers 
for the first half of 1993 are virtually at capacity, and some mills 
are taking orders for June delivery. Auto and appliance producers 
have led the order surge, which has induced other steel customers to 
place their orders Steel industry respondents assert that a 
strengthening economy and a drop in steel imports have contributed 
to strong demand. Despite a steel price hike in January and another 
increase announced for April, price hedging is not believed to be 
much of a factor in the current market, according to some producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Few respondents report near-term plans to rehire or to add new 
workers, although a number of business officials indicate that they 
are more likely to increase hiring than to reduce their employment 
this year Nonetheless, employment gains have not matched output 
growth in many industries. For example, while manufacturers of 
industrial controls, truck components, and steel note a high level 
of operations in recent months, they are resorting primarily to 
outsourcing, extra shifts, and overtime to accommodate output growth 
instead of adding workers. One exception is the auto industry. As 
many assembly plants have increased their production schedules, most 
employees on temporary layoff have been recalled, and some 
facilities are hiring additional workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail employment followed normal layoff patterns after the holiday 
season, and most companies anticipate little more than replacement 
hiring for spring. However, several retailers have announced the 
opening of new stores and the expansion of existing outlets later 
this year, which will increase employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District lenders report that loan growth is still confined largely 
to consumer and mortgage loans. Some large banks report another 
strong month of consumer lending in January, which followed a spurt 
late last year. Several lenders note an increase in the use of 
credit cards and home equity lines of credit in recent months. Most 
lenders also report another surge in mortgage loan refinancing, 
although not yet as strong as early last year. Business loans are 
generally described as showing little growth because business firms 
have access to strong cash flows and to equity and capital markets.
