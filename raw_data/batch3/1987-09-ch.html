     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity continues to rise in the Seventh District, and 
further expansion is expected. Total employment growth in the five 
District states, seasonally adjusted, about matched that in the U.S. 
during this year's first half. Chicago area help-wanted ads in the 
first half were well ahead of a year earlier. Reports from this 
bank's directors in August, overall were the most optimistic since 
at least the early 1980s. District purchasing managers see continued 
strong expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, auto sales have remained persistently below last year 
and resulting production cuts and layoffs are particularly affecting 
industrial activity in southeast Michigan. Purchases of machinery 
have been mixed. Steel demand remains vigorous. Nonresidential 
construction activity, overall, appears about even with last year in 
the District, but has slowed in some areas. Residential construction 
and resales have slowed. Large District retail chain stores indicate 
only small gains in July sales compared with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Managers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Chicago and Milwaukee purchasing managers for July show 
strong gains in production, orders, and backlogs, lengthening lead 
times, and rising prices. Suppliers are increasingly able to make 
announced price increases "stick." Reports from Chicago purchasers 
in the first half of August indicate another strong month, with 
orders up sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Temporary and indefinite auto production cutbacks and layoffs, in 
response to continued slower sales, are having wider effects in 
parts of the District where the industry is heavily concentrated, 
particularly southeast Michigan. This slowdown is partly offset by 
increased demand for trucks, including both light models bought 
partly by consumers and larger trucks. Although Michigan 
manufacturing employment in June was 3 percent below a year earlier, 
the only District state to show a decline over this period, 
nonmanufacturing employment there was 4 percent higher, a larger 
gain than for the U.S. or the District as a whole. Lower Michigan
factory employment in the latest year mainly reflects auto industry 
and related cuts. Sharply lower auto production in July reduced high 
inventory levels closer to normal levels. Model year-end cut-rate 
financing and rebates are expected to cut stocks further, though 
reports indicate that consumer response has been restrained. A major 
uncertainty overhanging District automakers is the outcome of labor 
negotiations currently underway at GM and Ford.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Machinery
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Markets are mixed for types of machinery with substantial production 
in the District. Demand for diesel engines for use in trucks is 
strong. Shipments of truck trailers have increased. Orders have 
risen for diesels used in some other industrial applications. Orders 
for railroad engines, however, are almost nil. Buying of railcars is 
up, but still low. A steel producer reports higher demand from 
makers of construction equipment and pressure vessels used in 
chemical process industries. Machine tool buying is weak, but an 
industry source views an upturn as imminent. Production of parts, 
shifted abroad when the dollar strengthened in the first half of the 
1980s, is being brought back to the U.S.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Farm Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unit sales of farm equipment remain sluggish, although concessional 
terms to cut inventories strengthened tractor sales this summer. 
Unit sales of farm tractors were 32 percent above the very low year-
earlier level in July, mostly reflecting inventory paring efforts by 
a major District manufacturer. August sales are also expected to 
show a large gain as another manufacturer introducing a new line is 
offering discounts of up to 50 percent on a large inventory of old 
models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District sheet steel production continues strong. A contact 
expressed concern about possible future shortages of some types of 
sheet steel. Demand for structurals and bars remains at a high 
level. Plate is on allocation, reflecting improved demand as well as 
capacity shut down when the market was soft. In response, a large 
Chicago-area plate mill is being restarted. Inventory rebuilding has 
been an important element in the strength of steel markets this 
year, following the six-month work stoppage at USX. However, 
analysts disagree on the relative importance of restocking versus 
improved final sales in the upturn in steel. Demand has improved 
from various steel users. The fall in the dollar has made domestic 
steel competitive with Japanese and European steel not only in U.S. 
markets but also abroad, though American exports of steel are 
restrained by trade barriers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Work on new office buildings remains vigorous in downtown Chicago, 
and more announcements of new buildings are expected. Several hotels 
are underway or planned. Commercial building activity in suburban 
areas has slowed considerably over the past year. Heavy August rains 
and flooding delayed projects. A $225 million steel mill will be 
built in Indiana, the state's second major new mill announced in the 
past year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Sales and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Markets for new homes and resales in the District slowed in response 
to the jump in mortgage interest rates in the second quarter. Most 
reports indicate that activity continues slower. Construction of 
houses is expected to be at a good level for the year, but below 
1986. Multifamily construction has fallen sharply due to adverse 
effects of last year's tax law changes. The inventory of houses for 
sale is low, suggesting that resales will continue below strong 
1986. Chicago area housing prices are estimated to be 10-12 percent 
higher than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Large District retailers report small increases in the dollar volume 
of sales in July, compared with a year earlier. Weakness continued 
in early August. A survey of Illinois department and specialty 
stores showed moderately higher July sales than a year earlier, but 
smaller gains than earlier this year. The late Labor Day is expected 
to shift sales from August to September.
