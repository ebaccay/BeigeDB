      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 2, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reports on business activity in the District indicate continued 
strength. So far this year, total payroll employment in the five 
states has trended upward at a somewhat slower pace than in the 
nation, mainly due to first quarter layoffs at auto makers and 
suppliers. Production cuts and stronger sales cleared excess car 
inventories, and were followed by increases in production. 
Purchasing managers in Chicago reported strong gains in activity 
through June, with widespread price increases. Reports are similarly 
robust from contacts in various industries, with the main exception 
being office and residential construction. Steel demand continues 
strong, reflecting the rise in auto production, improved markets for 
a wide range of equipment, and vigorous demand for construction 
steel reflecting in part rising industrial construction. Severe 
drought, relieved by scattered rains in mid-July, has
caused serious problems for many farmers and adversely affected 
agricultural suppliers. Production cuts, or the possibility of cuts, 
resulting from low water supplies have been reported in a few other 
industries, including papermaking and petroleum refining, but do not 
appear to be widespread.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of cars have exceeded the expectations of many forecasters. 
The first half sales rate outpaced sales in all of calendar year 
1987, though trailing 1986. Inventories are in good balance. 
Production is expected to stay relatively strong in the second half. 
Truck sales have trended upward and are likely to exceed 5 million 
units, a record, for all of 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production of steel is slowing in the third quarter to allow for 
needed maintenance and to keep output in line with seasonal 
slowdowns at customers' plants. Robust orders should support a high 
level of output over the rest of the year. Sales at steel service 
centers, which have been growing very strongly, are slowing less 
than usual at this time of year. Shipments of steel to motor vehicle 
makers are expected to stay strong. Purchasing by other consumer 
goods makers is holding up well. Demand from some equipment makers 
is the strongest since before the 1981-82 recession. Orders for 
construction steel continue robust, overall, helped by the upturn in 
factory construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers of various types of equipment are seeing good demand 
for their products. Some machinery makers report double-digit 
increases in orders and backlogs, with particularly large increases 
in sectors which had been depressed. Orders for metal-cutting 
machine tools this year have been about double the year-earlier 
pace, though still well short of the high levels of the late 1970s 
and 1980. The upturn is broad-based and inquiries suggest that 
further gains in orders are likely. Railcar orders are up sharply 
after having been very depressed since collapsing in the early 
1980s. A lift truck manufacturer is shifting some production from a 
European plant to Illinois. Makers of other materials handling 
equipment, food industry machinery, and other types of business 
equipment have seen sizable gains in orders. Demand is described as 
very good for various types of fabricated metal parts. Consumer 
goods sales are holding up well, including appliances as well as 
other types—buying of boat trailers, for example, is quite strong. 
However, there are indications that the recent strengthening in 
agricultural equipment is starting to abate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity in the District this year is at a fairly high 
level but shows signs of slowing. Contracts for residential 
construction (measured in square feet) in the first five months were 
15 percent below a year earlier in the five states. The sharpest 
year-over-year declines occurred early in the year, reflecting 
adverse weather, but contracts in the spring continued below a year 
earlier. Pouring of concrete at Chicago-area residential 
construction sites this summer is reported to be at a good pace but 
below last spring despite favorable weather. Nonresidential 
construction contracts in the first five months were 5 percent lower 
in District states. In contrast, shipments of gypsum board in the 
District states for five months were 1 percent higher than last 
year, reflecting finishing work on structures begun earlier. Chicago 
office building construction, still at a high level, is described as 
having slowed somewhat, bringing the market for office space into 
better balance. The industrial real estate market and construction 
of factories and warehouses have strengthened. Work on highways and 
streets in the District will be strong this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With no respite until recently from extremely dry and hot 
conditions, prospects for this fall's crops deteriorated sharply. 
Hot weather throughout much of the Midwest, coinciding with the 
start of the pollination state for the corn crop in early July, 
inflicted irreversible damage. Estimates of the resulting reductions 
in per acre yields, however, are still subject to considerable 
uncertainty. Scattered rain and cooler temperatures beginning in 
mid-July appear to have halted the deterioration in corn condition 
ratings in much of the District. Soybeans remain under stress but 
the improved weather will temper the overall decline in production. 
During June, most of the irreversible damage was concentrated on 
spring wheat, barley, oats, and hay. In addition, the grazing 
capacity of range and pasture land was seriously depleted and 
vegetables in the Great Lakes region, an important source of 
processing supplies, were hit hard.
