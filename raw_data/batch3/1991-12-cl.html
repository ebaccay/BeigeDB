      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District respondents revised downward their expectations for growth 
this quarter and next, but still do not expect a double-dip 
recession. Retail sales continue to be mixed and generally flat, and 
retailers remain cautious about sales, inventory, and employment 
prospects for the holiday season. Growth in manufacturing in the 
District may slow, as a result of trimmed auto production schedules, 
but capital goods producers note an increase in orders in October. 
Bank loans continue to be sluggish, except for mortgage refinancing 
and home equity loans, despite lower lending rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Fourth District panel of economists from manufacturing, trade, 
and financial services remains cautiously optimistic that the 
national economy will continue on a slow growth path, despite an 
apparent stalling in recent months. The panel of 25 economists who 
met at this Bank on October 25 predicted a 3 percent real GNP growth 
between 1991:IVQ and 1992:IVQ, and an inflation rate of 3.1 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      A telephone survey of most of the Roundtable members in late 
November shows a downward revision to real GNP growth to about a 1 
percent annual rate this quarter, and to about a 2 percent rate next 
quarter; however, but growth in the second half of 1992 has been 
revised upward to a 3 percent to 4 percent range. None of the 
respondents expects a double-dip recession, although a few 
acknowledge that growth in a zero to 1 percent range this quarter is 
possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several respondents cite a slower-than-expected recovery, and a 
common perception that the economy is still in recession, as causes 
for the deterioration in business and consumer sentiment in recent 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Latest information for the Fourth District is somewhat more 
encouraging than for the nation. Industrial production in Ohio rose 
again in September. In October, employment held steady, and the 
unemployment rate was again below the national average. Purchasing 
managers in Cleveland and Cincinnati report that orders and 
production strengthened in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers continue to cite a relatively flat level of sales over the 
past several weeks, with some department stores reporting somewhat 
better sales in October than in the summer, but others posting 
declines. Sales of major appliances, furniture, and home electronics 
products fell in October and early November, but sales of soft goods 
strengthened, according to several sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers remain cautious in their outlook for sales during the 
Christmas season. The expected improvement in sales ranges from zero 
to about 4 percent higher than a year earlier, with most of the 
strength in soft goods. A retail economist estimates that real 
consumer spending this quarter will increase at about a 1 percent 
rate from last quarter, with all of the increase in services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers have been cautious about inventories, but less-than-
expected sales growth, or even declines in some cases, have 
apparently resulted in larger-than-desired stocks, especially for 
hard goods and apparently for apparel. Consequently, retailers 
expect aggressive price promotions throughout the holiday season. 
Part-time hirings for the season are said to be much fewer than 
usual, which analysts warn will depress employment in November and 
December.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car dealers in the District report that November sales were 
slower than a year ago. As a result, most dealers have higher than 
desired inventories, and have cut factory orders for the balance of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of manufacturing activity in the District, which has been 
stronger than in the nation since the recovery began, is likely to 
abate, according to some forecasters. Auto production schedules are 
being trimmed, capital goods revival is still uneven, and businesses 
will keep inventory building below levels that are usual for this 
stage of recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      The revival in auto sales and production that began early this year 
has lost momentum in recent months. Automotive economists have 
lowered their estimates for both sales and output this quarter, and 
next, because the recent flattening in new car sales has left 
larger-than-desired inventories. Auto producers now forecast output 
at about 1.5 million cars this quarter and next. Total automobile 
and light truck sales this quarter are now estimated to fall a few 
percent from 1991:IIQ. Auto sources believe that significantly 
larger price incentives will be needed than at present in order to 
stimulate sales. Bank lending rates are reported to have been 
lowered in recent weeks, but with little effect on sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      The surge in real producers' durable equipment output last quarter 
was unexpected by capital goods respondents, who look for a much 
reduced pace this quarter. Orders for recently introduced new 
computer machinery were disappointing, according to a producer. Some 
believe that a strike in the construction machinery industry will 
dampen output for the next few months. A large parts supplier for 
heavy-duty trucks reports that new orders rose strongly in October, 
following a mixed but slowly rising trend since early this year. 
Several small business equipment producers in northern Ohio note a 
marked pickup in business in both September and October. A hand tool 
producer reports that October was the second best shipment month in 
recent history. A supplier of plastic parts for commercial aircraft 
and a small machine tool builder also report that October orders 
were the best in several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel operations have been reviving gradually to about 80 percent of 
capacity from 70 percent earlier in the year. Order books for flat-
rolled steel products are full through 1992:IQ, and operations are 
virtually at capacity, according to some sources. Output has been 
rising gradually, especially because of increased orders from the 
auto and appliance industries and from steel warehouses. Some 
rebuilding of steel inventories is occurring, but steel sources are 
apprehensive about how long the present level of operations will be 
sustained because orders appear to have leveled out. They are also 
concerned about whether the auto industry will take delivery of all 
of the orders now on the books in view of the trimming of auto 
production schedules.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Large and small commercial banks in the District report no pickup in 
new loans in recent weeks, either for commercial and industrial 
loans or for total loans. A large bank notes that loan activity, 
while little changed from September, was better than during the 
summer months. Large and small banks have had a surge in mortgage 
refinancing, which one lender described as being at capacity, and 
home equity loans have also been rising sharply. Recent declines in 
mortgage interest rates, to about an 8 percent to 8-1/2 percent 
range for 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, are believed to have come too 
late in the season to strengthen housing sales, but some thrifts 
report a burst in new loan activity in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most bankers contend that credit remains available to creditworthy 
borrowers, and that lending standards have neither tightened nor 
eased in recent months. Some large banks are still restricting loan 
growth because of possible losses that would affect their capital. 
Several small banks report constraint in lending, especially to 
gasoline stations, dry cleaning establishments, and auto garages 
because EPA and OSHA regulations place lenders at risk for 
compliance.
