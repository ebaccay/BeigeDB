      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 6, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on business activity in the District generally indicate 
solid expansion into the second half of 1988, though the rate of 
rise in activity appears to be less rapid than in the first half. 
Upward pressures on prices continue. Manufacturers in this region 
have been helped greatly by the strengthening in demand for capital 
equipment. Better-than-expected consumer spending for motor vehicles 
continues to support upward-revised production plans at plants in 
the District. Sales of major appliances have stayed near last year's 
record pace. Construction activity, in the aggregate, appears to be 
slowing. The drought has adversely affected the farm sector and some 
nonagricultural industries but boosted activity in a few other 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment growth in the District states through this year's first 
half was somewhat slower than the nation in part reflecting first 
quarter layoffs at auto assembly and parts plants. Unemployment has 
been below 5 percent of the labor force in Indiana and near 4 
percent in Iowa and Wisconsin. Illinois and Michigan rates have been 
above other District states and the nation. Labor markets have 
tightened in parts of the District but wage gains generally remain 
restrained, with some firms seeking concessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of domestic cars have remained strong, and domestic truck 
sales have set a record pace. The industry has been boosting 
production schedules to meet demand, following cuts earlier this 
year. Car assemblies in calendar year 1988 are projected about even 
with 1987, and truck production is expected to be highest ever. A 
large domestic producer assembling trucks on overtime is reported to 
be looking into expanding capacity, possibly using recently 
shuttered plants of another producer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production of steel slowed seasonally during the summer but is 
expected to come back strong. Some scheduled maintenance has been 
deferred in order to keep output at a high level. Mill shipments for 
the year are projected highest since 1981. Among steel's major 
markets, domestic motor vehicle production has been revised upward 
this year; demand for steel from machinery makers has increased 
considerably; plant investment is rising in chemical process 
industries—paper, chemicals, petrochemicals, and refineries; and 
construction steel has stayed strong. Steel mill inventories are 
thought to have risen in July but are not excessive. Steelmakers in 
the District are investing in projects to boost quality and 
productivity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Manufacturing Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for a wide range of machinery types continues to rise, in 
many cases from low levels. Increased costs for materials are 
squeezing profit margins, however. Machine tool orders are double 
the year-ago pace. Railcar orders have doubled and backlogs have 
tripled. Demand for truck trailers is expected to stay strong, about 
at last year's pace. Construction machinery sales have improved 
sharply, encouraging investments in upgrading manufacturing plants. 
Major home appliance shipments are expected to be second-highest 
ever this year, 4 percent below 1987. Recreational vehicle sales are 
projected 8 percent above last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity is at a fairly high level in the District, but 
segments of the industry are slowing and further slowing appears in 
prospect. Contracts for construction of nonresidential buildings, in 
square feet of floor space, were 5 percent lower in the first half 
than a year earlier in District states. Residential construction 
contracts were 11 percent lower. In contrast, first half shipments 
of gypsum board in District states were 1 percent higher than a year 
earlier, reflecting finishing work on projects begun earlier. 
Apartment construction is weak, and home building has also started 
to slip. Further slowing is expected in response to higher mortgage 
interest rates. Industrial building is strong in the District. 
Office construction remains strong in downtown Chicago, though below 
the record pace of recent years, and also has been strong in other 
District cities including Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee. 
Office construction is slowing in suburban Chicago, and is expected 
to slow in downtown Indianapolis. Total Detroit area nonresidential 
construction probably peaked last year. Some types of public works 
construction are very active including streets and highways.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Apparel sales, particularly fall merchandise, were hurt by hot 
weather in July after a stronger performance in June. Markdowns were 
described as widespread, depressing dollar volumes. Contacts 
expressed concerns about overbuilding of retail space in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Drought Effects
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The drought, relieved somewhat by increased rainfall and cooler 
weather in recent weeks, has cut crop yields sharply and pared farm 
equipment sales. Barge traffic was cut by low water levels, helping 
rail and Great Lakes transport alternatives to barges. Other 
industries which gained as a result of the drought include pump 
manufacturers and well drilling. The absence of rain earlier in the 
summer allowed construction projects to proceed ahead of schedule. 
Demand for farm equipment, grain storage facilities, and landscaping 
supplies and services may come back strong next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop losses due to the drought were sharper in the District than in 
the nation. The USDA estimates year-to-year declines of 42 percent 
in District states' corn production and 27 percent in soybeans. 
Higher feed costs have squeezed livestock producers' margins. 
However, recent disaster assistance legislation will cushion adverse 
drought effects on crop and livestock farmers. District farmland 
values rose during the second quarter but more slowly than in the 
previous four quarters. Although the District as a whole was up 1 
percent from three months earlier, gains were not reported in all 
five states. Contacts were less optimistic than earlier about the 
near-term trend in farmland values.
