      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District developments remain soft to mixed. Sales results 
were very uneven among District department stores during April and 
May. Homebuilders are hopeful that an upturn in the existing home 
market will soon spur increased demand for new homes. Office leasing 
activity remains somewhat sluggish and vacancy rates have continued 
to rise. The May unemployment rate rose in New Jersey but edged down 
in New York. Senior loan officers at small and mid-sized banks 
reported flat overall demand for consumer loans is moderate to weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results at District department stores were mixed during April 
and May. Some contacts noted an improvement with sales better than 
planned while others reported continued sluggishness. Over-the-year 
changes in April ranged from -7.8 percent to +5.0 percent and in 
May, from -2.0 percent to +6.5 percent with stores fairly evenly 
divided as to gains and declines. Women' s clothing and accessories 
sold well at most stores in April as did cosmetics and men's 
sportswear. Respondents with better-than-anticipated May sales 
attributed much of the gain to unseasonably warm weather, noting 
that the fastest-selling items were swimwear, weekend wear, sandals 
and other summer apparel. The pattern for home furnishings was mixed 
in both April and May, with one chain noting a pickup after several 
slow months but others experiencing further slackness.
     </p>
     <p>
      Due to tight monitoring and, in some cases, to better-than-expected 
sales, inventories are generally at comfortable levels, though one 
chain reported a level somewhat above plan. Contacts remain cautious 
about the outlook for consumer spending citing the uncertainties 
about the course of the economy as well as the possibility that 
May's strength may represent sales borrowed from June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Interest on the part of potential buyers is reportedly strong in 
much of the District as a result of lower home prices and mortgage 
rates, but apparently its initial effect has been primarily on the 
resale market. Homebuilders are hopeful that this upturn in the 
existing home market will soon spur increased demand for new homes 
from sellers wanting to move up. The New York State Association of 
Realtors noted that, for the first time in five years, existing home 
sales increased from February to March north of New York City, and 
the Buffalo area reported an 11 percent over-the-year increase in 
April resales. Recently in Manhattan there were, for the first time, 
auctions of condominium and cooperative apartments; in the suburbs, 
this technique has been used quite successfully in the past couple 
of years to reduce surplus stocks of new single-family homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity has remained somewhat sluggish in recent 
weeks and additional space continues to be marketed due to new 
completions and further consolidations and restructuring. As a 
result, office vacancy rates have been rising in many parts of the 
District. At the end of the first quarter, the vacancy rate in the 
15 northern New Jersey counties, for example, averaged more than 22 
percent, up almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier. Over-
the-year increases of 2 percentage points or more were common in 
several other areas such as Long Island, Westchester County and 
Manhattan. Vacancy rates in Manhattan are reportedly at their 
highest levels since the 1970s.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing firms contacted in the District report continued weak 
sales with none anticipating any significant turnaround until late 
summer or fall, at the earliest. A producer of construction 
equipment sees the weakness spreading as the anemic housing and 
government sectors have been joined in recent months by a noticeable 
slowing in demand from the auto industry. A small producer of 
electric machinery was the only firm reporting a jump in sales, but 
the pickup has only been enough to bring sales up to year-ago 
levels. Exports were frequently reported to be growing faster than 
domestic sales, although more than half of the firms contacted felt 
their export growth rate is declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents have lowered their prices in recent months to shore 
up sales, but none plan to offer large price discounts in the near 
future. Half of the firms surveyed have reduced their employment 
levels significantly in recent months in the face of weak demand but 
plan no further significant layoffs over the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The May unemployment rate rose in New Jersey to 6.8 percent from 6.5 
percent in April (seasonally adjusted), but edged down in New York 
State to 7.4 percent after a 0.7 percentage point jump in April. 
Unemployment rates in the District are no longer below the national 
average as they had been for several years and employment has been 
growing much more slowly than nationally in recent years. This trend 
primarily reflects layoffs and consolidations in New York City and 
on Long Island as well as sluggishness in northern New Jersey. 
Upstate New York had been registering sizable employment gains until 
the recession began. Budgetary problems that continue to plague 
local and state governments in much of the District cast a shadow on 
the employment outlook. Some 80 New York City workers were recently 
notified that they may be laid off by July 1 and both New York State 
and New Jersey continue to mention the possibility of cutbacks of 
state employees. In an attempt to forestall layoffs as well as 
higher taxes, Bridgeport, Connecticut is filing for protection from 
creditors under Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      The April surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
showed somewhat conflicting patterns. In the Buffalo survey, 84 
percent of firms reported stable to improved new orders in April, up 
from 72 percent in March. In Rochester, however, although fewer 
firms noted a worsening in April than in March, the 26 percent that 
did see a deterioration was still almost four times greater than in 
February.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District reported that overall demand for consumer loans 
is moderate to weak. The majority of respondents also noted that 
demand for consumer installment loans is lower than a year ago. Most 
bank officers characterized the growth of automobile, credit card, 
and home equity loans over the last three months as slow to flat. 
Those banks that typically offer lines of credit on home equity 
reported that commitment fees have not changed in the last three 
months. Most bankers said current home equity lending is mainly to 
new borrowers rather than takedowns on existing credit lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      The majority of respondents noted a slowdown in payment schedules 
for all types of consumer loans, though a few stated that the 
slowing was confined to automobile loans. However, most officers 
stated that outstanding balances are not rising and indicated that 
delinquencies are unchanged from three months ago. Several 
respondents noted some decline in the creditworthiness of borrowers 
due to high levels of debt, layoffs, and reductions in salaries. 
Nonetheless, two thirds of all respondents stated that, compared to 
three months ago, their institution is just as willing to extend 
credit for consumer installment loans.
