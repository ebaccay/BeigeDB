      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent reports from businesses, trade associations and the results 
of a variety of surveys indicate that economic expansion slowed in 
the Seventh District in March and early April, but contacts' 
expectations for renewed growth in coming weeks were guardedly 
optimistic. Most retail and housing industry contacts stated that 
bad weather curtailed sales growth in recent weeks. Little change 
could be detected in the pace of expansion in manufacturing 
activity, and manufacturers seemed comfortable with modestly rising 
inventory levels. Price increases proceeded at a somewhat faster 
pace in recent months, due at least in part to improvement in 
demand. Weather conditions have delayed spring plantings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity Indicators
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An underlying upward trend in purchasing managers surveys around the 
District generally remained intact in recent months, although 
results were increasingly mixed. The overall index for the Chicago 
survey slipped slightly in March, but remained at a level consistent 
with expansion in manufacturing activity. The production components 
of the Milwaukee and Detroit surveys continued to climb in March, 
and these indicators have reached and exceeded pre-recession levels. 
Purchasing managers surveys in Western Michigan signaled modest to 
moderate improvement in March, in line with results for the first 
two months of the quarter. Led by the auto sector, an index of 
business activity in the Detroit area rose to a record high in 
March, and the unemployment rate for the Detroit area has fallen 
significantly over the last year. An index of business conditions in 
a purchasing managers' survey in Iowa also continued so climb in the 
first quarter, reaching its highest level in five years. An informal 
survey of a variety of small manufacturing, construction, and 
service firms in the District indicated that respondents were 
largely upbeat with respect to appraisals of current conditions as 
well as expectations for future activity, although several firms 
expressed concern about the recent slump in measures of consumer 
confidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption and Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retail and housing industry contacts reported that unrelenting 
poor weather joined with renewed consumer uncertainty, especially 
about taxes. to dampen sales in March and early April. Continued 
gains in retail sales of nonseasonal merchandise and increased 
activity during breaks in the weather supported their expectations 
for renewed growth in coming months, however. A large retailer 
stated that sales growth was held back by concern over potential tax 
increases, uncertainty about the impact of withholding changes, a 
payback following aggressive promotion of credit sales in the 
previous quarter, and "some of the soggiest weather in our history." 
Sales reportedly surged, however, on several days when the weather
broke. This contact also noted that sales of nonseasonal items 
continued to strengthen in recent months, helping to offset weakness 
in spring apparel, and sales of furniture and housewares posed a 
double-digit increase in the first quarter on a same-store basis, 
reaching a record level. Another large retailer reported that credit 
utilization continued to rise even though sales slowed in March (on 
a seasonally adjusted basis), and sales rebounded in April, led by 
durable goods and apparel. A large shopping center reported that 
total sales increased (on a year-over-year basis) in March and early 
April. After a lengthy dormant period for sales of spring 
merchandise, this contact expected a burst in sales with the first 
sustained period of nice weather, but noted that it hadn't occurred 
yet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from bankers indicated that residential mortgage loan demand 
remained fairly strong, with continued relative strength in 
refinancing. A large homebuilder, however, expressed some 
frustration about a loss of momentum in traffic and sales in March, 
citing a reemergence of political uncertainty in addition to the bad 
weather. A report from an association of realtors indicated that 
closings slowed in the first quarter of 1993 on a seasonally 
adjusted basis, after a large increase in the fourth quarter last 
year. A report from a large realtor also indicated that transaction 
volume slowed in March, but activity seemed to pick up some momentum 
in April. This realtor stated that "the market is still pretty 
active," citing continued optimistic attitudes among salespeople.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from manufacturers and industrial trade associations 
indicated little change in the steady upward trend in District 
manufacturing activity, although pockets of weakness remained. Sales 
of electricity to industrial customers in March were significantly 
above the year-earlier period, according to one utility, largely due 
to strength in sales to the auto industry. One automaker reported 
that production of light trucks has been bumping up against capacity 
limits. Two producers of molds used in automobile production were 
experiencing a marked upturn in demand, which was attributed to 
increased optimism about sales prospects in future model years. An 
automaker reported that car sales strengthened significantly in the 
first twenty days of April, after some loss of momentum in March. A 
bank reported that auto loan volume rose an April, after softening 
in the first quarter. Among respondents to the purchasing managers' 
surveys in Western Michigan, above-average strength was reported for 
producers of capital equipment, and auto parts manufacturers are 
still doing somewhat better than firms in most other industries. An 
association of electronics manufacturers reported that orders in the 
first quarter ran at the highest level in the past five years, and 
an association of home appliance producers reported a record level 
of domestic shipments for a variety of products in March. One 
appliance producer expected a record year for retail sales of 
appliances (in units) in 1993. Weakness has lingered in several 
manufacturing sectors in the District, however. A large diversified 
manufacturer reported that orders for oilfield and airline 
equipment, which had been weak for some time, fell off significantly 
further in March. Retail sales of farm equipment in the first 
quarter were slightly below soft year-earlier levels. New 
strengthening was evident in one previously weak sector, however, as 
a large manufacturer of construction equipment reported that sales 
into commercial construction markets have been rising rapidly in 
recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices of a variety of commodities and final products have been 
increasing at higher rates in recent months, due at least in part to 
increased demand. The price components of several District 
purchasing managers' surveys rose in recent months. The director of 
two purchasing managers' surveys in Western Michigan noted that more 
commodities were being reported in short supply and rising in price. 
On the other hand, a large retailer reported that consumer 
sensitivity to price remains high. A banker stated that inflationary 
expectations may remain relatively muted, noting that the upturn in 
plant and equipment spending among borrowers has not been 
generalized, but specific by industry sector, by companies within 
industries, and projects within companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent survey found that farmers in this District and elsewhere 
intend to reduce corn acreage moderately this year while holding 
soybean seedings close to last year's level. The combination of a 
late harvest last fall and the wet and cool weather conditions of 
this spring has significantly reduced the amount of fieldwork 
completed so far for this year's plantings. Developments in the next 
couple of weeks will be important as the first 10 days of May are 
generally considered the optimum planting time for most of the 
District's corn farmers. The delays experienced so far could be 
quickly overcome with the right weather conditions. Alternatively, 
continued delays could trigger a shift toward quicker-maturing (but 
lower-yielding) seeds and/or encourage a shift from corn to soybean 
acreage. Livestock producers have enjoyed unexpectedly high prices 
so far this year. In contrast to the continued year-over-year gains 
expected in red mea production, pork production was down nearly 3 
percent in the first quarter while beef production was down nearly 4 
percent. The unexpected declines stem partly from slower weight 
gains due to the poor quality of last year's corn crop and the harsh 
weather conditions confronting feedlot operators. With USDA reports 
continuing to show larger inventories of hogs and cattle, most 
analysts are expecting red meat production will move above year-earlier levels again this spring.
