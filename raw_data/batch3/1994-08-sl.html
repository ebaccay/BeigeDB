     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity continues to expand, as firms report 
sales increases, plant expansions and new hiring. The overall pace 
of activity, though, has moderated somewhat since the last report 
because of employee layoffs and firm reorganizations. Residential 
construction remains strong in most areas of the District, though 
rising interest rates are dampening activity in some areas. Total 
loans at a group of small and mid-sized banks continued to increase, 
though by less than they had earlier in the year. In general, crop 
conditions are favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District firms continue to report growth, although reports are 
slightly more mixed than previously. Sales increases were reported 
by numerous contacts. For example, contacts selling heavy 
construction-related equipment continue to report very strong 
demand, resulting in occasional shipping delays of up to eight 
weeks. In addition, they report that used equipment sales to Mexico 
have grown substantially since the passage of NAFTA. The upholstered 
furniture industry in northern Mississippi is booming, with 
expectations for more of the same. Auto parts manufacturers also 
report strong demand. In fact, some contracts have been turned down 
because demand exceeds plant capacity; plant expansions are expected 
to occur to correct this situation. One brick manufacturer reports a 
strong backlog and a continued positive outlook; expansion is under 
way to meet this demand. Hotel industry contacts report that hotels 
are finally seeing impressive gains in occupancy rates after years 
of decline, especially at all-suite and full-service properties.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the southern parts of the District, building supplies companies 
report that year-over-year sales are up more than 20 percent; year-
to-date sales are up 18 percent. A pallet producer reports year-to-
date sales are up 15 percent. Other manufacturers report year-to-
date sales increases of between 6 percent and 12 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms are recalling laid-off workers and hiring additional workers 
in all parts of the District. For example, a clothing manufacturer 
in Arkansas recalled 2,000 laid-off workers and reports that plants 
are operating at capacity. A jeans manufacturer will soon complete a 
new facility in Kentucky, employing 350 workers, with potential for 
250 additional workers if consolidation plans are realized. 
Northeast Mississippi is getting a new waste recycling facility, 
generating about 200 new positions. An aerospace firm is 
transferring production from Utah to an abandoned Mississippi 
facility, bringing 850 jobs. A nationally known discount store 
announced the opening of three supercenters in western Tennessee 
that will employ 1,800 people. An automaker announced it will 
continue to build a particular model at its current plant, saving 
1,100 jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some employee layoffs, firm reorganizations and sales declines 
occurred in the District as well. For example, a maker of medical 
products closed two divisions and laid off 500 workers, about 125 in 
St. Louis. Riverboat casinos in the St. Louis area have also laid 
off workers, partly because of the normal overhiring that occurs 
when they first open and partly because of the lack of traditional 
slot machines, which reduces attendance and makes the riverboats 
less competitive. A shoe manufacturer and a chemical company 
announced plant closings, together eliminating almost 300 jobs. A 
southern Illinois mining company is closing a mine and a preparation 
facility by late August, eliminating 200 jobs, because its major 
customer, wanting a lower-sulfur coal, will not renew its contract. 
A vehicle transmission manufacturer reports that year-to-date sales 
are down 13 percent. A contact in the paper products industry 
reports that year-over-year sales are down 5 percent; however, 
demand in this industry usually lags the rest of the economy by 
about one year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction continues to be a source of strength in the 
District. Single-family housing permits are still significantly 
above year-ago levels in most areas. Moreover, many areas 
experiencing strong economic growth, such as central and western 
Kentucky, report a shortage of available housing. Despite the 
overall strength, rising interest rates are beginning to affect some 
markets, like first-time homebuyers. One Little Rock contact 
described the housing market as brisk, but said the "buying frenzy" 
appears to be over.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets continue to improve. In Memphis, the 
office vacancy rate is at a six-year low, and industrial 
construction is headed toward a 10-year peak. Some District contacts 
expect multifamily construction, which has been dormant for several 
years, to pick up in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans rose from mid-May to mid-July at a sample of 91 small 
and mid-sized District banks, but by less than they had increased 
from mid-March to mid-May. Each major loan category-commercial and 
industrial, real estate and consumer-showed a similar trend: 
increasing, but not by as much as during the prior two-month period. 
Still, District banking contacts report loan demand is strong, and 
many are expressing concerns about liquidity problems because of 
inadequate deposit growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crops are in mostly good condition throughout the District. Moisture 
conditions vary considerably, however, with some areas needing 
rainfall, while other areas, especially the southern region of the 
District, are experiencing excessive precipitation. Contacts in 
several areas indicate that, unless adverse weather develops, bumper 
crops are possible. For example, record or near-record cotton and 
rice crops are expected in Mississippi. Arkansas' rice crop is 
expected to be largest in several years. The corn and soybean crops 
appear to be in good-to-excellent shape, with minimal pest problems. 
Above-average yields appear to have been the rule rather than the 
exception in most wheat-producing areas this summer. High 
temperatures in parts of Missouri and Arkansas have reportedly 
caused above-average poultry losses for some growers. Southern pine 
lumber mills report that year-to-date orders and production are 
running about 5 percent above last year.
