      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 10, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District remains generally sluggish 
While housing activity continues to be stronger than a year earlier, 
starts are expected to flatten or decline for the rest of the year. 
Retail sales are up slightly from a year earlier and some further 
improvement is expected. Auto dealers are not optimistic, however. 
Both retail inventories and manufacturers' inventories of materials 
inputs are generally regarded as satisfactory. Large additions to 
supplies of wheat, corn, and cattle on feed have occurred or are 
expected. Savings and loan institutions expect a leveling off of 
both mortgage demand and savings inflows. Loan demand at district 
commercial banks decreased in the past month while deposits 
increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that year-to-date sales are moderately better than 
levels established a year ago. Sales in coming months are expected 
to run slightly higher as well. Prices have been stable and are 
expected to remain stable. Inventories are generally satisfactory. 
No unusual sales or promotions are anticipated, and inventory 
purchases should be only slightly below last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most dealers report that auto sales have been slow during the last 
month. Financing is readily available, but favorable credit 
conditions have not stimulated sales. All dealers report that 
inventory levels are high. Most dealers are not optimistic that 
sales will improve in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, purchasing agents report slightly higher input prices, 
satisfactory inventory levels, and  adequate availability of 
materials. Most purchasing agents surveyed report that input prices 
are slightly higher than a year ago but are expected to remain 
stable for the remainder of the year. With some trimming behind 
them, firms are now satisfied with current materials inventory 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area homebuilders report starts of single family dwellings up over a 
year ago, with starts of multifamily dwellings also up but to a 
lesser degree. However, most homebuilders expect housing starts to 
remain flat or fall slightly during the remainder of the year. Sales 
of new homes are near year ago levels, and new home prices have 
remained steady. Builders generally report good availability and 
steady prices of materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan institutions have been experiencing slightly lower 
savings inflows compared to those of a year ago. Most expect savings 
inflows to remain flat in the near future. Demand for mortgage funds 
has been declining lately after large increases earlier in the year. 
Expectations are for a leveling off of mortgage demand in the near 
future. Mortgage interest rates have been falling slightly and are 
expected to continue to do so over the remainder of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's energy industry remains beset both by the substantial 
drop in world crude oil prices earlier this year and by recent price 
volatility. The average weekly number of operating drilling rigs in 
the District was 188 in July, compared with 550 in January and 200 
in June. Despite an agreement by OPEC members to cut output 
temporarily, domestic exploration and development activity is 
expected to remain depressed. The OPEC agreement has caused oil 
prices to firm in recent weeks, however, possibly stalling the 
decline in drilling and production in district states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Following a winter wheat harvest that was average to above average 
throughout the Tenth District, agricultural lenders report that most 
wheat farmers have been able to service operating loans on schedule. 
The rate of loan paydown has improved since last year except in 
northcentral Oklahoma, where wheat yields were well below average. 
Some farmers in this area are now refinancing operating debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Storage space for the wheat harvest was generally adequate. A severe 
shortage of storage space is expected to develop with the harvest of 
the milo and corn crops. Farmers unable to secure sufficient storage 
space for their crops will be forced to store grain in temporary 
facilities or to sell grain at very low harvest-time prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      District agricultural bankers report that the ranching industry 
remains depressed. Nonetheless, most cow-calf ranchers have been 
able to maintain solvency. Ranchers with adequate cash flow are 
expected to hold spring-born calves through the winter to be sold as 
yearlings next spring. Cattle feeding activity in the district has 
increased over that of one year ago, and feedlots are expected to be 
filled to capacity by yearend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at Tenth District banks fell during the past month, 
largely due to a decrease in commercial and industrial loans. 
Agricultural loans were also down slightly. Among the remaining loan 
categories, residential real estate loans rose while consumer and 
commercial real estate loans were flat. Most banks lowered their 
prime rate one-half percentage point and expect further declines. 
Consumer lending rates fell at one-half of the respondent banks and 
remained constant at the other half. Further changes in the near 
term were expected by one-half of the respondents and not expected 
by the other half. Deposits rose at the respondent banks, largely 
due to an increase in MMDA's. NOW and passbook savings accounts also 
rose slightly. Demand deposits, IRA's, large CD's, and small time 
deposits were flat.
