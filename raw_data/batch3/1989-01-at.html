      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 25, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The southeastern economy (especially the manufacturing sector) 
continues to perform well in part due to expanding exports. Most 
respondents are optimistic about prospects for 1989 and project 
capital spending to be at or above the 1988 pace. Although a 
majority of producers polled do not anticipate serious shortages or 
particularly large price increases this year, it promises to be a 
close call in some regional industries, for example primary metals 
and paper. Overall, added capacity in the region is expected to 
reduce supply bottlenecks that emerged last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Announcements of price increases were fairly widespread in December. 
However, that is normally the time when suppliers post higher prices 
for the year ahead. At this point, respondents expect that some of 
these will be trimmed or deferred because of buyer resistance. With 
modest additions to capacity during the latter half of 1988, 
expectations of product price increases in 1989 are below the pace 
seen in 1988 and range between 3 and 5 percent. Despite import 
quotas on many products and higher import prices, foreign 
competition is still reported to be an important limitation on price 
increases. Several contacts remarked that some important labor 
contracts are up for renewal; they expect wage increases in 1989 to 
turn out between 4 and 6 percent. Many report that double digit 
increases in employee medical insurance are adding significantly to 
labor costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      By and large, growth in exports of regional industries does not 
appear to have been affected by capacity constraints and there are 
few reports of delivery lags in meeting export orders. In many 
instances strong global markets have served to offset a slackening 
in domestic demand. At the same time, import levels have been 
unusually high in a few industries facing bottlenecks in production. 
New capacity coming on stream in 1989 is expected to increase 
domestic supplies and lower the general level of imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some southeastern industries such as home appliance and lumber 
manufacturers are projecting slower growth in 1989 as a result of 
the flatness in homebuilding. Inventory adjustments at the retail 
level caused some Tennessee sawmills and furniture plants to 
schedule two weeks of shutdown in December. Lumber company salesmen 
commented that volume lumber purchasers have become more 
conservative. Weak domestic demand for lumber is being partially 
offset by strong foreign demand as rebuilding efforts in Iraq and in 
the Caribbean are using significant amounts of lumber. There are 
reports of higher input prices for selected items such as steel and 
plastic in the appliance industry. Because of weakness in domestic 
purchases and competitive pricing, they have not been able to pass 
along the full increase in raw material prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aluminum industry is running at high capacity levels and 
producers report increases in input (aluminum ingot) prices of about 
60 percent since a year ago. New orders are tapering off slightly as 
higher input prices have been passed through to finished products. 
Thus, no further price increases are planned in the near future. 
Delays in deliveries have been limited to scrap aluminum, which was 
diverted to export markets as world prices rose. Producers remain 
optimistic about prospects for 1989 and the industry is expanding. A 
new plant is coming on line in Georgia and an Alabama manufacturer 
is undergoing major capacity expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper mills have experienced especially strong demand, although 
there are signs of easing compared with the first half of 1988. 
Orders are higher in selected grades such as coated paper and some 
types of paperboard. Capacity constraints on domestic shipments of 
these grades have kept imports higher than they otherwise would have 
been. Several producers of linerboard announced price increases of 
up to 10 percent. Capital spending in 1989 is projected to be 
slightly above the 1988 level, which was up a sharp 25 percent. 
Additions to capacity are primarily in the form of new machinery or 
extra shifts of workers to make heavier use of existing equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production capacity poses an important constraint on growth in 
chemicals. New orders for basic chemicals continue to be strong and 
tight supplies of ethylene have meant higher imports (despite 
sharply higher prices). The global market for specialty chemicals 
going into plastics and paper is experiencing robust growth. When 
questioned about marketing efforts, one source remarked "it's been 
more a game of getting the pounds out rather than worrying about 
product differentiation." Polyethylene sales are being eroded by 
cheaper, competing polymers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although demand for agricultural chemicals is said to be seasonally 
low, increased 1989 planting expectations and strong export markets 
have strengthened the outlook. A previously idle agricultural 
chemicals plant in Louisiana was opened in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trucking transportation should experience increased activity this 
year. Frozen foods and dry goods carriers appear to be doing best. 
Some carriers are facing a shortage of drivers. While labor costs or 
wage gains are reported as moderate, high and rapidly escalating 
insurance premiums are placing pressures on costs. These cost 
pressures are expected to lead to increases in freight rates in 
1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel and textile companies are taking a cautious outlook for the 
new year. A large apparel manufacturer plans to keep inventories 
lean and reduce domestic production by outsourcing to low-wage 
countries. Textile firms report solid orders for bed and bath 
products but apparel producers are reluctant to create a new fashion 
direction because of the industry's uncertainty as to the direction 
of the economy. One spokesman warns that imports could surge during 
1989 as a result of 1988's market weakness which left importers with 
unused quotas that can be carried forward to the new year.
