     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 10, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of southeastern economic activity slackened toward the end 
of summer for most sectors. Unemployment rates continued to edge 
upward, consumer loan growth slowed, auto sales have not met 
expectations, and consumer spending has been mixed. High vacancy 
rates are slowing office construction, and residential construction 
has cooled in some areas. More positively, building permits are up 
and tourism has been strong. Textile employment has stabilized. 
Rains are helping to ease drought conditions. However, drought-
induced damage to timber and crops has been substantial.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets weakened from June to July, according to available 
statistics. Double-digit unemployment rates continue to plague 
Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Florida's unemployment rate 
rose to 8.5 percent, its highest level in a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing employment trends have been mixed recently. Roughly 
1,000 persons have lost jobs at Florida's Space Center since the 
Challenger accident. More layoffs are expected by major space center 
contractors due to delayed shuttle flights. Although District 
petrochemical companies have been aided by the lower dollar and 
falling raw material costs, demand is weak for specialty chemicals 
used in the semiconductor and computer industry. Agricultural 
chemical production has taken a downturn as a result of slack demand 
for fertilizer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Textile industry consolidation and restructuring programs initiated 
during 1985 are beginning to benefit producers by making firms more 
competitive, although product prices are still under pressure. Firms 
are focusing on products in low-labor-content niches such as home 
furnishings. District textile employment is currently slightly above 
that of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drop in the value of the dollar has benefited the pulp and paper 
industry by allowing higher prices for linerboard and packaging. 
Exports of paper products continue to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Year-over-year retail sales growth varies widely across Sixth 
District states. Through May, Tennessee and Florida reported double-
digit year-to-date sales increases, while sales in Louisiana were 
down from last year. Bargain-hunting consumers around the District 
had been shifting purchases from traditional department stores to 
discount retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domestic car sales during July and August were disappointingly below 
the year-earlier sales levels in most areas of the region. Dealers 
complain that the incentives offered by domestic manufacturers have 
gradually lost their appeal to consumers and that competition from 
imports is limiting sales, particularly in the subcompact market. 
Industry-wide, new vehicle registrations were still ahead of the 
District's year-earlier levels through June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Southeastern single-family building permits (seasonally adjusted, 
three-month moving average) rose in June for the fourth consecutive 
month. Nashville's new home sales appear to be outpacing those of 
the rest of the District. Economic growth attributable to 
Nashville's General Motors' Saturn plant and the city's new role as 
a hub of American Airlines have led to a surge in home sales and 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The south Florida and Atlanta housing markets, however, are 
softening. Realtors in south Florida say their area is attracting 
ever smaller shares of Florida's in-migration. They describe their 
markets as flat with only moderate increases in sales over year-
earlier levels. Similarly, Atlanta realtors note a slowdown. With 
mortgage rates declining, potential buyers seem inclined to delay 
loan applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent intense national concern over effects of tax reform on 
commercial real estate is discounted by commercial developers in the 
Sixth District, who believe that local economic conditions will far 
outweigh any effects of tax reform. Office construction in 
Nashville, Atlanta, and South Florida is expected to slow because of 
high vacancy rates. Market softness is causing lenders to enforce 
increasingly stringent preleasing requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan growth at large District banks edged upward from June to 
July. For the second consecutive month, real estate lending 
exhibited strong growth and led all other categories. District 
bankers report, however, that refinancing continues to be 
responsible for much of the gain. Following a national trend, the 
Sixth District experienced slowing growth of new consumer borrowing, 
resulting in a significant decline in consumer loan growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Travel to the Southeast remains very strong. Lower gasoline prices 
are especially boosting auto travel. However, the dollar's decline 
has not stimulated domestic travel as much as expected. Travel 
agents report vacationers are shifting their destinations to areas 
that have not experienced currency realignment such as Canada, 
Mexico, arid the Caribbean. Many are also choosing West Coast and 
Hawaiian locations. Still, for the Sixth District, the current trend 
reflects a 10 to 1.2 percent gain in tourist volume over last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rain is helping pastures return to normal in drought-stricken 
areas and may prevent further crop losses, especially for soybeans 
and cotton. Even so, existing damage to major crops suggests that 
revenue of farmers in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee will fall far 
short of production costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to severe crop losses from the summer drought, the 
Southeast is experiencing substantial damage to its timber industry. 
In Georgia and Alabama total forestry losses may exceed $30 million.
     </p>
     <p>
      At mid-year, the Federal Land Bank of Jackson, Mississippi, was one 
of four in the nation requiring a transfer of funds from the eight 
other FLB's to maintain solvency. The severe drought in the 
Southeast will likely increase losses to the Farm Credit System 
during the remainder of 1986. In response, the FCS has increased 
reserves for losses and instituted a number of belt-tightening 
measures, including office mergers and consolidations and reductions 
in personnel.
