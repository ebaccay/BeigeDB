      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several reports indicate softening in manufacturing, centered 
predominantly on motor vehicles but also including some types of 
electronic equipment and nonauto consumer durables. Other 
respondents with manufacturers see continued expansion in line with 
the pace set earlier this year, generally a more subdued rate of 
rise than last year's robust increases. Construction in the District 
continues relatively strong though Michigan is weakening. Consumer 
spending on nondurables is not showing the weakness evident in 
durables. General merchandise sales are expected to grow sluggishly 
over the year ahead. District farmland values continue to increase. 
Large grain shipments to the USSR are stressing domestic 
transportation facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total payroll employment in District states has been little changed, 
seasonally adjusted, since early this year and manufacturing has 
fallen, with half of the decline at Michigan factories. The average 
unemployment rate in the District rose to 6.1 percent in September, 
highest this year, from a low of 5.0 percent in April. Michigan 
unemployment increased most among District states, but Illinois, 
Indiana, and Iowa also recorded sizable increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Surveys of purchasing managers in the District show a mixed pattern. 
Chicago purchasing managers reported an upturn in production and 
orders in October and less widespread declines in backlogs. 
Indianapolis purchasing managers, still seeing expansion, indicated 
that increases in production and orders in October were more 
widespread than last summer but less so than a year ago. Milwaukee 
purchasers say orders, production, and backlogs fell in October, 
continuing a shift from expansion to slowdown underway for more than 
a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of contacts in manufacturing indicate that orders and 
activity are continuing to rise, in most cases less rapidly than 
last year. Others report declines, concentrated at motor vehicle 
makers and their suppliers, though volume also has turned down or is 
expected to slow in a few other sectors including nonauto consumer 
durables and some types of electronics. However, other motor vehicle 
plants continue to work overtime, and another foreign-owned assembly 
plant started production in the District in October. One major auto 
maker is forecasting a recession for the national economy; another 
thinks this projection is too pessimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Markets for many types of industrial machinery and equipment have 
continued to expand, though generally more slowly than last year. In 
some cases, sales have been stronger than expected. Sales have 
remained 3 to 4 percent above a year earlier throughout this year 
for a maker of electrical controls and supplies sold widely to 
manufacturers of industrial equipment including pumps, compressors, 
fans, motors, and other types of capital goods. A second-half 
slowdown anticipated by customers earlier this year has not 
materialized; sales remain as brisk as before. Another capital goods 
producer indicated that sales of food industry machinery are holding 
up reasonably well. Materials handling equipment sales weakened 
earlier but may be bottoming. Sales of farm tractors and implements 
are running well ahead of last year, and a manufacturer in the 
District expects a further gain in shipments next year to meet 
retail demand and build inventories. Heavy construction equipment 
demand has been firmer for road building and mining. Light 
construction equipment sales, chiefly for residential building as 
well as some road repair work, were reported weaker earlier this 
year, but one producer expects its sales in 1989 to exceed last 
year, and projects a further gain in 1990. Lower orders for metal-
cutting machine tools this year are said mainly to reflect cutbacks 
by motor vehicle makers. The market for diesel engines is off 
sharply because of lower orders and production cuts at heavy truck 
manufacturers and a less robust picture for industrial diesels. 
Softness in the semiconductor market reflects cutbacks at motor 
vehicle manufacturers and less favorable prospects for other end-
markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers also are cutting shipments to motor vehicle 
manufacturers, but industrial and construction demands for steel are 
holding up well. Calendar-year 1989 shipments, previously forecast 
to be below 1988. are now expected to be higher. The pace of 
investment in projects making heavy use of steel has stayed strong 
in chemicals and the paper industry, as well as for investment in 
steel mills themselves. Sales of steel for use in commercial 
construction are also described as doing well. Starts on new 
projects have slowed, but may pick up as uncertainties over 
pollution abatement requirements are resolved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of construction activity and prospects remain favorable 
in much of the District. Contracts for construction of 
nonresidential and residential buildings were higher, during this 
year's first nine months, than last year in the District states. 
Michigan, however, showed sizable declines. Indicators of current 
construction activity also indicate expansion. For example, year-to-
date shipments of gypsum board to the five District states were 6 
percent higher than a year earlier. A large Chicago-area building 
material supplier views prospects for downtown and suburban 
construction as favorable for the next four to five years, and plans 
to add capacity. Light industrial construction in the Chicago area 
is quite active. Residential building is down, but still at a "good" 
level. Existing home sales are sluggish, despite lower mortgage 
interest rates. The inventory of homes on the market has risen, and 
they are taking longer to sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A contact with a large general merchandise retailer thinks nonauto 
consumer spending is unlikely to provide much support for continued 
economic expansion in the year ahead. Sales of household durables 
generally have been weak. Home fashions have been selling poorly. 
Though appliance sales have improved recently at one large retailer, 
year-to-date sales of "core" appliances have been below last year. 
Buying of household furniture and lawn care equipment have softened. 
Some apparel lines have been selling relatively well, including 
men's and children's clothing. Industry-wide department store 
inventories are viewed as heavy, indicating that a highly 
promotional Christmas is likely. Next year's sales at general 
merchandise retailers are expected to be only a little higher than 
in 1989. Catalog and direct mail marketers' sales were described as 
soft in September and October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our latest survey of agricultural banks found that District farmland 
values rose 1.7 percent during the third quarter and 8 percent 
during the year ending September 30. The survey also indicated that 
farm loan repayment rates picked up somewhat this summer. Interest 
rates charged by banks on farm loans edged lower for the second 
consecutive quarter but were still 50 basis points higher than a 
year ago. Loan-to-deposit ratios at District agricultural banks, 
following a two-year uptrend, are at a five-year high but still far 
below the peak in the late 1970s.
     </p>
     <p>
      Barge rates and the demand for rail cars have firmed considerably 
this fall in response to large grain shipments to the USSR. While 
not unprecedented, the volume of Soviet grain shipments will stress 
the domestic transportation network. A major bottleneck at the soon-
to-be-replaced Alton (Illinois) Lock and Dam on the Mississippi 
River has resurfaced with the pick-up in barge traffic. Low water 
levels on both the Mississippi and the Missouri River could further 
limit barge traffic or result in an early, season-ending closure to 
traffic on the upper portions of those rivers.
