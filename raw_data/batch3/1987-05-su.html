     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy appears to be continuing on a course of moderate 
expansion, according to reports gathered in April. The agricultural 
sector, while certainly not in the clear yet, is showing signs of 
improvement. Manufacturers continue to post modest gains, bolstered 
by growth in both domestic sales and exports. Residential 
construction remains strong, especially in the single-family market, 
and has been relatively unaffected by the recent climb in mortgage 
rates. Retailers are making slight gains over year-ago levels in 
sales of general merchandise, although auto sales are about the same 
as or lower than last year. Bankers say business and real estate 
loans are growing, but demand for consumer loans is subsiding.
     </p>
     <p>
      The only uniformly negative reports are those on the energy 
industry, which remains depressed despite the higher price of oil. 
As a result, the regional economies heavily dependent on energy 
remain in the doldrums.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Forestry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions appear to be improving somewhat in the farm sector. 
Atlanta and Chicago indicate that farmland values are stabilizing; 
in the Dallas and Minneapolis Districts 1987 farm incomes are 
expected to increase; and St. Louis and Kansas City report improved 
agricultural credit conditions. It should he noted, however, that no 
reports predict a significant overall turnaround for agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock farmers are expected to benefit from a combination of 
lower production costs and stronger prices for cattle, hogs, and 
sheep. Severe weather in some parts of the mid-west had an adverse 
effect on livestock, but the outlook there remains positive as well. 
Crop farmers in the southeast and mid-west have had spring field 
work delayed by wet weather. When planting is completed, however, 
acreage devoted to corn and soybeans is expected to be significantly 
reduced from 1986 levels. Wheat acreage should stay about ever, with 
last year's level. Cotton prices have increased significantly this 
year, and production is expected to follow suit. A late frost in the 
southeast destroyed as much as 50 percent of the peaches in that 
area; reports from Richmond, however, indicate expectations of a 
good yield for fruit farmers in that District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for lumber is growing. Atlanta reports increasing prices for 
southern pine; San Francisco indicates orders for lumber in the 
northwest have risen by over 20 percent from a year ago, in part 
because of substantial increases in exports to Europe.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The energy industry remains depressed despite the higher price of 
oil. The number of operating rigs, while up slightly from earlier in 
the year, is still as much as 50 percent below a year ago. Many 
wells remain shut down in the Atlanta District, and reports from 
Minneapolis say that drilling is "almost nonexistent" in that area. 
Dallas, however, indicates that the rig count may be bottoming out, 
and that the slight growth in recent months is expected to continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts indicate stable or slightly improving manufacturing 
sectors. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas all 
note at least moderate growth in new orders and production. 
Employment gains, however, are less uniform. Industries mentioned as 
leading the pack include defense contractors, chemicals, steel, and 
paper products. Steel and paper specifically seem to be experiencing 
broad-based expansion of demand, and firms in these industries in 
the Chicago District are reported to be operating near capacity. 
Lagging industries include transportation equipment (specifically 
domestic automobiles) and capital goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices are headed up at least slightly in most areas, 
with rising prices for steel and pulp specifically mentioned by 
Boston, Chicago, and Minneapolis.
     </p>
     <p>
      While domestic sales seem to be stronger, at least some of the 
improvement in the industrial sector has been related to the export 
market as well. Dallas reports that the falling value of the dollar 
on foreign exchange markets specifically has contributed to an 
uptick in the chemical industry. Manufacturers in the San Francisco 
District say the trade tension between the U.S. and Japan has helped 
to open markets not only in that country but in South Korea and 
Taiwan as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction and sales are reported to be strong in 
virtually all Districts except Dallas, where the market is adversely 
affected by the depressed regional economy. Elsewhere, sales are 
reported to be up as much as 35 percent from a year ago. Activity 
appears to be strongest in the single-family market; several 
Districts say multifamily construction is lagging. There is 
widespread concern that the recent jump of as much as 200 basis 
points in mortgage rates will choke off demand for housing. The only 
effect actually noted so far, however, has been a rush by buyers to 
close deals already in progress or to purchase property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office-leasing activity is reported by Boston and New York to be 
good. There are some pockets of excess capacity in both Districts, 
however, with vacancy rates as high as 20 percent in some areas of 
suburban New York. Atlanta indicates that commercial construction is 
slow, and that some lenders are requiring pre-leasing before they 
approve financing for projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts report that retailers are posting "slight" or 
"modest" gains in March and/or April. Dallas, however, reports slow 
sales and San Francisco describes sales as mixed. Inventories remain 
generally in line with sales expectations, with neither shortages 
nor discounting prevalent. There have been some price increases in 
general merchandise as a result of the increasing cost of imports, 
and some retailers are trying to switch to domestic or non-Japanese 
Asian suppliers. Boston reports that merchants in that District are 
sometimes having difficulty finding domestic suppliers who can meet 
their volume needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are running at or below year-ago levels. Sales of 
domestic cars are uniformly sluggish. Japanese imports show more 
strength but are also slow in some areas: Atlanta indicates that 
demand for Japanese cars remains strong despite price hikes, while 
Cleveland reports that import dealers in that District are 
accumulating unwanted inventories and are considering sales 
incentives.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at banks continues to grow in most Districts, 
fueled mainly by real estate and business borrowing. Consumer 
borrowing is widely reported to be weakening, a phenomenon that New 
York and Philadelphia attribute to the relatively high level of 
consumer debt and to the availability of low-rate financing by auto 
manufacturers. Atlanta and Richmond note that several banks have cut 
interest rates on credit cards recently.
