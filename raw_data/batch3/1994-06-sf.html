      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 22, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While economic conditions are reported to be improving slowly an 
California and Hawaii, activity is strong in most other parts of the 
Twelfth District. Business leaders remain optimistic overall. Retail 
sales and tourism continue strong in many areas of the District. 
Manufacturing activity still is mixed, as weakness is reported in 
the aerospace industry while improvement is expected by some Silicon 
Valley firms. Livestock and dairy prices are soft. Construction and 
real estate activity generally remains strong, although home sales 
in some parts of the District are reported to have slowed in May in 
response to higher interest rates. Lending activity is rising, and 
banks are reported to be more aggressive in pursuing loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District business leaders remain optimistic. Almost two-
thirds of respondents continue to expect national growth to exceed 2 
1/2 percent during the next four quarters. Respondents in Arizona 
and the intermountain states expect especially strong growth in 
their regions. However, only about two-fifths of business leaders 
now expect housing starts to improve during the next four quarters, 
down from more than one-half in April. Less than a third of 
respondents now expect the inflation rate to rise during the next 
four quarters, compared with over one-half in April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail and service industry conditions remain strong in most parts 
of the District. Consumer durable sales are reported to be 
especially strong, with only a little evidence of slowing in 
response to higher interest rates. Prices for food and clothing show 
little increase. Auto sales in Idaho are reported up 25 percent in 
the first quarter of 1994 from the level of a year earlier, although 
sales in May slowed somewhat. Auto and light truck sales in the 
Pacific Northwest are reported strong, and sales are improving in 
parts of California. In Arizona, furniture and building materials 
sales through April are reported to be increasing at double-digit 
annual rates. Retail sales are reported to have picked up in 
California, especially for replacement furniture and appliances in 
the areas affected by the Northridge earthquake.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism is strong in many parts of the District. Strong gains are 
reported in eastern Oregon. The Portland airport reports a 16 
percent increase in passenger traffic in the first four months of 
the year from a year earlier. Tourism is reported to be rebounding 
in Hawaii, giving a boost to retail sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      The demand for telecommunication services in California is reported 
to be strengthening slowly. Cellular subscriptions in the Pacific 
Northwest are reported to be increasing at a substantially 
accelerated pace. In Idaho, computer programmers are earning higher 
wages as the growth in demand outstrips the increase in supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity is reported mixed. Commercial 
aircraft activity in the District is reported stable as 
manufacturers await the certification of Boeing's new 777. One 
aircraft parts supplier noted a pickup in sales to Sweden, 
Indonesia, and Brazil. Defense-related aerospace industries remain 
weak in Southern California. In Silicon Valley, the demand for 
executives with marketing skills is reported to be increasing as 
companies begin to position themselves for future growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions generally are good. Prices are high for 
field crops, like wheat, cotton, and rice, as well as for 
vegetables, including tomatoes, beans, and peas. Lower prices are 
expected for almonds, walnuts, and peaches. Milk prices are expected 
to fall sharply by July. High cattle inventories have pushed beef 
prices below production costs in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil prices have risen, but remain relatively low. The proposal to 
allow Alaskan crude oil to be exported may improve prices for oil 
producers in California's Central Valley by reducing supplies on the 
West Coast. Lumber and plywood prices are reported to be firming 
after falling between December 1993 and mid-May. Electricity prices 
in the Pacific Northwest are reported lower because of the 
additional water being spilled over the dams in the area to help the 
salmon run.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate markets generally remain strong, but residential 
activity in many parts of the District slowed somewhat in May in 
response to rising interest rates. Home sales are reported to have 
slowed recently from the strong pace of March and April in the 
Pacific Northwest, parts of Northern California, and parts of 
Arizona, although the Tucson market remains strong. Sales in the 
intermountain states remain brisk, and May home sales in Hawaii are 
reported up 31 percent from April and up 67 percent from a year 
earlier. Home prices are reported up in the Pacific Northwest, 
Arizona, and in the intermountain states, and prices have stabilized 
in California's Central Valley. In Washington, office vacancy rates 
have fallen and rents are up. In San Francisco, vacancy rates remain 
high and rents are below the costs of maintaining the buildings in 
some instances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity remains strong in many parts of the District. 
In Arizona and the intermountain states, both residential and 
commercial building is reported strong, with shortages of 
construction materials and skilled labor reported in these areas. 
Residential construction is reported flat in Northern California, 
improving in Southern California, and down from earlier levels in 
the Central Valley. In Salt Lake City, the airport is expanding and 
several new hotels are under construction. Interest rate increases 
are reported to have slowed the development of affordable housing in 
Southern California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks in the District are reported to be pursuing loans more 
aggressively by easing lending criteria and offering more attractive 
terms. Loan demand remains strong in Idaho and Utah. In Arizona, 
loan demand is reported to be increasing, especially for consumer 
credit. In California, loan demand generally remains weak, but some 
strengthening is noted in Northern California and in business 
lending in Southern California. Loan demand also is reported to be 
showing signs of life in Hawaii, but delinquencies remain high. 
Throughout the District, interest rate increases are reported to 
have put an end to the refinancing boom.
