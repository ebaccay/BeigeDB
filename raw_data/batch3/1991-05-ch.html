      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       May 1, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts indicate the rate of contraction in the Seventh District 
economy slowed in March and early April. Reports from District 
retailers suggest that consumer spending remained sluggish, although 
customer traffic gains continued. Residential real estate activity 
improved significantly. District auto dealers reported higher 
traffic levels, but new auto sales remained soft. At the same time, 
new orders received by District suppliers to the auto industry 
improved, brightening the outlook for production gains in the second 
quarter. Other District manufacturers report continued slow but 
stabilizing levels of activity, in line with results posted by 
purchasing managers' surveys. The financial condition of the 
District's banking sector is generally in better shape than the 
nation on average, and one large bank indicated a shift in April 
towards a more aggressive lending posture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several District retailers indicated that real consumer spending may 
have declined slightly in March and early April, as improved 
consumer confidence has yet to translate into solid sales gains for 
retailers. District consumer spending no longer shows as much 
strength, relative to the national average, as it did through 1990. 
A large general merchandise retailer reported continued improvement 
in traffic and customer attitudes. However, sales continued to run 
below year-earlier levels. Consumer buying is increasingly 
sophisticated, according to this contact, leading to a more 
competitive pricing environment. A large discount chain, previously 
reporting consistent sales gains, revealed that sales in March fell 
below year-earlier levels. A contact with this firm stated that 
gardening equipment sales in early April were showing solid growth, 
however, and these sales have tended to be a good leading indicator 
of overall Spring spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While household durable goods spending remained weak, residential 
real estate activity improved appreciably in March. Higher levels of 
inquiries reported by District realtors in the past few months have 
been followed by significant sales gains. Improved affordability, 
lower interest rates, and new governmental assistance programs for 
first-time home buyers contributed to the turnaround. A large 
realtor in the Chicago area reported that March residential sales 
were the highest for that month in the past ten years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New motor vehicle sales remained slow in March and early April. 
District dealers continued to speak of improved traffic and customer 
attitudes, while new car sales gains continue to be limited. Several 
contacts indicated that new car sales were being constrained by 
tight financing from both bank and non-bank lenders. Down payment 
requirements have risen sharply in recent months, in many cases 
posting a three-fold increase from last year. Efforts to shorten 
loan maturities also have impacted sales. Some lenders are putting 
increasing pressure on dealers to share in losses generated by 
higher defaults on previous loans, according to an industry source, 
causing some dealers to pass along fewer new loan applications. 
Several lenders also reported cutting back on the number of dealers 
from whom they accept loan applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several dealers expected improved traffic to translate into sales 
gains soon, and contribute to some improvement in their orders to 
automakers. Auto production is being spread around to more lines 
opening at slower rates, according to one industry source, which 
could indicate that overall capacity is being prepared for stepped-
up production. Assembly schedules for the second quarter were left 
unrevised in early April, marking the first time since last July 
that planners did not cut schedules from levels announced a month 
earlier. One auto Industry analyst contended that the announced 5.5 
million unit annual rate for second quarter production (still a low 
rate, but above that for the first quarter) could well be exceeded. 
A firm providing metal painting services for new auto parts reported 
that orders "ounced back" in early April. The firm's production is 
now running only 5 percent below year-ago sales, after experiencing 
production runs 40 percent below last year as late as mid-March. 
Steel producers also reported new improvement in orders from 
automakers in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports by non-auto manufacturers generally indicate continued 
weakness in shipments and production. A large manufacturer of 
electrical equipment reported that sales declined significantly in 
the first quarter from a strong year-earlier period. After plunging 
in February, District steel production improved in the month of 
March, then flattened out in early April, at a level nearly 20 
percent below year-earlier levels.  District steel manufacturer 
reported that industry shipments generally remained firm relative to 
production, as steel producers worked to reduce inventory built in 
advance of a threatened yet unrealized steelworker strike. A large 
capital goods manufacturer reported that machinery orders were 
"still on the weak side," but the overall impact of the recession 
remained mild. However, this contact stated that overseas revenues 
declined significantly in the first quarter. as slower growth in 
Western Europe and increased political uncertainty in the Soviet 
Union began to impact sales. A large manufacturer of a wide variety 
of specialty materials and office supplies, citing weaker foreign 
economies and the strength of the dollar, expects to export fewer 
goods in 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment data and purchasing managers surveys support producers' 
reports suggesting that the District manufacturing sector remains 
weak, but that the rate of decline has slowed since February. 
District manufacturing employment continued to decline in February 
(the latest month available), but recent job losses have been in 
line with the results posted in the nation as a whole. Excluding 
Michigan, District manufacturing employment has been relatively 
stable in recent months. District purchasing managers' surveys 
indicate slowing rates of contraction. The index produced by the 
Chicago survey bottomed out in January. While the index continued to 
indicate contraction in March, some of the best improvement from 
January to March was evident in the new orders component. The 
Detroit index also improved from January to March, yet remained at a 
low level relative to the Chicago results. Most of the improvement 
in Detroit in March came from the automotive sector, described in 
the survey report as "desperately weak" earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District bankers indicate that new lending activity is 
still weak, but at least one banker anticipates improvement in the 
near future. District banks are generally healthier than the 
national average, with lower exposure to loans on real estate and 
merger lending than those incurred by some banks in other regions. 
Several large District banks reported no further tightening in 
credit standards since January for merger business, commercial real 
estate, or consumer lending. One major bank recently completed a 
bond issue for the purpose of expanding lending activity over the 
next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several reports by nonfinancial corporations indicated increasing 
difficulty in collecting receivables and financing inventory, but 
several small manufacturers reported continued access to bank credit 
A large diversified manufacturer reported that a growing number of 
customers are slowing their payments. in response to slower payments 
customers themselves are experiencing. A District auto-parts 
manufacturer reported that most customers continue to pay reliably, 
including one distributor who recently reorganized in a leveraged 
buy-out. However, payments from several leveraged auto-parts 
retailers recently slowed, according to this source. Outside of 
commercial real estate, difficulty obtaining credit appears to be 
concentrated in retailing. A large national discount chain reported 
that a growing number of suppliers are having difficulty obtaining 
short-term credit, especially for inventory. However, several small 
manufacturers in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana reported continued 
access to bank funding, despite weak sales so far this year. One 
small machining shop recently was able to obtain a bank loan for the 
purchase of a tool costing one-third of its expected sales this 
year, in advance or a yet-to-be released customer order.
