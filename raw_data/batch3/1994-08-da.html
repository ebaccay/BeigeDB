     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity and optimism increased in late June and early 
July. Demand growth for manufactured products and business services 
accelerated. Retail sales increased, and construction and real 
estate activity continued to rise despite modest slowing in the 
single-family housing market. District energy activity was still 
moderate, and there was no indication that domestic or foreign 
drilling had been affected by the recent upturn in oil prices. Loan 
demand continued to expand, and bankers reported that the industry 
is very competitive. Agricultural conditions were favorable despite 
hot, dry weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing orders and optimism rose since the last survey. Brick 
and glass producers reported stronger demand and higher prices than 
both last month and a year ago. Brick and glass contacts were 
operating at capacity, and expect to remain busy through the end of 
the year filling a backlog of orders. Cement orders for homebuilding 
slowed, but demand from apartment and highway builders was up. 
Commercial and residential construction spurred lumber sales which 
slowed last Spring, when contacts said customers were concerned 
higher interest rates would curtail home building. Continued 
residential construction boosted confidence and encouraged inventory 
rebuilding. Demand for paper products increased, and prices were 
higher. Expanded exports, stimulated by recent declines in the value 
of the dollar, pushed up demand for corrugated boxes. Demand for 
semiconductors remained strong, and prices held steady, but contacts 
expect growth to slow. Primary and fabricated metal sales have 
stayed high, particularly for commercial construction. Metal 
producers reported that higher costs pushed up selling prices. 
Rising orders for apparel manufacturing led to more hiring and 
higher wages. Apparel contacts were optimistic that sales would 
continue to grow. Apparel input costs were higher although several 
producers said that they had not raised their selling prices. 
Garment finishers said that demand weakened in the last few months. 
Some contacts expect most garment finishing to move to Mexico. Sales 
of food and kindred products rose. Food manufacturers expressed 
optimism about future sales, and several firms added employees. 
Domestic demand for oil field equipment and services was still 
strong but foreign demand was weak, except from that of Canada and 
Latin America. Contacts reported a shortage of skilled blue collar 
workers, particularly machinists. Domestic demand for refined 
products is nearly five percent higher than a year ago, and 
refineries have been running at utilization rates of 55 percent or 
higher. Refining margins fell because prices for oil products had 
not risen as much as oil. Margins also narrowed because EPA mandates 
to blend renewable oxygenates into gasoline caused methanol and MTBE 
prices to increase sharply. Refinery contacts say that EPA mandates 
will reduce demand for gasoline and cause a shake-out in the 
industry. Demand for chemicals continued to rise. Producers of 
ethylene and propylene reported low inventories and higher prices, 
but they expect prices to moderate when additional capacity comes on 
line this fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business services contacts report slightly greater sales than during 
the last beige book survey period. Demand remained strong at 
temporary firms, particularly for technical and professional 
workers, such as accountants, engineers and programmers. Legal firms 
said that transactions activity (mergers, acquisitions and public 
offerings) was particularly high although litigation work was 
softening. Legal contacts said that businesses are using alternative 
dispute resolution mechanisms to reduce the expenses of litigation. 
Accounting activity increased, particularly international business 
dealing with trade between Mexico and the United States. Demand for 
transportation services continued to rise, but competition kept 
prices stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      District retail sales increased, but sales along the Mexican border 
were still sluggish. Home products continued to have the strongest 
growth, although apparel sales improved slightly. Selling prices 
were unchanged, and contacts do not expect price increases. Auto 
sales increased in May and June. Dealers reported that low inventory 
had begun to affect sales, and prices were rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate activity continued to rise despite 
modest slowing in the single-family housing market. Homebuilding 
remained stronger than a year ago, but contacts said sales of new 
and existing homes had slowed. Inventories of new homes were still 
very low, but new and existing home prices stabilized after large 
increases earlier in the year. Apartment occupancy remained high 
boosting multifamily construction. Leasing and construction of 
retail space was reported to be strong. Office construction was 
almost nonexistent although demand for existing office space picked 
up.
     </p>
     <p>
      District energy activity remained moderate, and there was no 
indication that higher oil prices had affected domestic or foreign 
drilling. Dooming demand for oil products combined with supply 
disruptions in Yemen, Brazil and Nigeria to push oil prices back 
over $20 per barrel in June. Drilling increased seasonally and is 
expected to rise through the end of the year, but remains slow. Most 
drilling was still focused on natural gas, and activity in the Gulf 
of Mexico remained high. The price of the NYMEX near-month contract 
for natural gas has been relatively high, although lower than last 
year, close to $2 per mcf all summer. The August contract slipped 
under $2 recently. Contacts are concerned that high levels of 
Canadian imports and growing domestic production, will put downward 
pressure on natural gas prices. Storage fields depleted over the 
winter refilled faster and more easily than expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers reported that loan demand was increasing, but they said they 
would like to extend more loans. Some also said that intense 
competition was limiting their ability to lend because it encourages 
lower rates and looser credit standards than they desire. Large 
banks are reported to be particularly active in lending. Respondents 
noted an increase in mergers of smaller banks, and suspected that 
cost reduction was one motivation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural conditions were favorable despite hot, dry weather. 
Crop progress was ahead of last year, and crop conditions were 
mostly good. Livestock remained in fair to good condition as 
supplemental feeding increased. Heat and insufficient moisture 
lowered yield estimates and stressed range conditions in some areas. 
Prices for beef cattle, calves and hogs continued to fall causing 
the June Livestock and Livestock Products Index to drop 13 percent 
below a year ago. All June commodity prices were higher than a year 
ago, except potatoes, pushing the All Crops Price Index up 14.9 
percent.
