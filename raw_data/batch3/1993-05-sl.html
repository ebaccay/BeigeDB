      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District farms continue to report growth in both sales and 
employment. Unexpected increases in demand have spurred some 
companies to hire additional workers or cancel planned layoffs. Wet 
weather has slowed District homebuilding, although many areas still 
report permits and sales at or above last year's levels. Consumer 
and small business loan demand continues to increase at area banks; 
some bankers are concerned, however, that slow deposit growth could 
hamper their efforts to fund further increases in loan demand. 
Excessive moisture and unseasonably cool temperatures have delayed 
spring planting throughout the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District manufacturers continue to be upbeat, as both 
sales and employment are increasing. Sales increases in the range of 
4 percent to 10 percent over last year are not uncommon. One contact 
reports a steadier stream of revenues this year relative to last, 
citing the customers' use of just-in-time inventory as the cause. 
Many firms report employment increases because of expansions and 
increased demand. In particular, Arkansas is witnessing spurts of 
growth from various industries. A steel processor will open a plant 
in the northeast part of the state, which brings the total to six 
steel-related plant openings in this area over the past year. In 
western Arkansas, the expansions of a wheel manufacturer and two 
apparel manufacturers will add about 250 jobs, while a maker of 
major household appliances is adding 400 workers because of 
unexpectedly strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from other areas of the District are also positive. For 
example, a Tennessee plant producing shoes with a workforce of 260, 
originally slated to close, will remain open indefinitely because of 
unexpected increases in demand. This is the second time this year 
the company has reversed its plans to close one of its plants 
because of unexpected growth in demand. In March, a steel foundry in 
Illinois reopened after 18 mouths with 330 recalled employees. The 
firm also reports that up to 1,000 additional workers may be hired 
soon to meet the expected demand. A poultry processor in western 
Kentucky is undergoing a major expansion that will lead to 300 new 
jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some employment reductions did occur, however. A Tennessee producer 
of children's clothing reports that reduced sales and internal 
efficiency concerns will cause it to close a plant by June, 
eliminating about 300 jobs. In Memphis, a maker of food products 
will release up to two-thirds of its current 350 employees as it 
stops production of bulk products for other food companies. Because 
of a reorganization, a national computer company will lay off about 
200 of its 550 workers in St. Louis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonmanufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District nonmanufacturing firms also continue to be 
positive. For example, an Arkansas building supplies company reports 
that sales are up 11 percent over last year because of strong growth 
in housing starts. The relocation of a nursing homes operator from 
Virginia to Arkansas will bring between 300 and 400 jobs into the 
area by next year, completing this firm's consolidation in Arkansas. 
A retail holding company that is moving its headquarters to St. 
Louis reports that 100 new jobs, in addition to the 430 jobs coming 
from New York, will be added. An athletic apparel maker, 
consolidating its national distribution in Memphis, is bringing 100 
jobs. In addition, a retailer in southern Illinois reports that when 
its remodeling is complete by year-end, it will need 300 new 
employees. The District's mining industry, though, contracted 
further when an Illinois coal company announced that it will close 
two mines this month, laying off more than 370 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wet weather in much of the District has dampened homebuilding, 
although many areas still report construction activity at or above 
last year's pace. Rain and mud have put many District homebuilders 
30 to 60 days behind schedule. Despite the weather, traffic and 
sales activity is reportedly moderate to strong throughout the 
District. Sales of houses priced in the $l00,000-to-$150,000 range 
are especially strong in Louisville. New home prices have risen 
slightly because of the pickup in demand and increases in materials 
costs, especially lumber.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to be on the upswing in many parts of the 
District. Consumers continue to refinance variable-rate debt with 
fixed-rate instruments: at the same time, consumers and small 
businesses have increased their demand for new loans, bankers 
report. Several contacts are concerned about slow deposit growth, 
believing that the low rates being paid on deposits have led many 
customers to move funds out of the banking system. They also worry 
that, should a sharp upturn in loan demand occur, it will be 
difficult to fund without significant increases in deposit rates or 
purchased funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surplus soil moisture and unseasonably cool spring temperatures are 
reported in most District states. Consequently, spring tillage and 
planting operations have proceeded at an unusually slow pace: corn, 
cotton and rice planting are well behind normal in most areas. Two 
large fertilizer producers and distributors report that sales have 
been adversely affected by the weather, but should pick up if the 
weather improves soon. Although the cool weather has significantly 
damaged the blueberry and strawberry crops in parts of Arkansas, 
Mississippi and Tennessee, the peach and apple crops in some areas 
have benefited. The winter wheat crop in most states is generally in 
good condition, although some concerns about moisture-related 
diseases have been expressed, Initial estimates suggest that 
District farmers intend to plant less corn and rice this year, but 
more soybeans. Cotton acreage should be near last year's level. 
Flooding along many of the major rivers in the District has barge 
activity hamstrung recently.
