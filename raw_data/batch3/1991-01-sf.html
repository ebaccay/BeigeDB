      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the West are reported to be softening 
further. Slower growth is bringing continued moderation in wage and 
price increases throughout the District. Holiday retail sales were 
mixed in the West, but, generally, were above low pre-holiday 
expectations. Manufacturing activity continues to slow across much 
of the West. Agriculture and resource-related industries in the 
District have been hit hard by a combination of low prices and 
weather related difficulties. Construction and real estate activity 
continues to be hampered by an abundance of vacant office space and 
difficulty in obtaining financing. Western financial institutions 
report mixed conditions, but many areas note a weakening in loan 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Western business leaders' expectations about future economic growth 
deteriorated slightly in January. Eighty-one percent now foresee a 
national recession in the next twelve months, compared with 75 
percent in November and 40 percent in September. An increasing 
number of business leaders see this weak economic growth leading to 
a lessening of inflationary pressures. Almost half now project 
lower inflation during the coming year. Respondents were less 
optimistic about foreign trade, with only 29 percent expecting a 
pick-up compared to 44 percent an November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage and price increases continue to moderate throughout the Twelfth 
District. Most retailers reported significant discounting during the 
holiday season in the face of a softening economy. Abundant grain 
and feed crops are pushing down prices for many agricultural 
commodities, like wheat. Prices for citrus fruits, especially navel 
oranges, and some vegetables have risen significantly as a result of 
the freeze in California. Wage demands are reported to be moderating 
a job security has become a more important concern. In Seattle, 
manufacturing wages are reported up 5 percent from last year, 
bolstered by gains in aerospace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail trade activity is mixed in much of the West. Holiday sales 
were flat to slightly down from last year. However, according to 
most reports, this performance was not too disappointing considering 
the economic climate. Southern California registered weak sales, 
while retailers in other areas of California reported slightly 
stronger sales. In Oregon and Washington, sales were flat despite 
severe weather that slowed holiday activity. Sales were slightly 
above year-earlier levels in Idaho and Utah, and up a strong 9 
percent or more in Hawaii. Most retailers entered the holiday season 
with low inventories, and report that business plans for 1991 will 
continue to be conservative. One retailer reports that sales were up 
sharply in the first week of January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Classified advertising volume continues to shrink for newspapers in 
California, but not as sharply as in other areas of the country. One 
report indicated that total classified advertising volume was down 3 
percent from a year ago in California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the West continues to slow. Defense-
related aerospace activity remains weak, and commercial aircraft 
manufacturing is expected to slow. Aluminum and steel markets also 
are reported to be soft. Manufacturing export volume is reported to 
have improved slightly, while imports have weakened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture is facing difficult conditions as lower prices and 
weather conditions cloud the outlook. Large rain and feed crops are 
pushing down prices for many crops. In Idaho, the price of farmland 
is reported to have fallen in the face of sharply lower prices for 
wheat. The freeze in California wiped out the Navel Orange crop and 
damaged other crops and trees. The freeze is expected to reduce 
California's $17.5 billion total farm revenue by $1 billion. In 
addition to crop losses, the freeze also caused large layoffs in 
food processing plants in California's central valley. Continued 
drought conditions also are reported to be causing major problems 
for California farmers. Lack of grazing land is reportedly forcing 
ranchers to liquidate their herds or move them to feedlots. Despite 
this increase in the beef supply, livestock prices remain high. 
Agricultural exports continue to expand, but there are concerns that 
the California freeze will hurt citrus producers' ability to move 
into the newly opened Japanese market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forest product industries remain depressed. Weak demand has caused 
prices for paper, containerboard, and plywood to fall. These lower 
prices coupled with high log prices have squeezed profits and caused 
many mills to close in the Northwest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity in most areas of the West is weak as a result 
of an abundance of office space in most of the major cities. 
Continued difficulty in obtaining financing for new construction 
projects also is blamed for the slowdown in activity. Reports from 
Los Angeles continue to cite high vacancy rates for downtown office 
space, and more space is coming on line. Commercial building in 
Seattle is described as lackluster. There is reported to be a 
substantial amount of new space yet to be absorbed in Seattle. Roth 
residential and commercial activity remain relatively solid in Boise 
and Salt Lake City as well as in Sacramento, Bakersfield, and other 
parts of California's central valley.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate sales and prices remain weak throughout much of the 
West. In California, sales have stabilized in the past few months, 
with prices near their year-earlier levels. Most of the residential 
activity continues to be in the lower-priced end of the market. In 
Seattle, median home prices peaked in mid-1990 and are reported down 
15 percent from that peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in Twelfth District financial institutions are mixed, 
with solid conditions reported in the inter-mountain states and 
continued softening in coastal areas. Loan demand is reported weak 
in Southern California, Oregon, and Washington. One report notes 
that auto loan demand has softened, while another report indicates 
that consumer credit card balances did not increase as much as usual 
this holiday season.
