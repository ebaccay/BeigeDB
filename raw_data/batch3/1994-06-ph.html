      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 22, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from businesses in the Third District suggest that economic 
activity in the region was increasing modestly in early June. 
Manufacturers indicated that orders and shipments were rising 
moderately. Retailers had mixed results: apparel sales were down 
from a year ago but sales of home furnishings were on the rise. Auto 
dealers generally indicated that sales were healthy. Bankers said 
that growth in consumer lending remained fairly strong while 
commercial and industrial lending was just edging up and real estate 
lending was dropping. Realtors generally reported that the pace of 
home sales remained good while demand for office space continued to 
be weak. Homebuilders reported that construction activity has eased 
recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      The general outlook among the businesses polled is positive, 
although contacts have trimmed their forecasts somewhat since 
earlier in the year. Manufacturers anticipate continued improvement, 
but they do not expect demand for their products to grow as rapidly 
as they had forecast this past winter. Retailers remain optimistic, 
but they also have reduced the amount of growth they are forecasting 
for the balance of the year. Bankers expect commercial and 
industrial lending to continue moving up slowly. They expect 
consumer lending to expand further, but several bankers said they 
anticipate some slowing in the rate of growth. Realtors believe the 
rate of home sales will remain good unless mortgage rates begin to 
climb again, but builders are growing less optimistic about 
prospects for construction during the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers polled in early June reported that 
activity continued to move up at a modest pace. New orders were on 
the rise at about one-quarter of the firms surveyed, and about one-
third were stepping up shipments. However, conditions varied across 
major goods-producing sectors in the region: manufacturers of 
machinery and transportation equipment were experiencing the largest 
gains while orders were either just steady or down somewhat at 
companies producing primary metals and metal products and at 
printing plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most local manufacturers were holding inventories steady, although 
reports of decreases slightly outnumbered reports of increases. 
Delivery times were unchanged, on balance, as was employment. 
Manufacturers continued to report increases in employment costs, 
primarily as a result of increased costs for employee benefits, with 
relatively smaller increases in wage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers' expectations for the balance of the year are 
positive, although the level of optimism has edged down a bit since 
the first quarter. Just over 40 percent of manufacturers contacted 
for this report forecast gains in orders and shipments for the 
second half, while about 20 percent anticipate decreases. Based on 
these forecasts of demand, about half of the managers at area plants 
intend to hold inventories steady and one-third plan to make 
reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost two-thirds of the manufacturers contacted for this report 
said input prices were steady, although nearly one-third said they 
were paying more in June than they had in May for certain raw 
materials, such as metals and chemicals, and for electricity and 
natural gas. Around 80 percent of the firms polled indicated they 
were holding the prices of their own products steady, but around 15 
percent were raising prices. Looking ahead, around half expect both 
input and output prices to remain at current levels, but 40 percent 
expect both to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers gave mixed reports on sales for May and 
early June. Most of those surveyed said apparel sales were off from 
last year, and merchants attributed the decline to unseasonably cool 
weather that dampened demand for spring and summer clothes. Sales of 
home furnishings and building supplies were generally described as 
good. Several merchants noted that consumers continue to look for 
price discounts, making markdowns necessary to maintain sales 
growth. With the traditionally slower sales pace of the summer 
months approaching, merchants said they are being very cautious in
inventory planning. Retailers' sales forecasts for the fall are 
conservative as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers continued to report year-over-year gains in unit sales 
for May and early June. Some dealers said they are unable to meet 
demand for a few popular models, but, in general, dealers said their 
inventories were adequate and they had no plans to increase them. 
Dealers forecast that unit sales for all of 1994 will be above sales 
in 1993 by 5 to 10 percent as long as auto loan rates do not rise 
from current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District bankers contacted for this report in 
early June said trends in lending had changed little from earlier 
this spring. Overall loan growth was moderate, with gains resulting 
mainly from credit card and auto lending. Commercial and industrial 
lending was just edging up, and real estate lending was declining. 
Bankers generally described loan pricing for both business and 
consumer lending as very competitive, and some expressed concern 
that margins were narrowing as loan rates lagged behind increases in 
funding costs, despite the recent increase in the prime rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, the bankers surveyed in June generally said they 
expect commercial and industrial lending to grow just slightly in 
the months immediately ahead. They expect further growth in consumer 
lending but several mentioned that the pace may slacken, partly as a 
result of the slower growth in consumer spending that they predict 
and partly as a result of less aggressive marketing of consumer 
loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate markets remain soft, according to leasing 
officials, with the vacancy rate somewhat higher in central 
Philadelphia than in suburban areas. No major office construction 
projects are expected to be started this year. Contacts point out 
that pharmaceutical companies have expansion plans, but they have 
put them on hold while new legislation on national health care 
policy is debated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from homebuilders indicated that the pace of housing 
construction was slipping in May and June, and some builders said 
they were operating below last year's rate. Conversely, realtors 
continued to indicate that home sales were continuing at a healthy 
pace, especially for low- and mid-priced homes. However, they 
caution that home buying will drop if mortgage rates start moving up 
again.
