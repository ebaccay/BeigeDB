      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 4, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy continued to expand slowly from early June 
through mid-July. Most manufacturing industries reported sluggish 
growth although industries tied to residential construction grew 
strongly. The service sector reported continued slow growth in sales 
and employment. Residential construction remained robust in most 
markets and highway construction improved. The District drilling rig 
count increased in response to continued strength in natural gas 
prices. Retail sales increased slowly throughout most of the 
District. Agricultural conditions improved slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents in the manufacturing sector reported that orders 
were flat to slightly up. Respondents in the lumber and wood 
products, furniture and fixtures, and stone, clay and glass 
industries reported continued strong orders due to strength in the 
residential construction sector. Most manufacturing industries 
reported that inventories were either manageable or near desired 
levels and that capital spending remained weak. Respondents in the 
electrical and electronic equipment industry reported overall flat 
orders, although several respondents noted strength in orders tied 
to personal computer sales. Paper producers said that orders for 
most of their products have been flat. A producer of corrugated 
boxes noted a gradual rise in orders from manufacturers in Texas. 
One respondent noted an increase in exports of newsprint to Mexico. 
Oil field equipment producers reported weak demand, particularly 
from their international customers. Chemical producers said demand 
was weak from both the U.S. and European markets. Several industries 
that supply products to the health care sector reported declines in 
orders. High technology equipment and any disposable medical 
products are considered costly and respondents say that demand has 
been reduced in anticipation of the new health care plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in the service sector reported that employment and 
orders continue to grow at a slow pace. Respondents said that hiring 
in anticipation of growth is a thing of the past and that employment 
growth will only pick up after activity picks up. A respondent from 
the legal industry reported that a move by insurance companies to 
use more in-house lawyers has reduced demand at law firms. One 
health care respondent said that they are cutting patient costs, 
through procedures such as more outpatient surgery, in anticipation 
of health care reform.
     </p>
     <p>
      District construction and real estate activity continued to increase 
primarily due to strength in residential and highway construction. 
Respondents said that office vacancy rates remained high in 
Dallas/Ft. Worth and Houston, and commercial construction remained 
weak. Office vacancy rates continued to decline in Austin. Highway 
construction continued to increase as a result of the 1991 
transportation bill. New home demand was reported to be strong 
across most of Texas, but new home sales have recently weakened in 
Houston.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales increased slowly throughout most of the District. 
Several retailers reported that they lowered their selling prices to 
maintain market share and keep inventories from building up. A few 
respondents reported that they anticipate lowering prices because 
their inventories were larger than desired. Apparel sales were said 
to be particularly slow. Sales along the Mexican border continued to 
be below last year's level because Mexico increased enforcement of a 
$50 limit on goods brought back into Mexico by its residents. Auto 
sales were slightly above last year's level, with particularly 
strong sales in the San Antonio area.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District oil and gas rig count has increased since April 
primarily due to continued strength in natural gas prices. Natural 
gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was reported to be strong. Oil 
prices fell sharply throughout the first three weeks of July. 
Respondents reported that a large surplus of oil on the world market 
and the possibility of oil sales from Iraq has driven down oil 
prices. The recent declines in oil prices have clouded a previously 
positive outlook for drilling during the second half of the year. 
Respondents still expect drilling to increase during the remainder 
of 1993 due to continued strength of natural gas prices and the 
availability of previously budgeted funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand at district financial institutions slowed in recent 
months. Lack of borrower capital and insufficient cash flow were the 
most cited reasons for rejecting loans. Home mortgage originations 
and refinancings remain a bright spot.
     </p>
     <p>
      District farming and ranching conditions have improved slightly 
since the last survey. Most crops were in good condition and on 
schedule, although ranges and pastures were beginning to deteriorate 
from recent hot and dry conditions in most of the state. Cotton 
producers were optimistic about the potential for export expansion 
due to the smaller than anticipated yield of cotton in China. Crop 
prices were generally lower than last year while livestock prices 
were mostly higher.
