     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District economic conditions have been fairly good. The 
employment situation in the district has been favorable, with 
reports of shortages of workers for entry-level jobs. Consumer 
spending on general merchandise has been strong, automobile sales 
have continued to show large month-to-month fluctuations, and 
housing activity has continued at a moderate pace. Manufacturing 
activity has been mixed, and conditions in resource-related 
industries have been fairly good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district employment situation has been fairly good. Employers 
throughout the district reported difficulty finding workers for 
entry-level jobs even at wages well above the minimum wage. The 
ongoing expansion of the mining industry in Montana created strong 
demand for workers. Strong demand for workers was also reported from 
lumber expansion projects in northern Minnesota and the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan and prison construction in the Upper 
Peninsula. Nevertheless, skilled labor cost increases in the 
district remained at a moderate 3 to 4 percentage point range, with 
most of the increases due to fringe benefit costs. Unemployment 
rates in the district were roughly unchanged in the reporting period 
from the corresponding period a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending on general merchandise has continued to be strong. 
One retailer reports that October sales were 8.5 percent higher than 
a year ago in comparable stores and total sales in October were 16.2 
percent higher than in October 1988. An appliance retailer reports 
that October sales in comparable stores were 5 percent higher than a 
year ago. Inventories were reported to be at acceptable levels. 
Retailers were cautiously optimistic about year-end sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales have continued to show large month-to-month 
variability. Dealers for one domestic line report that sales in 
October were 25 percent lower than a year ago, but sales in the 
three-month period from August to October were up 25 percent from 
the same period a year ago. Inventories of cars and trucks were at 
unusually high levels. Reports indicated that conditions in the used 
car market were good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity has been basically unchanged from last year's 
levels. The number of new housing permits issued in Minnesota in 
September was 10 percent lower than in August but roughly the same 
as in September 1988. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, 
the number of new housing permits fell by 25 percent from August to 
September but was 3 percent higher than in September 1988. Housing 
sales in this metropolitan area in October were about 2 percent 
higher than in October 1988. A sharp reduction in construction of 
homes priced above $250,000 was reported. Considerable home 
remodeling activity was also reported. A director reports weakness 
in commercial construction in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area with few 
new projects being started and only previously committed projects 
going forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist spending has continued to be strong. Tourist associations in 
the district report many inquiries for the upcoming season. Most 
areas near the Canadian border reported strong demand from Canadian 
shoppers and tourists.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity has been generally mixed. There has been 
continued softness in the computer, electronics, and defense 
industries. Suppliers to the aircraft and aerospace industries 
report strong demand. Reports from the capital goods sector were 
mixed. Most manufacturers report to be investing cautiously in 
capital equipment, preferring to pay down debts unless the equipment 
can reduce operating costs immediately. Lingering drought worries 
also slowed equipment purchases by farmers in parts of the district, 
although ranchers showed signs of increasing their investments in 
capital goods. The expansion of the mining and lumber industries 
contributed to the fairly good demand for capital investment in the 
western and northern portions of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Resource-related industries have been doing fairly well. Conditions 
in agriculture were generally good, except in the western part of 
North Dakota, where fall precipitation was sparse. In Montana, the 
wheat and barley crop production was reported to have doubled over 
last year's levels. Farmland values continued to increase; prime 
corn and soybean lands in southern Minnesota sold for about $1,500 
per acre, with some instances of sales at $2,000 per acre. These 
prices are considerably higher than the depressed levels earlier in 
the decade. Cattle prices were reported to be high, and ranchers 
were optimistic about their prospects. Expansion in the lumber 
industry was brisk with new construction and expansion plans in all 
the lumber producing areas of the district. The mining industry also 
reports strong activity.
