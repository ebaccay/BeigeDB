     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in most areas is continuing to expand at a solid 
pace, although a number of Districts report scattered indications of 
some slowing or slight declines. Retail activity, which had 
moderated during the spring, appears to have picked up recently. 
Most Districts report sales of autos, building materials, and 
apparel are improved since their June report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several Districts are reporting a tightening in labor markets that, 
in some cases at least, has resulted in faster wage growth. However, 
labor shortages appear to be concentrated only in a few skilled 
occupations. The range of commodities for which prices are rising 
appears to have broadened somewhat. However, a majority of Districts 
report that retailers are holding the line on price increases, and 
profit margins are narrowing in a retail environment that continues 
to be characterized as intensely competitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand appears to be fairly strong in most Districts. 
Commercial and industrial borrowing has improved in many regions and 
consumer lending is particularly active. Even in California, where 
the business trend remains flat, a moderate expansion in lending 
activity is reported to be underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Virtually all Districts are seeing an expansion of industrial 
activity, with only scattered observations of weakness. Industries 
such as motor vehicles, capital goods including industrial 
machinery, heavy trucks, microelectronics, computers, mining and 
construction equipment, and nondurable goods producers like 
chemicals and textiles, are all reported to be expanding their 
production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity appears to be holding steady, although a drop-
off in residential construction was prominently noted in many 
District reports. Higher mortgage interest rates are commonly blamed 
for a slowdown in home sales and new construction, although the 
Dallas District also notes a very low inventory of new homes. At 
least a share of the slower residential construction activity 
appears to have been offset by moderately stronger commercial 
building.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail markets are, in most regions, stronger than in the spring, 
particularly in the areas of autos, building materials, and 
appliances. Even apparel sales are noted as having improved since 
the June report, although not in all Districts. Several regions also 
report a reasonably busy tourist season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although activity has improved in retailing, competitive pressures 
have kept profit margins lean-discounts and promotions are 
frequently noted. Retailers are guardedly optimistic about prospects 
over the remainder of year, with continued strength anticipated in 
the new car market. There also appears to be a growing enthusiasm 
over the coming back-to-school season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price increases are noted among a broad range of business materials 
including finished steel and steel scrap, copper, wood, paper and 
paperboard, building materials including brick and glass, and wool 
and other textile products. Energy costs have also moved up a bit in 
the past month or so. In construction and some manufacturing 
industries, higher materials costs are thought to be exerting upward 
pressure on finished goods prices. The Philadelphia District survey 
of manufacturers taken in July indicates that nearly 25 percent of 
firms were implementing price increases, up from 15 percent in their 
June survey. In the Boston District, about half of the manufacturing 
contacts have raised or plan to raise prices, by up to 5 percent. 
However, virtually all Districts report that competitive pressures 
are holding prices down at the retail level and, presumably, retail 
margins are being squeezed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several Districts indicate a general tightening in labor markets and 
an increase in help-wanted advertising is cited. However, few 
Districts see any broad-based wage pressures as a result. Actual 
labor shortages are mostly limited to occupations such as 
machinists, technicians, clerical workers, construction workers, and 
truck drivers, although shortages of some entry-level positions are 
also noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jobs expansion in the industrial sector is uneven by District and 
industry. The use of temporary workers and high levels of overtime 
are continuing, and some Districts report a continuing resistance by 
firms to permanently expand their payrolls. Manufacturing jobs are 
reported to be holding steady in the Boston and Richmond Districts. 
In Philadelphia, where manufacturing employment is also steady, an 
increasing proportion of firms report plans to add to their payrolls 
during the next six months. In other Districts, such as St. Louis, 
recalls and new hires are on the rise, and in Atlanta, jobs growth 
is seen in the chemicals, steel, and auto industries. Reports of 
jobs cutbacks are more rare, although several Districts report 
continued layoffs of aerospace workers, and the New York District 
notes some jobs losses as a result of restructuring in the financial 
and retail industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural regions of the country are generally reporting 
favorable growing conditions, and some crop prices are falling in 
anticipation of high yields. Earlier concerns about a potential 
drought in the Richmond and Chicago Districts seem to have lessened 
with late spring rains. And, although rainfall has been excessive in 
some areas, such as in parts of the St. Louis and Minneapolis 
Districts, crop yields there are still expected to be normal, or 
better. Agricultural exports are also strong, helped in part by the 
falling dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      The energy producing Districts note only a small increase in 
drilling and exploration activity as a result of the rise in oil 
prices. The Dallas District indicates that drilling activity has 
been focused on natural gas, although oil drilling is expected to 
improve through the end of the year. Other mining operations are 
reported to be running strong; iron-ore production for the year is 
exceeding industry expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Lending Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial bank lending remains active with high levels of' consumer 
borrowing noted in virtually all Districts. Commercial and 
industrial borrowing is noted as having strengthened in the 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco 
Districts. The only major lending category that may have diminished 
is residential mortgages. Higher mortgage interest rates are widely 
cited, although interest rates are marginally higher on most types 
of credit. Credit standards are apparently changed very little and a 
farther decline in credit delinquency rates is reported.
