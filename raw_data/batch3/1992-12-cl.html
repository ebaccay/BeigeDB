      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity in the Fourth District continues to expand 
unevenly across industries. Retailers, reporting stronger year-over-
year sales increases in October and early November, plan to carry 
larger inventories than they anticipated a few months ago. Growth in 
manufacturing production has revived in recent months, but some 
producers see no change in activity so far this quarter from last, 
while others report that orders and production are better than they 
estimated previously. Although District respondents anticipate 
larger gains in their business next year than in 1992, they foresee 
little growth in employment because of continued emphasis on 
productivity improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the Fourth District generally agree that sales in 
October and early November were better than they previously 
estimated. Consequently, they raised their sales estimates for the 
1992 holiday season, and now anticipate a larger percentage increase 
this year than last. One discount retailer, however, experienced 
smaller year-over-year gains, largely in apparel, which they believe 
may represent a shift by consumers to more upscale stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers attribute some of the recent unanticipated sales strength 
to special factors, especially the colder-than-usual weather in 
October, which boosted sales of outerwear and sweaters. They 
uniformly plan to build larger inventories than they previously 
expected, and one retailer has decided to expand its stocks of gift-
type goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists associated with consumer spending estimate a 2% to 3% 
increase in real consumer spending this quarter from last, which is 
slightly higher than their earlier forecasts, but a let-up from the 
rapid pace of the third quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers were disappointed that November new car sales weakened 
for both domestic and foreign makes, although light truck sales 
strengthened again. New car stocks are believed to be adequate, and 
dealers apparently will hold back on factory orders to prevent 
inventories from growing too rapidly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in manufacturing output has revived in recent months, but 
capital goods producers still report mixed activity so far in the 
fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some producers of electric motors and equipment, welding machinery, 
and industrial bearings report that business so far in the fourth 
quarter has been about unchanged from the third, perhaps because of 
talk about an investment tax credit next year, according to some 
industry sources. Orders and production of heavy-duty trucks, 
however, have been rising rapidly in recent months to levels that 
are approaching 1988 highs, although suppliers of truck components 
believe that the surge is associated with anticipated truck price 
increases. Some producers of industrial controls note signs of a 
turnaround in their business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers estimate that orders and production this quarter 
will be higher than they forecast only a few months ago. Operating 
rates of some producers are presently averaging close to 85% of 
capacity, with demand strongest for flat-rolled steel products. 
Hedging against a scheduled 3% steel price hike in January may be 
pulling some business from early next year into this quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto producers still estimate that production and new car sales this 
quarter will still be slightly higher than last, despite a sag in 
November new car sales. Production of light trucks continues to 
rise, partly at the expense of passenger cars. Market shares of the 
Big Three auto producers will likely benefit from more rapid 
increases in prices for foreign than domestic nameplates, according 
to some industry contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers and depository institutions plan no big step-up in 
employment next year, even though they anticipate more-rapid growth 
in their output and revenues. Achieving further productivity growth 
appears to be a common goal of District respondents.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some manufacturers believe that they have sufficient capacity to 
accommodate a higher production level in 1993 and can resort first 
to more overtime hours and then to a recall of laid-off workers 
before adding new employees. Only a few anticipate that their 
business will expand enough to require new hiring, and then probably 
not until next spring. Auto sources indicate no prospect for 
employment growth because of further long-term cutbacks by some 
producers and only replacement hiring by others.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some retailers are planning a larger increase in hirings for this 
holiday season than last, but many plan to achieve greater 
productivity growth by increasing use of technology, just-in-time 
stocking, and self-help centers within stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks report that they are aggressively seeking qualified borrowers, 
but that loan demand remains soft. They see more intense competition 
for business loans, with some banks apparently paring their margins 
to meet bank and nonbank competition. The exit of a major issuer of 
commercial paper has led to some recent increase in business loan 
activity, according to some lenders.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent heavy volume of mortgage refinancing has let up since the 
latest rise in mortgage interest rates, according to several banks 
and thrifts. A few large lenders, who did not increase their 
mortgage rates in recent months, report that loan refinancing and 
new mortgage loan applications in November were strong.
