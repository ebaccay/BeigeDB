      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Southeast's economy registered mixed performance as weaknesses 
in some sectors offset strengths in others. Petroleum still tops the 
list of several weak primary industries in the region. The farm 
economy remains depressed, and Alabama employment is suffering from 
coal mine closings. Some commodity exports may be on the rise, 
however. Vigorous construction and sales of single-family homes are 
promoting growth of domestic lumber, furniture, and other consumer 
durable goods production. Tourism too boosted the region's economy. 
Department store sales outpaced those in the nation, while District 
auto sales lagged the national rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional labor markets improved marginally from July to August; 
employment rose slightly, and the District unemployment rate fell by 
0.2 percent to 8.1 percent. The trade and service sectors 
contributed most of the job growth, while manufacturing continued to 
edge below year-ago levels. Only Georgia and Tennessee, with 
unemployment rates of 6.0 and 7.9 percent, respectively, posted 
declines from a year ago. Mississippi's rate increased to 12.7 
percent, the nation's highest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Declining petroleum revenues have diminished tax revenues in 
Louisiana and Mississippi. In especially hard-hit Louisiana, the 
governor has imposed a 10 percent cutback in state expenditures at 
all levels. New Orleans faces severe revenue shortfalls as well. 
Total employment declined in August in Mississippi, Louisiana, and 
Florida. Bank directors report that large Florida computer 
manufacturers are cutting job rolls as a result of stiff competition 
and weakness in the computer market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand by the housing industry is stimulating regional lumber 
production, although contacts in Mississippi report continued 
weakening in that state. The furniture industry has been expanding 
rapidly in Tennessee and Mississippi, and home appliance producers 
in the region have noted accelerating demand, both outcomes due to 
an increase in home building. Textile industry spokesmen note that 
their capital spending has gone mainly to productivity enhancement 
and not to expansion. Department of Defense spending on 
shipbuilding, uniforms, and electronics is boosting business 
activity in the region. Tennessee's aluminum shipments, however, 
have weakened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Through July, southeastern year-to-date sales growth continued to 
outpace that of the nation. However, retailers reported poor sales 
of apparel and durable goods during September due to unseasonably 
hot weather. Low automobile finance rates diverted funds from 
purchases of other items such as appliances and furniture. Most 
District retailers are reporting favorable sales increases over 
year-earlier levels, but some Louisiana retailers are still plagued 
by double-digit sales declines. The sluggish sales pace is inducing 
retailers to maintain lean inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car buyers in the region responded to the special financing programs 
introduced by manufacturers in September. As a result, inventories 
of unsold l986 models were virtually exhausted by the second week of 
the program. Still, the fall sales pace in the region was much below 
the comparable rate nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family residential building and sales maintained most of 
their strength through mid-October, though a second consecutive 
monthly decline in single-family building permits (seasonally 
adjusted, three-month moving average) suggests construction may slow 
soon. Aggressive construction has boosted builder inventories, 
although these are not yet viewed as troublesome in most markets. 
According to an Orlando source, apartment tenant turnover has 
accelerated because lower mortgage rates have narrowed the gap 
between rental and mortgage payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      District commercial developers face increasingly strict preleasing 
requirements prior to construction loan approval. Additions to 
established complexes or new construction in developed areas qualify 
for lower preleasing requirements; "pioneering" projects are subject 
to higher standards. Though quoted office lease rates are holding 
steady, sizeable concessions are pandemic in District markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      August loan growth at large commercial banks in the District 
declined two percentage points from year-earlier levels due 
primarily to slower consumer lending advances. Bankers blame the low 
auto finance rates offered by automobile manufacturers for much of 
the decline. Bank contacts in Nashville and Tampa add that high 
consumer debt levels and rising bankruptcy rates are creating a more 
cautious lending atmosphere. District bankers acknowledge they will 
have to create new consumer products to supplement those made less 
attractive by tax reform, such as IRAs and home equity loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism in the Southeast remains generally strong; increases have 
been noted for both automobile and air travel. Cruise ship bookings 
are also solid, industry sources report. Foreign travel to the 
United States seems to be rebounding. Miami hotel occupancy is up 
slightly due to increased travel from Brazil and Chile. Hotel 
occupancy has been off in many regional cities because of 
construction of many new lodging facilities. Louisiana has closed 20 
out of 32 state-operated travel attractions and is laying off 
tourist-related employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      At mid-year, southeastern banks held $70 million (2 percent) less in 
farm loans than at the same time last year. Declines of nearly 10 
percent in Louisiana and Mississippi were partially offset by a 17 
percent rise in Florida farm loans. The difference in lending 
behavior reflects the lesser financial distress of Florida's farm 
sector. Regional farm cash receipts are trending 13 percent lower 
than In 1985, but farm income will be supplemented by heavy 
government payments to cotton and grain farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Southeastern coal production for the first eight months of 1986 fell 
approximately 8 percent below the same period in 1985 as a result of 
Alabama mine closures. With modest oil price increases, the 
Louisiana petroleum industry is showing renewed signs of life. Since 
reaching a low of 92 operating rigs in early August, the state rig 
count has climbed to 120. Reports from primary industries indicate a 
recent improvement in export volume.
