      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity rose in some sectors in November and 
stayed about even in most others, while optimism about the economic 
future generally softened. Manufacturers and department stores 
reported increase in activity. Other retail activity and residential 
construction were also reported to be generally firm. City bankers 
reported loan demand to be even with last month, while agricultural 
bankers were optimistic about financial and income prospects for 
farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decline in the stock market has apparently had a significant 
effect on business expectations, but not on plans for capital 
spending. Our business and financial contacts are now less 
optimistic than they were a few weeks ago about prospects for 
economic growth. Also, a higher percentage now expect inflation to 
increase. Only a small proportion, however, indicated changes in 
their capital spending intentions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most department stores reported that their sales were higher in mid-
November than they were in late October and at this time a year ago. 
In general, store managers expect a good Christmas
season.
     </p>
     <p>
      The combined responses of all kinds of retail establishments 
indicated that sales have been about flat overall in recent weeks. 
Several retail executives reported declines in the sale of big-
ticket items, and nearly half of the respondents reported increases 
in their inventories. Retail employment was steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers said the stock market decline had had no effect on 
their business, although a few thought it had reduced consumer 
demand somewhat. A small number of retail respondents said their 
firms had decided to postpone some planned fixed investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity expanded in early November, although 
at a slower pace than earlier this year. Forty percent of the 
respondents to our regular mail survey reported increased shipments 
in November, as compared with 52 percent who reported increases in 
September. The responses also indicated that new orders and 
employment grew less rapidly, the workweek increased less, and the 
backlog of orders was unchanged. Manufacturers reported somewhat 
higher inventories of materials and finished goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prices of raw materials and finished products continued to rise, 
according to District manufacturers. A small but higher-than-normal 
percentage of producers reported experiencing shortages of some 
materials. Perhaps because of these shortages and rising input 
prices, two-fifths of manufacturers have raised their estimates of 
inflation in 1988. Only one-sixth have lowered their estimates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fraction of manufacturers expecting growth in their firms in the 
next six months declined from our previous survey. About one-third 
now believe their shipments and new order will rise, compared with 
about one-half in the previous survey. Most manufacturers indicated 
that they plan to reduce their inventories of both materials and 
finished goods in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers participating in our survey also appear to 
have become less optimistic in their outlook for the national 
economy. Thirty-four percent of the respondents now believe the 
level of general business activity in the nation will decline in the 
next six months while 24 percent expect it to increase. In our 
previous survey of manufacturers, these percentages were 18 and 43, 
respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our survey regularly asks manufacturers about their current and 
expected capital spending. This month we included a second question 
regarding how the stock market crash had affected their plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      The distribution of responses to the regular questions showed no 
change from the two previous surveys. About one-fifth of the 
manufacturers indicated that they had increased their current 
capital spending from a month ago, and about three-fourths reported 
no change. Looking ahead six months, about three of ten producers 
expect to increase spending, while about two in ten expect to reduce 
it. It bears repeating that these numbers are virtually identical to 
those from the previous survey, conducted in late September.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding the second question on the impact of the market crash on 
spending plans, 80 percent of the respondents indicated that the 
crash had not affected their plans. However, six percentâ€”all of 
them producers of durable goodsâ€”reported that they had decided to 
scale back their plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of builders and realtors in the District indicated 
generally firm demand for single-family homes over the last few 
weeks. Some firms reported that the October stock market decline 
decreased customer traffic for a week or two, but others saw no 
noticeable effect. Most respondents agreed that recent declines in 
mortgage rates have helped stimulate their business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A mail survey of District agricultural banks indicated increased 
optimism about the financial and income prospects for agriculture. 
Farmland prices were reported to be higher than in the previous 
quarter, and all respondents expect land prices to be stable or to 
move higher in the next three months. Respondents said that loan 
repayment rates had increased, and over two-thirds of the 
agricultural banks indicated that they were actively seeking new 
farm loans. Several banks attributed the improved income prospects 
for farmers to farm price support programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of District financial institutions indicated that the 
demands for commercial, consumer, and home equity loans have not 
changed in the last month from previous levels. Opinions about the 
outlook for the next six months were mixed, with more than half of 
the bankers expecting increased loan activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead to economic conditions six months from now, most 
bankers are optimistic that the trade deficit will be lower. 
However, they expect slower economic growth, higher inflation, and a 
higher unemployment rate.
