      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Firms headquartered in the Southeast continue to report business 
activity growing although many believe that it will slow. Reported 
upward revisions in capital spending plans by several manufacturers, 
indications of producers' expanding capacity, and strong export 
demand provide evidence of continued growth. At the same time, there 
are also reports of undesired accumulations of inventories in 
construction materials, agricultural supplies, paper materials, 
automobiles and retail goods at department stores. On the price 
front, our contacts are indicating generally stable prices for most 
producer inputs used in their operations. Labor costs are an 
exception; contacts say that nonwage benefits have been rising 
rapidly and report that localized shortages of skilled and non-
skilled workers are generating some upward pressure on wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Reports of Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of our contacts indicate that while business activity is still 
growing, its pace is slowing. A few contacts, primarily in export 
related sectors, indicated a recent increase in demand and 
corresponding plans to expand output. Several manufacturers have 
reported that they have recently increased their capital spending 
plans. A chemical producer is restarting an idle plant, while a 
plastics manufacturer is planning to purchase new equipment to 
expand output. Several oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico 
note that capital spending has been more rapid than expected as the 
result of oil price increases. Sixteen mobile drilling rigs have 
recently been put back into operation. On the agricultural side, 
strong demand for poultry has prompted one producer to expand 
processing capacity by 50 percent. Financial institutions are 
reporting a slight weakening in overall consumer lending and credit 
reference firms report no unusual trends in consumer credit, except 
reductions in new auto loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Inventory Picture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The overall inventory picture as painted by our contacts shows some 
moderation in economic activity resulting in unanticipated inventory 
building in some sectors while other sectors continue to experience 
substantial growth and inventory tightness. Undesired accumulation 
was reported in weaker sectors of the economy. A supplier of 
building materials notes that inventories are higher than desired, 
as does a producer of chemicals used in construction. Stocks of 
crushed rock have started to accumulate, and one producer has cut 
production hours 15 percent. Producers are reporting increased 
inventories of some chemicals and plastics. Agricultural supplies 
have been building up as some farmers delay or cancel plantings due 
to heavy rains in the Southeast. Several financial firms noted 
increased loan demand to finance higher inventories at some 
department stores but especially at auto dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      To balance the inventory picture somewhat, reports of desired 
accumulation and tightness were also received. A paper manufacturer 
reports a buildup of box inventories, but this was intentional in 
anticipation of increased demand later in the year. Several large 
retailers indicated that inventories are at desirable levels. A 
producer of telecommunication equipment reported less than desirable 
stocks in part because of increased export demand. Because of higher 
demand for electricity and strong export demand, coal stocks are 
below the level desired by producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Price Pressures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Southeastern contacts do not report strong concern about price 
pressures. In fact, they indicate that partly as a result of 
unintended inventory accumulation, some downward pressures could 
develop. A producer of chemicals and plastics reports that 
increasing supplies of primary chemicals are expected to cause price 
reductions later this year. He added that the demand for certain 
thermoplastics and polyvinylchloride compounds has eased recently 
because of slowdowns in construction. A plastic container 
manufacturer who had earlier expected to raise prices did not 
because of an improved supply of resins and corrugated packaging.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper prices have recently backed off from the increased levels 
established early in 1989, and one producer anticipates further 
cuts. Weakness in the price of linerboard was also reported, and one 
paper manufacturer reports that while demand is strong, it is weaker 
than expected earlier this year. And a producer of wood pulp noted 
that his firm's price is currently 10 percent higher than that of 
some European producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those surveyed report scattered labor market shortages but do not 
regard generalized wage pressures as substantial. Wage increases are 
generally reported below 5 percent. The cost of employee benefits, 
however, has been rising more rapidly and many contacts report they 
have been trying to reduce nonwage compensation to control costs, in 
particular, medical coverages for employee dependents is being 
restricted.
     </p>
     <p>
      One respondent indicated that wages for unskilled, outdoor labor in 
Nashville are often well above minimum wage levels. Entry level 
workers for hotels and restaurants are in short supply, and a large 
Atlanta retailer reports that entry level wages have been under 
constant pressure, although productivity increases have so far 
offset wage gains. The shortage of registered nurses continues, with 
wages rising faster than inflation. One banker in Atlanta has found 
it difficult to locate experienced managers and skilled clerical 
help. A producer of lumber and paper indicated that mandatory Sunday 
overtime is being eliminated and that the firm has seen no unusual 
pressure on wages.
