      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic developments in the Second District were mixed in recent 
weeks, but on balance tended toward improvement. Plagued by severe 
snowstorms, most retail contacts reported sales results below plan 
during February and March, though some were able to recoup much of 
their shortfall during the final weeks of March. New York's 
unemployment rate declined in February and March while New Jersey's 
rate rose. Office leasing activity varied widely with some vacancy 
rates declining and others increasing. Homebuilders in most of the 
District reported some recent improvement and anticipate that home 
sales will surpass last year's level. In its first assessment of the 
local economic impact of the World Trade Center bombing, the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey estimated that the net short-
term effect would be a small, positive one due to the increase in 
jobs for reconstruction and cleanup work financed by national 
insurers. Personal income tax receipts in both New York and New 
Jersey continued to show sizable over-the-year gains. The latest 
survey of small and midsized banks showed an increase in their 
willingness to make loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Plagued by severe snowstorms in February and March, most District 
retail contacts reported sales results that were less-than-targeted 
during both months. Some, however, were able to recoup much of their 
shortfall in the final weeks of March. Due in part to the earlier 
occurrence of Easter this year, some improvement was also noted 
during the first half of April. Over-the-year sales changes ranged 
from -7 percent to +6 1/2 percent in February with all retailers 
except one posting results that were below projections. A few more 
retailers had results that were on or better than plan during March 
when year-to-year changes ranged from -5 percent to +12 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cold and stormy weather reportedly put a damper on sales of 
adult spring apparel at several stores, but sales of children's 
clothes for Easter did well. Furniture and home appliances sold well 
at some chains and retailers are hopeful that warmer weather will 
spur apparel sales in the weeks ahead. Despite some recent inventory 
buildup resulting from below-plan sales, the majority of contacts 
reported no significant inventory problems. However, a few stated 
that additional promotional efforts may be needed to pare stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in most of the District reported some recent 
improvement in the residential construction market and most 
anticipate that home sales this year will surpass last year's level. 
The continued low level of mortgage rates and somewhat more 
enthusiasm on the part of potential buyers at home shows were cited 
for this optimism. In addition, in New York City several well-known 
developers are reportedly planning to build new rental apartment 
buildings for the first time in several years. Apparently, these are 
now feasible because of a declining vacancy rate for market-priced
rental units and because of recent changes in local and federal tax 
laws. No one is anticipating boom conditions, however, given the 
continuing concerns about job security in various parts of the 
District and general uncertainty about the impact of proposed 
changes in federal tax policy. Lumber prices remain quite high and 
some newly written contracts are guaranteeing home prices for only 
30 days to safeguard builders against further escalation of lumber 
costs. Financing remains a widespread problem for construction as 
well as acquisition and development loans in some areas. However, a 
recent easing of bank construction loans was noted in western New 
York.
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the District's office market have been mixed. 
Leasing activity was reportedly brisk in midtown Manhattan where, 
despite some additions to space, the vacancy rate edged down. While 
activity in downtown Manhattan remained subdued, the area has 
managed to absorb some of its vacant space in recent months and the 
primary vacancy rate has begun to decline. The vacancy rate has 
risen sharply in Westchester County, however, due in part to the 
addition of large blocks of space created by IBM's downsizing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New York's unemployment rate declined in both February and March and 
now stands at 7.3 percent. However, New Jersey's rate rose in both 
months, reaching 8.3 percent in March. Personal income tax receipts 
in both states continue to show sizable over-the-year increases 
implying moderate gains in personal income. Layoffs have started at 
the IBM plants in New York State where some 6000 positions are to be 
eliminated. With the Justice Department's recent approval of Martin 
Marietta's purchase of G.E.'s aerospace division, many additional 
workers could be laid off in the District as the division is 
absorbed. A recent report by the Business Council of New York State 
noted that a sizable majority of 800 surveyed businesses believe the 
State's recovery will lag behind the rest of the nation and that 
this will continue in 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      In its first assessment of the local economic impact of the World 
Trade Center bombing, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey 
estimated that the net short-term effect would be a small, positive 
one. Since almost all of the damage to businesses was insured, the 
reconstruction and cleanup effort was largely financed from outside 
the region but provided jobs for people living here. The long-term 
effect could be different, however, if insurance premiums rise, 
revenue is lost because the Center decides to restrict public access 
to certain facilities and/or the prestige of the Center is reduced 
as a result of the bombing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The latest survey of small and midsized banks in the Second District 
continued to show an increase in banks' willingness to make loans. 
The percentage of loan officers more willing to make nonresidential 
mortgages was the highest since 1991. Willingness to make all other 
types of loans was steady or higher than two months ago. Consumer 
loan demand and residential mortgage demand strengthened. with the 
latter generally attributed to increased refinancing activity. 
Demand for business loans was unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Surveyed bankers indicated that the recent policy change requiring 
less documentation on "character" loans by healthy banks has not 
affected their lending to small businesses. Moreover, their 
reactions to proposals to create a secondary market for business 
loans were mixed. Several officers mentioned that securitization 
often results in the loss of relationships with the community, which 
are essential to small business lending. Also cited as a potential 
hindrance was the customized and unique nature of small business 
loans, which renders them difficult to securitize. However, 
increased liquidity and reduced risk might encourage more small 
business lending. Several officers suggest that the expansion of 
Small Business Administration programs would be the best vehicle for 
stimulating small business loans.
