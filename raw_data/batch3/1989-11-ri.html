     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The performance of the District economy in late September and early 
October showed little change from a month earlier, although the 
impact of Hurricane Hugo was clearly evident. Retail sales, which 
rose somewhat overall, were strong in some categories and weak in 
others. Manufacturing activity was also mixed and about unchanged on 
balance following a small increase in August. Most District 
financial institutions reported steady loan demand. The tourist 
industry expects a good fall season, with hotel and motel bookings 
above those of last year, although hurricane damage and the 
publicity surrounding it may have a negative impact in some local 
areas in South Carolina. The District agricultural sector as a whole 
should finish the year strong, despite considerable damage in the 
Carolinas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey indicated that retail sales in the District 
rose in the first part of October. Department store sales were up 
after being flat in September, but sales of big ticket items were 
unchanged. After increasing in September, car sales fell in early 
October. Most retailers expect their sales to rise in the next six 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to our regular manufacturing survey reported mixed 
activity in September following a small increase in August. (Many of 
our usual respondents from South Carolina did not respond to this 
survey.) Shipments and new orders were up slightly, unfilled orders 
and employment were down, and the length of the workweek and new 
export orders were flat. Prices for finished goods and raw materials 
continued to rise, but at a slower rate than in August. Inventories 
of materials and finished goods were largely unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers were somewhat more optimistic than in August 
about prospects for growth in their businesses in the next six 
months. Respondents who expect increases in sales, new orders, and 
employment outnumbered those who expect declines. However, more 
manufacturers anticipate decreases than increases in unfilled orders 
and the length of the workweek.
     </p>
     <p>
      The effects of Hurricane Hugo on the industrial base of South 
Carolina and North Carolina appear to be small. Most textile plants 
were not located in the path of the storm, and we have no reports of 
damage to furniture plants, although Hugo traveled directly through 
some of the major furniture production areas of the Carolinas and 
Virginia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Power outages did reduce industrial production somewhat. For 
example, furniture production in North Carolina, where about 25 
percent of U.S. furniture is manufactured, declined about 1 to 2 
percent during September. Pulp and paper production was also reduced 
somewhat by power outages and, apparently, because some logging 
roads were temporarily impassable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports received from the three major District portsâ€”Hampton Roads 
(Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimoreâ€”showed imports were higher in 
September than in August at Hampton Roads and Baltimore, but were 
lower at Charleston where the port was closed for five days because 
of the hurricane. The export picture was mixed with shipments 
slightly higher at Baltimore, lower at Charleston and about the same 
at Hampton Roads.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, resorts, and divisions of 
tourism indicated that tourist activity was above that of last fall. 
About half of the respondents indicated increased activity while 
about one-fourth experienced declines. About two-fifths of the 
hotels and motels reported an increase in fall bookings when 
compared to last year, and the remaining three-fifths saw little 
change. Approximately two-thirds of the respondents expect tourist 
activity in the coming months to be better than usual and none of 
the respondents expect declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to South Carolina's Division of Travel and Tourism 
Development, 85 percent of the hotels in the Charleston area have 
reopened. About one-third of the hotel business for the month was 
lost because of the hurricane. Fall bookings are about the same as 
last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of financial institutions indicated that demand 
for commercial and industrial loans remained steady over the last 
thirty days. Most lenders reported no change in the rate of loan 
growth from a month ago, though a few reported slight increases or 
decreases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The demand for home mortgage loans appeared to strengthen in most 
parts of the District in the last thirty days, although reports from 
the Washington, D.C. area were mixed. Elsewhere in the District, a 
few lenders reported a slight downturn in mortgage loan activity, 
but the majority said that the demand for mortgage loans was at or 
above the levels of the previous month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the fall harvest nearly complete, yields for most crops appear 
excellent. Recent rainfall across the District has not hampered 
harvest activity substantially, but has caused delays in the fall 
planting of small grains. Prospects for 1989 farm income generally 
appear bright, though the impact of hurricane damage in the 
Carolinas is not yet fully known. Farmland prices are reported to be 
steady or rising in most areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hurricane Hugo did extensive damage to the agricultural sectors in 
both South Carolina and North Carolina. In South Carolina, USDA 
estimates total crop losses at roughly $80 million, with cotton, 
corn, and soybeans all hard hit. Structural damage totaled about 
$270 million. Estimates of livestock damage were incomplete, but 
thousands of head of cattle and hogs were reportedly destroyed, 
along with 2.7 million chickens and turkeys. Overall losses to the 
South Carolina farm sector are believed to be close to $1 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      In North Carolina, USDA estimates total crop losses were near $40 
million, with corn accounting for about half of the total. Poultry 
industry losses were also approximately $40 million. Total damage is 
estimated to be in the vicinity of $175 million.
