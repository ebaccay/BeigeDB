      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 18, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts around the District, business activity in the 
Southeast continued to expand through the end of 1994, although more 
slowly than earlier in the year. Most retailers reported that the 
holiday shopping season went well. Sales generally met expectations, 
but many contacts had to use more discounting than they would have 
liked in order to generate business. Auto sales were reported as 
steady. Tourism and business travel contacts say activity remains 
above year-ago levels in most of the District; however, parts of the 
Florida tourism industry have not yet fully recovered from their 
year-long slowdown. Single-family home building and sales have 
continued to slow, and most contacts expect a moderately slower 
1995. On the other hand, commercial real estate market reports 
continue to improve. District wages and prices were generally 
steady; however, there were an increasing number of reports of tight 
labor markets and higher materials prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that sales in December met or exceeded 
their expectations; however, retailers attributed much of their 
success to aggressive promotions. Several merchants stated that 
unseasonably warm weather held sales down a bit. Once again, men's 
apparel and home products were strong sellers and several retailers 
noted substantial improvements in women's apparel over last year. 
Retailers said after-holiday inventories were, for the most part, at 
anticipated levels. Most contacts expect year-over-year sales gains 
to continue, although same are concerned that the credit card debt 
incurred during December will curtail consumers' purchases more than 
usual during the first quarter of 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers reported ongoing spotty growth in December 
and early January. Strength in orders for paper, pulp, metals, and 
industrial chemicals is keeping plants in these industries operating 
near capacity. Auto parts suppliers continue to announce 
construction of new production facilities in the region. Some 
producers of electronics for cable television and data 
communications report order backlogs increasing at double-digit 
rates. Producers of home textiles such as sheets and towels are 
optimistic that business will remain strong. However, respondents 
note that the market has softened for other products linked to 
housing such as building products and heating and air-conditioning 
equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the apparel industry continue to report a shrinking 
factory workweek and payrolls. Temporary help firms supplying 
personnel for manufacturers report that the pace of placements 
remains brisk. Foreign orders for military aircraft have brightened 
the outlook for Lockheed's Marietta, Georgia, facility. However, 
recent cancellations or scalebacks of U.S. Department of Defense 
contracts continue to adversely affect many defense-related firms in 
the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent peso devaluation has some regional manufacturers 
concerned that exports of their products will slow as U.S.-made 
products become more expensive in Mexico. A broad range of regional 
industries has posted significant gains in exports to Mexico since 
NAFTA was enacted last January. Most industrial contacts remain 
optimistic about the near-term outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Winter bookings and occupancies are up for some Florida 
destinations; however, state officials are concerned that rival 
destinations are capturing a significant portion of the state's 
marks. Weak early winter cruise bookings are expected to pick up in 
February following an unusually soft fall season, partly attributed 
to unseasonable weather. Although overall casino traffic in 
Mississippi continues to grow and larger firms continue to expand, 
contacts report that weaker firms are laying off employees or filing 
for bankruptcy. Interest in the 1996 Olympic Games is sharply 
increasing foreign visits to Atlanta.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A majority of real estate contacts reported that single-family home 
sales and construction slowed slightly in December. However, 
contacts in the Miami and Nashville markets stated that December 
sales exceeded year-ago levels. Most real estate agents and builders 
continue to anticipate a modest decline in home sales and 
construction in 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report 
improving market conditions. The apartment market is characterized 
by steadily rising rental rates and high occupancy levels. Contacts 
say that, as a result, multifamily construction is on the rise in 
many areas of the District. Commercial realtors also report 
declining vacancy rates and steadily increasing rental rates. While 
commercial construction is reportedly accelerating, the majority of 
current construction is build-to-suit with most of the space leased 
prior to building, leaving very little speculative space available. 
However, builders say that shortages of skilled labor continue to 
push building costs up. Realtors anticipate both commercial and 
multifamily markets will exhibit continued strong growth in 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to District bankers, overall loan demand has been rising 
modestly. Most contacts reported that business loan demand was up, 
while consumer loan demand was slightly off. Commercial real estate 
lending was reported to be fairly active by several contacts. 
Weakness in consumer loan demand was accounted for mainly by auto 
lending. Residential mortgage lending has declined. Commercial and 
consumer default rates remain low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of upward pressures on wages are becoming more frequent 
among contacts surveyed. Demand in the areas of skilled construction 
and food services personnel is especially strong in parts of the 
District. Manufacturers report that prices of raw materials continue 
to escalate, and more producers expect to be able to increase final 
product prices. Paper, chemicals, metals, and textile contacts 
continue to report rising raw materials prices. Apparel and fabric 
producers are coming under increasing pressure from raw materials 
price increases, but are reportedly not able to raise finished 
product prices because of consumer bargain hunting pressures at the 
retail level. A few companies report that higher than usual 
inventories at the end of 1994 are designed to help offset 
anticipated additional price increases in 1995. Residential 
homebuilders throughout the District report that both materials and 
labor costs have stabilized, generally steadying home prices.
