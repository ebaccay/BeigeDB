      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Signs of softening activity were apparent in most sectors of the 
Third District economy in early January. Manufacturers continued to 
report declining business and employment. Retailers generally 
reported flat sales for the Christmas shopping season, in dollar 
terms. Bankers indicated that commercial and industrial lending was 
edging down and growth in consumer lending was slackening. Real 
estate lending remained curtailed and debt restructurings were 
beginning to reduce outstanding commercial real estate debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook is clouded by potential developments in the Persian Gulf 
crisis, according to business contacts. They are virtually unanimous 
in citing the situation, however it is resolved, as a depressing 
influence on their own businesses. Looking beyond the crisis, 
expectations are that the economic slowdown will last through most 
of the year and perhaps into early 1992. Manufacturers' overall view 
of the economy is pessimistic, and they plan to make more cuts in 
employment and capital spending. Retailers generally expect only a 
slow improvement in sales beginning late in 1991, and then only if 
there are clear signs of renewed economic expansion to boost 
consumer confidence. Bankers expect weak loan demand through most of 
the year as both businesses and consumers cut spending plans. 
Bankers also indicated they will continue to limit commercial real 
estate lending; it appears that debt restructurings in this segment 
of real estate lending, combined with slow residential activity, 
will result in a reduction in total real estate loan volume 
outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued to slip as 
the new year began. Nearly half of the industrial firms polled in 
January indicated that business was falling off from December while 
only one-in-eight noted improvement. Although nondurable goods 
producers generally were experiencing relatively weaker conditions 
than durable goods makers, negative reports outnumbered positive 
indications in every major industry segment except electrical 
machinery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, Third District manufacturers said they were continuing to 
see drops in shipments, new orders, and order backlogs. Employment 
was also softening, on balance. While half of the firms contacted 
were maintaining steady employment, one-third were cutting work 
forces and an equal number were reducing working hours. Industrial 
prices are apparently responding to the slackness in the 
manufacturing sector. While a slight majority of area firms reported 
that they were maintaining steady prices for the goods they make, 
prices were being reduced by one-out-of-five companies surveyed; 
and, although nearly one-third noted rising input costs, more than 
half indicated that the prices of the goods they buy were unchanged 
from a month ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, negative expectations edge out positive views among 
Third District manufacturers, and the balance of opinion is that the 
current down trend in industrial activity will continue to midyear. 
Individual forecasts vary considerably but, overall, managers at 
area plants expect no growth in either new orders or shipments over 
the next six months. In response to the dim outlook, local 
manufacturers plan to trim employment further and they intend to 
scale back capital spending slightly between now and midsummer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from merchants indicate that sales for the Christmas season 
ran even with 1989 results, in dollar terms. Some stores made slight 
gains and a few fell well below their year-ago performance. Nearly 
all store executives contacted for this report said they made 
extensive reductions from original selling prices in order to meet 
sales targets. As a result, it appears that volume sales goals were 
nearly achieved and leftover inventories are not significantly 
higher than anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Store officials said they continue to be extremely cautious in 
planning for the rest of the year. In their view, near-term 
prospects depend on developments in the Persian Gulf and their 
effect on consumer sentiment. Looking somewhat further out, 
merchants generally do not expect sales to improve until the second 
half, and then only if the overall economy shows signs of renewed 
vigor and consumer confidence improves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at major Third District banks in late December was 
approximately 9 percent above the December 1989 level, with growth 
largely due to gains in consumer lending. Commercial and industrial 
loan volume was down slightly, year-over-year, and bankers contacted 
in January said demand for business loans remained weak. Real estate 
loan volume was up from year-earlier levels, but bankers indicated 
that outstandings were beginning to decline as a result of payoffs 
and commercial real estate loan write-downs while new loan 
commitments remain limited. Personal lending in late December was 
up, but the gain appeared to be less than the usual seasonal 
increase, and bankers indicated that growth appeared to be easing in 
early January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers generally expect weak loan demand throughout the year. They 
cite the Persian Gulf situation as a restraining influence on the 
demand for credit; and, looking further ahead, several bankers said 
they expect an economic slowdown to persist well beyond midyear, 
further dampening the demand for loans by businesses and consumers.
