      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District appeared mixed in early 
October. Activity in the manufacturing sector eased, according to 
surveyed firms, while retail and banking contacts reported some 
improvement. While half of the area manufacturers contacted recently 
said new orders were running at a steady rate, the number of firms 
that indicated drops in orders slightly exceeded the number noting 
gains. Area retailers reported a modest increase in sales, on 
balance, in the first half of October, continuing an upward trend 
they noted in September. Auto dealers gave mixed reports, but it 
appeared that sales were running at a steady rate. Bankers generally 
reported continuing gains in residential mortgage lending for both 
refinancings and purchases, and steady to slightly growing consumer 
lending. Some bankers said commercial and industrial lending had 
picked up recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District business contacts is modestly 
positive. Despite recent signs of softness, a majority of the 
manufacturers polled look for improvement over the winter, and 
nearly a third plan to step up hiring. Retailers expect the current 
trend of rising sales to result in a slightly better fourth quarter 
this year compared to last. Bankers' expectations are muted; most of 
those queried said loan growth would remain slow in the months 
ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District appears to have slipped 
somewhat in recent weeks. Of those industrial firms contacted in 
early October, the number who reported that they had experienced 
some slowing in business in recent weeks slightly exceeded the 
number who noted gains. On balance, Third District manufacturers 
said new orders were running at a slower rate in October than had 
been achieved in September, with drops especially noted among makers 
of transportation equipment, nonelectrical machinery, rubber and 
plastics, and metal products. Printing firms also reported declines 
in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment indicators at Third District manufacturing plants also 
showed some deterioration in October compared to September. Although 
two-thirds of the firms contacted for this report were keeping 
employment steady, more companies were cutting back their workweeks 
and reducing employee levels than were extending hours or hiring 
more workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite these recent signs of softening business, most Third 
District manufacturers believe that the upturn in the region's 
manufacturing sector that began in the spring of this year is still 
on course. More than two-thirds expect business to improve over the 
next six months, and nearly two-thirds forecast increases in new 
orders for their products. While half indicated they will keep 
employment at current levels, nearly a third plan to hire more 
workers over the winter. One-third of the region's manufacturers 
contacted for this report also plan to step up capital spending 
while half will maintain such outlays at the current rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in early and mid October 
generally indicated that the slight pickup in sales they had 
experienced in September was continuing, resulting in year-over-year 
gains of a few percentage points for the first half of October, in 
dollar terms. These increases, although slight, appeared to extend 
to most types of stores and most lines of merchandise. Some 
merchants noted that the selling environment remained difficult, 
requiring discounting and other promotional efforts. Auto dealers 
gave mixed reports, but, on balance, the sales rate in the first 
weeks of October appeared to be steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Store officials said they were unable to give specific forecasts for 
the important fourth quarter, but most of those contacted expected 
sales to exceed the year-ago level slightly. In general, merchants 
said they were keeping inventories lean and looking for cost savings 
to bolster profits as they anticipate that growth in sales will be 
slow. Auto dealers generally believe that sales will just inch up 
during the balance of the year as 1992 models are cleared out. Some 
dealers expect stronger growth next spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in early 
October was slightly above the month-ago level. Most of the banks 
contacted for this report indicated that the growth of residential 
mortgage lending was continuing. Some indicated that the pace of 
refinancings was slackening while purchase mortgage lending was 
still moving up at a steady rate. Some bankers also noted that 
commercial and industrial loan demand had picked up in recent weeks. 
These bankers indicated that companies in a variety of industries 
were seeking new credit facilities. Most of the commercial bank 
lending officers surveyed said consumer lending at their 
institutions was level or moving up very slightly. Most of the gains 
appeared to be in home equity loans and credit lines while other 
installment loans and credit card lending was flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, bankers said the outlook for lending is uncertain, and 
none predicted accelerating growth. Bankers who noted recent gains 
in commercial and industrial lending said this was an encouraging 
development, but they were not convinced a sustained upturn had 
begun. Similarly, most of the bankers contacted this month do not 
expect strong growth in consumer lending.
