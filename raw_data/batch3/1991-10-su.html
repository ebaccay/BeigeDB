      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sources contacted by the Federal Reserve banks generally described 
the economy in September and early October as weak or growing 
slowly. In most districts there has been little improvement in 
retail sales, and a few reported some slowing. Auto sales have 
generally been weak. Expected crop yields vary, but agricultural 
prices remain low. Manufacturing output is still improving although 
at a slower pace in some areas. Several districts reported some 
increase in home sales, but residential construction is still at low 
levels. Loan demand has been weak for commercial, industrial, and 
consumer loans. Some districts noted a pickup in real estate loans, 
especially refinancings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales were reported to be slow or sluggish in most districts. 
Dallas and San Francisco cited weakness in the retail sector, and in 
Boston and Philadelphia sales have been flat to slightly below last 
year's levels. In Atlanta they have been flat to slightly above 
year-ago levels but have improved little since August. Cleveland and 
Richmond reported that sales have slowed in the last month. Two 
districts indicated improvement in retail sales. Kansas City 
reported sales increased somewhat, and Minneapolis reported "fairly 
strong" sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas indicated that retail inventories 
were under control, but some contacts in Cleveland and most in 
Kansas City considered inventories too high.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general the outlook for the holiday sales season is cautious. In 
Kansas City, however, some retailers are expecting relatively strong 
sales for the holiday season, and in Richmond they are optimistic 
about their business over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales were reported to be flat or down from last year in many 
districts although the Cleveland District indicated that sales rose 
in late September and early October, and Minneapolis noted a recent 
surge in truck sales. Several contacts in the Cleveland District 
said dealers' orders for new models are slightly above year-ago 
levels: but Atlanta indicated that orders have been mixed and 
dealers there do not expect an acceleration of demand. Dealers in 
the Philadelphia District are also pessimistic about prospects for 
the 1992 model year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most districts output and shipments in the industrial sector have 
been stable to slightly higher. Philadelphia noted that the pace of 
advance had slowed recently. There was also some indication of 
slower growth in the immediate Chicago area. San Francisco mentioned 
that conditions were still worsening in California and in the 
Pacific Northwest while the industrial sector in Idaho and Utah 
remained stable. Cleveland and Chicago reported that autos and steel 
have been most responsible for the recent increases in 
manufacturing. Boston and St. Louis noted weakness in the defense 
industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Boston and Cleveland mentioned that manufacturing inventories are at 
satisfactory levels while Kansas City noted that firms are still 
trying to trim inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports about new orders were mixed. Richmond noted an increase in 
new orders, and some manufacturers in the New York District have 
seen an improvement, but new orders were weak or declining in Boston 
and Philadelphia. Orders for defense goods in St. Louis and for oil 
field machinery in Dallas were reported to be down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Philadelphia and Richmond said that, on balance, manufacturers 
expect improvement over the next six months. Boston, however, noted 
concern about renewed softness.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on housing were also mixed. New York, St. Louis, and Kansas 
City reported some increase in home sales, and Atlanta and 
Minneapolis reported mixed conditions with increases in some parts 
of their districts and declines in other parts. Richmond said that 
housing markets in the district are sluggish. Likewise, San 
Francisco reported that home sales in California and the Pacific 
Northwest, which had rebounded earlier in the year, were now 
sluggish. New home construction is still slow in those districts 
that mentioned it.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the commercial leasing market, the New York District said rents 
were still falling, and San Francisco reported plummeting commercial 
rental rates in the Los Angeles market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the agricultural sector, expected yields compared to last year 
vary by crop, but prices generally remain low. Drier than normal 
weather has reduced yields for corn according to several district 
reports. The Chicago District added that corn yields, although lower 
than last year, are turning out to be much better than earlier 
estimates. In the Dallas District and in parts of the Minneapolis 
District, excessive precipitation hurt crop production although 
yields are still good. In North Dakota, corn and dry bean yields are 
sharply higher than last year; in the Richmond District they are 
slightly lower. The wheat crop forecast for Montana is the highest 
in many years. Prices for many crops, livestock, and dairy products 
are weak. San Francisco reported that high production of fruits and 
vegetables in California's Central Valley has lowered prices for 
those products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Low natural gas prices have reduced drilling activity in the Kansas 
City and Dallas districts. Dallas also reported that some energy 
firms have announced layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, loan demand has been weak. Overall demand has decreased 
in the New York District, and total loan volume continued to decline 
in Philadelphia. In Kansas City demand for commercial and industrial 
loans is down, and demand remains soft in Chicago. New York and San 
Francisco specifically mentioned that consumer loan demand was 
sluggish. Atlanta, on the other hand, reported moderate improvement 
in loan demand in September. And in the last two months, total loans 
outstanding have increased in the St. Louis District. A number of 
districts have experienced increased demand for mortgage loans, 
especially refinancings spurred by lower interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several districts reported that the majority of banks have not 
raised credit standards in the past few months. Cleveland noted that 
some banks appear to be less aggressive in seeking loans.
