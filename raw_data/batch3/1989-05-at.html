      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 3, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Firms headquartered in the Southeast report that business activity 
continues to move ahead at a moderately healthy pace. Some shortages 
of both skilled and unskilled workers are reported by firms in both 
the manufacturing and service sectors. Most contacts, however, say 
that sufficient labor is available and continue to report that wage 
rates are rising at a 3-5 percent range. Increases in prices of 
materials and final products are showing some acceleration, 
particularly where imported goods are a significant component. At 
the same time, order backlogs appear to be easing a bit and vendor 
delays as well as inventories are said to be generally acceptable 
relative to sales. Capital spending plans of businesses, although 
decelerating, remain stronger than a year ago; there are still more 
reports of spending for modernization rather than for outright 
expansion. Loan growth is weakening in both the consumer and real 
estate categories. Delinquencies are not a major problem but real 
estate lenders express concern about housing and commercial 
properties in overbuilt areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage increases remain mostly in the 3-5 percent range although there 
are a few notable exceptions. One manufacturer reports wage hikes in 
the 10 to 15 percent range for low skilled workers In certain 
fields; the wage increase is estimated to be less costly than the 
turnover that would occur without it. Welders, pipe fitters, 
machinists, engineers, and nurses are reported to be in short supply 
and are contributing to upward wage pressures in affected 
businesses. An acute shortage of nurses in the Southeast is expected 
to further escalate hospital costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most input and product prices are said to be rising at a faster pace 
than last year at this time, but reported rates of increase vary 
widely by industry. A major distributor of auto, office machine and 
industrial parts notes that prices have been accelerating and 
pressures are the most intense in three years. Year-to-date in the 
firm's industrial supply division, price increases have averaged 
about 6 percent and forecasts are for some acceleration for the 
remainder of the year. Back orders at suppliers are huge and 
delivery delays have been severe although some improvement has been 
noted in the last few weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the other extreme, prices of construction materials and products 
associated with the slowing building industry are generally feeling 
little or no upward pressure. The major exception is the price of 
cement which has increased 10 to 12 percent so far this year. 
Imported cement is primarily responsible for the upward price 
pressure. On the other hand, demand is slowing for lumber and 
additional softness is anticipated because of the slowdown in 
residential housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      In agriculture, prices of vegetables have moderated with the 
regrowth of fresh vegetable crops since the February freeze. 
However, prices of broilers and eggs are holding at relatively high 
levels. The broiler industry is benefiting from rapid demand growth 
in the fast food industry, which is supporting prices at a highly 
profitable level for all chicken producers. Feed costs, though 
higher than a year ago, have not risen recently and there is hope 
that prospects for larger grain crops in 1989 may soon cause feed 
prices to decline. Last year's heavy losses drove egg producers out 
of the business reducing supplies and contributing to current high 
egg prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capacity Utilization
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capacity constraints appear to be easing a bit throughout the 
Southeast. One capital equipment manufacturer notes that the rise in 
interest rates has caused distributors to trim inventories of 
products from a typical 4 and 1/2 months supply to a 1 and 1/2 
months supply. This has resulted in a slowing pace of new orders for 
a formerly very active product line and is, in turn, reducing 
pressures to expand capacity. A number of other respondents note 
that new capacity is now coming on line reflecting past expansion 
decisions but few new expansions are planned for this year. A pickup 
in utilization of idle capacity is now anticipated for a number of 
energy producers. Spokesmen relate that an improvement in 
expectations for the oil industry over the long run is generating 
plans for some renewed activity in oil exploration. The natural gas 
industry is becoming especially active in response to brighter 
market prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Investment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital investment appears to be slowing across the region. Some 
contacts state that uncertainty regarding the possibility of a 
recession by next year is causing reluctance in major expansion 
decisions. A medical services firm states that investment is being 
cut back from the levels of recent years partially because of 
efforts by businesses, insurers, and particularly the federal 
government to manage reimbursements of medical expenses more 
closely. For example, Medicare's reimbursement for capital 
expenditures has declined 10-15 percent this year and it is 
speculated that another 10 percent reduction is in the offing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most new capital investments are expenditures to upgrade machinery 
and production techniques which will enhance the output from the 
currently employed work force. In agriculture, crop farmers are 
sharply expanding purchases of machinery and equipment mostly to 
replace worn items that were held in service during the low-income 
period over the past several years. The broiler producing and 
processing industry is the major exception to the general trend. New 
processing plants are being built to respond to the brisk growth in 
the nationwide demand for chicken products. A significant investment 
to expand grower facilities is also required to supply the new 
processing capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit Situation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Delinquency rates and defaults on real estate loans have continued 
to rise in the District although the extent of the problems is not 
yet considered serious. Several lenders report that loan volumes are 
flat or down reflecting the slowdown in both residential and 
commercial construction. A few lenders register concern that 
problems with large real estate development projects could become 
more severe in an environment of high vacancies and rising interest 
rates.
