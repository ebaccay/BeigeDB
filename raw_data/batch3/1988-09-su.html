      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 6, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of business activity reflected in most District reports 
ranges from healthy expansion to stable or mixed, with weakening 
noted only by St. Louis. However, contacts in several Districts were 
less optimistic than earlier about the outlook. A number of 
manufacturing industries are operating near capacity, and further 
upward pressures on prices were noted. Retail spending is generally 
lackluster though some segments are doing better. Several Districts 
report weakness in residential construction, but home sales are 
strong on the West Coast and in the Richmond District. 
Nonresidential construction has slowed in various areas of the 
country, though industrial building has strengthened in the Midwest. 
Rainfall in the second half of the summer relieved drought stress to 
agriculture in several Districts, though parts of the St. Louis 
District suffered further crop damage from hot, dry weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing
Activity is expanding in numerous manufacturing industries and in 
most Districts. Rising exports and transfer of production from 
overseas as well as strength of domestic demand have contributed to 
manufacturing's rise. Some industries are at or near capacity 
including paper, chemicals, steel, and aluminum. Other sectors doing 
well include electronics; nondefense aerospace; and electrical 
equipment and instruments, particularly for installation in new 
plants and factory expansion projects. Demand for various types of 
nonelectrical machinery has strengthened, in some cases from low 
levels. Motor vehicle output plans have been revised upward in line 
with better-than-expected sales. San Francisco says that output of 
forest products is strong, though industry sources are concerned 
about weakening in housing. In contrast, Dallas and Boston report 
sluggishness in construction supplies. Other manufacturing sectors 
showing softness include personal care products and government 
purchases, including defense. Atlanta, however, notes an increase in 
shipbuilding to fulfill new Navy contracts. Apparel is mixed, with 
foreign competition still strong. Several Districts indicate that 
the overall manufacturing expansion is expected to continue, though 
Richmond noted somewhat less optimism among its contacts than 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing market conditions vary widely around the country, from 
healthy to weak. Recent interest rate increases are thought to have 
prompted some potential buyers to act before rates rose further (New 
York) but discouraged other would-be buyers (Richmond). San 
Francisco reports strength in West Coast housing markets and rapid 
increases in home prices. Richmond indicates that new home sales 
stayed strong in August. Dallas reports that residential 
construction contracts and permits are rising but from low levels. 
Slowing in homebuilding is noted by New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. 
Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, though some parts of the New 
York District have shown recent improvement or less slowing than 
expected. Weak multifamily building was reported by Chicago and 
Atlanta, though the latter has seen an upturn in two District 
cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction of factories has strengthened in the Chicago District, 
and industrial park construction has increased in south Florida with 
the boom in exports. The pace of office building construction varies 
considerably among major cities. Hotel building is booming in 
Orlando. Chicago contacts expressed concern about overbuilding of 
retail stores in some areas. Boston described capital spending by 
profitable stores as cautious; weak retailers are selling stores. 
Strong or increased highway construction was noted by Chicago and 
San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was reported sluggish in most Districts. Cleveland 
and Minneapolis, however, noted an upturn in apparel sales in recent 
weeks. Other Districts were hopeful that an end to hot, humid 
weather would bring stronger sales of fall apparel and back-to-
school items. Lines described as selling well include conservative 
clothing (Boston) and accessories, handbags, and women's at-home 
clothing (New York). Cleveland sees some strength in home 
furnishings, appliances, and electronics, but sales of furniture 
were reported lagging by Boston, New York, and Richmond. Sales of 
home improvement items were reported strong by Kansas City, but
Boston said hot weather deterred sales of building materials. Retail 
sales have picked up in rural areas following recent rains, 
according to St. Louis. Motor vehicle sales have been mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ordering by retailers is described as conservative and cautious. 
Inventories were viewed as generally satisfactory in the New York, 
Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, but Dallas noted stocks 
above desired levels, and Boston District stores with weak profits 
are cutting inventories. Extensive markdowns were reported by New 
York and Chicago. Dallas noted reports of continued high square 
footage per customer, holding down profits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions vary widely. Timely rains in August helped crop 
conditions according to Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. 
However, hot dry weather in mid-August caused further crop 
deterioration in the St. Louis District. Minneapolis reports 
conditions largely unchanged there over the past month. This 
summer's drought caused a sharper loss of corn and soybean 
production in the Chicago District than for the nation as a whole. 
Higher feed costs have squeezed livestock producers' margins, as 
have higher water costs in the San Francisco District, but Kansas 
City indicates that drought-induced cattle liquidation has been 
limited. Richmond notes that higher livestock prices are expected to 
help offset the adverse effects on margins of the rise in feed 
costs. The past year's climb in agricultural land values in the 
Chicago District slowed in the second quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      This has been a "roller coaster" year for forestry, according to 
Atlanta. Increased timber supply due partly to the drought, and 
reduced demand reflecting concerns about lagging housing starts, 
have cut lumber prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil exploration and development is expected by Dallas contacts to 
remain sluggish. The number of active drilling rigs has fallen since 
May in the Dallas District but risen, contrary to expectations, in 
the Kansas City District. Atlanta reports new oil discoveries in 
Alabama and Mississippi, and moderately lower oil production in the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Drought Effects
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Low Mississippi River levels this summer because of the drought 
caused diversion of freight from barges to higher-cost rail and 
Great Lakes shipping. However, recent rains in the upper Midwest 
have helped raise barge traffic above a year ago at Memphis, where 
delays had been lengthy. The drought cut into demand for farm 
equipment, which was recovering in the spring from low levels, but 
added to demand in some other industries including pump 
manufacturing and well drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rising raw materials costs continue widespread, and higher prices 
for components are increasingly being noted. Further price increases 
are expected. Some firms, however, are experiencing little or no 
cost pressure, because of long-term contracts or because they have 
worked closely with suppliers on cost reduction, according to 
Boston. Richmond reports that materials and finished goods price 
increases in August were less widespread than in July. Various 
materials and components are in short supply, and lead times have 
lengthened further, prompting producers to try to raise their 
inventories of these items. Cleveland comments that concerns about 
rising costs and capacity limits are allayed by sizable profit and 
productivity gains, but Chicago notes that margins at some firms are 
being squeezed by increasing materials costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on wage gains are mixed. Cleveland sees signs of somewhat 
higher labor costs, partly reflecting increased overtime. Boston's 
contacts are evenly divided between those who see accelerating labor 
costs, especially for fringe benefits, and those who do not. San 
Francisco reports shortages of entry and low-skill workers, partly 
tied to the immigration law. Shortages of qualified retail 
salespeople are exerting upward pressures on wages. In contrast, St. 
Louis sees no substantial upward wage pressures even in industries 
running at capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Trends in lending have been mixed. Business lending has been strong 
except in the Dallas District where business and real estate loans 
are leading the decline in total loans. Consumer lending ranges from 
soft to strong, with increases generally led by financing of car 
purchases. Real estate lending is weak in some areas and showing 
moderate gains in others. Business and consumer loan rates have 
risen as have funding costs. Boston area bankers expect further 
interest rate increases over the rest of 1988.
