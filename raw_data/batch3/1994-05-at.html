      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business contacts reported that the Southeast economy continued to 
expand at a healthy pace in April. Retailers noted that spring sales 
improved over last year's levels, and the majority of auto dealers 
also saw year-over-year sales gains. Manufacturers in most sectors 
reported increases in new orders, shipments, and production, 
although defense-related producers continue to struggle. Bankers 
said that overall loan demand was more mixed than in recent months, 
mainly because of large but anticipated declines in residential 
mortgage refinancings. Single-family home building remained strong 
throughout the District, while commercial real estate markets also 
continued to show improvement. Wages and input prices were reported 
to be stable by most manufacturers. However, firms linked to the 
home building industry experienced rising materials prices as well 
as continuing upward pressure on wages, particularly for skilled 
construction workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that spring sales have been better than 
expected this year, with several noting double-digit year-over-year 
sales growth. Durable goods continue to sell well, but most of the 
recent improvement in sales have come from nondurable goods. Sales 
of women's apparel have improved considerably over last year's 
disappointing levels, while men's and children's clothing sales have 
been quite strong. Despite this improvement in sales, there were no 
reports of upward retail price pressures. Most retailers remain 
cautious in their expectations for this year and continue to 
maintain relatively lean inventories. Auto dealers continued to 
report year-over-year increases in sales, and most were optimistic 
about their prospects for the remainder of this model year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism officials in Florida expect a 4 percent increase in visitor 
traffic in 1994 following a "disappointing" 1993. The state hopes to 
see an increase in tourists from the improving economies of Latin 
America and the Caribbean. However, the number of European visitors 
remains down in south Florida. Several travel agencies that cater 
mainly to Europeans have been forced to lay off employees because of 
the dramatic reduction in bookings. By contrast, Mississippi's 
gaming industry reportedly has created 16,000 jobs directly and 
"energized" tourism in the state. In New Orleans, first quarter 
figures suggest record occupancy levels at local hotels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers in most sectors reported increases in production, 
shipments, and new orders in April, as well as positive expectations 
for future activity. The major exceptions to this rule are defense 
and aerospace producers who continue to struggle in the face of 
domestic defense cutbacks and weak foreign markets. Production and 
shipments of household textiles remain strong, and there have been 
recent reports of improving demand for apparel fabric. Capital 
equipment producers have noted increases in recent business 
activity. Several consumer goods manufacturers announced plans for 
plant expansions to be completed in the District within the next 
year. Regional suppliers to the automotive industry are reported to 
be running at near capacity, while temporary help agencies that 
supply workers to the manufacturing industry continue to report 
strong demand for their services.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Realtors across the Southeast generally reported that single-family 
home sales were strong in April. According to several contacts, the 
recent increases in mortgage financing rates have created a slight 
surge in buying activity which they expect to taper off over the 
next few months. Inventories of homes for sale remain low in many 
areas, stimulating price increases in the most active markets. New 
homes continue to be among popular sellers, keeping building 
contractors extremely busy in most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily real estate markets continue to improve 
slowly. Commercial and office vacancy rates have declined throughout 
the District while leasing has improved. Although no new speculative 
construction has been announced recently, commercial real estate 
agents in several areas have noted an increase in discussions about 
possible speculative projects. In addition, rising apartment rents 
have encouraged new multifamily construction in several District 
cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to District bankers, loan demand was more mixed in April 
than it had been in previous months. Most institutions reported 
declines in home mortgage lending as the recent uptick in rates 
caused refinancings to plummet. However, these declines were 
anticipated, and there was general agreement that it was too early 
to tell if rate increases would affect other loan areas. Commercial 
loan demand generally was reported to be moderate to strong, 
although contacts in several areas reported some slowdown in 
business lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts continued to report no change in the prices paid 
either for raw materials or for prices received for finished 
products. Although home builders reported that lumber prices have 
begun to stabilize, they noted that the prices of other building 
materials, as well as wages for skilled construction labor, have 
continued to rise.
