      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      There are mixed signals in the Third District economy as 1988 
begins. Manufacturing activity was flat in January, although factory 
employment continued on an upward trend. Retail sales for the 
holiday season increased year-over-year, except for women's apparel 
and consumer electronics, and met or exceeded merchants' 
expectations. The growth of aggregate bank lending was slowing, with 
consumer loan volume at a standstill and business lending up just 
slightly; however, real estate lending continues to move up 
strongly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most business contacts expect little growth in 1988. Manufacturers 
forecast only steady business for the first half, and they do not 
expect to continue adding to payrolls. Retailers said sales in 
January were good, but they expect consumers to step up their buying 
only slightly, if at all, as the year progresses. Bankers, citing 
the improvement in the manufacturing sector in 1987, are optimistic 
that commercial lending will regain momentum this year, but they do 
not expect strong demand for consumer credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's manufacturing sector marked time in the first month of 
the year. After expanding through most of 1987. Two-thirds of the 
industrial firms participating in the January Business Outlook 
Survey reported steady business, and the number of companies 
starting the new year at a slower pace nearly equaled the number 
stepping up production. Durable goods makers reported sane 
improvement, while nondurable goods producers said business was 
steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specific measures of industrial activity in January showed little 
change from December. Order backlogs leveled off and inventories 
moved higher, indicating an easing from last year's operating pace. 
However, fractional increases in new orders and shipments were 
reported. Employment also posted a slight gain for the ninth 
consecutive month; although 75 percent of the companies surveyed in 
January were maintaining steady payrolls, 19 percent added workers 
while only 6 percent made cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the apparent interruption of growth in January, survey 
respondents reported continuing upward movement in prices --60 
percent said input costs were higher than in December, and nearly 40 
percent raised prices for their own products. Looking to the first 
half of 1988, 72 percent of the respondents predict further 
increases in the prices of goods they purchase and 41 percent plan 
to charge more for the goods they make.
     </p>
     <p>
      January's pause in manufacturing growth appears to be coloring 
survey participants' views of the future. Neither production nor 
employment is expected to change from current levels in the first 
half of 1988. These expectations, combined with an anticipated 
modest increase in shipments, should work to reverse this month's 
inventory buildup.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Third District retailers queried in January said sales for the 
Christmas season met expectations, and some department stores and 
general merchandise stores reported that sales were above plan. 
Overall, area merchants said sales were about 5 to 7 percent above 
1986 results, in dollar terms. Discount stores and department stores 
catering to relatively affluent clienteles turned in better 
performances than stores selling middle price range merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      While promotional discounting in the days just before Christmas was 
greater than planned for many stores, most retailers said margins 
were not seriously reduced. This was not the case for specialty 
shops, however. Despite large markdowns, stores selling women's 
apparel and consumer electronics did not have a good season. Some 
reported sales declines of up to 10 percent from 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants contacted in mid-January said sales were running at a 
healthy pace, but they are worried about the year as a whole. Most 
have adjusted their purchasing plans for a year of slow or no growth 
in sales, in real terms, and many specialty stores have cut back 
plans for renovations and expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Store executives said cost containment will command attention this 
year. Labor costs are rising as stores face shortages of salespeople 
and other workers. Also, retailers reported that costs of imported 
goods are rising more rapidly now than in the past few years, and 
consumers are resisting stores' attempts to pass cost increases 
through to selling prices; consequently, profit margins on imported 
goods are falling and stores are turning to domestic suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth at major Third District banks was slowing as 1987 came 
to a close, continuing a trend that began at the start of last year. 
Among the major credit categories, real estate lending is strongest 
and consumer lending is weakest. Total personal loan volume 
outstanding near year-end 1987 was only 3 percent higher than in 
December 1986, and bankers surveyed in mid-January said consumer 
lending has been flat or down in recent weeks. Most bankers expect 
little growth in this type of lending in 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although growth in commercial and industrial lending eased during 
1987, bank credit officers contacted recently believe lending to 
businesses will accelerate, and some have already noticed an 
increased demand for commercial credit. Bankers believe economic 
conditions in the region will remain good for most of 1988, spurring 
financing needs of local businesses, particularly manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total deposits at large Third District banks in December were at the 
same level as in December 1986. Demand deposit balances have 
declined since October, ending the year lower than where they 
started. Growth in nontransactions deposits, while slow, has 
accelerated in recent months. Some bank asset/liability managers 
indicated in January that they were boosting interest rates on 
certificates of deposit in anticipation of tighter money market 
conditions in the second half of 1988.
