      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions continue to be generally healthy in the Twelfth 
Federal Reserve District. Nevertheless, western business leaders' 
expectations about future growth have deteriorated somewhat during 
the past month, particularly regarding business investment. Wage and 
price pressures continue modest in most cases. Consumer spending is 
healthy but not growing rapidly, with weakness noted in auto sales. 
Manufacturing activity is reported to be mixed, with some producers 
at capacity and planning expansions, while others report slower 
orders. Conditions in most resource sectors are satisfactory, with 
strong growth in agricultural exports. Construction and real estate 
activity is reported to be strong or improving in most of the West,
except Arizona. Banks and thrifts continue to compete vigorously for 
deposits, while loan demand remains strong for most categories and 
regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District business leaders' expectations regarding GNP growth 
have deteriorated slightly during the past month, as three quarters 
of the respondents now anticipate that growth will be slower during 
the next year than its historical average. Expectations deteriorated 
particularly sharply for business investment. Only 15 percent expect 
stronger investment, compared with 30 percent last month, while 59 
percent now anticipate weaker business investment, compared with 
only 30 percent of last month's respondents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage and price pressures continue modest in most cases. Reports of 
wage and price increases of up to 4 or 5 percent are common. 
Retailers report that competition and price-conscious consumers are 
keeping a lid on retail prices. 57,000 machinists at Boeing recently 
agreed to a 10 percent increase in base wages over three years, in 
addition to cost-of-living adjustments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending is healthy but not growing rapidly. Department 
store sales are reported to be in line with expectations, with 
intense price competition. The financial problems of some department 
store chains are causing concern in the industry. A car dealer 
reports that customer traffic declined about 40 percent during the 
first half of November, to the lowest level of the year. Customers 
are not responding to incentives, but it is not clear whether this 
is an early sign of further weakening, or simply a payback for the 
strong sales of August and September. All product lines are 
affected: imports and domestics, new and used.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the West is mixed. An Idaho respondent 
reports that production in his area is at capacity, and several 
firms (particularly food processors) plan expansions. Food 
processing activity in California also is strong. The Boeing strike 
resulted in some lost commercial aircraft production. but the huge 
order backlog should yield healthy activity as work resumes in the 
wake of the recent settlement. A construction and engineering firm 
reports that while demand from manufacturers continues to grow, the 
rate of growth has slowed in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several respondents, however, note slower orders for manufactured 
goods. Moreover, a heavy equipment manufacturer reports that export 
sales were down 1 percent during the third quarter compared to their 
year-earlier level. A paint and coatings manufacturer reports that 
most of the companies his firm deals with have experienced a 
slowdown during recent months. Recent performance varies widely 
among high-technology manufacturers, as one respondent reports that 
lower chip prices have hurt semiconductor producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in most resource sectors are satisfactory. Gold prices 
are up. Metals industries are producing at high levels, although 
they are not growing. However, the forest products industries seem 
to be slowing somewhat. Lumber orders and log exports both have 
fallen during the past year, with recent activity 10 to 15 percent 
below year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural industries report healthy conditions, with strong 
export growth. California farm exports are expected to be about 10 
percent higher in 1989 than they were in 1988, with exports of nuts, 
fruits, and vegetables particularly strong. Livestock operators are 
doing well, with steady increases in exports. Wine exports are 
starting to "take off," particularly to the U.K and Japan. The 
extent of earthquake damage suffered by food processors and by 
flower and nursery greenhouse operators in Watsonville, Gilroy, and 
Hollister remains unknown.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity is reported strong or 
improving in most of the West outside Arizona. Building activity in 
Nevada continues at a vigorous pace, and home values in the Puget 
Sound area are up by as much as 30 percent over their year-earlier 
levels. Increases in building and sales activity, as well as in 
property values, are reported in Oregon, eastern Washington, Idaho, 
and Utah. California's coastal markets have cooled since the 
frenetic pace seen a few months ago, but values continue to exceed 
their year-earlier levels by 10 to 15 percent, and activity in less 
expensive parts of the state is very strong. Arizona, however, 
continues to suffer from overbuilt markets for apartment, office, 
retail, and industrial space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks and thrifts continue to compete vigorously for deposits, while 
loan demand remains strong in most categories and regions. However, 
the rate of growth in lending appears to have slowed from the robust 
pace seen earlier this year. A California banker reports that the 
rate of growth in consumer lending slowed in September and October, 
as home equity lending grew more slowly and credit card borrowing 
continued to be slow. An Oregon banker notes some decrease in demand 
for non-mortgage credit. Several bankers report that delinquencies 
are down from their year-earlier levels.
