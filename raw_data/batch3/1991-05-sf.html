      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 1, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Twelfth District are characterized by 
continued weakness in California offset partly by relatively strong 
activity in other states. The outlook of western business leaders, 
however, continues to improve. Materials prices are reported 
unchanged or down slightly, and wage increases remain moderate. 
Consumer spending continues to be sluggish, with little pick-up 
noted since the end of the Gulf War. Agriculture is hindered by 
drought conditions in some parts of the District. Construction and 
real estate markets remain soft, but some improvement has appeared 
in sales and prices in California. District financial institutions 
report generally slow conditions, although lower interest rates have 
spurred mortgage refinancing activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic expectations of western business leaders continued to 
improve in April. Forty-seven percent of those sampled expect 
improvement in housing starts in the coming four quarters, and a 
similar percentage expect increased consumer spending. This is a 
strong pick-up from the end of 1990 when over 90 percent of 
respondents expected conditions to worsen in these sectors. Over 50 
percent of business leaders continue to project improvement in the 
foreign trade balance and inflation during the next four quarters. 
Even with the more positive outlook, over 65 percent of respondents 
still expect unemployment to increase and over 75 percent continue 
to foresee GNP growth of less than 2.5 percent in the coming four 
quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices for many Twelfth District products and services are reported 
to be unchanged or down slightly. Many reports suggest that declines 
in fuel prices have helped to bring down overall prices. The Salt 
Lake City and Boise area CPIs declined in the first quarter of 1991. 
In Southern California, one report indicates that the price of 
newsprint is 2 percent below last year's level. Wage increases 
remain moderate. Most respondents report wage gains of only 3 to 4 
percent, with minimal wage pressure on large employers currently 
involved in labor negotiation. Increases of as much as 10 percent 
continue to be reported for health care and tuition casts, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in the Twelfth District remains sluggish, with 
only a few reports indicating a significant pick-up since the end of 
the Gulf War. A food and drug retailer notes some improvement in 
sales around Easter, especially outside of California. Auto sales 
continue weak in the District, although showroom traffic is reported 
to have increased steadily since the end of the war. Hawaii's 
tourism industry is just beginning to recover from the sharp drop in 
Japanese visitors earlier this year. Advertising at television 
stations in the Pacific Northwest has increased since the end of the 
war, but newspaper advertising volume in Southern California remains 
off 20 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Twelfth District is relatively solid 
outside of defense-related industries. Conditions in the aerospace 
industry continue to be split, with commercial aerospace growing 
while defense-related activity slows. In the Pacific Northwest, 
shipyards are reporting solid growth. In Oregon, a helicopter supply 
firm and a heavy equipment supplier are reported to he expecting 
orders associated with the rebuilding of Kuwait. Export demand has 
boosted sales of agricultural machinery to Mexico and Brazil.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural and resource industries in the Twelfth District 
continue to report weak conditions. In California, the freeze in 
late December cut citrus fruit production and exports in half and 
destroyed many fruit and nut trees. Continued drought conditions in 
California have caused farmers to cut back on acreage planted for 
many crops, including a 15 to 20 percent drop in cotton acreage 
planted in the San Joaquin Valley. Prices for many crops affected by 
the drought are expected to rise, which will help to offset the 
impact of the reduced plantings on cash receipts. Grain prices are 
well below last year's levels. The cattle industry remains in good 
shape, but higher commodity costs are reported to be tightening 
profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forest product industries in the District continue to be hampered by 
court actions which are halting federal timber sales. Some pick-up 
in lumber sales and prices is noted in recent months. Copper and 
aluminum prices have fallen recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity show signs of improvement in 
California, and remain relatively healthy in the Pacific Northwest 
and Intermountain areas. In California, reports suggest that home 
prices are stabilizing. Moreover, sales activity has increased in 
recent months. Single-family and condominium sales in Los Angeles 
are reported to have doubled between February and March. Home prices 
are rising moderately in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah. 
Commercial markets are weak in California as vacancy rates increased 
in Los Angeles and remained high in other markets. Some reports 
suggest that over-capacity will continue to depress commercial 
construction in Los Angeles for two to five years. Conversely, 
reports from Salt Lake City note low vacancy rates and rising rents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial institutions in the Twelfth District report generally 
sluggish conditions. In Southern California, loan demand remains 
slow, while a Silicon Valley banker reports that loan demand is 
strong, but deposit growth has fallen off. The decline in interest 
rates has caused a flood of mortgage refinancing in the Pacific 
Northwest. One report indicates that 35 to 40 percent of recent real 
estate loan originations have been refinancings.
