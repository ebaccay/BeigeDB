      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A large majority of firms contacted around year end reported 
marginally lower or flat production, sales, or employment compared 
to late fall and a year ago. Retailers, with few exceptions, 
reported that real holiday sales fell below or only equaled last 
year's levels. While domestic sales are reported to be down by many 
contacts in diverse industries, several businesses report growing 
international sales. Continued widespread contraction in 
construction is reported to be causing construction-related 
manufacturing activity to weaken further. Banking contacts supported 
these interpretations with information that consumer loan demand and 
business capital spending are softening. Contacts report that the 
California freeze is raising fruit and vegetable prices, while an 
unseasonably warm winter in other areas has led to falling prices 
for natural gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers said that real sales had turned out weak compared to a 
year earlier, though most had expected this to happen. Contacts say 
that they planned inventory carefully, promoted and discounted items 
early, and finally moved remaining merchandise with further price 
cuts during the week before Christmas; that helped trigger an 
unusually large late sales surge. It appears that sales activity was 
not as poor in the western part of the District. Although sales of 
most big ticket items were reported to be weak everywhere, luxury 
items received a temporary boost in December from the special tax 
slated to begin in 1991. Florida restaurateurs and luxury resort 
operators report reduced business entertainment spending, and a "no 
frills" hotel franchiser says that business travelers in the 
Southeast are "trading down." Tourism, overall, is still strong but 
there are reports of softening domestic leisure travel to Florida. 
According to industry contacts, convention attendance in Atlanta, 
New Orleans, and Orlando has been record-setting.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers in most industries report declining or flat domestic sales 
while reports on the strength of exports vary. Contacts reporting 
strong exports but flat domestic sales include a telecommunications 
components manufacturer in Atlanta, linerboard and pulp 
manufacturers with plants across the Southeast, a major regional 
aluminum can sheet producer, and a few makers of original equipment 
auto parts. Mobile home manufacturers in Florida, Georgia, and 
Mississippi report new or expected contracts to make homes for 
Russian immigrants in Israel, helping to offset weak domestic sales. 
Manufacturers who report weak domestic sales that are not being 
offset by growing exports include southern pine lumber producers for 
whom Iraq represented a major market before its August invasion of 
Kuwait. Lumber sales to LDCs in the Caribbean and Africa also are 
reported to be down because of the higher energy costs they are 
facing. A Georgia producer of carpets says that Saudi Arabia, the 
largest international market for the state's carpets, has stopped 
taking delivery and that insurance costs on shipments to the Middle 
East have become prohibitively high. A major supplier of inorganic 
industrial chemicals to domestic manufacturers of many industrial 
and consumer products reports significantly lower sales compared to 
a year ago. A plumbing fixture supplier serving Georgia and 
Tennessee and a Florida wall coatings manufacturer report lower 
sales in their domestic-only markets. In contrast, pen and pencil 
and cellular phone companies report healthy domestic and foreign 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers indicate that business and consumer loan demand was weak in 
December compared to a year ago and attribute the weakness to the 
slackening economy and uncertainties associated with the Middle East 
crisis. Loan officers say that capital spending is shrinking or 
being delayed in several industries. Direct reports from businesses 
such as a hotel franchiser, a computer software firm, and a producer 
of office supplies confirm this information. Industrial engineering, 
accounting, and management consulting firms report a decline in 
their businesses due to reduced capital spending by clients. 
However, one loan officer reported continued strength in loan demand 
by the health industry, and a Miami banker notes growing demand from 
firms exporting to South America.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most segments of construction activity across the region were down 
sharply at year-end from levels a year earlier and in previous 
months of 1990. In contrast to previous years, there was no 
initiation or acceleration of projects related to tax laws. Parts of 
Louisiana and Mississippi are reported to have more building 
activity than last year at this time, but these areas are expanding 
from depressed levels. A large building materials supplier, who has 
already cut his payroll by 15 percent, says that he is experiencing 
collection problems from hard-pressed contractors and that the 
remodeling business is flat. A home improvement company in Georgia 
also reports that December and early-January sales are down from 
preceding months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major Florida contractor cites a decline in prices of concrete and 
construction tools in response to construction's weakness. South 
Florida citrus and vegetable growers are reported to be temporarily 
reaping much higher prices as a consequence of the December freeze 
affecting Southern California crops. Trucking company contacts, a 
mobile home manufacturer, and a regional supplier of linens say 
their profits are falling because they are unable to pass on 
increased fuel costs. According to an industry contact, natural gas 
prices fell significantly in January because of unseasonably warm 
weather and excess supplies.
