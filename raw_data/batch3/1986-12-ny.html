      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The modest uptrend in the Second District economy continued in 
recent weeks. Retailers reported over-the-year sales gains in 
October ranging from moderate to very good and residential building 
remained strong. Business activity was generally steady to improved, 
though leasing of office space moderated in some areas. Small Second 
District banks report that home equity lines of credit represent 
only a small portion of their consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Second District retail sales showed further over-the-year 
improvement during October with respondents describing gains as 
ranging from moderate to very good. Purchases by foreign visitors 
continued to be an important factor, particularly in New York City. 
Apparel, accessories, furniture and home furnishings were cited as 
items in generally strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales increases during October were from 6-13 percent above year-
earlier levels and, in most cases, were 2 to 3 percent higher than 
targeted. As a result, inventories are well under control and 
respondents do not anticipate the need for heavy promotional 
activity in order to move merchandise during the coming Christmas 
season. Retailers generally expect moderate over-the—year gains in 
holiday sales but one respondent, whose Christmas catalogue orders 
have been strong, is looking for a double-digit increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little change occurred in the Second District's economic expansion 
since the last meeting. Eighty percent or more of purchasing 
managers surveyed in Rochester and Buffalo reported that business 
conditions were stable or improved during October and three-fourths 
of the managers in the Syracuse area's third quarter survey also 
gave that response. While inventories were generally described as at 
satisfactory levels, an increasing percentage of managers has been 
experiencing a rise in commodity prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      News concerning the District's employment outlook has been mixed in 
recent weeks. On the negative side, G.E. plans to end its color TV 
tube operations in upstate New York, where it continues phasing out 
large engine production, and ITT may cut back its international 
operations in New York City. On the other hand, several thousand 
jobs in the chemical and transportation equipment industries have 
been retained due to the successful negotiation of some longstanding 
problems. In addition, a new railway car plant has opened in Yonkers 
and plans for a sizable new operation in the garment industry have 
been announced. As of October, unemployment rates in New York State 
and New Jersey remained 1 1/2 percentage points below the national 
average.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to the District's longer term development, New Jersey 
officials recently announced plans for the first new rail line in 
the New York metropolitan region in 50 years. The $825 million 
trolley-bus system will link billions of dollars of proposed 
residential and commercial projects along 15 miles of the Hudson 
River waterfront.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity among District homebuilders continued strong in recent 
weeks, though the pace was less hectic than at the height of the 
season in the spring and summer. After two years or more at a record 
pace, builders in several areas report that pent-up demand seems 
finally to have been satisfied, and they anticipate a more normal 
but healthy rate of activity in 1987. While some seasonal slack will 
occur over the next few months, a number of builders have already 
signed contracts for homes to be constructed in the spring of next 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leasing activity in the commercial real estate market was at a slow 
to moderate pace in much of the Second District during recent weeks. 
A major exception was downtown Manhattan where leasing of new 
financial center buildings remained strong. While no dramatic 
absorption of space occurred in areas such as northern New Jersey, 
Fairfield County, and Westchester County, where more than ample 
supplies of office space exist, few major new projects have been 
undertaken there in recent months. As a result, vacancy rates in 
these areas have shown over-the-year declines. However, in downtown 
and mid-Manhattan, where many new buildings have come on line, rates 
have moved somewhat higher though they are still well below the 
national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small banks in the Second District report that home equity lines of 
credit currently represent only a small portion of their outstanding 
consumer loans. While all of the surveyed banks have increased their 
efforts to market the product, each expected only moderate growth in 
its volume of these loans through 1987. Several banks believe that 
more rapid growth would be restrained by competition from other 
banks and non-banks and also by a continued surge in second 
mortgages and refinancing arrangements. Loan officers state that the 
most common uses of the credit line include consolidating debt, 
financing education, and providing additional cash flow for 
business. The banks suggested that they can prevent consumers from 
using the line of credit as a proxy for other types of consumer 
loans by providing counseling and by maintaining high underwriting 
standards. However, only one bank indicated that it required its 
applicants to provide information on how the money is to be used, 
and none used this type of information as a criterion for lending.
