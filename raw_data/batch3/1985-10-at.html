     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Broadly-based yardsticks of economic activity indicate a mixed 
performance of the Southeast economy in late summer. Employment 
growth exceeded labor force growth, reducing the region's jobless 
rate. Manufacturing employment showed a respectable increase in 
August, with transportation equipment responsible for much of the 
growth. Consumer spending is up from a year ago. However, September 
retail sales were up only moderately from August as consumers gave a 
lukewarm response to sales promotions. Construction of single-family 
housing is strong but signs of weakness have surfaced in 
multifamily, commercial and office construction. The pace of loan 
demand is slackening despite an uptick in business loans in 
September. Tourism has flattened somewhat around the region. While
carpet mills are increasing employment, owing to strong demand and 
low susceptibility to imports, weakness persists in other textiles 
and apparel, petrochemicals, and agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets conditions improved since midsummer. Employment growth 
exceeded labor force increases in August, and the District 
unemployment rate fell 0.4 percent from July to 7.9 percent. Job 
gains in the services and trade sectors have more than offset 
employment declines in manufacturing. Chemicals and textiles 
manufacturing have accounted for the most job losses. Spokesmen for 
Louisiana's chemical industry now feel that employment may remain 
stable for the remainder of 1985. However, the high comparative 
value of the dollar continues to pressure regional textile and 
apparel producers and employment in apparel plants is continuing to 
decline. In contrast to apparel manufacturers, carpet mills are 
adding employees. The strong housing market and the commercial 
office building boom are chief sources of strength for the domestic 
carpet industry which is somewhat insulated from imports, owing to 
high shipping costs and customization. Orders for carpets are 
expected to remain strong through the end of the year. Contacts 
report that the region's paper and linerboard industry, unexpectedly 
weak in the first two quarters of 1985, is expected to strengthen 
towards the year's end. A record $8 billion in capital spending by 
U.S. paper mills is expected in 1985, 13 percent above 1984 levels. 
Expanding employment at auto and auto-related plants in the region 
is related to growing new car sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report moderately higher sales in September compared to a 
year ago. Although consumers' response to recent sales promotions 
was lukewarm, merchants report inventories to be leaner, but at 
desired levels. Sales at department stores continue to exceed the 
sales pace nationally. Women's apparel, sportswear and sports 
equipment, and furniture and housewares have been the best-selling 
items during the early fall period. Most retailers polled expect 
Christmas sales growth to match last year's increase despite fewer 
selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Car sales 
strengthened throughout the region in September, and industry 
contacts are optimistic about the demand for cars for the remainder 
of 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The general outlook for single-family sales and construction remains 
good. Declines in mortgage rates have boosted demand amid only 
modest advances in home prices. August building permits were up from 
the previous year by 28 percent in Nashville, 20 percent in Atlanta, 
and 13 percent in Miami. In the multifamily sector, by contrast, 
there is a large unsold inventory of condominiums and prices have 
been falling, especially in the south Florida market. Reflecting the 
surplus of condos, building permits for apartments are down sharply 
from last year. Signs of slowdown in office markets have surfaced in 
Atlanta and Miami. Below-normal absorption for the first half of 
1985 and a significant volume of new space expected to enter the 
market in the fourth quarter, are likely to push up vacancy rates 
and place downward pressure on rents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although loan demand remains strong, a slowing trend is evident A 
slight uptick in business loan growth in September cushioned the 
slowing growth rates in real estate and consumer loans. About one-
third of current real estate lending reflects mortgage refinancing. 
Bankers were smarting over substantial losses in auto loan volume to 
special low-rate dealer financing during September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After good growth during the summer, tourist activity seems to have 
waned a bit Air travel was mixed in August While most regional 
airports have reported healthy increases in passengers in 1985, 
some, including Atlanta's Hartsfield, have experienced slower growth 
in August. Visitor center registrations in September fell in 3 of 
the 4 states for which data are available. Hurricanes adversely 
affected the region's coastal areas during the month. Although 
occupancy levels at hotels and motels in overbuilt cities such as 
Orlando, Miami, and New Orleans remain weak, performance continues 
to strengthen in many other southeastern cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop prospects are generally favorable throughout the region and 
indicated yields are significantly above the average for the past 
five years. However, crop prices averaging 29 percent below year-ago 
levels indicate sharp reductions in income from 1985's increased 
production. Farm loans outstanding, as of mid-1985, were below year-
ago levels reflecting both reduced lending and increased write-offs 
of bad loans. Loan write-offs will increase as a result of further 
reductions in crop income in 1985. The livestock sector, and 
especially broiler and turkey producers, will fare better than crop 
producers because product prices have not weakened as much as crops 
and feed costs have dropped with grain prices. On balance, 
southeastern farmers are doing somewhat better than farmers 
elsewhere in the country.
