      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 10, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the Second District economy registered a modest 
improvement since the last report. Most retailers had sales gains 
that were at or above plan. Residential construction remained 
strong, and business activity showed some pickup. Demand for office 
space was slack (as usually is the case this time of year), and few 
new projects were announced. Over the past year, small District 
banks have experienced increased competition from larger banking 
organizations in the market for business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was stronger than had been expected at several 
District stores during July, and most retailers reported 
satisfactory gains in sales. As a result, inventories are currently 
at or below planned levels throughout the region. Higher priced 
stores registered sales growth of 11-19 percent, well above plan in 
some cases, while sales at medium-priced retailers grew between 6 
and 12 percent. Discount stores were the only major group with 
lower-than-expected gains of just 3-4 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      While July is traditionally a month in which retailers clear out 
summer stock, sales of apparel were particularly strong during the 
recent period. In addition, a pickup in demand for consumer durables 
was also noted, with one store reporting "exceptional" sales of 
furniture and rugs. Continuing interest on the part of foreign 
visitors was cited as an important factor in the improved consumer 
spending, particularly in New York City. Industry sources attribute 
this increased foreign buying to the decline in the value of the 
dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Second District were somewhat better in 
recent weeks. The percentage of Rochester purchasing managers 
reporting an improved business situation increased during July. 
Groundbreaking ceremonies were recently held at New Jersey's first 
trash-to-energy power plant. Electricity produced there will be 
purchased by a major utility in the area. A large pharmaceutical 
firm in New Jersey has also undertaken a multimillion-dollar 
expansion of its research and development laboratory, which should 
result in additional employment by 1987. Other recently announced 
plans include the construction of a frozen food factory in central 
New York, which a British food manufacturer will begin this fall, 
and the building of an aircraft parts facility on Long Island.
     </p>
     <p>
      In upstate New York some 2000 of an expected 10,000 soldiers have 
already arrived at Fort Drum where a new Army division is being 
assembled. The Pentagon plans to spend some $1 billion on 
construction in the area, and the addition of these soldiers and 
their families is expected to provide a significant stimulus to the 
regional economy. This should offset to some extent the impact of 
GM's recently announced plans to lay off or transfer 1200 of its 
foundry workers in that area over the next two years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders remain busy throughout the Second District, but 
conditions are somewhat less hectic than in the spring and early 
summer when buyer activity peaked. A major problem continues to be 
getting homes completed on time, since certain types of skilled 
labor are still in short supply. In some areas, particularly where 
the stock of suitable land is almost depleted, a substantial 
increase in home prices has also been noted. In Manhattan, however, 
where a large amount of apartment building is underway (that was 
started prior to the November 1985 cutoff date for city tax 
abatement), some observers question the viability of the high prices 
and rentals that will be asked for the new units.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District commercial real estate market has shown little 
change in recent weeks, and conditions remain somewhat mixed. Only a 
few major new projects have been announced as most areas adjust to 
the ample supply of office space currently available. Leasing 
activity has been seasonally slow in many areas, and the prolonged 
sluggishness in northern New Jersey persists. Some pickup has been 
noted in Manhattan, however, where a major brokerage firm recently 
announced that it will occupy the last of the World Trade Center 
buildings in its entirety. Throughout the District observers 
anticipate that the new tax reform bill will curtail the pace of 
speculative office building.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small and mid-sized banks in the Second District report that 
competition in the business loan market from larger banking 
organizations has increased over the past year. Most of the increase 
has been from large regional banks and smaller bank holding 
companies, rather than from money center banks. The responses from 
those surveyed suggest that only those banks large enough to service 
mid-sized companies have been affected. Moreover, the intensity of 
the competition seemed to increase directly with the size of the 
bank surveyed. While most banks indicated that all types of business 
loans were equally affected, a few felt that the commercial mortgage 
sector had received special attention. The competition has taken the 
form of increased advertising and direct solicitation of borrowers. 
Among the steps, which the small banks have taken to preserve their 
share of the commercial lending market are faster handling and 
approval of loans, greater customer contact, and increased efforts 
to match, though not undercut, competitors' rates.
