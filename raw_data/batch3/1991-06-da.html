      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The 11th District economy has improved since the last survey. 
Respondents note a slight pickup in orders and a more optimistic 
outlook. Much of the recent improvement stems from a mild pickup in 
District residential construction and some recent gains in consumer 
spending. Producers of lumber and wood, stone, clay and glass, and 
primary and fabricated metals have noted increased orders from 
District homebuilders. District retail sales have increased slightly 
and many retailers say the outlook has improved. Growth in the 
service sector has increased to a modest pace with improvement in 
the hotel, advertising and temporary employment industries. Extreme 
weather conditions have slowed planting in some areas and estimates 
of crop production have been reduced slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, orders to District manufacturers have improved and are 
growing modestly. A main source of growth has been increased orders 
from District home builders. Demand has increased for brick 
manufacturers because of increased residential construction in 
Houston, Dallas and Austin. Brick producers expect demand to 
continue to grow as credit to builders is loosened. Lumber and wood 
producers note a sharp increase in production. While improved 
weather conditions are responsible for much of the recent increase, 
increases in Texas home and store construction was responsible for 
much of the gain. Most contacts in the lumber industry feel that the 
U.S recession has finally bottomed out and demand should improve 
gradually. Demand for primary metals has been steady to up slightly, 
following a weak January and February. Increases in residential 
construction in Texas and continued strong exports have helped this 
sector. Orders for chemicals have stabilized following declines 
during January and February. Weakness in the auto sector, however, 
continues to suppress demand for plastics and related industries. 
Petroleum refining has been holding steady. Oil field machinery 
production has declined slightly due to decreased domestic drilling. 
Several apparel producers say that orders have recently jumped.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the District's business services are still reporting weak 
demand, several other service industries have noted improvement. The 
demand for legal services has been weak, although strength was 
reported in Houston and Austin where the Resolution Trust 
Corporation is now very active. Temporary employment agencies are 
seeing increased demand for services, and one firm noted strength in 
both the District and the nation. After declining dramatically for 
over a year, national and international demand for engineering 
services reportedly has bottomed out and recently has increased 
slightly. Advertising and communications firms noted large increases 
in demand from regional customers. Hotel occupancy rates continue to 
pick up slightly and airlines report stable to slightly improved 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail respondents in the District say that sales have improved and 
are now growing slowly. Sales in Houston are reportedly the 
strongest, while sales in Austin and along the Texas Border are also 
experiencing positive growth. Sales are weakest in the Dallas-Fort 
Worth Metroplex where recent defense-related layoffs have increased 
unemployment. Dallas-Fort Worth sales remain positive although very 
slow. Most retailers are optimistic that sales growth will improve 
in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      District auto sales have increased lately, but year-to-date sales 
remain well below last year. April auto sales in the Dallas/Fort-
Worth metroplex were up 2.4 percent over last year, although year-
to-date sales remain nearly 7 percent below last year. Houston sales 
were up 10 percent year-over-year in April, but year-to-date sales 
remained 8 percent below last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil prices have stabilized around $20 per barrel after the end of 
the Middle East war. Prices should stay stable through the third 
quarter because OPEC has decided to hold production at current 
levels. District drilling has declined despite the price stability. 
The low drilling activity is partly due to low natural gas prices 
which are about 20 percent less than a year ago. Although domestic 
drilling activity is weak, foreign drilling by District oil and gas 
companies is healthy and is expected to pick up.
     </p>
     <p>
      District construction activity has increased moderately due to some 
recent strength in single-family building. One respondent thought 
that the recent surge may be pent up demand from the Middle East war 
and may not continue. The multi-family sector is weak, but the 
outlook for this sector remains positive. There has been a 
significant slowdown in demand for civil-related projects (highways, 
infrastructure and public buildings) in Texas. The only area of 
growth in public structures has been prison building.
     </p>
     <p>
      Extreme weather conditions have slowed planting in some areas of the 
District and agricultural production estimates have been reduced 
slightly. Dry conditions in West Texas and the Texas panhandle have 
reduced production estimates for wheat and cotton crops. Louisiana, 
north central Texas and portions of the coast have reported problems 
with excessive moisture. The index of agricultural prices received 
by Texas farmers and ranchers reached a record high in May, 
increasing 5 percent from last year.
