      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District economic conditions have been mixed. The Minnesota 
labor market has continued to display signs of weakness, while the 
employment situation in the rest of the district has improved. 
Consumer spending on general merchandise has been strong, automobile 
sales have risen sharply from levels earlier in the year, and 
housing activity has shown signs of improvement. Conditions in 
resource-related industries have been mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district employment situation has continued to be mixed, with 
signs of increasing unemployment in Minnesota. The unemployment rate 
in Minnesota in June was 4.9 percent, 0.6 percentage points higher 
than in May and 0.8 percentage points higher than in June 1988. The 
unemployment rate in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was 
4.4 percent in June, up from 3.9 percent in May and 3.0 percent in 
June 1988. Manufacturing employment, in particular, has been 
stagnant since June 1988. Analysts attribute the lack of growth in 
manufacturing employment to the problems experienced by area firms 
in the computer and electronics industries. The one bright spot is 
the growth in employment by firms specializing in advanced medical 
technologies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The unemployment rate in North Dakota declined to 3.8 percent in 
July from 4.6 percent in June and 4.4 percent in July 1988. The 
unemployment rate in South Dakota was 4.0 percent in July, 0.2 
percentage points lower than in June and 0.5 percentage points 
higher than in July 1988. In Montana, the unemployment rate fell to 
5.2 percent in July, from 6.0 percent in June and 6.5 percent in 
July 1988. The unemployment rate in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan 
dropped to 6.0 percent in July from 7.5 percent in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending on general merchandise has continued to be strong. 
One retailer reports that August sales were 19 percent higher than a 
year ago and 8 percent higher on a year-to-date basis. This retailer 
said that sales were the best they had been in a long time. Another 
retailer reports that sales in August were 5.1 percent higher than a 
year ago, and year-to-date sales were 5.7 percent higher than last 
year. Inventories were reported to be at acceptable levels. All of 
our contacts were optimistic about fall and Christmas sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales have continued to recover rapidly from a poor first 
quarter. One domestic manufacturer reports that sales in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in August were 25 percent 
higher than in August 1988 and were about even on a year-to-date 
basis compared to last year. Another domestic manufacturer reports 
that sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area were 22 
percent higher in August than in August 1988 and 5 percent higher on 
a year-to-date basis. Automobile dealers were generally optimistic 
about sales prospects for the new model year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity has also rebounded from its depressed levels 
earlier in the year. In Minnesota, the number of new housing permits 
issued in June was roughly the same as in June 1988. Earlier this 
year, the number of new housing permits issued was as much as 30 
percent below the levels of last year. Housing sales in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area were 6.3 percent higher in August than in 
August 1988 but 3.4 percent lower on a year-to-date basis. 
Nonresidential construction has not fared as well. The dollar value 
of contracts for future construction in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
metropolitan area was 25 percent lower in July than in July 1988 and 
about 15 percent lower on a year-to-date basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist spending has been fairly strong. North Dakota, South Dakota, 
and Montana have been celebrating their centennial year as states in 
the Union, and all three states report very good tourist seasons. 
One observer reports that in some areas of Montana it was nearly 
impossible to find lodging. The city of Northfield, Minnesota, 
anticipates that over 100,000 people will turnout for its annual 
"Defeat of Jesse James Days," the reenactment of the shootout 
between the citizens of Northfield and the James Gang in 1876.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in resource-related industries have been mixed. 
Agricultural conditions in Minnesota improved since our last report. 
It was reported that in early September 62 percent of Minnesota 
farmland had adequate or surplus moisture. This report was an 
improvement over earlier reports that over half the farmland was dry 
or very dry. The spring wheat harvest in Minnesota was projected to 
be 91 percent higher than the drought-affected levels of a year ago. 
An index of prices received by Minnesota farmers was 6 percent lower 
in August than in August 1988. In North Dakota, it was estimated 
that 60 to 65 percent of the spring wheat harvest was lost this year 
due to unseasonably hot weather and grasshopper infestation. The 
mining industry throughout the district reports to be doing well. 
Gold mines in Montana are having a good year. Manufacturers of heavy 
equipment used in mining also report an excellent year. A platinum 
mine in Montana plans to expand operations. The lumber industry in 
the district continued to report difficulties in securing enough 
timber.
