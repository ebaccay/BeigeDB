      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On balance, the Fifth District economy continued to improve in 
recent weeks. Retailing strengthened and, although manufacturing was 
generally steady, the furniture market was the strongest in several 
years. The residential real estate market improved, particularly for 
houses in the mid-price range. Commercial real estate activity 
strengthened in the Carolinas and in the Richmond area, but remained 
weak in Maryland and the D.C. area. Residential mortgage demand 
rose, while commercial loan demand was unchanged. Activity at Fifth 
District ports increased. Bad weather led to a deterioration in some 
agricultural crops and also contributed to a decline in tourism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our survey of manufacturers indicated that District activity 
generally held steady during the past month. Respondents noted 
little change in most indicators, although they reported increases 
in shipments, capital expenditures, and prices. Virginia 
manufacturers, however, reported increased activity, especially in 
shipments, new orders, and capital expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers were optimistic about their prospects for the next six 
months. Increases were expected in almost all indicators except 
inventories and the number of employees, which were both expected to 
be steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Lumber and Furniture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers at the International Furniture Market in High Point, North 
Carolina, indicated that the '93 market was the strongest since 
before the industry slump of 1988-91. Buyers were more confident 
than in the past few years and were trying to rebuild their 
inventories as quickly as possible. In addition, furniture analysts 
suggested that many retailers would be refurbishing their stores in 
order to better display new products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cost-conscious consumers and high lumber prices were squeezing 
manufacturers' profit margins. Three reasons were cited for high 
lumber prices: (1) recent weather has hindered timbering; (2) 
competition in the lumber industry has lessened as regulations have 
forced small mills out of business; and (3) environmental 
restrictions have reduced the availability of timber, despite 
increases in forest areas and volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the District indicated that 
tourist activity for March and the first two weeks of April declined 
when compared to February and to a year ago. The respondents 
attributed the declines to the "Blizzard of '93" and weak consumer 
confidence. Respondents also indicated that tourists were not 
spending as much per person. Spring bookings were unchanged when 
compared to a year ago, and all of the respondents expected tourist 
activity to improve during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey indicated that retail activity strengthened 
during late March and early April. Retailers reported increases in 
shopper traffic and sales, including sales of big-ticket items. 
Wages and prices rose, while employment and capita1 expenditures 
remained unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers were optimistic about their prospects for the next six 
months. They expected sales, shopper traffic, wages, prices, and 
inventories to increase. They foresaw no change in employment or 
capital expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports--Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk)--indicated that both imports and exports 
were generally higher in March than in February. Compared with a 
year ago, both imports and exports were about the same at Baltimore 
and Hampton Roads but were higher at Charleston. Exports were 
expected to continue increasing at Charleston and Hampton Roads but 
to remain unchanged at Baltimore during the next six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone indicated 
that credit conditions improved during the last six weeks. 
Respondents stated that commercial and consumer loan demand was 
steady, while commercial and consumer loan rates were down slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential mortgage demand strengthened during the last six weeks. 
Application volume was at a record-high level in March, but fell off 
in April. Home mortgage loan rates were, on net, little changed 
during the period. Rates bottomed out in early March, rose during 
the next few weeks, and began to decline again in April. Activity 
was about evenly divided between originations and refinancings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate analysts surveyed by telephone reported that residential 
activity remained relatively strong, although adverse weather 
conditions delayed housing starts in some parts of the District. 
Residential sales varied across the District but were, on net, 
higher; sales remained strongest for homes in the mid-price range.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of existing homes remained mostly steady, but prices of new 
homes rose because of higher lumber costs. In areas where the 
residential market was strongest, higher costs were almost entirely 
borne by homebuyers. In other areas, however, the result was lower 
profit margins for builders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate activity remained strong in the Carolinas and 
Richmond but was weak in Maryland and the D.C. area during the past 
six weeks. Analysts noted that vacancy rates fell faster in the 
suburbs than in the downtown areas. Leasing activity was 
particularly strong in the retail sector because of a shift towards 
large, value-oriented stores. Analysts also reported an increase in 
industrial and warehouse leasing activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some new construction was underway, particularly for large, anchored 
shopping centers and government buildings. Little speculative 
construction was underway, but some analysts noted that a few 
builders were beginning construction with only 80 to 90 percent of 
the building preleased. Other analysts reported that a shortage of 
large blocks of office space would stimulate construction demand in 
the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Above-normal rainfall and below-normal temperatures across most of 
the District delayed spring planting activity and led to the 
deterioration of some crops. Corn and tobacco plantings were only 5 
to 8 percent complete, compared to 25 percent or more normally. 
Vegetable crop plantings were also behind schedule. Almost half of 
the District's small grains--planted last fall--were rated in fair 
or poor condition, either because they were drowned, were suffering 
from disease and powdery mildew, or were growing at below-normal 
rates on account of cold weather. On a more positive note, the 
condition of peach and apple trees improved during the last several 
weeks.
