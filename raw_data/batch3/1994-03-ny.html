      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's economy showed some underlying modest improvement in 
recent weeks, though unusually harsh weather slowed consumer 
spending and construction. Office vacancy races declined in several 
areas and District payroll employment continued to expand. While the 
majority of loan officers at small and midsized banks indicated no 
change in their willingness to lend from two months earlier, about a 
quarter said they were more willing to lend.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer Spending
Most District retailers reported disappointing sales results during 
January, due, in large part, to unusually cold and stormy weather 
during the last part of the month. Sales snapped back in early 
February, when the weather moderated, but additional winter storms 
battered the region at midmonth and were expected to reduce overall 
February sales results as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      While most contacts experienced January sales that were below 
expectations, retailers were fairly evenly divided between those 
with positive and negative results on a year-over-year basis. The 
changes ranged from -18 percent to +4 percent. Sales in suburban 
areas, dependent on cars, tended to be hardest hit by the ice and 
snowstorms, while in areas with mass transit, sales held up to a 
greater extent. Practical items such as home furnishings, 
electronics and outerwear were the best sellers, and several 
retailers noted that fashion apparel remained relatively weak. 
Inventories were generally at comfortable levels despite the recent 
storms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity has been relatively slow throughout the 
District in the wake of the continuing ice and snow conditions, but 
builders anticipated a moderate overall increase in starts this 
year. They cited low mortgage rates, some improvement in consumer 
confidence, and more realistic home prices as the basis for their 
outlook. In New York City, two developers have begun construction of 
the first apartment buildings that take advantage of recent changes 
in local and federal laws providing added incentives for such 
undertakings. Construction of other new rental apartment buildings 
is expected to follow later this year as result both of these new 
incentives and of a reported improvement in the demand for rental 
housing in the City.
     </p>
     <p>
      The combination of virtually no new speculative office building and 
a moderate amount of leasing activity resulted in lower office 
vacancy rates in several parts of the District. The largest decline-
-about 1 1/2 percentage points over the September to December 1993 
period--was on Long Island, while smaller decreases occurred in 
northern New Jersey and Fairfield County, Connecticut. However, the 
primary vacancy rate in midtown Manhattan was unchanged in recent 
weeks, While the rates in downtown Manhattan and Westchester County 
rose as a result of the continued downsizing and merging of firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New York reported an over-the-year increase in payroll employment of 
55.000 in January, its fourth consecutive over-the-year gain, and 
New Jersey posted an over-the-year rise of 45,000 in January, its 
sixth consecutive gain. New York and New Jersey have been generating 
sufficient job growth in recent months to produce net gains in 
employment despite the ongoing cutbacks by several large employers. 
More cutbacks have been announced for the future. Nynex, the major 
local telephone company, will cut almost 17,000 jobs over the next 
three years, and A.T.&amp;T.; will eliminate as many as 15,000 jobs in 
its long-distance unit over the next two years. GTE will also 
eliminate 17,000 positions, although much of its workforce is 
outside the District. In addition, Mayor Guiliani plans to pare the 
New York City workforce by 14,000-l8,000. On a smaller scale, 
Grumman on Long Island, Niagara Mohawk in upstate New York, and G.E. 
in Schenectady plan reductions of several hundred additional workers 
each.
     </p>
     <p>
      As is the case for the national data, January unemployment rates at 
the state level are not directly comparable with earlier ones 
because of an extensive redesign of the household survey beginning 
with January data. However, New York's January rate of 7.1 percent 
and New Jersey's 6.8 percent represented decreases in unemployment 
from the old December survey figure to the new January figure even 
at a time when the new survey design increased the unemployment rate 
at the national level relative to the old December figure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The January survey of purchasing managers in Buffalo showed a sharp 
decline in the percentages of firms reporting improved orders and 
production, possibly reflecting adverse weather conditions. At the 
same time, a much higher percentage of respondents reported a rise 
in commodity prices in January than in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized 
banks in the District indicated no change in their willingness to 
lend when compared with two months ago, while about a quarter of the 
respondents reported an increased willingness to lend. Overall loan 
demand appears weaker on balance, with one-third of the officers 
reporting stronger demand and almost one-half reporting weaker 
demand. This weakness came mainly from a slowdown in residential 
mortgages and mortgage refinancing, with roughly two-thirds of 
respondents noting reduced demand for such loans. The only lending 
category for which more respondents reported an increase in demand 
rather than a decrease was the commercial and industrial sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      When asked about any response thus far to the recent increase in the 
federal funds rate, most respondents indicated that both their loan 
and deposit rates have remained the same as two months ago. 
Regarding expected movements in these rates in the near future, a 
few respondents foresaw increases, but significantly more expected 
no change in either loan or deposit rates. Approximately equal 
numbers of respondents reported higher, lower, and no change in 
delinquency rates. Some loan officers attributed their higher 
delinquency rate to seasonal factors such as higher consumer 
spending during the holiday season.
