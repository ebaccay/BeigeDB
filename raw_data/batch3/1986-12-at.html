      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Southeast remains mixed. Manufacturing 
employment has posted little growth, although employment growth in 
services is accelerating. Residential and commercial construction is 
active, but there has been a shift away from multi-family dwellings 
and office building. Lending has remained strong, but consumer 
purchases of cars and other durables have slowed. Stabilized oil 
prices have prevented further economic decline in the western part 
of the District. Crop production and income will be down 
substantially, although citrus growers should do well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's unemployment rate for September was steady at 8.1 
percent. The services industry kept its lead over all industries in 
both the level and growth rate of employment. Employment in the 
trade sector grew by 3.8 percent from a year ago in September, a 
slowing from 4.8 percent in the previous year. By contrast, 
construction employment growth has been flat since April.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing employment has registered little change since the 
first of the year. Lack of demand for petroleum-related machinery 
and nuclear power generating equipment has forced layoffs in some 
regional states. A slump in some capital goods markets—electronics 
and construction equipment—has hurt fabricated metal producers. 
Labor disputes in the steel and transportation equipment industries 
have idled nearly 4,000 workers in Alabama.
     </p>
     <p>
      More positively, apparel and textile employment has been increasing 
since July. Employment growth for food processors has been steady; 
falling commodity prices have stimulated this industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sixth District retailers reported moderate sales gains during 
October. Cooler weather spurred apparel sales across the region, but 
movement of big-ticket items was sluggish. Retailers in Tampa, 
Orlando, Atlanta, and Nashville noted strong consumer demand induced 
by fierce price and promotional competition, cutting profit margins. 
Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana retailers, however, report weak 
demand and less vibrant competition. Sales in Louisiana are expected 
to remain very weak despite the recent firming of oil prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the ending of aggressive marketing and financing programs in 
October, District car sales returned to the sluggish pace prevailing 
earlier this year. Car dealers in the region also fear that 
September sales have borrowed heavily from demand late this year and 
early in 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After declining in July and August, single-family building permits 
in the Sixth District turned up in September. Georgia led the nation 
in year-over-year sales growth of existing single-family homes. 
Florida placed third in the ranking, while only one state in the 
nation suffered a worse sales decline than Louisiana. Nashville 
stands out among District cities as a hotbed of activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in Miami report an all-time high of condominium 
inventories, and poor demand has brought multi-family construction 
in New Orleans to a standstill. Although builders in Atlanta and 
Nashville note slowing of construction, they believe their markets 
will fare better in 1987 than most in the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial developers across the Southeast report slowing activity 
and anticipate further deceleration in the coming months. New 
Orleans remains the region's weakest market, but contacts there 
report some expansion of retail construction to meet the demands of 
tourists and conventioneers. The south Florida market remains 
saturated with office, retail, and industrial space. Atlanta's 
glutted office market is leading developers to focus on retail and 
industrial construction. The relatively short construction time 
required for completion of such projects also suggests these markets 
will soon be saturated. Nashville developers are confident that 
their market will continue to experience strong but "controlled" 
growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans at large Sixth District banks grew at the same rate in 
September compared to a year ago. Real estate lending dipped 
slightly from August, while business and consumer loan growth 
maintained its August pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to the effects of tax reform, demand for home equity 
loans has surged across the region. Bankers say these loans have 
gained popularity because they retain at least partial interest 
deductibility under the new tax laws. Some bankers expect many 
homeowners to substitute these loans for card and installment 
credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Travel to the Southeast remains generally strong. Automobile travel 
has increased dramatically over last year. Passenger volume in the 
region's airports is also up, due largely to the addition of new 
flights. Cruise ship bookings are solid, according to industry 
sources. Convention business is up throughout the region. Year-to-
date tax revenues from the hotel industry are up around 10 percent 
over last year. However, in response to a large revenue shortfall, 
Louisiana has closed 22 out of 32 state-operated visitor facilities 
and is laying off tourist-related government employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since its low of $12.25 per barrel in midsummer, the price of Gulf 
Coast sweet crude petroleum has climbed approximately 15 percent to 
reach $14 in November. The price improvement was accompanied by a 20 
percent increase in the number of oil rigs operating in the 
District. Even so, the 140 active rigs in early November equaled 
slightly less than half of the number a year ago. Approximately 2.3 
million tons of coal were mined in October, down one million from 
October 1985 and roughly 9 percent less than in September this year. 
Despite a 5 percent coal price decline, oil and natural gas remain 
highly competitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural conditions are mixed; poultry and livestock producers 
are doing rather well, but income is down for most crops. Recent 
unfavorable weather and insect and disease damage have lowered field 
crop prospects in Louisiana, while recovery from the drought in 
Tennessee and Alabama has improved expected yields. Florida orange 
and grapefruit crops are projected to be almost 8 percent greater 
than last year. The lumber market has been relatively stable in 
recent weeks; prices have been modestly higher than during the 
summer but 10 to 20 percent less than last spring.
