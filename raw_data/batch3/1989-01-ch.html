      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 25, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity continues to expand in the Seventh District. The 
Christmas shopping season was stronger than expected for many 
retailers. Paperboard shipments have picked up after growing more 
slowly in the second and third quarters. Demand for steel continues 
strong. Motor vehicle production plans are at high levels, but some 
contacts expect slower sales in 1989 to require cutbacks. Demand for 
equipment is robust across a range of industries, but one contact 
notes increased hesitancy about further additions to capacity, out 
of concern that the economy may turn down in 1990. Construction 
activity has been above expectations, but advance indicators suggest 
that declines are likely. Some labor markets have tightened in 
recent years, but conditions vary widely among locations and 
occupations. Farm debt owed to banks rose last year, after declines 
in previous years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Merchants report generally favorable results for the Christmas 
selling season. An Illinois retailers' group estimates that its 
members' sales during the period were 6 percent or more above a year 
earlier. Many engaged in less promotional activity than in recent 
years. The picture is mixed, however; year-to-year sales gains at a 
large general merchandiser's Chicago-area stores were relatively 
weak compared with other parts of the country. Where sales were up, 
strength was in both durables and nondurables, including women's 
apparel. The pickup in apparel is expected to continue. Credit sales 
are high. Contacts have indicated that delinquencies have risen but 
not alarmingly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Markets for labor have tightened in the District over the past few 
years, but conditions differ substantially among geographic areas 
and occupations. A manufacturer planning additions to employment 
foresaw problems finding qualified factory workers at a plant in a 
"booming" Chicago suburb, but not at other plants. Stores in large 
shopping centers around Chicago reported difficulty finding clerical 
staff, particularly through the Christmas season. Fast food 
restaurants advertise continuously and prominently for employees. 
Some skills are in short supply. On the other hand, openings for 
other skilled and experienced workers appear quite limited, 
attributed partly to corporate downsizing and mergers. An 
outplacement firm reports a sharp rise, during the past 2 years, in 
the proportion of people willing to relocate out of state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for steel are strong but "orderly," with lead times shorter 
than at seasonal peaks last spring. Demand from auto and appliance 
makers continues at high levels. Sales to industrial equipment 
makers remain well above levels of a few years ago. Adequate 
capacity for these types of steel is in place for further expansion. 
Construction steel markets are strong, and the largest backlog in 
years will keep shipments brisk at least through the first half of 
1989. Steel service centers' sales continue vigorous.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industry observers think auto production plans may be excessive 
relative to likely sales. Inventory accumulation would lead to 
enhanced sales incentives, production cuts, or both. One source 
forecast a 2% decline in unit auto sales in 1983. Another expected a 
drop of 5% or more. Truck sales in 1989 were expected to be near 
all-time highs, but down a little from 1988's record pace. A heavy 
truck maker predicted continued strong demand for large trucks in 
early 1989, but thought a weaker economy and higher interest rates 
may subsequently cut into sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on the outlook for business equipment are mixed. The 
producers' durable goods sector continues to "roll on with great 
momentum," according to one source. Another expects capital spending 
programs begun in 1988 to keep investment vigorous in 1989. 
Strongest have been chemical process industries. Other industries 
reported to be adding to capacity include manufacturers of glass, 
appliances, tires, and some types of electrical equipment, as well 
as food processors, printers and airlines. Farm equipment sales may 
rise 15% to 20% this year, according to one producer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Buying of construction and mining equipment was up strongly last 
year, but an industry source thinks the replacement cycle in these 
sectors may be nearly over. Another contact reports increasing 
concerns about the risk of economic weakness in 1990 may result in 
smaller spending increases than indicated by recent national 
surveys. A maker of communications equipment and electronic 
components sees indications of slowing in both sectors, and expects 
the downtrend to continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Declines in contracts for residential and nonresidential building 
construction in the 5 District states point to a slowdown ahead. 
However, suppliers indicate that the current pace of building 
activity remains fairly high. Work on industrial buildings is 
particularly strong in the Midwest. Work on hospitals, convention 
centers, and office buildings is also described as strong. Gypsum 
board shipments to District states rose somewhat in 1988 (based on 
11 months of data) and are expected to be about even in 1989. (In 
view of the strength of construction material shipments to building 
sites and of construction industry employment, two contacts regard 
Commerce Dept. figures on nonresidential construction activity 
nationwide in 1988 as too low, particularly for industrial 
buildings.)
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farm debt owed to banks turned up modestly in 1988, following a 16 
percent slide over three years in District states and a 13 percent 
decline nationwide. Call Report data as of the end of the third 
quarter show that farm debt owed to banks was up 3.4 percent from a 
year ago in District states, and up 3.0 percent nationwide. The 
gains stem from continued strong growth in farm real estate loans 
and, for the first time in 15 quarters, a nominal rise in farm 
production loans. Farm debt owed to other lenders continued to 
decline through the third quarter, but at a much slower pace than in 
recent years. About a year ago, banks moved ahead of the Farm Credit 
System as the largest institutional lender serving farmers.
