      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little change from the recent pattern of sluggish activity in the 
Tenth District is evident. While housing activity remains stronger 
than a year ago, some recent weakening is reported. Retail sales 
continue to improve but auto dealers are not optimistic about future 
sales. Both manufacturers' inventories of materials inputs and 
retail inventories are generally viewed as satisfactory. Neither 
retailers nor purchasing agents expect other than modest price 
rises. The energy and agricultural sectors resin depressed. 
Moderation in demand for mortgage funds at savings and loan 
institutions is expected to continue. Total loan demand at district 
commercial  banks was generally unchanged over the past month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report sales moderately stronger than a year earlier, with 
sales continuing to improve over the past three months. In the more 
recent period, sales of furniture, bedding and apparel have been 
particularly strong in most instances. Retail prices are reported to 
be steady. Inventories are generally regarded as satisfactory, with 
a few respondents trimming stocks. Sales growth is expected to 
continue at about the seine pace, with little increased inventory 
growth and steady prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto dealers report good to very strong sales during the last month. 
Ample low-priced credit has stimulated sales. Inventories of 1986 
models are being reduced significantly and 1987 model inventories 
are growing. Dealers are not optimistic about the outlook for future 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents continue to report slightly to moderately higher 
prices for major inputs, but expect little further change in the 
period ahead. Materials continue to be readily available, and no 
problems with availability or lead times are expected. Inventory 
levels are regarded as satisfactory and little change is expected in 
inventory activity. None of the respondents report any production 
bottlenecks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area homebuilders still report starts up aver a year ago, but some 
weakening in the past month. Starts of multifamily dwellings are up 
less than single family starts. Most homebuilders expect housing 
activity to remain about the see during the rest of the year. Sales 
of new homes, and changes in new home prices vary depending upon 
location. Builders generally report good availability and steady 
prices of materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of savings and loan respondents have experienced light to 
moderate savings outflows recently, while inflows have been slight 
for others. Most anticipate little improvement in savings inflows 
until the first quarter of 1987. Demand for mortgage funds has 
apparently begun to moderate. This moderation is expected to 
continue, influenced partly by the passing of the "refinancing 
bulge" and by seasonal factors. Mortgage interest rates have 
stabilized and are expected to remain steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The serious slump in the district's energy industry continues 
despite somewhat firmer prices resulting from the recent OPEC 
agreement to temporarily cut output. The average weekly number of 
operating drilling rigs in the Tenth District was up slightly to 215 
in September from 208 in August, but remains far below the 550 rigs 
counted in January. Exploration and development activity is expected 
to remain depressed as a result of uncertainty about the future 
course of oil prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      September's record-setting rainfall hit three district states 
especially hard. Prolonged, heavy rainfall delayed harvest as much 
as 30 days in parts of Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. While losses 
in Missouri and Kansas are expected to be minor, 20 to 50 percent of 
the Oklahoma wheat pasture planted after mid-September was destroyed 
by heavy rains. There are no estimates yet of damage to Oklahoma's 
cotton crop. The rainfall also delayed winter wheat planting by as 
much as 30 days in parts of Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. In some 
areas, the delay means there will be no winter wheat planted this 
season. Livestock marketing in southwest Oklahoma was down due to 
the inclement weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among cow-calf operations in the district, a mixed pattern of both 
selling and holding spring calves has emerged. Operators holding 
calves are doing so either to rebuild their herds, or to take 
advantage of cheap and plentiful feed grain. Some operators are 
selling calves this fall in response to favorable prices. In other 
cases, lenders are requiring the sale of calves for paydown of 
livestock loans. And in Oklahoma, some selling has occurred because 
wheat pasture is flooded.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite strong hog prices, agricultural lenders in Missouri, Kansas, 
and Nebraska see no signs of expansion in pork production. Hog 
producers, concerned about keeping current on their loans, are using 
hog profits to pay down debt. As long as this activity continues, 
the expected expansion in pork production will likely be delayed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand was generally unchanged and total deposit activity 
has been mixed during the past month at Tenth District banks. Some 
bankers surveyed indicate an increase in residential real estate 
loan demand but most report unchanged or weaker demand for these 
loans. Commercial and industrial, consumer, commercial real estate, 
and agricultural loans are also mostly unchanged or down from one 
month ago. None of the respondents have changed their prime rate or 
consumer loan rates during the last month but most expect rates to 
fall some by yearend. Among deposit accounts, NOW, super-NOW and 
passbook savings accounts remained constant or increased. MMDA 
accounts were constant at most banks in the sample while other 
deposit categories were mixed.
