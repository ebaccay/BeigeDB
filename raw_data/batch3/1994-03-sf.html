      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      California continues to lag behind the national economy, but much of 
the rest of the Twelfth District shows signs of solid economic 
growth. In California, weakness remains centered in the Los Angeles 
area, reflecting the region's dependence on aerospace and defense, 
while other regions of California are showing signs of bottoming out 
or of modest improvement. The Northridge earthquake is seen as 
causing a significant loss in quality of life in the Los Angeles 
region, but also should provide some short-term stimulus to the 
construction industry. In contrast to the California economy, Oregon 
and Arizona are experiencing solid growth across several sectors and 
the economies of the intermountain states continue to boom. Mixed 
conditions are reported in Washington, where weakness in aerospace 
is being offset by strength in other sectors and in the eastern part 
of the state. Business sentiment in the Twelfth District is strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders has improved 
significantly in recent months. Almost all of the respondents expect 
the real economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate 
at or above trend growth. This response is as strong as in January, 
but is up from three-quarters in November, two-thirds in October, 
and one-half in August. Furthermore, it remains the strongest such 
response in the six-year history of this survey. Respondents from 
California and western Washington, however, expect the pace of 
growth in their regions to lag the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail and services industry conditions are reported mixed in 
California but good in most other District markets. Consumer 
spending in certain parts of California is showing modest signs of 
improvement, with the strongest conditions in the San Francisco Bay 
Area and San Diego. Sales in Los Angeles and other parts of southern 
California. however, remain weak. Much of the increase in spending 
is reported in durable goods, especially autos and building 
materials, while nondurables remain sluggish. In Utah, favorable 
weather conditions helped sustain the pace of consumer buying 
following a very strong holiday season. One national retailer 
reports that overall sales are slightly better than in 1993. but 
that cold weather in the East and the Northridge earthquake had a 
sizeable negative effect in those areas. Another national retailer 
reports that current sales are on par with three months ago, but 
above a year earlier. Both national retailers report that 
inventories are in line with sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the telecommunications sector some shortage of cable supplies and 
broadcast equipment is reported. A contact in the newspaper industry 
reports some improvement in profits and ad volume at the end of 
1993. The contact reports that newsprint is selling at a deep 
discount due to oversupply and relatively weak demand. Visitor 
industry conditions remain sluggish in Hawaii, but an increase in 
advance bookings for 1994 has led to expectations for improvement. 
In southern California, visitor industry conditions are reported 
improving despite the earthquake.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity is mixed, with weakness reported in 
aerospace, defense, and wood products and strength reported in other 
sectors. A contact in Oregon reports that wood products production 
is flat due to timber supply shortages, but that other manufacturing 
companies in the region have experienced steadily improving sales 
and profits, particularly in durable goods. Another contact from 
Oregon reports strength in truck and rail car manufacturing, and 
that several expansions in the electronics sector are underway or 
have been announced. A contact from Silicon Valley reports that 
sales and production levels in the computer industry have improved 
during the past three months and are much better than a year 
earlier. Inventory levels in the industry have dropped and are 
expected to continue falling over the next quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Weakness in aerospace continues to act as a drag on the economies of 
southern California and western Washington, but contacts report that 
the pace of new announced layoffs has declined from a year earlier. 
The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to purchase United States 
manufactured aircraft will help preserve jobs in these regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural conditions are generally good. Several 
contacts report that feed grain product prices are rising, with 
dairies and feed lots paying more than in at least the last two 
years. In contrast, cattle prices are expected to soften in 1994 due 
to increased inventory. The oil industry in California's Kern county 
is depressed, with oil prices at about the cost of extraction.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the lumber industry, a contact reports that prices fell back from 
the January peak levels, but have stabilized about 15 percent over 
the 1993 average price level. Furthermore, with public timber 
supplies all but gone, the overall prices will stay above 1993 
levels in 1994. Another contact reports that the threat of 
additional regulation of private lands has led to a rush in 
harvesting of private timber.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Both residential and nonresidential real estate and construction 
markets are reported strong in most District markets outside of 
California. Residential, commercial, and industrial construction is 
reported strong in central and eastern Washington, with low interest 
rates cited as a contributing factor. In Oregon, residential 
construction activity is reported up from a strong 1993 and several 
public infrastructure projects are underway. Boom conditions in 
construction and real estate continue in the intermountain states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sluggish construction and real estate markets persist in California. 
A contact in northern California reports an improving mood in real 
estate markets, but no significant increase in activity. Sales of 
single family homes in southern California are only slightly higher 
from a year earlier. In the Central Valley. residential construction 
is slow, with no real pickup expected until late in 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts report that as a result of the Northridge earthquake, 
construction activity in the Los Angeles area will increase as 
repair and reconstruction efforts get underway The timing of the 
activity, however, is uncertain. One contact expects increased 
activity for architectural, engineering, and construction services 
for residential repairs over the next six to twelve months With 
respect to freeway construction, the state has announced a plan to 
complete much of the rebuilding by the end of this year. Some 
contacts, however, report that freeway construction could stretch 
well into 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some increased lending activity is reported in District financial 
markets. A contact in eastern Washington reports somewhat stronger 
commercial loan activity. In Oregon, loan demand is reported very 
strong in all categories, but especially in real estate sales. A 
contact from the California agricultural industry reports some 
easing in bank lending policies. A contact in northern California 
reports that small businesses find it very difficult to qualify for 
conventional bank financing, despite public announcements by 
commercial banks of their commitment to this market.
