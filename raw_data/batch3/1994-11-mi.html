      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy continues to gain momentum. Construction 
continues strong. Manufacturers report continued good sales. Banks 
and financial service firms report excellent profits. Natural 
resource industries face favorable prices, and many mines and 
building board plants are operating near capacity. The 1994 crop is 
a record one in many areas and livestock numbers remain high. 
Vehicle sales are still the strongest force pulling the retail 
sector, but general merchandise sales are also robust. Summer 
tourism was excellent in most areas and some observers anticipate an 
active winter season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment remains higher than year-earlier levels in all parts of 
the district and continues to grow. Unemployment rates are generally 
lower, particularly in metropolitan areas and in some cases are at 
their lowest level in two decades. Some firms report difficulty in 
finding skilled employees and reports of wage pressures are more 
frequent than in mid summer. Prices increases for steel, paper, 
plastics and other manufacturing inputs are reported, but prices for 
agricultural commodities and petroleum have eased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction remains a robust sector across the district. In 
Minneapolis-St. Paul, new residential permits for August were down 
somewhat from year-earlier levels, but industry officials still 
categorize building activity as strong. "Because 1993 was such a 
fantastic year for the single-family residential construction 
industry, 1994 has to work that much harder to beat it," said one 
building association official. Builders in metropolitan areas of 
North Dakota and South Dakota also continue to report strong 
business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and heavy construction is running ahead of 1993's hearty 
pace. Publicly let contracts in Minnesota and the Dakotas for 
September were 4 percent above 1993 levels. Contracts for the first 
three quarters of 1994 were 6 percent above year-earlier figures and 
18 percent above 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment numbers illustrate the strength of the two-year 
construction boom in the western part of the district. In North 
Dakota, South Dakota and Montana, August 1994 construction 
employment stood 11 percent, 16 percent and 19 percent, 
respectively, above the same month in 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers report good orders, particularly for farm machinery 
and components for the auto industry. Many publicly-traded 
manufacturing firms announced strong revenue increases over 1993. 
One Minnesota-based utility noted that electrical use by industry 
grew from August 1993 to August 1994, at twice the five-year average 
rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and financial services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks reportedly face excellent business conditions. Two large, 
publicly traded, Minneapolis-based banks announced record earnings 
for the third quarter. Several bankers responding to a survey of 
agricultural credit conditions also noted that their banks' earnings 
were solid in spite of continuing financial stress for some farmers. 
Two large insurance firms based in Minnesota also announced 
favorable earnings. However one securities firm reportedly suffered 
substantial losses in derivatives positions held earlier in 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Favorable prices are spurring production in natural resource 
industries. After a long period in the doldrums, paper producers 
face strong demand for many grades, and sales volumes and prices 
have both increased. Prices remain very favorable for most metals, 
and mines are generally running at capacity. In August, Minnesota 
mines employed 22 percent more workers than two years previously. 
Oil and gas drilling rig counts have recovered from earlier in the 
year and are about at year-earlier levels, though oil production in 
the district continues to decline. Lumber and building board output 
in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan remains strong, in contrast to 
South Dakota and Montana where cutting restrictions have sapped
production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The 1994 harvest is excellent in all Ninth District states and is 
setting records in many areas. Spring wheat production in Montana 
nosed out the previous record set in 1993. Sugar yields are very 
favorable in Minnesota and North Dakota. Record corn and soybean 
harvests are expected in South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Some 
potato producers suffered losses from excess rain in early fall, but 
yields are good overall as are those of edible beans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wheat prices have recovered somewhat from lows set in late summer, 
but corn prices have declined to the lowest level in three years. In 
spite of the bumper crop, comments from a Minneapolis Fed third 
quarter survey of farm bankers indicate that low crop prices will 
limit farm household and capital spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock numbers remain very high and prices continued to erode 
into early October. Farmers are expected to cut output of hogs by 
mid-1995 in response to current low prices, but for now pork 
supplies are more than adequate and retail pork prices are expected 
to decline even further in the next two months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Vehicle sales continue as the locomotive pulling retail sales. 
Pickup trucks are especially popular, September new registrations of 
all trucks in Montana ran 32 percent above the same month in 1993. 
New registrations of cars and light trucks in South Dakota for the 
year through September were over 4 percent above year-earlier 
figures. In Minnesota, the increase for the same period was nearly 5 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mall managers and a regional department store chain report good 
sales. Minneapolis-based national retailers announced very good 
sales for September, with the best results in mid-priced and 
discount stores but less satisfactory sales in traditional 
department stores. Directors from western areas of the district 
report very favorable conditions for retailers, but in Michigan's 
Upper Peninsula "sales are so-so."
     </p>
     <p>
      However the summer tourist season in the Upper Peninsula is 
described as "excellent, and the fall and winter are expected to be 
very good also." Wisconsin tourism continues a strong year with 
seasonally high occupancy rates at resorts this fall. A Minnesota 
tourism industry association described 1994 as the best season in 
five years. Major attractions in South Dakota report double digit 
increases for September. Although Canadian traffic is slower, 
tourism numbers in Montana remain at last year's pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market indicators sketch a robust economy in the Ninth 
District. With the exception of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, August 
unemployment rates in most metropolitan areas were at 4 percent or 
less, with the dominant Minneapolis-St. Paul MSA at 2.9 percent. 
Montana's 3.6 percent rate was the lowest in 24 years. Overall 
employment numbers are 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent above year-earlier 
levels. News media, directors and industry sources indicate that 
some firms have difficulty securing enough workers with desired 
skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence of upward pressure on wages and prices is emerging. 
Directors and news media note that some employers have raised wages 
in attempts to secure needed workers in tightening labor markets. A 
major credit card processor in South Dakota announced a 6.7 percent 
increase in compensation for 2,100 non-managerial employees. A St. 
Paul commercial building contractor said that compensation costs for 
skilled building trades will increase by 8 percent or more for 1995. 
But directors continue to report some new labor agreements with 
modest wage increases. Moreover, a Minneapolis-St. Paul personnel 
managers association poll of its members projected pay increases of 
4 percent in 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several sources report price increases. Steel prices for 
construction and manufacturing have risen by as much as 10 percent 
since January and some steel users anticipate further increases. 
Plastic laminates and particle board for cabinetry have increased by 
8 percent. Other manufacturing inputs including plastics and non-
ferrous metals also have increased in price. Prices of some grades 
of office paper have increased by over 20 percent. But petroleum 
costs have declined from mid-summer levels and all prices of 
virtually all agricultural commodities are below year-earlier 
levels.
