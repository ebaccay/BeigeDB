      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 18, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District economy remains generally healthy and registered 
one further modest expansion since the last report. The percentage 
of purchasing managers who reported improved business conditions 
increased and leasing activity in the District's office markets 
continued at a moderate pace. Retail sales were sluggish during 
August but spending picked up somewhat in September. Activity among 
homebuilders has generally been slow though there continue to be 
some areas of strength. Small and medium-sized banks report strong 
demand for home equity loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales remained sluggish in August when a prolonged 
heat wave continued in many areas. Spending picked up somewhat in 
September though the extent of the improvement varies. Thus far, the 
sales results for the new fall fashions in women's apparel have been 
mixed. Items cited as in stronger demand were children's back-to-
school clothes, athletic apparel, electronics and toys.
     </p>
     <p>
      During August sales at District retailers whom we contact declined 
from a year earlier by from 0.5 percent to 5.5 percent, results 
which were definitely below plan. With the unusual heat, the main 
items in strong demand were air conditioners and fans. September 
brought a general improvement in sales with over-the-year changes 
ranging from -2.0 percent to +10.0 percent. For the most part, sales 
remained somewhat below plan but retailers are hopeful that year-to-
year gains will increase as the holiday season nears. Despite lower-
than-expected sales, inventories are generally at satisfactory 
levels and actually below plan at some retail chains as a result of 
strict monitoring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some further expansion in the District s business activity occurred 
in recent weeks. During September the percentage of purchasing 
managers in both Rochester and Buffalo who reported improved 
conditions increased—in Rochester to the highest level since March. 
Rochester, New York's leading manufacturing export center, is 
benefiting greatly from the dollar's relative weakness with its 
average factory workweek climbing to a record 45.4 hours at one 
point this year. Major exporters there include Eastman Kodak, Xerox 
and Bausch &amp; Lomb.
     </p>
     <p>
      Plans for several new projects in the District were recently 
announced. Port Chester, N.Y. officials signed an agreement for a 
$200 million harbor redevelopment which will include condominium 
homes, a yacht club, boat slips, a restaurant and commercial-retail 
space. In another attempt to reclaim a waterfront, Buffalo officials 
approved a $63 million plan which will include shops, offices, a 
hotel and a lakefront park. Since one of the developers of this plan 
was involved in the restoration of the Boston, Baltimore, and New 
York City waterfronts, Buffalo is hopeful that its project will also 
prove to be a popular tourist attraction. In the manufacturing 
sector, Bethlehem Steel unveiled plans to spend some $45 million 
over the next few years to enhance its three remaining operations in 
the Buffalo area. This follows announcements made earlier that 
General Motors will invest $80 million to build a new series of hi-
tech engines beginning this fall and that Motorola will build a new 
plant in that area as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity among District homebuilders has generally been slow in 
recent weeks though there continues to be some strength in upstate 
New York. Sluggishness in the resale market was cited as a major 
deterrent. Potential new homebuyers have reportedly not reduced 
asking prices sufficiently to sell their current dwellings, and a 
substantial inventory of existing homes for sale has developed. 
Higher mortgage rates and the satisfaction of pent-up demand during 
the past few years were also mentioned as contributing to the 
current slowdown in residential construction. Few observers 
anticipate improvement in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leasing activity in the District's office market continued at a 
moderate pace in recent weeks. Additional leases were signed for 
extensive space in several of the commercial buildings under 
construction on the developing west side of Manhattan and some 
renewed activity took place in lower Manhattan as well. Long Island 
continues to have one of the lowest office vacancy rates in the 
suburban U.S., due in part to temporary moratoriums placed by some 
communities on new buildings in recent years. Realtors report a 
turnaround in Westchester County's office market with increased 
demand and virtually no new supply resulting in lower vacancy rates 
and increased rentals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Based on a survey of small and medium-sized banks in the Second 
District, demand for home equity loans remains strong. Some officers 
stated that demand for home equity loans has never been greater, 
though others reported that demand is not quite as high as during 
the introductory period. Most expected demand will rise through 
early 1989 and especially during the upcoming holiday season. 
Approximately half of the banks in the survey indicated that they 
were aggressively marketing home equity loans at the present time. 
Because most home equity loans have adjustable interest rates, a 
popular marketing feature is a low cap on potential interest rate 
increases. Even at those banks without a promotion campaign, home
equity loans comprise a large and growing share of total consumer 
lending. Home equity credit is most commonly used to defray expenses 
related to home improvement and college costs, as well as for debt 
consolidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of bankers noted that borrowers using home 
  equity credit for debt consolidation usually did so for the tax 
  advantage, not because they felt pressed to reschedule overwhelming 
  debt. However, few banks actually inquire about the purpose of the 
  loan in the credit screening process. The officers believed that 
  prudence by borrowers and strict credit standards have thus far 
  resulted in very low delinquency rates for home equity loans. Many 
  commented that home equity loans have by far the lowest delinquency 
  rates of any consumer loan in their bank's portfolio.
