      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 19, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continued to expand with signs of acceleration in 
some sectors, according to most Federal Reserve District reports. 
Consumer spending, especially on household-related items, was strong 
during the holidays in most districts. Manufacturing activity 
strengthened, and the manufacturing employment picture improved 
somewhat. Residential real estate sales and construction grew 
robustly in almost all districts. Commercial real estate leasing and 
construction improved in some districts but remained generally 
sluggish. Loan demand increased somewhat in many districts. Several 
districts reported weather-related stress to agricultural crops, but 
crop prices rose and crop income prospects improved. Little upward 
pressure on wages and prices was indicated by almost all districts; 
however, reports of lumber price increases were widespread, and 
scattered labor shortages were reported. Weak economic conditions 
continued in southern California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in most districts enjoyed strong sales that met or 
exceeded expectations during the holiday season, although the Boston 
District's retailers were disappointed with their modest gains. In 
the Atlanta, Dallas, and New York Districts, stores offered earlier-
than-normal holiday price discounts and in the Chicago, St. Louis, 
and New York Districts, retailers indicated they advertised more 
than normal. Retailers in the Boston, Kansas City, Philadelphia, 
Richmond, and St. Louis Districts expected continued economic growth 
to boost retail sales moderately this spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts reported robust sales of electronics and other home-
related durables during December. Retailers in the Dallas, 
Minneapolis, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts indicated that 
automobile sales were strong, and those in the Kansas City and St. 
Louis Districts expressed optimism about prospects for sales of new 
cars and trucks in 1994. In contrast, the Atlanta, Chicago, 
Cleveland, Dallas, New York, and San Francisco Districts reported 
that apparel sales were weak; Kansas City, however, reported 
generally strong apparel sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts reported that manufacturing activity strengthened. 
Reports from Cleveland and Minneapolis indicated that some factories 
were operating near capacity, and several districts reported signs 
of stronger demand for manufactured products. The Atlanta, Boston, 
Dallas, and Minneapolis Districts noted increased demand for 
construction-related products, while stronger demand for automotive 
products was cited in the Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland reports. 
Personal computer orders strengthened in the Boston and San 
Francisco Districts, while capital equipment orders rose in the 
Cleveland District. The Atlanta District reported continued strength 
in textile orders arising from residential home sales and 
refurbishing. Defense-related manufacturing, however, continued to 
be sluggish in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, and 
apparel manufacturing apparently was lackluster in the Atlanta and 
Dallas Districts. Looking forward, manufacturers in several 
districts expected continued economic expansion in early 1994 and 
looked for continued improvement in business conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most reports of manufacturing employment indicated improvement. 
Producers in several districts increased employment a little and 
those in some districts planned to add workers if economic growth 
continues. Manufacturers in the Boston and Richmond Districts 
expected stable employment levels in 1994. Defense-related cutbacks 
in employment, however, were reported in the Atlanta, Cleveland, St. 
Louis, and San Francisco Districts, and apparel manufacturers in the 
Atlanta District reported further cutbacks in employment and a 
shortening of the factory workweek. In the New York District, 
several major manufacturers announced layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from most districts indicated substantial improvement in 
residential real estate sales and construction. Home sales increased 
in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City 
Districts. Homebuilding also increased in these districts and in the 
New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, where residential 
construction activity exhibited unusually strong growth. San 
Francisco contrasted continued weakness in residential sales and 
construction in southern California with robust housing activity in 
Idaho.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity was mixed. Office vacancy rates fell 
in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. New York reported some 
reduction in Manhattan vacancy rates, but that market was still 
considered weak. Commercial construction increased in the Richmond, 
Dallas, and Minneapolis Districts. Commercial real estate in 
California remained weak according to the San Francisco report.
     </p>
     <p>
      The New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San 
Francisco Districts reported tight markets for building materials 
and/or construction labor. In several districts, short supplies of 
these inputs delayed some construction projects; in some districts, 
the tightness in supplies of inputs led to higher construction 
costs, which placed upward pressure on housing prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial banks in most districts reported that loan demand 
strengthened somewhat. Bankers in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, 
Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts 
reported moderately higher commercial loan demand. Sluggish 
commercial lending was reported by banks in the New York District, 
however, and some lenders in the San Francisco District noted that 
commercial loan demand had weakened slightly. Consumer loan demand 
was reported to be moderately higher in the Atlanta, Cleveland, 
Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts 
but was unchanged in Richmond. Atlanta and Cleveland noted 
especially high levels of automobile lending, and Kansas City and 
Dallas indicated increases in residential real estate lending. 
Atlanta and Cleveland noted slight declines in mortgage 
refinancings, although activity remained high in both districts. 
Bankers in the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts 
reported sharp declines in refinancing activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts noted little general upward pressure on prices or 
wages, although several reported increases in the prices of lumber 
and building materials and scattered labor shortages. The Boston, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San 
Francisco Districts reported that virtually all retail and 
manufacturing prices were little changed, and Chicago reported that 
the prices paid by manufacturers declined. Energy prices declined in 
the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Prices of 
aircraft-quality aluminum were soft in the San Francisco District, 
but steel prices rose in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, and 
copper prices were somewhat higher in the Minneapolis District. 
Increases in the cost of lumber were indicated by the New York, 
Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas reports. The Richmond, Dallas, and 
Atlanta reports also indicated higher building materials prices. In 
the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, housing prices were moving up 
somewhat, and the New York report indicated that higher materials 
prices could soon lead to upward pressure on housing prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some districts reported tight labor markets for specific workers. 
Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated a shortage of 
skilled construction workers, and Chicago observed that finding 
skilled production workers and tradespeople was increasingly 
difficult. Dallas reported a short supply of temporary workers and a 
rise in their wages, but indicated that competition was keeping 
wages stable in other business services.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several districts indicated that worse-than-normal December weather 
and the lingering effects of abnormal summer and fall weather 
disrupted agricultural activity, but farm income levels remained 
steady. Snow and cold weather delayed winter small grain planting in 
the western part of the Richmond District, and cold weather delayed 
tillage in parts of Minnesota and North Dakota. Dry weather in the 
Dallas District damaged pastures, winter wheat, and the hay crop. 
Richmond and Dallas contacts expressed concern over the adequacy of 
hay stocks. San Francisco reported that potato production was down 
in Idaho but up strongly in Washington and Oregon. The Chicago, St. 
Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted higher 
crop prices. Several districts indicated that higher grain prices 
would support crop receipts, but Chicago and Kansas City also noted 
that higher grain prices would also push up feed costs and reduce 
profit margins for livestock producers. Chicago and St. Louis 
indicated declines in livestock production.
