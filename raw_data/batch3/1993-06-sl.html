      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent changes in District economic activity have been mixed. 
Numerous firms report uncertainty and trepidation concerning the 
budget deficit and health care proposals. Many retailers report that 
consumers also seem hesitant, as they are unwilling to commit to 
major purchases until they see the results of Congressional 
deliberations. Despite continued wet weather, District homebuilding 
is still on the upswing in most areas. Total loan growth has slowed 
at large District banks in recent months. Cool, wet weather 
continues to stymie farmers in many areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the District have increased modestly over one year 
ago. Sales are reportedly up between 2 percent and 3 percent; some 
in St. Louis report double-digit increases. Most contacts felt that 
their year-to-date sales expectations had been met. Price cutting to 
spur sales was reported only in Louisville, and only for jewelry. 
Contacts also report that consumers remain cautious about the 
effects of prospective fiscal policy changes. Most retailers, 
however, are optimistic about this fall and expect increased sales 
without many price cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      District auto dealers report that new and used domestic car sales 
are on the rise. Many dealers are optimistic and expect slow-to-
moderate growth through the end of the year. Sales of Japanese cars, 
however, have declined because of rising prices and the perception 
of improved quality of domestic cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing firms are somewhat optimistic, but many are 
unwilling to make commitments regarding employment or investment 
plans until the outcomes of current Congressional deliberations are 
revealed. Reports are therefore mixed. The areas of strongest growth 
appear to be Arkansas and northeast Mississippi. For example, a New 
York-based shirt manufacturer will open its eighth factory in 
Arkansas, employing an additional 300 workers. A meat-processing 
company will also open a new plant in eastern Arkansas that will 
employ 200. A school furniture maker is expanding its production in 
central Arkansas, creating an additional 100 jobs. Northeast 
Mississippi has two new firms, a furniture producer and a maker of 
building materials, which will employ 300 workers in the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other District areas are not as upbeat. For example, a shoe 
manufacturer reversed its decision about the fate of a western 
Tennessee plant and will close it in late July, eliminating 265 
jobs. In addition, a children's clothing manufacturer in Tennessee 
will close its plant in early July, eliminating 300 jobs. A St. 
Louis-based defense contractor laid off an additional 132 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonmanufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District nonmanufacturing firms have also expressed concerns about 
the pending deficit reduction and health care proposals. On top of 
these concerns, mines in southern Illinois and Indiana have closed 
as 3,100 union members went on strike. Positive reports were 
received, however, from some contacts. A trucking company in 
Memphis, for example, began operations at its new facility this 
month with more than 250 workers. Other contacts report increased 
use of just-in-time management of inventories, which has allowed for 
better inventory control and reduced costs. A recent survey 
indicates that 30 percent and 33 percent of the reporting firms in 
Memphis and Little Rock, respectively, will increase employment in 
the third quarter of this year. Some contacts in the construction 
industry report very high cement prices, but believe that such price 
increases are an aberration rather than a trend toward higher rates 
of inflation. Developers report that lease renewals no longer 
include the perks previously sought by lessees, although 
renegotiated rents can be up to 40 percent lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wet weather continues to be a problem for many District 
homebuilders, as contacts indicate that issuance of single-family 
building permits has been delayed by the rain. Nevertheless, a 
number of areas report double-digit increases in March and April 
permits over the same period last year. Sales of new and existing 
homes are strong in most areas of the District, with St. Louis a 
notable exception. Many realtors have expressed concern about low 
inventories of homes for sale. In central Arkansas, prices received 
by home sellers are very close to the asking price, and in 
Louisville existing homes valued at less than $140,000 are selling 
within five to eight days.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans on the books of a group of large St. Louis banks rose 
just 0.2 percent from early April through late May after a 1.1 
percent increase during the prior two-month period. All of the 
slowdown in growth was the result of a decline in commercial 
lending. Real estate loans increased 0.7 percent after a 0.2 percent 
increase in February and March; consumer loans rose 1 .6 percent in 
the April-to-May period after a 0.7 percent decline in the prior two 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cool temperatures and substantial rainfall have delayed planting and 
impeded crop emergence across the District. In many instances, 
planting took place under less-than-ideal conditions. Contacts in 
Missouri and southern Illinois have expressed concern over the 
planting delays and the slow development of the corn crop; as a 
result, some farmers have switched from corn to soybeans or sorghum. 
Record boll weevil infestations-a result of the mild winter and the 
wet spring-have been reported in most cotton-producing areas of the 
District. Although farmers have started to apply pesticide, some 
contacts believe that a substantial risk to the cotton crop is 
possible this year given the magnitude of the outbreak. Generally, 
the winter wheat crop is in good condition as the summer harvest 
approaches.
