      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is growing at a moderate 
pace, as indicated by information obtained in July. Manufacturers 
reported that business is improving at about the first half's modest 
rate. A reversal of the first half's downward trend in orders and a 
slight pickup in employment in July are encouraging signs for the 
industrial sector. Retailers contacted in July said the healthy pace 
of sales they have experienced for the past few months is 
continuing, with warm weather bolstering sales of summer clothes and 
seasonal goods. Growth in total bank lending in the region has 
slackened a bit since the beginning of the year, but Third District 
bankers report that business and real estate lending has been 
growing steadily for the past four months. Consumer lending, as 
classified for reporting purposes, appears to have fallen off, but 
some bankers say a drop in credit card lending has been offset by 
home equity loans. Deposit growth, however, has slowed, largely due 
to a run off in long-term certificates of deposit.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is for 
continued growth but at a somewhat slower pace. Manufacturers expect 
improving business for the rest of the year, although they are not 
planning significant increases in hiring or capital spending. 
Retailers expect the current growth of sales to slacken, but still 
forecast a good second half. Bankers expect slower growth in 
economic activity in the region in the next several quarters to 
result in smaller increases in loan volume than were booked in the 
first half of the year. Nevertheless, they express some concern that 
they may not be able to fund planned loan growth without raising 
interest rates paid on deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The modest growth that the region's industrial sector experienced in 
the first half of the year is continuing, according to the latest 
Business Outlook Survey. Just over one-fourth of the firms 
participating in the July survey stepped up production from June's 
pace, while 16 percent cut back; around half were operating at a 
steady rate. Conditions appear to be slightly better for durable 
goods producers than for nondurables makers. Reflecting the overall 
trend of slow growth, most measures of industrial activity made only 
fractional gains in July. New orders and shipments rose slightly, 
continuing the first half's pace. Showing more improvement, order 
backlogs turned up after declining for five months in a row, and 
employment rose fractionally for the third time this year. Although 
three-fourths of the companies surveyed in July reported steady 
payrolls, 17 percent added workers, while only 8 percent made cuts. 
Industrial prices in the region remain generally stable, although 
input costs are showing some upward movement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking to the future, area manufacturers contacted in July are 
mostly optimistic, but remain conservative in their planning. On 
balance, survey participants forecast gains for new orders and 
shipments, and larger order backlogs by the end of the year. 
However, local manufacturers do not expect the recent improvement in 
employment to continue, and they are planning only modest increases 
in capital spending. Price expectations are mixed. Half of the firms 
polled in July intend to hold the line on the prices of their own 
products, but one-third plan increases in the next six months; 60 
percent anticipate higher prices for purchased goods in the next six 
months, while one-third expect no change.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Merchants contacted in late July reported healthy rates of sales 
continuing from June. Store officials say sales for their fiscal 
second quarter (May-July) will probably meet or exceed plans, with 
increases from the year-ago period around 10 percent in dollar 
terms. Retailers say a long spell of hot weather has resulted in 
greater than expected sales of summer apparel and seasonal items. 
Less robust performance has been turned in by home furnishings and 
major appliances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking past the usual summer lull to the fall, retailers expect 
sales growth to slow from its current pace and to run about 
"average." They do not believe that business can continue to 
increase substantially unless overall economic growth accelerates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in early 
July was about 5 percent above the level at the beginning of the 
year. Loan volume appeared to be increasing at about a 10 percent 
annual rate in July, consistent with the second quarter's rate but 
slower than the first quarter's pace. Bankers contacted in July say 
that commercial and industrial lending and real estate lending are 
growing, but that consumer lending has fallen off. However, some 
commercial bank credit officers have analyzed the shift from credit 
card borrowing to home equity loans by their customers, and they 
conclude that total lending for personal expenditures is still 
increasing at about the same rate as it has grown over the past 
twelve months, around 10 percent annually for large Third District 
banks as a group.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers generally expect a period of sluggish 
economic growth ahead, resulting in a smaller increase in overall 
loan demand in the second half of the year than in the first half. 
With slower loan growth, some bankers say gains from the purchases 
and sale of securities will account for an increasing share of 
revenues, and that this will increase the variability of their 
earnings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most large banks contacted in July reported that deposit growth has 
been slower than expected since May. Long-term certificates of 
deposit are not being rolled over and bankers believe these funds 
are being reinvested outside the banking industry. However, total 
deposits continue to rise as a result of strong growth in other 
accounts, especially interest-bearing checkable deposits. 
Nevertheless, bank asset/liability managers say they may have to 
raise rates on money market deposits and other short-term accounts 
later in the year in order to maintain deposit growth in line with 
planed asset growth.
