     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District continued to ease in 
November, according to indications from business contacts. Although 
more industrial firms reported improving business in November than 
in earlier months this fall, overall manufacturing activity remained 
on a downward trend. Retail sales in October and November, including 
Thanksgiving weekend, were below sales in the same months of last 
year for most stores, and auto sales were continuing to drop. 
Bankers indicated that lending has been flat in recent weeks, with 
modest growth in mortgage lending offset by slower business and 
consumer lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      While there is some optimism among manufacturers, in general the 
outlook in the Third District business community is dim. Slightly 
more manufacturing executives expect business to pick up between now 
and next spring than anticipate continued slowing, but manufacturing 
employment generally is expected to continue falling. Retailers 
expect sales for the holiday period to be below last year's results 
and they are concerned that sales will remain soft in 1991. Auto 
dealers expect sales to continue dropping. Bankers predict continued 
softness in lending, due to weakening loan demand and further 
lending restraint prompted by the need to bolster capital.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial activity in the Third District continued to decline in 
November, but the severity of the downturn appeared to be 
diminishing a bit. Four out of ten manufacturers contacted for this 
report indicated that business was slipping, but this represented a 
slight improvement since early fall, when over half reported 
declining activity. Also, some firms indicated that business was 
improving in November, in contrast to early fall when there were 
virtually no manufacturers experiencing improvement. Nevertheless, 
the region's goods-producing sector remained on the downward trend 
that began a year and a half ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although there was a slight upturn in the number of firms that 
reported growth in shipments and orders in November, overall new 
orders, shipments, and order backlogs continued to shrink at area 
plants. Employment also remained weak, as Third District 
manufacturers continued to cut payrolls and working hours, on 
balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, the number of area manufacturers with optimistic 
forecasts slightly exceeds the number predicting further 
deterioration in business conditions. On balance, managers at area 
plants expect modest increases in orders and shipments over the next 
six months. However, with significant uncertainty still surrounding 
the outlook, they are planning further cutbacks in employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in late November generally 
indicated that sales for October and November were below the level 
for the same period last year and continued to be sluggish over the 
Thanksgiving weekend. While a few upscale specialty stores were 
doing well, most stores of all types were experiencing weaker sales 
than they had anticipated. Retailers indicated that inventories were 
at appropriate levels; nevertheless, many expressed determination to 
move out all merchandise ordered for the Christmas shopping season 
by the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Store executives' forecasts of final results for the holiday sales 
period reflect the recent slow sales pace. Most merchants expect 
Christmas sales this year to be below last year's, with forecasted 
declines ranging up to 10 percent, in dollar terms. Retailers also 
generally expect slow sales in 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers reported a continuing decline in unit 
sales, and they were paring orders to manufacturers and keeping 
inventories lean. Most expect the downtrend to continue regardless 
of the course of the overall economy, and they do no expect more 
than slight temporary upticks in sales in response to current or 
future rebates or other marketing efforts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Aggregate loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in 
early November was approximately 9 percent above the year-ago level 
but flat compared to the prior month. Commercial and industrial loan 
volume was below the year-ago level, continuing on the downward 
trend that began during the summer; bankers surveyed in late 
November said the continued softening in commercial and industrial 
lending was partly due to easing demand and partly to continuing 
lending restraint by banks. Consumer lending in November was well 
above a year ago, but bankers said growth was slowing noticeably, 
and they attributed this to increasing caution among consumers in 
light of economic uncertainties and growing debt burdens. Real 
estate lending was still growing modestly, mostly due to residential 
mortgages; bankers described commercial real estate lending as 
"inactive."
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District bankers is for a continued pullback 
in lending to business, lasting into mid-1991 at least, and softness 
in consumer lending until economic growth picks up. They expect 
banks' participation in commercial real estate financing to be 
restrained for an indefinite period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several bankers expressed concern about the imposition of new 
minimum capital standards. Many banks expect to limit or reduce 
assets in anticipation of needing to meet a capital-to-assets ratio 
of greater than 3 percent; however, some said reducing assets 
through securitization is becoming less attractive. The large number 
of banks attempting to sell assets is resulting in lower prices and, 
consequently, less funds are being generated from downsizing than 
had been expected.
