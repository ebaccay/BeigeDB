      Beige Book Report: Chicago

       August 3, 1994
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic growth has moderated from the robust pace 
of late 1993 and early 1994, but generally continued to advance at a 
good rate during the seasonally slower summer period. Survey data 
and reports from retailers suggest that sales growth may have picked 
up again in June and early July, after slowing in April and May. 
Manufacturing and distribution activity remained vigorous. Somewhat 
weaker demand has played a role (along with tight supplies) in 
constraining auto sales, but discussions with auto manufacturers and 
dealers suggest that underlying demand for vehicles remains 
relatively strong. Higher mortgage interest rates have definitely 
slowed housing activity, however. Competitive forces continued to 
preclude price increases in retailing, while industrial materials 
continued to rise. Labor shortages have been reported more 
frequently, but few manufacturers expressed concern about developing 
wage pressures. Favorable weather has significantly bolstered 
prospects for the District's fall crop harvest, and prices for corn 
and soybeans have fallen markedly since mid-June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales/Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys and discussions with large retailers suggest that retail 
sales continued to grow at a moderate pace, after slowing earlier in 
the second quarter. One large retailer stated that "April and May 
were a small setback, but we think this is a boring, slow, middle-
of-the-road upward trend, and it is likely to continue." Sales 
growth in this firm's District stores has been below the national 
average during 1994, but only because sales recovered in other 
important market areas later than they did in the District. Another 
large retailing firm reported that "the overall trend is not as 
strong as it was, but it's still very good." Sales gains in 
household furnishings continue to outperform those for apparel, 
according to several retailing firms. Sales tax revenues continued 
to post strong gains in Illinois through June. A state official in 
Michigan noted that growth in sales tax revenues has implied greater 
economic growth in the state than recent employment and income data, 
even after adjusting for the impact of changes in the tax law. 
Discussions with 12 auto dealerships were mixed but suggestive of 
relatively strong vehicle demand, although growth may still have 
slowed from earlier in the year. Tight supplies are still cutting 
into sales gains, and some (but not all) dealerships stated that 
higher interest rates were also dampening sales. No dealership 
expected accelerating lease expirations to hamper future new car 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing sales and construction have lost some momentum in recent 
months. An association of homebuilders reported that sales and 
traffic fell off significantly further than seasonally expected in 
May and June. Activity is well below expectations held earlier in 
1994. One large homebuilder stated that "the initial sales push from 
fears of higher interest rates seems to have played itself out. The 
overall impact of higher rates is now negative." Demand from non-
discretionary buyers has held up relatively well under rate 
increases, according to this contact, but May and June results were 
still characterized as "lousy." and below plan. One of the largest 
realtors, in the District reported that transactions volume in June 
was significantly below its year-earlier level; year-to-date in 
1994, sales are even with last year, and "the trend isn't good." A 
large bank reported that housing loan demand has fallen off in 
recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Survey results and reports from manufacturers indicate that 
manufacturing activity remained vigorous. The production components 
of purchasing managers' surveys around the District continued to 
increase or remain at high levels in June. A large manufacturer of 
industrial power equipment division cited strong demand from the 
steel industry as a primary factor in its continuing sales gains, 
both from integrated mills (striving to improve productivity) and 
mini-mills. The underlying momentum in steel production remained 
strong, according to an industry analyst who recently raised his 
forecast for shipments in 1994. Construction and mining machinery 
sales (in units) rose significantly in the Midwest in the first 
quarter, although an industry analyst believed that sales growth may 
have moderated since then. This contact indicated that higher 
interest rates seem to have had little effect on construction and 
mining equipment sales thus far in 1994. A large manufacturer of 
appliances reported slowing sales growth in most product lines (air 
conditioners being an important exception). Domestic appliance sales 
to dealers still reached a record for June, and continued gains in 
housing completions should help strengthen demand, but this contact 
expected sales to flatten out (on a seasonally adjusted basis) over 
the balance of 1994. A survey of heavy-duty truck operators 
suggested that utilization rose to the highest level for the second 
quarter in the past eleven years, and a greater-than-seasonally-
expected increase from the first quarter "spells heightened demand 
for ... replacement parts for the next six to nine months."
     </p>
     <p>
      There are not yet any extraordinary shortages of construction 
equipment arising from an ongoing strike: some machine types are on 
allocation, but an industry analyst noted that "this is typical for 
the industry tight now." Overseas productive capacity is still 
underutilized for most of the affected manufacturers' product lines. 
A capital goods manufacturer stated that sales to the paper industry 
remain relatively weak, even as that industry's operating rate has 
risen to high levels, because paper manufacturers' profitability has 
suffered with weak prices due to low capacity utilization levels 
among overseas manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Discussions with retailers revealed little if any upward movement in 
the consumer prices. Asked about pricing, one large chain stated 
that "if you're looking for inflation, you better find another 
industry." Another large retailer indicated that the firm is still 
trying to lower prices "wherever possible." On average, this firm's 
prices have continued to decline. A number of banking, retailing, 
and construction equipment firms cited renewed vigor in shopping 
center development and otherwise increased retailing capacity as 
evidence that competitive conditions will dampen retail pricing for 
some time to come.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial material prices continued to climb faster than the 
overall price level. The price component of purchasing managers' 
surveys in Chicago, Detroit and Western Michigan each rose in June, 
and have been on upward trends during 1994. Finished steel prices 
have been heading higher this year on the spot market, while 
contractual prices with automakers are also expected to rise. After 
dropping off significantly in March and April, scrap steel prices 
firmed and rose anew during May and June, and an industry analyst 
expected further gains in coming months. A large petrochemical firm 
noted that future supply conditions are highly uncertain (citing 
output in the former USSR, in particular), and refrained from 
speculating about the future path of oil prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several regional analysts reported strong gains in help-wanted 
advertising in their respective market areas, both in print as well 
as on the radio, with one noting increased advertising by employers 
based outside the local area where the ads appear. Few manufacturers 
stated that labor shortages were impacting wages, however, and those 
who did noted that upward pressures on wages were concentrated in 
skilled technical positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Favorable weather patterns this summer have offset earlier drought 
concerns and significantly bolstered prospects for the District's 
fall crop harvest. Crop condition ratings are among the highest in 
memory, especially in Iowa and Wisconsin where virtually all of the 
corn acreage is rated "good" or "excellent." The high ratings have 
prompted some analysts to view this year's potential harvest as 
comparable to the 1992 record. In line with these improved 
prospects. however, crop prices have retreated sharply. Both corn 
and soybean prices have fallen about 20 percent since mid-June.
