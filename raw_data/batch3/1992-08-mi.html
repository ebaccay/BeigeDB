      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Ninth District declined somewhat. Labor 
markets, which had been showing modest signs of improvement, 
deteriorated. Retail sales continued to exhibit only modest growth 
relative to last year's level. Home and truck sales were relatively 
strong, while automotive sales were reported to have fallen off 
recently. Manufacturing was steady to positive in the District, 
while conditions in the construction sector were mixed. Conditions 
in the agricultural sector could become quite positive if the 
weather turns warmer this summer after a cool, wet first half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates rose across almost the entire District in May 
relative to their year-ago and month-ago levels. The only exceptions 
to this pattern were the Upper Peninsula where rates were 
substantially lower than their month-ago level, and western 
Wisconsin where unemployment rates were mixed. There have been a 
number of layoffs in the District, suggesting that unemployment may 
continue so be high when June and July figures become available. 
Also consistent with the rise in unemployment was the moderate 
growth in nonagricultural employment in May. June numbers are 
available only for Minnesota where nonagricultural employment was 
only 1 percent higher than its year-ago level. On the slightly 
brighter side, a recent study ranked the Minneapolis-St. Paul area 
fourth best in terms of job creation in a metropolitan area over the 
past year; however, this may be more a sign of national weakness 
than of local strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reported increases in prices and wages continue to be moderate with 
the exception of medical costs and, in parts of the District, 
construction costs. A major food distributor in the District reports 
that their index of retail food prices actually declined in recent 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in the District is generally moderate with some 
areas of strength. Major retailers in the District reported sales 
increases in comparable stores in June ranging from 2 to 17 percent 
relative to a year ago. Sales in rural areas are reported to be slow 
due in part to uncertainty over local agricultural conditions. 
Montana, however, reported a decline in their Canadian business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Canadian shopping continues to be strong in North Dakota, with 
retail outlets in shopping malls reporting substantial year-to-date 
sales increases relative to a year ago The Canadian government has 
sought to stem the cross-border flow. Recent regulations on 
appliance sales and service are reported to be having some effect on 
discouraging appliance sales. Additionally, in June the Canadian 
government agreed to collect provincial taxes on liquor and tobacco 
brought across the border. These factors, along with the greater 
driving distance involved, may explain Montana's recent declines in 
both Canadian sales and traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car and truck sales were reported to be stronger in the District 
in June than they were in the nation as a whole. However, figures 
for the first part of July indicate that sales have slowed somewhat, 
with some dealers reporting sales declines of over 15 percent for 
the first 20 days of July relative to year-ago levels. Truck sales, 
which have been strong in the District, are reported to be holding 
up better with sales in the first part of July reported to be 
slightly above their year-ago level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home sales which sagged in April and May after being quite strong in 
the first quarter, rose in June. Existing home sales in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area rebounded by 18 percent in June, relative 
to a year ago, though the median sales price was down slightly from 
a year ago. The housing market is reported to be booming in parts of 
Montana, due in part the continuing influx of wealthy out-of-state 
buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The summer vacation season is well under way and despite the cool 
wet weather, indications are generally good. Tourism in the District 
is being aided by special events and local government spending to 
promote it. By way of example, there was a five day International 
Polkafest which attracted 10,000 people to Chisholm, Minnesota, and 
the Country Fest which attracted 80,000 to 100,000 people over a 
four day period to Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Glacier National Park is 
reported to be completely booked for the summer. Though crossings 
over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula were off by almost 
2 percent in June relative to a year ago, their year-to-date level 
is still 4.2 percent higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction was mixed, with reports that it was booming in Montana 
and North Dakota, while from other parts of the District there were 
more negative reports. In Minnesota, total housing permits in May 
were down by 10 percent relative to a year ago. Commercial 
construction in the important Minneapolis-St Paul area continues to 
show weakness due to the overhang of commercial real estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions improved slightly in the District's manufacturing sector. 
The May level of average weekly hours in manufacturing in Minnesota 
of 40.5 was above its year- and month-ago level of 39.9. The June 
level of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area's average hourly earnings in 
manufacturing was up 2.5 percent from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions were mixed in the agricultural sector. Recent cool 
weather has slowed crop growth, however the precipitation that 
accompanied it has been most welcome. The fall harvest depends on 
how warm August turns out. There has been some hail damage in a few 
spots. The North Dakota mid-June index of prices received on farm 
products was up 4 percent from its year-ago level, with crop price 
increases of 13 percent and livestock price decreases of 8 percent.
