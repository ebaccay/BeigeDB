      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions remain weak in California, but are improving 
moderately in other District states. In California, further cutbacks 
are reported in aerospace and defense-related manufacturing. In 
addition, the state's fiscal problems threaten layoffs in education 
and other government services. Outside of California, moderate 
improvement is reported in retail trade, non-defense manufacturing, 
and residential construction. The strongest conditions remain in 
Utah and Idaho, but drought is threatening agriculture in certain 
sections of the Pacific Northwest. Overall business sentiment 
declined since our last report. Little upward pressure on wages and 
prices is reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District business leaders are less optimistic than they were 
at our last report. Only one-third of our respondents now expect the 
real economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate of at 
least 2.5 percent. This proportion is down from one-half in June. 
Almost two-thirds of our respondents expect output to expand, but at 
a rate below 2.5 percent. The proportion of respondents expecting 
improvement in employment, consumer spending, investment, and 
housing starts also declined, with the proportion expecting a 
decline in the unemployment rate over the next four quarters 
dropping from two-thirds to one-third. Most respondents expect 
little change in the rate of inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts continue to report little upward pressure on wages in 
District markets. Salaries in some sectors of California higher 
education are expected to decline by 5 percent, and only nominal 
increases are reported for state and city workers in Arizona. In 
Hawaii, proposed wage increases for hotel workers may be delayed one 
year. In California, wage negotiations in the construction sector 
are reported to have been settled with no increase in labor costs. A 
wage settlement in the forest products industry, however, calls for 
an average 3.5 percent annual wage increase over the next two years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price changes are reported to be modest except for health care and 
insurance. Several respondents report retail price markdowns in 
department and shopping center stores. Supermarket prices are 
reported as last year's levels, wish slight increases in non-food 
items balancing declines in food products. Drought conditions, 
however, are raising utility prices in certain sectors of the 
Pacific Northwest. Due to the state's budget crisis, higher 
education fees for California's state universities are expected to 
climb 40 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts with major retailing operations report gradual improvement 
in department and discount store sales across much of the District. 
Sales were reported as "very soft" in June by one major retailer, 
but picking up in July. Sluggish conditions continue in southern 
California. Contacts report that auto sales are up slightly in 
California, but down in Arizona after a strong first quarter. Auto 
dealers in Utah report good sales. Some deterioration in consumer 
confidence is noted by many contacts, particularly in California 
where the state budget crisis and defense reductions threaten 
further employment losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Utah, strong expansion is reported in computer services, 
medical/health services, and engineering and management services. 
Layoffs in the insurance industry, however, are reported in 
California. Fiscal problems in California (and so a lesser degree 
property tax limitations in Oregon) are having a significant adverse 
impact on most levels of government.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cutbacks in aerospace and defense-related industries continue across 
the District, with major employment reductions recently announced in 
southern California due so production slowdowns and consolidations. 
Layoffs are reported in aerospace in Utah, and defense cutbacks have 
been felt even in the otherwise robust Idaho manufacturing sector. 
The recent weakening of airlines' financial positions due to fare 
wars has raised concern about further cancellations of commercial 
aircraft orders. Electronic components manufacturing remains weak in 
most District markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of defense and aerospace, conditions are improving modestly. 
In the Pacific Northwest, improvement is reported for fabricated 
metals, industrial machinery, and the region's shipyards. In Utah, 
production is expanding in office furniture, food products, and 
automotive airbags. Contacts report stable to declining employment 
in the utility industries. Railroad employment remains strong, 
however, due to increasing rail traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite some recent rains, the sixth year of drought is affecting 
agriculture adversely in many puts of the Pacific Northwest. 
Contacts report a shift to drought tolerant (but less valuable) 
crops like grains. Even so, winter wheat yields are reported at only 
85 percent of average. Water quality problems are reported, and 
reduced flows threaten trout streams and fish hatcheries. In Idaho, 
the drought could move up the timing of the potato harvest, 
affecting quality. Uncertain log supply and weak housing activity in 
California continues to hurt the lumber and wood industries in 
Washington and Oregon. A moderate decline in lumber prices is 
reported for the last two months, following good conditions earlier 
in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity varies substantially across 
District markets. The strongest conditions are in Utah, Idaho, and 
eastern Washington. Property sales in Salt Lake City are reported up 
25 percent from a year earlier, and the combined value of Idaho 
construction is up 57 percent from a year earlier. Home construction 
and remodeling work is reported to be expanding in Oregon, where dry 
weather has advanced the start of the summer construction season. 
Home sales in Oregon for May were reported up 14 percent from their 
year-earlier level. Residential construction in Arizona continues to 
improve, though little commercial and industrial activity is 
reported. The housing market in California, however, is reported 
sluggish. New home construction remains weak, with permits for the 
first five months of 1992 down 12 percent from a year earlier. Sales 
of new and existing homes have rebounded somewhat from the weak 
conditions of late 1991, but remain below their year-earlier levels. 
Commercial real estate conditions remain depressed in southern 
California, with transaction prices of some properties falling 
substantially below replacement costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, contacts in financial industries report flat to slightly 
improving conditions. Downsizing continues in California due to 
mergers, cost containment, slow loan demand, and increased problems 
in loan portfolios. Several southern California bankers expect 
future staff cuts. Large California banks are reporting declines in 
commercial, consumer, and real estate lending. The bulk of real 
estate lending is for refinancing rather than for new loans. Soft 
loan demand has allowed California banks so make sizable additions 
to their securities holdings. The banking industries in Utah and 
Idaho continue to enjoy favorable business conditions. Mortgage and 
consumer loan demand is very strong, while commercial loan demand is 
stable. Many banks across the District report sizable shifts from 
banks into liquid money fund accounts or into higher yield bond 
funds in response to lower interest rates.
