     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 20,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Aided by lower interest rates, conditions in much of the Ninth 
District have stabilized early this year. Consumer spending, 
employment, and construction have all done fairly well. Construction 
has been generally strong, and many new construction projects are 
planned. Conditions in the resource-related industries, however, are 
still mixed, and only a little improvement was evident in the 
agricultural sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales of general merchandise in the district have done fairly 
well so far this year. After experiencing strong year-end holiday 
sales, one diversified retailer reports reasonable sales growth in 
January, traditionally a slow month, and even stronger sales in 
February. In addition, the retailer notes that the sharp growth in 
credit sales, a cause of concern in some quarters, finally slowed 
late in 1985. Reports from large shopping malls in Sioux Falls, 
South Dakota, have been encouraging, with strengthening sales also 
evident in February. Growth in retail sales has not been uniform 
throughout the district, however. For example, Bank directors from 
northern and central Minnesota note lackluster sales in their 
communities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite some slowing late in February, motor vehicle sales have been 
good so far this quarter. One domestic manufacturer reports that its 
districtwide sales were up about 15 percent through February, 
although it has a large inventory of cars and trucks available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spurred by lower mortgage rates, housing activity has picked up in 
district areas with stable or growing populations. Compared with 
year-earlier levels, residential building contracts awarded in 
January were up 12 percent in Minnesota and up 19 percent in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. January home sales in the Twin 
Cities area were also up a healthy l2 percent from a year ago. In 
parts of North Dakota and in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, existing 
home sales appear to be up this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After worsening somewhat in the last half of 1985, employment 
conditions have stabilized in some district areas but have worsened 
in others. The district's overall seasonally adjusted unemployment 
rate fell a few tenths to 6.5 percent in January. In South Dakota, 
January employment was virtually unchanged from its January record 
level a year earlier. The typical seasonal employment decrease 
between December and January was the smallest there since January 
1976. In North Dakota, though, unemployment was up, primarily due to 
lower employment in the oil and construction sectors. Although 
seasonally adjusted employment in Minnesota increased between 
December and January, the unemployment rate still rose; however, 
part of the increase was probably due to some changes, made in 
December, in how the rate is measured.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in resource-related industries in the district have 
remained mixed. The drop in oil prices has continued to slow 
district oil and gas activity. A Bank director reports that the rig 
count in North Dakota was down to its lowest level in five yearsâ€”22 
rigs (compared with 150 at its peak). In contrast, the falling 
dollar bodes well for district paper production. In Duluth, 
Minnesota, financing is now arranged for a big new paper mill, and 
another paper mill in northern Minnesota is modernizing its plant. 
But a Bank director reports that wood pulp logging for paper mills 
in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has been hurt by imports, and a 
lumber mill in Montana has closed. An iron pellet plant in northern 
Minnesota is reopening in March, but with over 100 fewer workers 
than were originally employed there. A reopened copper mine in the 
Upper Peninsula is now hiring workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity in the district has generally been strong, and 
many new projects have been announced. Nonresidential building 
contracts in January were up 5 percent in Minnesota since January 
1985. Bank directors report numerous ambitious construction projects 
in the works. In and around Duluth, Minnesota, several projectsâ€”
including a large paper mill, a mall expansion, and expansions of 
several public facilitiesâ€”are expected to bring $500 million of 
construction activity to that hard-pressed area. Noteworthy future 
projects in South Dakota include a convention center and hotel in 
Pierre and a new community to house B-l bomber personnel in the 
Rapid City area. North Dakota also expects to benefit from $200 
million in military-related construction, in connection with nuclear 
missiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little improvement was seen in the district's agricultural sector in 
the past months. Bank directors report little change in conditions 
in their areas. One banker in South Dakota thinks that a third of 
the indebted farmers there will eventually leave farming, although 
not all this year. On a brighter note, a Bank director reports that 
the winter wheat crop in Montana looks good. And prices of farm 
goods have increased some recently. The Minnesota farm price index 
rose again in January, although it still remained 9 percent below 
its year-earlier level. Livestock prices have deteriorated, however, 
even though ranchers have kept herd sizes small.
