      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Fourth District economy remains lackluster. The unemployment 
rate remains high and employment shows little growth. Retail sales 
growth is positive but not robust. Manufacturing activity remains 
flat with the steel and machine tool industries continuing in 
difficulty. House sales are strengthening and builders plan to step 
up construction. Commercial bank loan demand remains moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the Fourth District remain mixed. 
Unemployment rates range widely around Ohio's current rate of 9.2 
percent (s.a.), from as low as about 4.5 percent in Lexington, Ky. 
to around 20 percent in some coal mining regions of southeastern 
Ohio and eastern Kentucky. Manufacturing employment shows little net 
change in recent months. A survey of manufacturing firms in the 
Cincinnati area indicates that, on balance, they expect a slight 
decline in their employment in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the Fourth District improved in October for most 
non-auto retailers, but sales growth was quite mixed within the 
District. Year-to-year growth rates of 7 to 9 percent were common in 
the southern half of Ohio (Cincinnati), but nearer 0 to 4 percent in 
the northern portions of the state (Akron, Cleveland, Toledo, and 
Youngstown). Sales of apparel, particularly women's apparel, showed 
relatively strong gains between September and October, while most 
hardgoods sales are still moderate or declining. One department 
store analyst anticipates "near-double digit rates of increase for 
the Christmas selling period", although in general, retailers are 
only guardedly optimistic over holiday selling prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similar to the national market, new-car sales in the District are 
down so far in the fourth quarter because of exceptionally high 
third-quarter sales. Sales of larger models are especially soft. 
Import car sales are reported strong and getting stronger. Truck 
sales are moderate, which is not unusual for this area. Large 
inventories of used cars accumulated from third quarter trade-ins 
are beginning to thin out.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District is flat while coal mining 
remains depressed. On balance, contacts indicate industrial 
production is flat or up slightly, new orders are down, and backlogs 
are falling. Manufacturers are holding employment steady, although 
one contact reported increasing overtime being worked in his area. 
Raw materials inventories are falling sharply while finished goods 
inventories are flat. Prices paid by manufacturers for materials are 
unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the steel industry, import competition continues to hold down 
domestic sales and prices. One senior executive asserts that it will 
take a very large depreciation of the dollar to get a significant 
price increase in basic steel. A major steelmaker in Chapter 11 
bankruptcy recently negotiated a 16% compensation cut with its 
union, ending a 98-day strike. An aluminum industry executive 
reports that turmoil in the tin market has spilled over into 
additional downward pressure on already low aluminum prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of machine tools continue to report weak orders and low 
prices. Employment at any firms remains well below its pre-recession 
peak, and one firm expects to cut employment further next year 
unless orders improve quickly. Competition from imported machine 
tools remains very strong. Machine tool orders are weak also because 
an increasing share of capital spending is for computers and other 
information processing equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      A producer of components for heavy trucks reports North American 
production of heavy trucks and buses is down about 9.5 percent in 
1985; the firm expects it to fall another 6 or 7 percent in 1986. A 
major diversified producer of components for capital goods reports 
all lines of business are "on hold" except for strength in defense 
goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal production remains low and the outlook for the District coal 
industry weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The optimism evident in District housing markets last month 
continues unabated. Builders, who had been cautious and waiting for 
lower mortgage rates, are now stepping up construction plans. 
District builders expect housing demand to rise steadily in coming 
months if mortgage rates continue to ease. The confluence of lower 
mortgage rates, further income advances, the availability of state 
of Ohio-subsidized mortgage funds, and retention of housing's 
favored status in pending tax reform legislation has led to a 
consensus among builders, mortgage lenders, and realtors that 
favorable housing conditions should prevail through at least mid-
1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors in the District report a resurgence in both listings and 
closings in recent months. Particularly strong sales are reported 
for Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati. However, realtors are 
uncertain how much the recent tightening of private mortgage 
insurance standards by lenders will reduce the number of prospective 
house buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to a major mortgage lender, mortgage loan volume remains 
lower than expected at the current level of mortgage rates, because 
many potential borrowers are waiting for even lower rates. This 
lender continues to sell all of its fixed rate mortgages in the 
secondary mortgage market. Like a growing number of midwestern 
lenders, this lender may begin to retain shorter-term fixed rate 
mortgages in its loan portfolio if it decides that prepayments of 
shorter-term mortgages will be substantially less than on 30-year 
mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall loan demand at District banks remains moderate. Declines in 
commercial and industrial loans are being more than offset by gains 
in real estate and consumer installment loans. Lower interest rates 
are helping to improve the demand for real estate loans. Consumer 
installment lending at banks has received a boost from the end of 
the cut-rate financing through auto dealers, even though car sales 
have declined significantly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts anticipate a small pickup in business lending primarily 
because of seasonal factors. While consumer loan demand is expected 
to remain good, the rate of growth is expected to decline in the 
months ahead.
