      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recovery in the Seventh District economy has slowed, with 
contacts revealing slowing momentum in auto production and housing 
activity. Consumer spending gains remained sluggish, although most 
District mail contacts still expect holiday sales to be even with or 
slightly above last year. Auto sales remained weak, prompting 
further cuts in fourth quarter production schedules. Overall 
manufacturing activity generally continued to contribute to relative 
strength in the District economy, but smaller increases in orders 
and production were recorded by many manufacturers. Housing activity 
also softened in recent months. Most large District banks reported 
little change in lending standards, while lower borrower demand was 
noted by some banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District consumer spending gains remain sluggish, according to most 
contacts, although one large retailer reported significant sales 
improvement in early November. Surveys conducted for District state 
retailers' associations generally indicated that sales gains are 
still expected during the holiday season, but at a somewhat slower 
pace than last year. A large discount retailer reported slower sales 
in Detroit and Chicago continued to run below year-earlier levels, 
in part due to increased competition. A large general merchandise 
chain reported improved year-over-year sales in early November, with 
increases well distributed across product lines and across regions. 
New credit usage at this chain was reported to be above a year ago 
for the first time in 1991. This contact also indicated that 
inventories remain higher than desired, particularly for some 
durable goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales remained depressed. A District supplier of financial 
services to car dealers reported that business at most dealerships 
has continually slowed in recent months. Floor traffic weakened 
further and was joined by a new softening in the interest level of 
potential buyers. Car sales in the Midwest have been hit almost as 
hard as the national average, according to this contact. One of the 
largest auto dealers in the District reported that sales have been 
running at half the rate experienced during the summer and early 
fall, and stated that his experience was repeated for most 
dealerships in his market area. Another dealer reported that 
leasing, as well as sales have softened in recent weeks, noting that 
"used car sales are keeping us afloat." A dealer of a relatively 
strong selling model indicated that new business has been softer 
than projected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers surveys supported by contact reports indicate 
that manufacturing activity continued to bolster the regional 
economy modestly, although momentum slowed in motor vehicle 
production. Car and truck assembly schedules continued to be trimmed 
in recent weeks. The number of plants idled by domestic automakers 
in mid-November was the highest since March. Underlying demand from 
consumers remains at recessionary levels, according to this contact. 
Heavy-duty truck sales and production remain "very depressed," 
according to an industry consultant, and new softening was reported 
in demand from agricultural markets. A parts supplier to truck 
manufacturers doesn't see any rebound signals. District producers of 
farm and constriction machinery have also been trimming production 
schedules recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing manager surveys have been indicating continued expansion 
by a slimming majority of District manufacturers in the past two 
months. The overall index produced by the Chicago survey dropped 
from a seasonally adjusted 56.2 percent in October to 52.7 percent 
in November. The picture of slowing but continued growth was 
generally echoed in recent results for Detroit, Indianapolis, and 
Southwest Michigan, while the October results for Milwaukee showed 
conditions improving. Reports from individual manufacturers were 
mixed. A steel manufacturer reported that industry shipments are now 
expected to decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on 
a seasonally adjusted basis. A manufacturer of electronic connectors 
stated that the firm continues to cut costs, because the U.S. market 
remains sluggish. A brighter picture was offered by a large 
manufacturer of industrial machinery, who reported that domestic 
orders have begun to show some improvement on a month-to-month 
basis, after consistently reporting sluggish conditions during the 
summer and early fall. Several contacts report that exports and 
sales by foreign subsidiaries continued to outperform domestic 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District housing activity generally softened in recent months, 
although some individual markets continued to hold up relatively 
well. Recently released state level data show that seasonally 
adjusted existing home sales declined in four of the five District 
states from the second quarter to the third quarter, although most 
of them at a somewhat slower pace than the national average. Sales 
in Iowa showed a small increase, and one realtor stated that press 
reports of waning optimism in the Midwest "were written by people 
who haven't been to Cedar Rapids." Sales in Illinois have softened 
since June, but prices are holding, according to the state realtors' 
association. Sales in Wisconsin fell slightly, yet remain well above 
year-earlier levels, and the states realtor association stated that
sales are still on track for a record year. Statements by individual 
realtors generally were consistent with state-level data, although 
one large realtor reported the best October in their history, in 
large part due to gains in market share. The pace of the recovery in 
housing starts in the District has slowed along with new and 
existing home sales. A home remodeling association reported that a 
seasonal surge in business failed to materialize, with business well 
below year-earlier levels. Several reports suggested little change 
in the weak commercial real estate market. A supplier of 
construction materials used in both residential and commercial 
construction in the Chicago metropolitan area reported that 
shipments continued to fall in October, and estimated that 1992 
shipments will be as much as 25 percent lower than in 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit standards for approving commercial and industrial loans 
essentially were unchanged over the past few months. Some of the 
respondents reported increased loan rate spreads and/or increased 
credit line costs, with increases more frequently reported for large 
and medium-sized borrowers than for small firms. At the same time, 
borrowing demand was generally reported to be little changed over 
recent months, with softer demand from smaller businesses reported 
more frequently than from medium-sized or large firms. Where weaker 
demand was reported, banks most often cited lower customer needs for 
inventory and capital investment. One banker stated that credit 
standards consistent with recessionary conditions still hold, but 
that when "good prospects" for loans appear, competition has 
intensified, with the borrower benefiting from lower loan rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Heavy rains in recent weeks slowed the wind-up of the fall harvest 
but helped recharge subsoil moisture. Corn and soybean production 
estimates for this District, and nationwide, were revised upward 
again in November. A better than expected harvest and prospects for 
continued weakness in exports have weighed on crop prices this fall. 
Corn exports, which declined 27 percent during the year ending with 
August, are projected to decline an additional 9 percent during the 
current crop marketing year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock prices have weakened considerably this fall due to 
evidence of an upturn in red meat production. The expansion now 
underway among hog farmers in District states and nationwide 
suggests that per capita pork production in 1991 will be up 7 
percent and the largest since 1981. On a more positive note for farm 
earnings, the distressed conditions among dairy farmers over the 
past year have eased somewhat as production has leveled-off and milk 
prices have moved back up above the retreating levels of a year ago.
