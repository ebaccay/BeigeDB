      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all Fourth District respondents expect that real GNP will 
decline this quarter. A few anticipate, however, that growth will 
revive in 1991:IQ, and that the economy will avoid recession. 
Respondents generally believe that the District is not currently in 
a recession. Manufacturing has held up better here than nationally. 
Several retailers expect that real consumer spending will decline 
this quarter from last. Construction appears to be weakening more 
than seasonally. Funds for qualified borrowers are generally 
available, but District bankers have become cautious about 
industrial construction and consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       National Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      U.S. economic prospects eroded further in recent weeks. All but one 
of a panel of 24 Fourth District Roundtable economists expect GNP to 
decline this quarter. Just a few weeks ago, 6 of the group expected 
slight growth. Still, a few expect that growth in real GNP will 
revive next quarter, and believe that the economy is not in a 
recession, even if real GNP declines this quarter. Most panelists 
still anticipate a temporary bulge in prices because of the oil 
price shock, and forecasts of inflation a year from now hover in a 
4% zone.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Regional Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents believe that although conditions in this District 
have softened recently, the economy is not now in a recession. 
Manufacturing has been the region's strong sector, but construction 
activity has been weakening. Some District respondents point out 
that the recent flatness in employment, a rise in Ohio's 
unemployment rate in September and October, and softness in retail 
sales all suggest an impending slowdown in the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District respondents still believe that manufacturing here is 
holding up better than in the national economy, although same note 
signs of deterioration in both domestic and export markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      A supplier of electronic parts reports that year-to-year increases 
in the firm's exports were shrinking even before the Kuwait 
invasion. A softening dollar has helped to sustain exports of steel 
mill products, but one producer notes deterioration in its overseas 
markets. A capital goods exporter believes that exports should be 
stronger this quarter than last, partly in response to the dollar's 
continued decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some steel producers note a recent decline in orders that may prompt 
some layoffs next month, but another reports that its orders are 
holding up because customers are hedging against a possible work 
stoppage when a labor contract expires in January. Producers expect 
that output this quarter could fall 10% from last quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers report weakened demand in some industries, 
but flat to rising demand in others. A welding machinery producer 
comments that domestic orders softened in the last few months, 
resulting in a cutback in overtime work. A computer industry 
supplier reports that orders declined recently. In contrast, a 
supplier to the heavy-duty truck industry is encouraged by a gradual 
revival in that industry from trough months earlier this year. Auto 
production this quarter has been cut back to about a 6.2 million 
unit annual rate. The industry is tentatively planning on a 
production rate only slightly higher for 1991:IQ.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers generally are not optimistic about sales prospects for 
this quarter. Most expect a decline in real consumer spending 
relative to last quarter. One retailer noted that spending for big-
ticket goods, including home furnishings and appliances, has been 
weakening. He anticipates that December sales will increase about 
5%, in nominal terms, from a year earlier. Another reports its 
October sales in this area were only 2.5% higher (in nominal 
dollars) than a year earlier. Still another retailer asserted that 
spending in this area remains better than spending in some other 
regions of the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      All retailers emphasize that advertising and other costs will be 
cut, and that new hiring this holiday season will be less than 
usual. Still, one department store official indicates that consumer 
spending the day after Thanksgiving was better than they expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and nonresidential construction is softening more than 
seasonally, according to some construction officials.
     </p>
     <p>
      Builders of single-family homes still have access to borrowed funds, 
but builders of multi-family units are forced to search extensively 
for financing. Neither banks nor thrifts are reported to be 
interested in acquisition and development loans, except to highly 
qualified builders of single-family units. One builder claims that 
although credit conditions have changed marginally since last 
spring, environmental regulations in some areas are now a bigger 
restraint on residential construction than credit availability.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans for commercial real estate are difficult to obtain, except for 
owner-occupied buildings. A construction official claims that 
industrial construction is being limited to environmental work and 
to maintenance and repair. No new speculative office building 
construction is underway, according to a developer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan activity continues to be "soft," according to District bankers. 
Some report continuing growth of loans outstanding, but at a slower 
pace in recent months. One bank comments that credit card and auto 
installment loans were rather strong in November, but mortgage loans 
have been soft. Another reports slower total loan growth in recent 
months because more loan applications are being rejected. Another 
bank is cutting back on loans to meet its year-end capital 
requirements. A few well-capitalized banks claim that ample credit 
is available for qualified borrowers, but demand is weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several banks report that they are now more cautious about consumer 
loans, and indicate that more applicants are being turned down than 
a few months ago. Auto dealers note a marked tightening in bank 
financing for new cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large mortgage lender reports that the value of its construction 
and development loans in 1990 will nearly match its 1989 level.
