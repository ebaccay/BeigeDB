      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity, sparked by a strong holiday sales 
season, continues to show signs of improvement. Holiday sales were 
generally strong throughout the District, and most retailers are 
optimistic about 1993. Manufacturers report increases in sales and 
employment. Single-family home construction continues to buoy the 
District's economy. Nonresidential construction is on the rise in 
St. Louis. Loans outstanding at large District banks continue to 
register small increases. According to District farmers, record or 
near-record harvests were the rule rather than the exception.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales of general merchandise in the District made a strong 
comeback during the holiday season. Many contacts report double-
digit increases in sales compared with a year ago. Two extra days 
between Thanksgiving and Christmas gave retailers more time to 
attract early shoppers, although aggressive marketing strategies 
apparently were unnecessary as the level of price-cutting and 
advertising remained relatively low. Holiday shoppers focused on 
mainstays such as electronics, jewelry and small appliances, while 
holding off on the luxury and big-ticket items. Discounters 
reportedly fared better than the specialty and department stores. A 
number of merchants report that more customers paid for purchases 
with cash this year than in previous years. Inventories remain 
fairly steady at desired levels. Retail merchants are optimistic 
about the growth of sales during the early part of 1993, citing the 
strong holiday season and a more positive consumer attitude about 
the direction of the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      District auto sales are reported to be moderately strong, although 
in Arkansas, many dealers called the past quarter the worst in 
years. Sales of mid-sized, moderately priced cars still outpaced the 
sales of all others, particularly upscale models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District manufacturing contacts are more upbeat than 
they have been in recent months. Many speak of increases in both 
sales and employment. A contact in the burglar alarm industry 
reports that sales are up 76 percent over last year's level. 
Contacts in the heavy equipment industry state that sales increased 
during the fourth quarter of 1992 and are expected to remain strong 
in the short term. Nonetheless, sales remain below peak levels, and 
inventories are at their lowest level since 1975-76. A beverage and 
grocery distributor reports that orders and inventories have been 
stable at desired levels. A concern of most contacts throughout the 
District is the lack of qualified workers available in the market. 
Small businesses worry about the rising cost of health care.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other reports show District poultry producers and auto parts 
suppliers increasing employment because of expansions and increased 
demand. In addition, a major household appliance manufacturer is not 
only recalling 650 workers laid off during the holiday season, but 
expects to hire an additional 550 during the first quarter to meet 
demand. A District shoe manufacturer has secured a contract to begin 
selling its products in four major Chinese cities. A St Louis 
defense contractor, however, continues to shrink with 320 more 
layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      A recent survey of firms in the St. Louis area reveals that 
approximately 20 percent will hire new employees during the first 
quarter, while only 8 percent plan layoffs. Nationally, 17 percent 
of employers plan to hire, while 13 percent plan to cut employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most areas of the District finished 1992 with single-family housing 
permits substantially above their year-ago levels. Homebuilders cite 
low interest rates, increases in consumer confidence and a surge of 
starter-priced housing as reasons for the continuing improvement. 
New and existing home sales an also up in most parts of the 
District; though home prices are generally flat, some increases have 
been reported. Contacts in St. Louis note that nonresidential 
construction is showing signs of expansion, with public works 
projects and new factories accounting for the growth spurt. These 
same contacts report that the level of nonresidential construction 
is still running about 20 percent below the boom years of the mid-
1980s.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer and business loan demand appears to be strengthening. Loans 
outstanding at 12 large District banks increased 0.7 percent in 
November and December, after declining 0.5 percent during the prior 
two-month period. Business loans and consumer loans increased in 
November and December, while real estate loans, the largest portion 
of these banks' combined loan portfolio, declined 2 percent during 
the period after a 0.8 percent decline in September and October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farmers reported record or near-record harvests in many areas, 
although some corn has yet to be harvested in the northern region of 
the District. While prices received by District farmers have risen 
somewhat recently, they remain below last year's levels. Substantial 
amounts of precipitation were reported in many areas of the District 
in late December and early January. The demand for natural gas in 
some parts of the District has reportedly increased markedly, owing 
to increased drying of the recently harvested corn crop. Cotton 
producers in the southern portion of the District report that the 
quality of 1992's cotton crop was excellent. Southern pine lumber 
mills report that orders have declined slightly, but that production 
remains substantially above that of last year.
