      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Federal Reserve districts describe the growth of economic 
activity as modest or slow, although regional variation in activity 
is substantial. Consumer spending has been mixed, but most districts 
report strong sales of apparel and cars recently. Manufacturing 
conditions are generally satisfactory or improving in the nation's 
Southern and Western regions, but some weakening was noted in New 
England and much of the Midwest. Construction activity is mixed. 
Agricultural conditions continue to improve over much of the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Merchandise sales have been mixed across the country. Retail sales 
have expanded at satisfactory rates or above in the New York. 
Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Kansas City 
districts. Boston, Richmond and Dallas all report that retail sales 
have softened in recent months, while Cleveland reports mixed sales 
patterns. In several districts, increased sales of women's apparel 
have spurred overall apparel growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories appear to be under control in the New York, 
Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City districts, 
while in Boston and Cleveland, inventories are a bit high. The sales 
outlook for the remainder of the year is optimistic in the Richmond, 
Minneapolis, Dallas, Cleveland and Kansas City districts. St. Louis 
retailers expect sales to be flat or slightly higher, while 
Philadelphia retailers believe a slackening in demand through next 
spring is more likely than an acceleration in spending. Boston notes 
that retailers are split half-and-half over sales potential for the 
rest of 1989, while Chicago reports that retailers expect further 
weakness in spending on durables. A surge in auto sales has helped 
reduce auto inventories over most of the nation. In several 
districts, dealers are worried that recent incentive-boosted sales 
may cut into 1990 model sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The performance of manufacturing is mixed, varying significantly 
among districts and across industries. Increased activity was 
reported by New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas. 
Weak or slowing activity was reported by Boston, Philadelphia, 
Chicago and Minneapolis and St. Louis. Although manufacturing 
conditions in the San Francisco District are generally satisfactory, 
some sectors, such as defense-related production, continue to 
decline. Cleveland also reports that manufacturing activity remains 
at a high level, but some softening is apparent in the production of 
steel and capital goods. Manufacturers' inventories are generally at 
satisfactory levels, but are being reduced from relatively high 
levels by producers in the Kansas City District. Five districts 
report that input pricing pressures have eased, while the Kansas 
City District reports an increase in such pressure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for manufacturing is mixed. Of the districts that 
mentioned an outlook, Philadelphia and Richmond contacts generally 
anticipate a weakening in conditions while Boston contacts expect 
activity to continue at its current pace through the end of the 
year. Several manufacturers in the Atlanta District, primarily in 
the chemical, textiles and primary metal industries, recently have 
revised their expectations for the near future upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports indicate substantial variation in the strength of 
construction and real estate activity. Recent strength in 
nonresidential construction was reported by the Richmond, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco districts, while nonresidential 
activity reportedly weakened in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. 
Residential construction activity, though generally weak compared 
with a year ago, picked up in the Richmond, St. Louis and 
Minneapolis districts and remained strong in the San Francisco 
District. New York reports that homebuilding in parts of its 
District has been deterred by an oversupply of existing homes. Home 
sales picked up in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago and Minneapolis 
districts and remained strong in the Far West, but are slow in the 
Kansas City District. Several districts report that declines in 
mortgage rates stimulated the construction and sales of existing 
homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Three districts report labor shortages. Boston reports that, 
although manufacturing labor market conditions are generally 
unchanged or softer, some types of labor continue to be hard to 
find. St. Louis reports a reduction in the availability of skilled 
labor in several sectors, while San Francisco noted shortages of 
retail and construction workers in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The demand for loans continues to vary considerably by region and 
type of loan. Overall loan volume is reported up in Philadelphia and 
San Francisco. Commercial and industrial loan growth has been good 
in Philadelphia, and Richmond and Kansas City report steady demand. 
Cleveland, however, notes a continued softening in commercial and 
industrial loans. Consumer loan demand has fallen off since last 
year in the New York District, but Philadelphia reports that 
consumer loan growth has strengthened. Auto loans appear to be a 
major factor in determining consumer loan growth rates. Real estate 
lending is growing at a strong pace in Philadelphia, with San 
Francisco also reporting expanded loan volume. Bank earnings are 
growing significantly in San Francisco, while in St. Louis earnings 
declined in the second quarter with particular problems in real 
estate loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions have improved over much of the country. 
Recent rains have helped crops and pastures in the Chicago, St. 
Louis, Kansas City, Minneapolis and Dallas districts. Despite the 
improved conditions, weather-related stress has damaged crops in the 
Plains States, Iowa, Oregon, Utah and Idaho. Dallas reports that 
central and southern Texas remains dry. In the Dallas and Richmond 
districts, agricultural prices for most commodities are relatively 
strong. The mining industry has showed increased activity in the 
Minneapolis, Dallas, Atlanta and Kansas City districts in recent 
months. Lumber industry contacts in the Minneapolis and San 
Francisco districts report difficulties in securing timber for 
mills.
