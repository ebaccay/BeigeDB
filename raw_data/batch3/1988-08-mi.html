      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 2, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      General economic conditions have held firm in the Ninth District. 
Employment demand has remained high, and consumer spending has 
continued to grow moderately. Recent rains should eventually help 
some drought-stricken crop, livestock, and dairy operations. And 
agricultural bank conditions, while not improving, have not yet 
deteriorated either.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The most recent statistics indicate that district labor markets have 
experienced some additional tightening. During May, Minnesota's 
unemployment rate dropped to 3.2 percent, its lowest level in 9 
years. The unemployment rate in its Minneapolis-St. Paul 
metropolitan area fell to just 2.8 percent. In that area, temporary 
help agencies report some spot labor shortages and rising wages paid 
to clerical workers. Both the labor force and total employment 
reached record highs during May in South Dakota; its unemployment 
rate was only 3 percent. Also, North Dakota's unemployment rate 
dropped to 3.7 percent during May, almost one full percentage point 
below its level a year earlier. During past years, the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan has experienced very high unemployment; this 
has eased in the 12 months ending in May: from 10.6 to 7.7 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail spending has continued to grow moderately in the district. 
One chain reports that its department store sales were 7 percent 
higher this June than last. One chain plans to significantly expand 
two of its stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. A chain 
with stores throughout the district reports much stronger growth 
during this period, but a higher market share probably accounts for 
much of that strength. Neither chain reports any inventory or credit 
problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      District sales of motor vehicles have continued to hold up well. One 
domestic manufacturer reports that its car sales during June rose 17 
percent over their level a year earlier. A district manager for a 
popular domestic line reports that car sales during June were strong 
at virtually all its dealers. A recent arena sale in Sioux Falls, 
South Dakota, went quite well. But district truck sales have slowed 
relative to car sales, perhaps due to drought-induced buying 
resistance in farm-dependent areas. Still, vehicle inventories 
haven't risen above normal levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity has held firm. Home sales in the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul area during May and June were 13 percent ahead of a year 
earlier. Residential building contracts In Minnesota were up 5 
percent during May. But as has been true for some time, housing 
activity was stagnant in many cities and towns of Montana and North 
Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      District tourist spending has increased sharply this summer. Despite 
burning bans at campgrounds, all tourism industry representatives 
contacted report increased activity. For example, Independence Day 
weekend business was way above the expectations of industry sources 
in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. A source in northern Wisconsin says 
that tourism there has beers running 10 percent ahead of last year. 
And the Black Hills area of South Dakota has also done well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rain during July came too late to significantly help some of the 
district's wheat, barley, and oats crops but has helped its soybean 
and corn crops. For example, during the third week in July, the 
Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture estimated that 80 percent of' 
Minnesota's soybean crop would survive. Soybeans are Minnesota's 
second-largest cash crop. Its largest crop, corn, is not expected to 
do so well: only 60 percent may survive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop insurance will help district farmers cover part of the lost 
output. Compared to last year, federally sponsored multiperil 
coverage is up 83 percent in South Dakota, 77 percent in North 
Dakota, 41 percent in Montana, and 31 percent in Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      More help has come from prices of farm products, which have 
continued to rise. Mid-July products of corn and soybeans on the 
cash markets were over 70 percent higher than a year earlier, while 
barley and wheat prices were up around 50 percent. These high prices 
imply lower government deficiency payments to farmers under current 
law, but some form of disaster relief might be enacted to replace 
that loss. Furthermore, farmers with stored crops carried over from 
last year will benefit from sales at these high prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock and dairy operations have been significantly hampered by 
higher feed prices and a shortage of pasture growth. As a result, 
more stock has been sold than normal, which has lowered its price as 
much as 20 percent. Recent rains should help stimulate grass growth, 
though, and slow the sell-off in some parts of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The safety and soundness of district banks do not seem to have been 
hurt by the drought yet. Members of this Bank's Advisory Council on 
Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor report that banks are still 
liquid and looking for good lending opportunities. A prominent 
banker in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, says that most serious farm 
debt problems won't be noticed until next year. This Bank's latest 
survey of district agricultural bankers does indicate that many 
bankers are expecting low farm income and slow repayment of farm 
debt during the third quarter. Still, the condition of district 
agricultural banks substantially improved during 1987, which should
help them weather the drought.
