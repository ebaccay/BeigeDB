      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 24, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Fourth District economy continues its pattern of slow growth 
with weakness in manufacturing and energy and strength in housing. 
Retail sales are a bit better than last quarter. Unemployment 
remains above the national level despite employment growing faster 
than nationally during the last twelve months. Manufacturing 
activity continues to be sluggish, and the energy industry is 
depressed. Housing activity is robust. Real estate and consumer 
installment lending is strong but commercial and industrial lending 
is down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the District report generally better sales in the 
second quarter than in the first quarter. Although two major 
department store chains differ in the amount of increase during the 
current quarter, they both agreed that first quarter sales were 
below plans and the sales in the past two months have improved. 
General merchandise inventories are reported to be at normal levels. 
Charge sales at department stores appear to be increasing as a 
percent of total sales and one firm noted a significant increase in 
delinquent accounts since the beginning of this year. Retailers 
reported that imported prices have increased very little in response 
to dollar depreciation, although one expects price increases in the 
third or fourth quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area auto dealers reported much the same story as other retailers. 
Sales in recent months have been better than the first quarter, but 
still well below levels of last year. Inventory levels at domestic 
auto dealers range from slightly above normal to "heavy," but only 
one dealer expressed any concern over inventories. None of the 
dealers contacted expected additional near-term price increases, but 
did mention that past increases have been completely passed on to 
the consumer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Relative to a year earlier, Ohio employment in May has risen by 2.55 
percent, somewhat better than the national gain of 2.03 percent. 
Nevertheless, the unemployment rate in Ohio was unchanged from its 
year earlier level and at 8.1 percent (s.a.) remains well above the 
national rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues to be sluggish. Manufacturers in 
this District report new orders continue to grow but at a 
substantially slower pace than in April. The pace of production was 
also slower than in April. Order backlogs are up slightly after 
several months of decline. Employment in manufacturing appears on 
balance to be flat. Inventories of raw materials and finished goods 
continue their slow decline. Prices paid by manufacturers for 
commodities, components and equipment rose much more rapidly in May 
than they have in the last year or so. A major steel producer in 
this District has laid off several hundred production workers, in 
large measure because of weak demand from the oil and gas industry. 
The firm expects the workers to be out of work at least throughout 
the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Coal, oil, and natural gas industries in this District are 
depressed. A major oil firm expects crude oil prices to fluctuate 
between $12 and $18 per barrel and to average $15 per barrel over 
the next three or four years. The firm has cut its exploration 
budget by almost 60 percent from last year and would cut it further 
except that active drilling projects can't be cancelled. Total 
capital expenditures are being cut by about one-third from last 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of housing activity in the Fourth District is high and 
builders, real estate brokers, and mortgage lenders all expect that 
the strong first-half pace will persist for the balance of 1986. 
However, there is a general consensus among market participants that 
lower mortgage rates would probably be required for the high level 
of housing construction to be sustained into 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate brokers continue to complain that a typical mortgage 
loan application now requires more than 60 days to process. 
Apparently, mortgage lenders are understaffed but do not expect the 
high mortgage volume to last long enough to justify expanding staff. 
Mortgage lenders are accommodating the longer processing times by 
extending their loan commitments from the standard 30 days to 60 
days. Long processing times are not causing a higher level of 
application cancellations. So far, the suspension of the FHA 
mortgage-insurance program has had no visible effect on mortgage 
markets in this region, and FHA lending still represents 
approximately 12-15 percent of total mortgage applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      In late May, mortgage lenders increased their mortgage charges 
slightly by increasing closing points by 1 point and adding 1/4 to 
1/2 percentage point to the mortgage rate. The 15-year mortgage is 
becoming less popular as borrowers return to the 30-year mortgage. 
The adjustable rate mortgage also continues to lose favor, falling 
to less than 10 percent of new loans by many lenders in this 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall loan demand continues to be flat at District banks. Total 
loans outstanding at large banks fell slightly over the last month 
even though real estate and consumer installment loans rose at a 
double-digit pace. Commercial and industrial loans outstanding 
contracted somewhat, reflecting softness in the demand for business 
loans. Other types of loans also fell at large District banks. 
Lenders do not anticipate any significant pickup in business loan 
demand over the next few months, but they do expect relatively good 
growth in consumer installment and real estate loans.
