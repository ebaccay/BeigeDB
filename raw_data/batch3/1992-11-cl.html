      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity in the Fourth District continues to edge upward 
unevenly. Respondents anticipate further slow growth in both 
consumer spending and manufacturing over the next few months. A 
strong revival in manufacturing output is being checked by 
persistent tight management of inventories and by volatile sales and 
production of cars. Residential construction still outpaces last 
year, but nonresidential construction is generally weak, and 
builders anticipate little near-term improvement. Strength in bank 
loans remains centered in mortgages, with only scattered signs of a 
pickup in business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the District strengthened in mid-September and have 
improved markedly in October, according to several sources The 
recent revival followed less-than-expected sales volume during the 
summer, which caused some retailers to resort to aggressive price 
promotion to liquidate seasonal merchandise. A retailer notes 
stronger sales for a broad range of merchandise, except for women's 
apparel, which he speculates as reflecting a shift in consumer but 
from discount to department and specialty stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some retailers now anticipate that sales will post further small 
increases through the balance of this year, and that the 1992 
holiday season will show larger year-over-year gains than they 
forecast just a few months ago. Consequently, they plan on carrying 
larger inventories, and have begun to step up factory orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers, however, report that sales of new cars flattened in 
October following a September rise. Several dealers state that 
aggressive pricing of 1992 models at below cost brought their 
inventories down to desired levels. Stocks of 1993 models are said 
to be between 60 and 70 days, and dealers are generally holding back 
on new factory orders. Substitution of light trucks, especially 
minivans, for cars appears to be unabated, but several dealers 
indicate that stiffening competition from Japanese producers may 
have peaked the market share for U.S. vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Shipments and production in the District are rising at a slow and 
uneven pace. A commercial bank survey of 500 midsize and small 
business firms located manly in Ohio shows that their business is 
still rising, but by less than expected in their spring survey and 
at a slower pace than last spring. Capital spending plans are 
virtually unchanged since that time, but businesses plan to cut 
instead of build inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest Cleveland purchasing agents' survey also shows a slower 
pace of expansion in September, and preliminary information for 
October suggests a marginal increase. Little growth in employment is 
anticipated over the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturers contacted report a slow but steady rise in orders 
and shipments again last quarter, which combined with further cost-
cutting and lower interest rates, boosted earnings. With few 
exceptions, order backlogs are not accumulating, primarily because 
of a tendency toward smaller but more frequent placement of new 
orders. New hirings continue to be selective.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several capital goods producers report that orders last quarter 
continued to climb, although their anticipations for the fourth 
quarter range from "excellent" to "flat." A heavy-duty truck 
supplier comments that a surge in the annual rate of new orders last 
quarter exceeded the 1988 peak and that a sizable order backlog is 
being built. Production this quarter should match or exceed last 
quarter's pace A producer of medical equipment reports a farther 
steady improvement in business last quarter that should be followed 
by another increase this quarter. Shipments of industrial 
metalworking equipment and supplies also rose a little in the third 
quarter, with further improvement expected in the final three months 
of the year, even though export orders are expected to fall again. 
Another producer of industrial parts also expects its domestic 
business to expand this quarter from last because of strong demand 
for maintenance and repair work. Machine tool orders surged in 
September and in the third quarter, although a producer speculates 
that pace may not be matched this quarter or next because of 
weakness in the aerospace industry and uncertainty in the auto 
outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domestic auto producers estimate new car sales at about a 6.3 
million-unit annual rate this quarter, up from a 6.15 million-unit 
rate in the third quarter. Little, if any, pickup in production is 
anticipated because of generally adequate inventories of 1993 model 
cars. Better-than-expected sales of the Jeep Cherokee in recent 
weeks have helped to retain a 700-worker second shift at an assembly 
plant in Toledo that was scheduled for a cutback.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent private survey of more than 100 builders in Ohio shows that 
the bulk of the respondents anticipate no pickup in construction for 
another year. A lender that specializes in small construction 
projects, such as shopping strip malls, notes scant demand for 
construction loans. In Pittsburgh, however, the newly opened $750 
million airport has already generated a boost in both retail stores 
and residential development in the adjacent area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential contracts in the District continued to climb in August, 
well ahead of the pace a year earlier, but recent growth slowed from 
earlier in the summer. In Cincinnati, new home sales in August rose 
at less than a double-digit rate for the first time so far this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Only a few large banks in the District indicate a step-up in 
business loans in recent weeks, but little change in demand is 
generally noted even among small and midsize business firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      The most active part of the loan market continues to be in 
residential mortgages. Banks and thrifts report strong but easing 
demand for mortgage refinancing. Thrifts say that many 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgages are being refinanced with 10- to 15-year 
mortgages, and one thrift reports that a one-year adjustable-rate 
mortgage has become more popular than the 30-year fixed-rate loan. 
According to a major lender in Cleveland, new mortgage loans through 
most of October held up better than usual for the month.
