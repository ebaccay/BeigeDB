      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District conditions are moderately good, and the general tone 
here is one of cautious optimism. Labor markets are still tight but 
manageable. Wage and price increases remain moderate in most 
district markets. Spending on general merchandise has been fairly 
strong during the first two months of this year, but car sales and 
construction activity has been generally lackluster. Resource-
related industries have been doing quite well generally. However, 
concern about a lack of moisture is widespread. Unless spring brings 
precipitation across the Upper Midwest, another serious drought is 
possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remain fairly tight through most of the district, as 
they have been for some time. The unemployment rate in Minnesota was 
4.3 percent in January, down from 5 percent a year earlier. Between 
December 1989 and a year earlier, unemployment declined in Montana, 
North Dakota, and South Dakota, but it rose in Wisconsin and the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The Minneapolis-St. Paul area has 
continued to feel some effects of cutbacks in the computer and 
electronics industries, and districtwide December 1989 employment in 
manufacturing was slightly below a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage and price increases remain moderate. Wage increases in the 3 - 
5 percent range are reported in most district industries. However, 
sharp increases in health care costs are prevalent. In some recent 
settlements, these costs have almost entirely absorbed employee 
compensation gains. High gasoline costs are causing problems for 
some district truckers and loggers, but gas prices appear to have 
peaked in mid-1989; they have modestly declined since then. This 
Bank's directors note that capital equipment price hikes are running 
in the 3-6 percent range, except in the paper industry, where they 
are a bit higher. One director reports modest increases in material 
costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that recent sales levels have been "OK" to 
"moderately good." One large retailer notes that inventories are 
well under control and expectations for Easter shopping are bright. 
Regional centers within 100 miles of the northern U.S. border are 
benefiting from brisk sales to Canadian shoppers. New car sales are 
reported as soft in much of the district, with used cars moving 
considerably better. Some dealers have been struggling in recent 
months, and modest consolidation in the auto dealership industry is 
possible in 1990. Housing sales have been generally flat overall, 
but with considerable variation around the district. Weakness is 
noted in most of North Dakota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, 
but moderate strength is reported in western Wisconsin. In 
Minnesota's Twin Cities, unusually warm weather is cited as the 
reason January 1990 home sales exceeded those a year ago by about 20 
percent. Tourist activity has varied widely around the district, 
depending on the amount of snow. An excellent early snowfall has 
helped ski resorts in western Montana, and the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan is enjoying good snow cover; resorts there are generally 
busy. Most parts of western Wisconsin, however, have had limited 
snowfall, and tourism has suffered. In several district states, 
dogsled racing is attracting crowds and media attention.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity in the Ninth District is generally flat, and 
industry respondents are not optimistic for the rest of 1990-
particularly not for commercial real estate. Although less affected 
than some parts of the United States, the Twin Cities suffer from 
excess capacity, with still more coming on line this year. Minnesota 
contracts for new construction declined throughout the second half 
of last year and by December were about 40 percent below midyear 
levels. A notable exception to weakness in commercial construction 
is the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which will benefit from pipeline 
construction and several large public projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mining remains ore of the strongest sectors of the Upper Midwest 
economy. This is true in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where iron 
mines are profitable and expanding capacity. It is also true in 
Montana, where precious metal mines are running at full capacity and 
expanding. The drilling rig count in Montana, however, is down to 
about five, which is low by virtually any standard. The district's 
forest product industries are generally strong, with fiberboard 
plants running at full capacity and paper plants making substantial 
capital investments to expand capacity. Increasingly, however, 
environmental concerns are affecting capital spending plans in some 
industries, including mining, logging, and paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agricultural sector has one or two bright spots in the Ninth 
District. Dairy prices dropped sharply in February, but until then 
had been running at record highs. A director reports that Wisconsin 
dairy operators are investing in equipment improvement. Cattle 
ranchers in Montana have benefited from excellent prices, good 
grass, and generally benign weather conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Still, there is great concern in much of the district about a lack 
of soil moisture. The effects, so far, have been limited. Winter 
wheat losses due to lack of snow cover have been less than feared, 
thanks to relatively mild weather. However, most areas report below-
normal precipitation. Since most areas are still recovering from 
drought, groundwater levels are typically very low. In parts of 
Minnesota, shallow wells have gone dry, and the state has recently 
reconvened its task force on drought. Many district lakes are at 
extremely low levels, and fishing, which is a major summer tourist 
attraction, is likely to suffer.
     </p>
     <p>
      In sum, most of the Ninth District needs water badly. If 
precipitation comes when farmers need it and the weather cooperates 
thereafter (which is what happened last year), the agricultural 
sector could still do quite well. However, the risk of significant 
drought problems in 1990 cannot be ignored.
