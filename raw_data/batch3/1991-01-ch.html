      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       January 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity slowed in December and early January, 
particularly as auto production fell. A consensus outlook of 
business economists in the District called for a mild recession 
nationally to end by the second quarter, followed by a sluggish 
recovery that is held back by weak industrial production. District 
retailers indicated that consumer spending over the holiday season 
was somewhat stronger than the national average. Auto sales and 
production remained weak in December and early January, and the 
impact of slowing auto production is beginning to spread to other 
manufacturers. Outside the auto industry, several capital goods 
manufacturers report recent weakness in sales and orders. Export 
growth continued, although several contacts with important exporting 
sectors expressed concern about continued strength. Construction 
spending continues on existing projects, while expectations for 1991 
activity continue to be weak. Loan demand in the District has 
softened. Agricultural exports fell sharply in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook for the National Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business economists from around the District attending a mid-
December conference at the Bank generally anticipated sluggish 
growth in 1991. The consensus outlook of 25 forecasts showed real 
GNP rising only 0.4 percent in 1991. The quarterly pattern indicated 
by the consensus showed real GNP declining in the fourth quarter of 
l990 and the first quarter of 1991. A slow recovery was expected 
over the remainder of 1991, as declines in industrial production 
extended into the second quarter. Citing weakening cash flow in the 
nonfinancial business and farm sectors, several capital goods 
producers projected absolute declines in expenditures for their 
respective product categories (including office and computer 
equipment). Consumer spending was expected to expand in the second 
quarter at a slow pace as auto sales make a moderate rebound. In the 
weeks after the meeting, reports by participants suggested that many 
revised forecasts downward as new data were released, but little 
change arose in the expected quarterly pattern of economic activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales activity generally softened through most of the fourth 
quarter, but picked up toward the end of the holiday season. Most 
contacts report that consumer spending in the District was still 
somewhat stronger than the nation on average. Several retailers 
reported that holiday sales were basically flat (in nominal dollars) 
with last year, while District sales increased slightly. Some 
contacts spoke of heavier-than-usual discounting toward the end of 
the year, which may have boosted some retailers' sales at the 
expense of earnings. Contacts generally noted increased consumer 
cost-consciousness and a shift towards practicality. The best sales
performances typically were reported by discount retailers. Several 
contacts reaffirmed the weakness in the Detroit area, although one 
analyst stated that the warehouse club/discount format performed 
well in Detroit in December, showing good volume increases. While 
most contacts reported little change in the mix of sales between 
credit and cash, many reported rising delinquency rates on utilized 
credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales expectations for the new year are mixed, and contacts 
universally cited the Middle East situation as a yet-to-be resolved 
uncertainty. Most contacts related a belief that the consumer has 
been postponing discretionary purchases. However, opinions were 
mixed about the degree to which consumer confidence will return, 
should a peaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict be reached. 
Several business analysts in the District stated that the perception 
of difficulty in the banking industry has also impacted consumer 
confidence. Retail contacts generally indicated that orders to 
manufacturers are running about even with those placed at this time 
last year. Increased financial difficulties and inventory building 
in several sectors, however, may constrain total order activity in 
the early part of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Auto Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The auto production slowdown continued in December and into the 
first weeks of 1991, as industry sales remained weak nationally and 
consumer confidence remained at recessionary levels. While Big Three 
automakers attending the Bank's December meeting expect 1991 vehicle 
sales to be roughly 7 percent lower than in 1990, sales rates 
(seasonally adjusted) are expected to improve each quarter of the 
year. Fleet sales are expected to continue to grow in importance, 
lowering inventory requirements for a given sales level and holding 
back a production rebound. Vehicle rental and leasing activity are 
growing more rapidly than sales to individuals. Although several 
dealers expressed optimism about the prospects of the "nearly-new" 
car market created by the quicker turnover of auto fleets, auto 
producers report concern that new car sales and production will be 
adversely affected. Auto suppliers report being impacted by slower 
auto production and by volatility in production schedules. Since 
employees of many suppliers to Big Three automakers do not have the 
income guarantees won by members of the United Auto Workers, 
softness in auto-related sectors could curb District personal income 
and spending growth in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity has experienced an increasing number of 
weakening sectors besides the auto industry, while some industries 
remain healthy. Overall, order book quality seems increasingly 
subject to the same uncertainty that is slowing consumer spending, 
with many contacts reporting that capital spending decisions have 
become contingent on outcomes in the Middle East. A major producer 
of heavy equipment reported that sales declined sharply in December 
and early January (from the year-earlier periods), while new orders 
have fallen off even more dramatically than sales. The slowdown in 
auto production has begun to impact the previously stable steel 
industry. A large District steel producer reported that the slowdown 
contributed to a sharp decline in its operating rate in late 
December and early January. A major supplier to the electronics 
industry reported that component sales growth was better than 
expected in December. This contact expected continued growth in 
1991, but at roughly half the rate in recent years. An economist for 
an electric utility stated that power sales to non-automotive 
industrial customers in Michigan increased in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trade Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several District contacts reported that expectations have weakened 
for export growth continuing at recent rates, although exports still 
provide some of their strongest markets. Citing slower growth in 
domestic demand in Canada, much of Western Europe, and parts of 
Asia, economists with two of the largest exporting firms in the 
District recently lowered their forecasts for 1991 export growth. 
Another large District capital goods producer stated that export 
opportunities are still being developed, and that export orders are 
holding up reasonably well. However, this contact expressed concern 
about the potentially adverse impact on sales growth from slowing 
growth in several European economies as well as political 
uncertainty in the Soviet Union. Steel imports actually increased in 
the fourth quarter, although a large District steel producer stated 
that the increase may reflect, in part, inventory building prior to 
a possible strike in late January. Citing the crisis in the Middle 
East, one large District exporting manufacturer recently suspended 
international travel of its employees, and ordered all US. citizens 
working abroad to return home.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction in the District is widely expected to be 
weak this year, while spending for schools, highways, and other 
public construction is expected to take up some of the slack. A 
large District producer of building materials stated that projects 
underway are being completed, but new projects are well below levels 
reached at the end of 1989. A cement producer projected a double-
digit decline in the firm's shipments in 1991. Cement industry 
shipments in 1990 (through October) showed that relative strength in 
the District has disappeared, with shipments growth in the Great 
Lakes region now running about equal with that for the nation as a 
whole (on a year-to-date basis). A supplier of materials to home 
builders in the Chicago area reported that business for many of its 
customers has slowed dramatically, although sales growth for 
consumer do-it-yourself projects was holding up well even through 
the Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several District financial institutions are experiencing weak loan 
demand from many sectors, although some contacts noted a slight 
increase in credit card usage last quarter. Several bankers reported 
continued weak growth in commercial real estate and industrial 
loans, which was attributed mostly to an unwillingness to borrow. 
One large bank reported increases in services fees, but basically 
unchanged lending policy. A savings and loan analyst noted some 
growth in home mortgage lending when mortgage rates were below 9.5 
percent, but most of that demand is for refinancing. One large 
bank's credit card volume increased in the fourth quarter, with half 
of the gain due to increased usage by existing accounts. This lender 
also reported no increase in consumer delinquency rates (through 
November), although delinquency in home mortgage lending had 
increased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Corn and soybean exports have fallen off sharply in recent months. 
From January through August of 1990, the combined U.S. export 
tonnage of corn and soybeans held nearly 13 percent above the year-
earlier level. But from September through December, the combined 
export tonnage was off a third from the year-earlier pace and the 
lowest for that period in at least 16 years. Several factors have 
contributed to the sharper-than-expected downturn, including the 
emerging trade problems facing the USSR, bumper harvests elsewhere 
in the world, and various disruptions related to the Mideast 
situation. Most analysts believe that the export pace will pickup in 
the months ahead but remain short of the year-earlier level.
