      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the Second District's economy has continued to improve 
since the last report. Retail sales showed over-the-year gains, 
particularly at higher income levels, and inventories remained in 
line. The spring homebuilding season was off to a good start, and 
the demand for office space continued to increase. Business activity 
was stable to somewhat improved. Demand for commercial mortgages has 
increased at small District banks as a result of declining interest 
rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales, although higher in general, have not shown equal 
strength for all income groups or in all regions. After a weak 
January-February period, retail sales in stores serving higher 
income consumers downstate and in New Jersey grew strongly in March. 
Most of these states reported over-the-year increases of 10 to 15 
percent (well above plan), and early April figures suggest that 
sales are continuing strong. However, sales at department stores in 
western New York and at lower-priced stores throughout the District 
showed more modest gains. Over-the-year increases in March and early 
April of 6 to 7 percent were somewhat below expectations. Some 
retailers mentioned an "economic stratification" of the market. 
Higher income households appear to have the discretionary income to 
continue generating strong sales growth. But low and middle income 
consumers, feeling the weight of high consumer debt, appear hesitant 
to increase spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite some difficulty in predicting sales, District stores were 
generally able to keep inventories in line with desired levels. Most 
retailers planned promotions and sales similar to earlier years, 
though some higher-priced stores bad more spring promotions this 
year. Sales of apparel end housewares—highly advertised items—were especially strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Second District have tended to stabilize 
in recent weeks. More than 80% of purchasing managers surveyed in 
Rochester and Buffalo reported unchanged or improved conditions in 
March. Inventories at the majority of these firms held steady as 
well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Plans for several plant expansions and relocation into the District 
have recently been announced. These included an $11 million 
renovation and modernization at a Buffalo food plant, a $6 million 
expansion of a ceramics and brick plant in Niagara Falls, and the 
move to central New York of some frozen food operations from an Iowa 
location. In addition, an electronics firm that invested $14 million 
at its Long Island plant last year plans even larger capital outlays 
at that location in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      Offsetting these developments, however, were announcements of some 
further layoffs and plant closings. In the Buffalo area, 
Westinghouse announced plans to close a factory, idling 800 workers 
by year's end. Layoffs associated with the recently announced 
production cutbacks at General Motors and further restructuring at 
Union Carbide could also have a negative impact on the District's 
employment. Thus far, however, the unemployment rates for March of 
6.7 percent in New York and 4.2 percent in New Jersey remained below 
the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The new homebuilding season is reportedly off to a good start in the 
Second District, "Business is booming," according to one contact, 
and builders in general are busy, fulfilling contracts negotiated 
this winter as well as negotiating new ones. Strong buyer interest, 
fueled in part by the sharp drop in mortgage rates, has led many 
builders to anticipate a repeat of last year's lively pace. Some 
possible deterrents were noted, however. A growing shortage of 
suitable land was cited as a major factor behind rising home prices 
in rural areas. In addition, a short supply of subcontractors and 
other skilled labor could throw homebuilders behind schedule in the 
months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commercial real estate market remained relatively strong in the 
Second District, and the demand for office space has increased 
further in several areas. The pickup in office leasing activity was 
most evident in Fairfield County, in northern New Jersey, and on 
Long Island. Nonetheless, conditions generally continue to be 
characterized as favorable to tenants, and rent concessions have 
been widespread in some areas. New York City's efforts to expand its 
office market to the outer boroughs were recently rewarded. British 
Airways announced that it will move its U.S. headquarters to Queens, 
and a stock exchange subsidiary plans to relocate its corporate 
headquarters to downtown Brooklyn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the continued decline in interest rates, small Second District 
banks have seen an increased demand for commercial mortgages. At 
some banks this demand has been mainly for refinancings of both 
fixed and adjustable rate loans, while at others almost all requests 
has been for new loans. Prepayment penalties at some banks may 
discourage refinancings. Currently, some banks are incorporating 
floors into their variable rate loans. There is also some preference 
for shorter terms to maturity, in general in the 3 to 15 year range. 
Expectations are that demand for both new loans and refinancings 
will continue to increase.
