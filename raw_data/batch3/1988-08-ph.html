      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 2, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy is continuing on a moderate expansionary 
trend in July. Manufacturing activity is growing modestly and area 
firms are adding to payrolls. Retailers report a slight pickup in 
sales after a May-June lag, and auto dealers say sales are running 
above expectations. Bankers report that demand for business loans 
improved in June and is continuing to grow in July, but they say 
consumer loan growth is being maintained only by easier credit 
terms. Home equity lending remains strong, however. Bankers also 
note a pickup in deposit growth during June extending into July that 
is easing pressure on their cost of funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most business contacts in the Third District lock for a continuation 
of current trends through the end of the year. Manufacturers 
forecast further expansion in the next six months, and they plan 
additions to payrolls and increases in capital spending. Retailers 
expect sales in the second half to slightly exceed the same period 
last year. Domestic auto dealers believe sales will remain strong 
through fall but import dealers fear price increases will result in 
a year-to-year drop in sales. Bankers see the region's expanding 
manufacturing sector bolstering business loan demand but they expect 
little growth in consumer lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's industrial sector remains on an upward path, according 
to the latest Business Outlook Survey. Twenty-nine percent of the 
firms participating in the July survey said business improved from 
the prior month, while only 5 percent indicated that business had 
slowed. Both durable and nondurable goods producers are experiencing 
moderate growth. On balance, area manufacturers report increases in 
new orders that are being matched by higher shipments, leaving order 
backlogs virtually unchanged. Delivery times were increasing 
marginally in July, reflecting a step-up in the volume of business, 
but a slight inventory buildup indicates that area firms are more 
than able to met rising demand for their products. Employment 
remains healthy; although most firms are holding payrolls steady, 
one-fifth of those surveyed in July were adding workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price pressures in the industrial sector show no signs of abating. 
Half of the firms polled in July report higher input costs and one-
fourth are raising prices on their own products. Looking to the 
future, 87 percent of the survey respondents expect to pay more for 
the goods they purchase in the next six months, and 65 percent plan 
to charge more for the products they make.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, area manufacturers see a continuation of current 
trends. Overall, firms polled in July expect business to expand 
further during the next six months. They forecast gains in orders 
and shipments, and some firming in order backlogs as well. On 
balance, survey respondents are planning to boost capacity over the 
next six months by hiring more workers and investing more in plant 
and equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in the second half of July 
reported a slight improvement in sales continuing from June. Based 
on comments from store officials, the current sales rate is running 
around 5 percent above the year-ago pace, in dollar terms. Hot 
weather has boosted sales of seasonal items, including summer 
apparel, according to local merchants. However, they also say they 
have been making more extensive price reductions in recent weeks in 
order to stimulate sales. The strong demand for seasonal goods end 
consumer response to discounts are bringing inventories down to more 
satisfactory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, most retailers in the Third District say current 
trends give them no cause for pessimism, but they remain cautious in 
planning for the fall. The local consensus is for second half 
results somewhat above last year's. However, merchants say they are 
prepared to cut prices and cancel orders if there are early signs 
that consumer spending this autumn will be below their forecasts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers report a pickup in sales in June that has carried into 
July. Sales are currently running above their expectations, and 
dealers attribute much of the gain to manufacturers' rebate 
programs. Domestic auto dealers are optimistic that sales in 1988 as 
a whole will exceed 1987 sales. Import dealers indicate that foreign 
manufacturers who have not yet raised prices to fully compensate for 
the dollar's decline may do so later this year, and they believe 
this year's sales could fall below last year's as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan volume at major Third District banks increased in June and 
bankers contacted in July generally report further growth in most 
categories of lending. Bank loan officers say commercial and 
industrial lending has been accelerating and is likely to remain 
healthy for the near future. Demand for consumer credit is not 
strong, although home equity loans are still popular; nevertheless, 
area banks have been able to increase installment lending by 
offering more attractive credit terms. Growth in real estate 
lending, while still at a healthy pace, continues to taper off, and 
bankers see this trend continuing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit growth at major Third District banks picked up in June, and 
bankers say this growth was being maintained in July. In particular, 
demand deposits appeared to be reversing the year-over-year decline 
of the last eight months. Bankers indicate that growing demand for 
business loans in combination with increased deposit growth is 
bolstering net interest margins.
