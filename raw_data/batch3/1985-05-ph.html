      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Major sectors of the Third District economy are stable or growing in 
April. Manufacturing activity is holding steady after three months 
of accelerating growth, while retail sales remain strong after a 
successful Easter selling season. Loan demand is up at area banks. 
Sales of new and existing houses are rising, and both residential 
and commercial construction are increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the Third District economy is positive. 
Manufacturers expect to boost production and employment during the 
next six months, and retailers forecast higher sales for the second 
half of 1985 and for the year as a whole. Likewise, area bankers 
anticipate greater loan demand as economic growth continues. Real 
estate sales and construction activity are expected to remain strong 
through the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After expending at increasingly faster rates for three consecutive 
months, manufacturing activity In the Third District levelled off in 
April, according to the most recent Business Outlook Survey. Sixty 
percent of the April survey respondents said there had been no 
change from March in the pace of their operations. The number of 
respondents reporting increases in new orders and shipments slightly 
exceeded the number reporting decreases, while around 40 percent 
reported no change. Inventories also were stable. As for employment, 
three out of four survey respondents reported that payrolls and 
working hours were holding steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the lack of growth in April, the outlook for local 
manufacturing over the next six months remains fairly positive. Half 
of the companies participating in the April survey expect Increases 
in production, new orders, and shipments during the summer. A 
quarter of those polled plan to hire more workers, and almost one-
fifth expect to lengthen the workweek. About 30 percent have 
scheduled larger expenditures on new plant and equipment during the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of industrial goods remained flat again in April. Although 
some survey respondents reported higher prices for their inputs, 
more than 80 percent of the survey respondents said there had been 
no change in the prices of the products they buy or sell. Looking 
ahead, two out of three of the respondents anticipate paying more 
for raw materials within the next six months, and one out of three 
expect the prices of their own products to go up during the same 
period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Third District's strong retail sales of the first two months of 
this year continued into March. The trend appears to be extending 
through April, although some store managers speculate that delays in 
income tax refunds may have interrupted consumer purchases early in 
the month. Department store and general merchandise sales for the 
first fiscal quarter (February, March, April) are up 5 to 10 percent 
above the comparable period in 1984. Retailers say this growth was 
assisted by favorable weather and an early Easter holiday. Although 
sales growth thus far in 1985 is less than last year, retailers are 
basically satisfied, as prices have been steady and virtually all of 
the increase represents higher unit sales volume. Inventories at 
department stores remain in line with sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers are cautiously optimistic about the upcoming spring and 
summer seasons. Apparel and seasonal goods are selling well, and 
sales are expected to continue strong through the spring. Sale 
growth is expected to moderate in late summer and fall. For the year 
as a whole compared to 1984, retailers forecast increases ranging 
from 6 to 10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank lending officers in the Third District report that strong loan 
demand reflects a strong economy, despite some indications of a 
pause given by national economic measures in the first quarter. 
Compared to April 1984, commercial and industrial loan volume is up 
between 15 and 20 percent, and commercial real estate and 
construction loans are up about 15 percent. Consumer loans are 
approximately 35 percent above year-ago levels, partly due to 
continuing credit card promotion by local banks. Although area 
bankers expect growth to slacken somewhat from its present pace, 
they anticipate robust loan demand through the rest of the year. 
Lending in all categories in the second half of this year is 
expected to be 10 to 15 percent higher than in the second half of 
1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      For Third District bankers, a strong economy and concomitant loan 
demand imply that short-term interest rates are at or near their 
lows for the year. Local bank economists believe a slight dip is 
possible in the prime and federal funds rates before a gradual rise 
during the balance of the year. The consensus is that rates will be 
higher by the fall, with the prime rate approaching 12 percent and 
the federal funds rate hovering around 10 percent by the end of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate agents throughout the Third District report 
growing numbers of people shopping for homes, after a brief drop in 
March. Sales are rising, and developers and agents believe that 
current mortgage rates, which average 13 percent for a 30 year 
conventional loan, are consistent with sustained sales at the 
present pace. Sales would drop off at rates of 14 percent or more, 
and would pick up substantially if rates were to fall to 12 percent 
or less, according to agents.
     </p>
     <p>
      For most areas of the Third District, real estate and construction 
activity is at or above 1984 levels. Some differences in local 
growth rates are noted, with those that dipped in 1984 now posting 
the biggest gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction continues to thrive. Building agents say the 
local office vacancy rate remains below the national average and 
that the market should continue to absorb new space through the rest 
of the year.
