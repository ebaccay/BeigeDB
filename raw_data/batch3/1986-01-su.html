      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      This month's commentaries on regional economic activity suggest that 
the economy is growing at a moderate pace on balance. Several Banks, 
including Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San 
Francisco, pointed to signs of improving business activity in their 
respective Districts. Most other Banks reported little change. 
Dallas reported that its economy remained sluggish, and St. Louis 
noted a continuation of the conflicting signals reported earlier for 
its region. Chicago pointed to continued weakness in its District 
and indicated that it expected business activity there to lag the 
national economy in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic picture is uneven across sectors. Consumer spending 
appears to have been moderately strong during the Christmas season 
in most regions, although Chicago reported that sales were 
disappointing. Construction activity was also reported to be 
relatively strong, especially in the residential sector. 
Manufacturing activity, however, is mixed, ranging from a boom in 
military electronics in the San Francisco District to activity that 
remains in the "doldrums" in time Cleveland District. Elsewhere, 
several reports noted continuing problems in agriculture, including 
declining livestock prices (Minneapolis and Dallas), rising 
delinquencies on farm loans (St. Louis), low orange prices 
(Atlanta), and low tobacco prices (Richmond). Several pockets of 
strength in the agricultural sector were mentioned, however, 
including poultry, almonds, and winegrapes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Much of the comment on consumer spending focused on sales during the 
Christmas season. Most of the reports indicated satisfactory sales 
despite the shorter-them-normal selling period between Thanksgiving 
and Christmas. Sales were 5 to 10 percent higher than last year in 
the New York District. They were up 3 to 7 percent in the 
Philadelphia District, and were described as relatively strong in 
the Kansas City District, above expectations in the Dallas District, 
and either level or up moderately in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis, and Cleveland Districts. Retail inventories appear to be 
under good control for the most part; they were variously described 
as relatively low, satisfactory, or well-balanced. Profits of retail 
merchants were reported to be well above the year-ago level in most 
districts, due to reduced price competition this Christmas. St. 
Louis, however, reported that profits were about equal to 1984 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales have apparently responded to the latest round of 
interest rate incentive programs. Cleveland, for example, noted that 
sales in early January were up as such as 30 percent from year-ago 
levels. Dallas, however, reported that sales have recently weakened 
and that inventories of domestic cars were excessive.
     </p>
     <p>
      There were mixed views of the outlook for consumer spending. While 
sales are generally expected to increase, some of the reports 
suggest the increase may be modest in some regions. For example, 
Kansas City reported that sales are expected to increase only 
slightly, and Philadelphia indicated that most retailers expect flat 
sales in the first half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing shipments and orders, on average, appear to be growing 
at a slow rate, while manufacturing employment continues to decline. 
Conditions vary widely, however, across industries and regions. 
Philadelphia noted that orders and shipments are up in its District, 
but that employment is steady. Boston reported that orders are flat, 
or increasing modestly, while employment is being cut by attrition. 
Cleveland indicated that employment had fallen substantially at more 
than half of the establishments it had surveyed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Atlanta and Sam Francisco reported that defense spending had 
stimulated industrial activity in their Districts, particularly in 
the electronic equipment and shipbuilding industries. Richmond and 
Atlanta reported that activity in the textile industry, hit hard in 
recent months by imports, had recently stabilized, albeit at a low 
level. Sam Francisco and Dallas stated that the output of lumber and 
wood products in their areas had continued to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several Banks noted little tangible response to the recent decline 
in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Richmond, however, 
indicated that several District manufacturers had recently reported 
renewed contacts with former customers. Also, Boston reported that 
sales to European buyers had picked up quite markedly in the second 
half of 1985 due, at least in part, to the dollar's decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dallas reported that the drilling rig count was at its lowest level 
since 1976, and that the seismic crew count was continuing to fall. 
Minneapolis also noted declining oil and gas activity but mentioned 
that a copper mine was reopening. San Francisco indicated that 
mining activity for metals such as copper remained depressed, but 
that gold and silver mining were expanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seven districts reported moderate to strong increases in residential 
building activity. Dallas, however, painted a bleak picture of 
construction activity in its District. It indicated that the value 
of both residential and nonresidential construction contracts had 
fallen in each of the last three months. Atlanta reported that 
office construction had outpaced leasing recently, and Cleveland 
reported concern that speculative construction of new office space 
was excessive in some midwestern cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several Banks mentioned low farm prices and the resulting low farm 
incomes. Richmond reported low tobacco prices, Atlanta noted low 
orange prices, and Minneapolis and Dallas found falling livestock 
prices. Dallas also reported a continuing decline in foreign demand 
for cotton, and San Francisco noted generally weak farm prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reports on agriculture were not uniformly bleak, however. 
Richmond indicated that the demand for poultry was strong, and San 
Francisco found that the lower dollar had aided producers of almonds 
and winegrapes. Chicago and Minneapolis stated that recent increases 
in some farm commodity prices were a positive factor. Also, Kansas 
City reported that excellent crop yields and higher livestock prices 
had produced a better than expected farm loan situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several Banks reported that both household and business loan demand 
were strong. Kansas City, however, indicated that loan demand in its 
District was flat, and Dallas noted that both consumer and business 
demand were below the year ago level. Only two Banks mentioned the 
removal of minimum balance requirements on Super-NOW accounts, and 
both reported that the removal had not yet produced any significant 
change in deposit pricing policies in their Districts.
