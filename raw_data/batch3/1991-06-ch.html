       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most sectors of the District economy were flat to slightly expanding 
in May and early June, while traditionally lagging industries 
continued to decline. A solid recovery in residential real estate 
activity continued, although commercial construction remained soft. 
Retailers in the District reported that consumer spending advanced 
in recent weeks, with sales gains led by housing-related spending. 
Reports from District manufacturers were mixed, with producers of 
consumer durable goods generally reporting better results than those 
posted by producers of heavy equipment. Capital spending intentions 
of District businesses indicated continued cutbacks and 
postponements in the second quarter of 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recovery in District residential real estate activity continued in 
recent weeks, helping to bolster construction spending, consumer 
spending on household durable goods, and manufacturing activity 
related to housing. A large District realtor reported continued 
solid year-over-year sales gains in May and early June. District 
housing construction fell off slightly in April, but only after an 
unsustainable surge in March. Industry contacts indicated little 
change in the weak outlook for commercial construction, however. A 
large producer of cement reported that shipments continue to decline 
in the month of May (from the year-earlier period), but not quite so 
severely as in previous months. Cement shipments for commercial 
construction were decidedly weaker than those for residential 
building, and the company's backlog continued to shrink. At the end 
of May, this company's backlog was 65 percent below May 1990. A 
recent study found that the amount of new office space under 
construction in the suburban Chicago area declined by over 50 
percent from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the first quarter of 
1991, reaching the lowest level in ten years. Labor strikes in 
Chicago and Detroit have been holding back several large 
construction projects. A settlement is expected soon in the Chicago 
negotiations, while bargaining is in the early stages in the more 
recent strikes in Detroit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The strengthening in the housing sector has begun to translate into 
gains in other forms of consumer spending, according to several 
District retailers. A large general merchandise retailer reported 
that May and early June sales in the District increased in real 
terms and outperformed the company's national average. This contact 
had previously reported relative weakness in sales in the District 
in the first quarter of 1991. Appliances and home improvement 
products provided the largest contributions to sales growth. A large 
discount chain reported continued modest sales gains in May, with 
District sales growth in line with national results despite an 
increasingly competitive District environment facing the retailer. 
This contact stated that sales growth has not yet been robust enough 
to translate into improvement of their orders to manufacturers, 
however, as efforts to trim inventory continue. Despite the surge in 
housing, several smaller specialty furniture retailers in the 
District continued to experience a very difficult period, with many 
store closings reported in the first half of the year. One small 
District furniture retailer reported that May and early June sales 
continued to post year-over-year declines, and noted that credit 
card sales were especially weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales' trends remain difficult to interpret, according to 
several industry analysts. The 1990 switch from a two-turn to a 
three-turn strategy by automakers selling to captive rental fleets 
generated distortions to seasonal sales patterns. April sales 
figures (which under a two-turn strategy would include some sales to 
fleets) were understated by using traditional seasonal factors. Th 
higher level of fleet sales in 1990 provided a second factor helping 
to understate recent sales strength, as higher resale levels of 
nearly-new program cars substituted for new vehicles in early 1991. 
A major domestic car manufacturer estimates that after accounting 
for these effects, total light vehicle sales (including domestic and 
imported vehicles) have been essentially flat in recent months. 
Reports from several District auto dealers generally support this 
conclusion. One large District domestic car dealer reported that 
sales fell 20 percent in May from a year earlier, in line with 
declines posted in March and April. Citing higher auction prices, 
this dealer ceased selling program cars, which is consistent with 
widespread expectations that sales of these "nearly-new" vehicles 
will lessen in importance in the months ahead. Sales to first-time 
car buyers declined significantly, in part because basic demand was 
off and in part because first-time buyers fall into stricter credit-
quality categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers of consumer durable goods generally reported 
better results than producers of heavy equipment. A large District 
appliance manufacturer reported modest improvement in shipments, 
especially for products going into new homes. Shipments of air 
conditioners and microwave ovens remained weak, however, and excess 
inventories have to be worked off before shipments at the plant 
level improve. A large manufacturer of lawn care equipment reported 
that its factory sales strengthened from March to April, but 
remained well below year-earlier levels. Production in the auto 
industry (on a seasonally adjusted basis) generally continued to
register the gains recorded early in the second quarter, although 
some early shutdowns for new model changeovers have held back 
overall production. Still, May output exceeded announced schedules 
for the first time in almost a year. A steel producer reported that 
orders from automakers indicate continued growth (on a seasonally-
adjusted basis) in auto production through the third quarter, This 
contact stated that summer shutdowns may be shorter than 
anticipated, as automakers speed up production of new models. An 
electronics firm reported that orders rose for the second 
consecutive month in May, after experiencing moderate weakening 
earlier in the year. Orders received from the auto industry were 
particularly strong, consistent with other evidence of improved 
production levels in this key District industry. The automotive 
component of the Detroit purchasing managers' survey index advanced 
sharply in May, registering its first expansionary month in 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several capital goods producers, whose sales recoveries tend to lag 
a turnaround in the overall economy, reported continued weakness in 
sales and production. A large District manufacturer of heavy 
equipment reported that sales continued to decline at a significant 
pace in May but the rate of decline has improved somewhat over the 
past three months. Orders in-hand remain very weak, however, off as 
much as 60 percent from a year earlier. Dealer inventories remain 
high and are expected to dampen the production response to an 
anticipated sales increase in the second half of the year. Another 
capital goods producer reported that sales of construction equipment 
continue to show sharp year-over-year declines, and sales of 
agricultural equipment in May turned soft again, after some 
improvement in previous months. A large diversified manufacturer 
reported that orders have been mixed recently, with weakness 
concentrated on the capital goods side of the business. A trick 
manufacturer reported modest improvement in orders for heavy-duty 
trucks, but medium-duty truck orders remained at recessionary 
levels. This contact noted that medium-duty truck orders usually 
improve before heavy-duty trucks as an economic recovery asserts 
itself, and attributed some of the weakness in medium-duty trucks to 
financial problems facing small businesses. A manufacturer of motor 
vehicle engines also reported that orders for heavy-duty truck 
engines strengthened in recent months, but production planning 
remained cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A small sampling of District manufacturers indicates that cutbacks 
and postponements of capital spending plans may have extended into 
the second quarter of the year. A large manufacturer of heavy 
equipment reported 1991 capital spending plans had recently been cut 
to a level 16 percent below last year, after plans at the beginning 
of the year called for flat spending. A manufacturer of truck 
engines reported that 1991 spending plans were cut in the first 
quarter to a level 30 percent below last year, but have remained in 
place since then. A large District manufacturer of paper-based 
containers reported that 1991 capital spending plans were cut at the 
end of March to a level 50 percent below 1990, citing industry 
overcapacity and a reluctance to borrow. A steel producer reported 
that 1991 spending plans, previously scheduled to be 20 percent 
lower than 1990, had been newly cut to a level 40 percent below last 
year. The capital expenditures component of the Milwaukee purchasing 
managers' survey fell from 55 percent in April to 48 percent in May, 
reaching its lowest level since late 1987. Industry orders for 
machine tools have weakened in recent months after holding up well 
through the early stages of the recession. An industry participant 
stated that sales have become less cyclical, as customers show 
increased sensitivity to efficiency considerations, relative to 
capacity requirements. This company still expected substantial 
internal capital expenditure growth this year. A machine tool 
industry representative reported that companies specializing in 
sales to the auto industry have suffered disproportionately in the 
current downturn.
