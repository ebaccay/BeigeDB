      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions are mixed in the Twelfth District, with 
continued weakness in California offsetting modest growth in other 
states. In California, weakness is reported in trade, finance, real 
estate markets, and construction activity. Moreover, health and 
welfare programs are beginning to feel cutbacks in state and local 
government spending resulting from the recent state budget 
agreement. In the southern part of the state, weakness persists in 
aerospace and defense-related manufacturing. Conditions in other 
District states are improving modestly, with the strongest 
conditions reported in Utah and Idaho. However, most contacts expect 
sluggish overall economic growth. Agricultural conditions are mixed, 
with drought affecting certain sections of the Pacific Northwest. 
Little upward pressure on wages and prices is reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The sentiment of Twelfth District business leaders was little 
changed from our last report, with most contacts expecting sluggish 
growth. Only 20 percent of our respondents expect the real economy 
to expand during the next four quarters at a rate of at least 2.5 
percent. This proportion is about the same as in September but down 
from one-third in July and one-half in June. Almost three-quarters 
of our respondents expect real output to expand, but at a rate below 
2.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts continue to report few upward pressures on prices in 
District markets. Lumber and roofing materials prices have risen due 
to recent hurricanes, but the surge in demand for plywood appears to 
have ebbed and prices are reported to have dropped 15 percent in 
recent weeks. Retail consumer prices in Utah and Idaho rose at a 4.5 
percent annual rate during the first three quarters of 1992. A 
contact in the telecommunications industry reports generally 
declining prices and price concessions by suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Boeing Company machinists approved a new three-year contract with 
the company on October 2. The deal included a 12 percent lump sum 
bonus check this year followed by 3.5 percent pay increases during 
the next two years. Labor wages in the rail industry are reported to 
be increasing by 3 percent for less than a third of employees, with 
the rest receiving no increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer sentiment appears severely affected in southern California, 
where contacts report general pessimism due to continuing employment 
cutbacks. One contact reports that while general merchandise 
retailers saw business pick up nationally in September, no 
significant change from sluggish conditions is apparent in 
California. Contacts from several states report that discount and 
outlet stores are doing well and expanding operations. In Arizona, 
retail sales rebounded during the summer, showing a 4.3 percent 
increase in August over a year earlier. One contact reports that 
durable goods sales in Arizona are suppressed by low consumer 
confidence, but that auto sales in August were up 6 percent from a 
year earlier. An auto industry contact from Idaho also reports that 
sales have improved somewhat since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fall-out of the California state budget settlement reached in 
September is beginning to be felt. All public state agencies 
experienced major reductions in funds, with health and social 
welfare programs particularly hard hit. To offset lower funding 
levels, public colleges and universities are reducing employment and 
raising fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing conditions are mixed, but defense-related 
employment reductions continue in southern California. Contacts in 
Utah and Arizona report some increases in aerospace activity due to 
shifts from California, and employment cuts in defense appear to be 
over in Idaho and Utah. One contact reports that the aerospace 
industry has been helped by the avoidance of a strike at Boeing and 
continued strong airplane orders from Pacific-Rim airlines. However, 
Boeing is cutting back the production rate of its 737 model this 
year, and plans to slow production of the 757 in September 1993. 
Aluminum production is reported to remain high, although prices have 
fallen sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of aerospace and defense, conditions are mixed. One contact 
from Silicon Valley reports that the price war continues in the 
personal computer industry, and that a significant shake-out in the 
industry is expected. High-tech manufacturers are reporting some 
cancellations of orders from Japan, but in general export demand 
from Latin America and Pacific Basin countries is supporting 
manufacturing activity across the District. One contact from Arizona 
reports that business is booming for suppliers to Mexican firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Eastern Oregon and most of Idaho are still in the grips of drought 
as irrigation water has been shut off for quite some time and 
reservoirs are at extremely low levels. Tree fruit crops, however, 
have been helped by sunny weather. Apple production in Oregon is 54 
percent above last year's crop, and cherry production in eastern 
Washington is up 30 percent from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forest products production continues weak. Lumber exports are 25 
percent below 1991 levels, due primarily to declines in shipments to 
Japan and other Pacific Basin countries. While damage from the 
recent hurricanes caused plywood demand to surge, a contact reports 
that the short-term jump in demand has subsided.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction and real estate conditions are mixed. 
Contacts in California report sluggish sales, with prices decreasing 
in some areas, particularly for higher priced houses. A contact in 
southern California notes that home foreclosures are up 74 percent 
since the beginning of 1992, and another contact reports concern 
that people cannot sell homes. Weakness in construction activity in 
California is reflected in a 5.1 percent decline in lumber shipments 
to California during the first half of 1992 versus a year earlier. 
Stronger conditions exist in other District states. Contacts in 
Oregon report a strong real estate market with a wave of 
construction activity in August. House sales in Salem were 31 
percent above their year-earlier level in August. Housing sales, 
construction and prices are up in Tucson, but Phoenix still is 
reporting weakness. Contacts in Utah and Idaho are reporting 
continued strong growth in housing demand. Nonresidential 
construction remains weak in most District markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial industry conditions are mixed in the District, with 
weakness reported in California. One California banker reports that 
consumer loan demand continues to drop, and that commercial loan 
demand remains weak, although loan officers report some recent 
pickup among high-tech industries in northern California. Another 
contact reports that loan demand remains weak as consumers and 
businesses continue to be focused on debt reduction. Demand for 
mortgage loans in Utah remains brisk, with demand coming from 
consumers upgrading their housing and from continued migration into 
the state. Contacts in Oregon report that, despite recent mergers, 
employment in financial services is growing due to relatively strong 
economic conditions. Commercial loan demand in Utah and Arizona, 
however, is described as flat.
