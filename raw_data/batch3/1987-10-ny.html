      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 27, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the Second District economy registered some improvement 
since the last report. The latest purchasing managers' surveys 
showed a sizable increase in firms reporting better business 
conditions, and retailers experienced satisfactory sales in recent 
weeks. Office leasing activity was also good, but the residential 
construction market remains mixed. On the financial side, most small 
and mid-sized banks have raised their lending rates in response to 
prime rate increases at money center banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In part reflecting the lateness of Labor Day this year, sales at 
District department stores registered stronger over-the-year gains 
in September than in August. Promotionals and back-to-school buying 
which typically occur in late August were postponed to early 
September this year. However, the remainder of September was also 
relatively strong. Our respondents reported year-to-year gains of 11 
to 13 percent in September, up from a range of 2 to 8 percent in 
August. September sales were generally above plan whereas August 
sales at some stores were on or slightly below target.
     </p>
     <p>
      Items in strong demand during recent weeks were most kinds of 
apparel, accessories, and home furnishings. One retailer, however, 
noted a weakness in women's apparel throughout his chain, possibly 
reflecting disenchantment with some of the more extreme new 
fashions. Inventories were reported from 4 percent below to 4 
percent above plan, which respondents found tolerable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The improved tone in the District's economy continued in recent 
weeks. The latest purchasing managers' surveys from Buffalo and 
Rochester showed a sizable increase an the percentage of firms 
reporting an improvement in general business conditions. Inventories 
were also somewhat higher, but the level was not burdensome.
     </p>
     <p>
      Plans were announced for several major new projects in the District. 
These include a proposal for a new residential community of some 
1200 condominiums on a waterfront site in New Jersey where an auto 
assembly plant was formerly located and a project in Brooklyn to 
build 2500 middle-income apartments along the waterfront together 
with a public park, promenade, and space for light industrial use. 
On Long Island work is scheduled to begin in November on a 362- room 
hotel, resort, and conference center, the first phase of a $150 
million mixed-use development which will also include town houses 
and an office building. In addition, the lifting of a 7-month 
building ban elsewhere on Long Island is expected to result in the 
construction of several residential and commercial projects that 
have been on hold.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates in the District showed little change in September 
when both New York and New Jersey posted rates of 4.5%. New York 
City's unemployment rate also fell to 4.5%, its lowest level in 17 
years. While unemployment rates have dropped substantially 
throughout the District in recent years, analysts in some labor 
markets such as Buffalo view the decline with caution. They 
attribute much of the improvement to substantial outmigration and 
the substitution of low-paying service jobs for the high-paying 
manufacturing positions which once were prevalent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of District residential construction activity was again 
mixed in recent weeks. Builders in upstate communities remain quite 
busy, and starts in some of these areas are expected to equal last 
year's high levels. In the downstate and New Jersey markets, 
however, builders continued to experience a slowdown and little 
traffic from potential buyers. High prices resulting from a shortage 
of suitable land are cited as the major deterrent. The high cost of 
new homes is reportedly stimulating a boom in the rebuilding and 
expansion of existing homes. In the District as a whole 1987 starts 
are expected to trail the year-earlier pace. Observers were 
generally reluctant to speculate about the longer-term outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      The demand for office space in the District during recent weeks was 
generally good. A large number of modest-sized leasings strengthened 
Manhattan's midtown market while the downtown market was bolstered 
by steady demand and the withdrawal of a large block of space for 
subleasing. In their continuing battle to induce firms not to 
relocate, New York City officials were recently heartened by a 
survey showing that manufacturing firms more than doubled the amount 
of office space which they leased in Manhattan during the first half 
of this year compared with a year earlier. City officials are 
particularly concerned by the abundance of new, less expensive 
quarters across the Hudson River in New Jersey, fearing that a 
decline in New Jersey's high vacancy rates will come at the City's 
expense.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most small and mid-sized banks in the Second District have raised 
their lending rates in response to the recent increases in the prime 
rate charged by money center banks. Despite the rise in interest 
rates, demand for commercial loans remains strong, according to 
senior officers who cited the robust regional economy as responsible 
for the steady demand for business loans. On the retail side, demand 
for consumer installment and home mortgage loans also has not been 
dampened by rising rates. However, one conspicuously weak segment of 
the market is the demand for bank auto loans. Respondents stated 
that the generous promotional offers by the auto finance companies 
have drastically reduced the market for bank auto loans.
