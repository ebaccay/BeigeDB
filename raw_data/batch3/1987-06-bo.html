      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the First District remains at a high level, 
although the composition of activity may have changed a little. The 
retail experience has been mixed, with some merchants facing flat 
sales and others enjoying large increases. Poor weather depressed 
sales in May; early June results have been stronger. Manufacturing 
respondents reported a fairly broad-based pickup in orders in the 
past couple of months. This increase is attributed to domestic 
demand, rather than an improving trade situation. While retailers 
are seeing rising import prices, manufacturers are not. Employers 
throughout the District are experiencing difficulty attracting and 
holding workers, particularly at the entry level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results continue to be mixed in the First District. Some 
chains report sales level with last year; others have seen increases 
of up to 22 percent in recent months. Several contacts mentioned a 
noticeable pickup in the first week or two of June after a 
lackluster May. Inventories have been kept in line with sales. Some 
prices, notably apparel and lumber, are rising; so are local labor 
costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The weather in New England was poor in May and sales generally 
suffered as a result. This was particularly true of seasonal items, 
which reportedly picked up markedly as the weather warmed at the end 
of the month. One store experienced a sudden drop in sales of major 
appliances in the middle of April which has not yet been reversed; 
another, however, said appliances advanced well while sales of 
homebuilding supplies declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of merchants reported difficulty in keeping stores and home 
offices fully staffed. Turnover is rising ("because it is so easy 
for employees to find new jobs") and it is difficult to hire new 
employees, especially at the lower-paid end of the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasts for the remainder of the year are closely tied to recent 
performance. For stores performing poorly, this represents a more 
negative outlook compared with earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Apparel Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Because of the sizable apparel price increase in the CPI, inquiries 
about the sources of this increase were made among First District 
retailers. These retailers report that apparel import prices are 
rising substantially (10-25 percent compared to a year earlier); 
they lay the blame for these increases on both the quota system and 
the decline in the value of the dollar. Prices of domestically 
produced apparel are increasing more gradually; these domestic price 
increases are attributed to rising textile prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong demand for apparel is leading to increases in the prices at 
which quotas are bought and sold among overseas manufacturers. Also, 
because the quotas limit the quantity (not value) of goods that 
foreign producers can send to the United States, the items now 
imported include fewer inexpensive goods. While the decline in the 
value of the dollar has had its strongest effects on the prices of 
imports from Japan and Europe, quotas also affect goods from 
countries with no currency appreciation relative to the dollar. In 
addition, the appreciation of the yen has contributed to price 
increases for Korean and Taiwanese apparel, because many producers 
in these countries buy their fabrics from Japan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both imported and domestic textile prices are rising. Prices for 
imported textiles are rising because of the decline in the value of 
the dollar (Japan and Europe) and because of quotas (Hong Kong, 
Korea, Taiwan). Domestic prices are rising because demand is up and 
domestic textile mills are running near capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents from the manufacturing sector have seen an increase in 
orders in the past month or two. Most of these contacts are 
producers of capital goods, but within this group the increases have 
been broadly based. Manufacturers of both high technology products 
and more traditional capital goods have experienced increases. 
Domestic demand is responsible for the improvement. Reports on 
exports were mixed. One contact in the instruments industry reported 
that exports to Europe have been strong since 1986; however, another 
contact, from a firm that is very active in international markets, 
described exports as disappointing. None of the residents attributed 
the pickup in domestic orders to an easing in import competition. 
Japanese competitors are said to be resisting raising prices and are 
holding on to market share tenaciously. Most respondents are also 
holding the line on prices and in a couple of cases prices are being 
reduced.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of the lag between orders and shipments, several contacts 
have quite low shipment volumes. A couple have had small layoffs 
recently. Hiring is limited to replacement hiring; none of the firms 
contacted is increasing the size of its workforce. Capital spending 
levels are considered to be fairly high, although not necessarily 
higher than last year. On balance, manufacturing respondents have 
become a little more positive about the outlook for the next six 
months to a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The New England Economic Project (NEEP), a non-profit organization 
comprising businesses, government agencies and educational 
institutions, held its semi-annual outlook conference at the end of 
May. The NEEP forecasts for the six New England states, taken 
together, call for nonagricultural employment in the region to 
increase at a slightly faster rate in 1987 and 1988 than the 2.6 
percent rate of growth experienced in 1986. Growth will be more 
balanced, with manufacturing employment stabilizing in 1987 and 
increasing slightly in 1988. Non-manufacturing employment will grow 
strongly but not quite so strongly as in the past couple of years. 
The unemployment rate in the region will remain around 4 percent. 
Representatives from all six states spoke of the difficulties 
employers are having finding workers. All kinds of businesses, 
manufacturing and services, are experiencing difficulty attracting 
and holding on to staff, especially at the entry level.
