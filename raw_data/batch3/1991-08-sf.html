      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions are weak in much of the Twelfth District, with 
particular stress reported in southern California. Conditions in 
Utah, Idaho, and Washington are reported to be relatively strong, 
but few signs of expansion are reported elsewhere. Layoffs are 
reported to be continuing in several sectors--including defense-
related manufacturing, banking, retail, and state and local 
government. The rebound in California and Washington residential 
real estate seen since the end of the Gulf War shows signs of 
tailing off and commercial real estate remains weak. Exports to 
Pacific Basin and Latin American nations, however, remain a source 
of strength for agriculture, lumber, and manufacturing. While 
consumer price inflation has been temporarily boosted by increased 
sales taxes, underlying price and wage increases are reported to be 
moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expectations of Twelfth District business leaders showed 
little change in July. Respondents remain pessimistic about future 
national economic growth, with 68 percent projecting GNP growth of 
less than 2.5 to 3 percent over the next four quarters. This 
proportion, however, has fallen steadily from 100 percent at the end 
of 1990, and only nine percent of western business leaders now 
expect the U.S. to remain in recession during the coming year. 
Three-quarters of western business leaders expect no improvement in 
the unemployment rate over the next year. About half of respondents 
continue to project improvement in business investment, housing 
starts, and inflation during the next four quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wages and prices are increasing at moderate rates throughout the 
Twelfth District. In the Pacific Northwest, manufacturing and lumber 
industry wages are up 4 to 5 percent from last year. Retail 
nondurable prices are reported to be flat to up slightly. Prices in 
California were affected by a rise in the general sales tax, an 
expansion of coverage to include snacks, newspapers, and magazines, 
and an increase in taxes on alcohol. Food prices are reported to be 
stable, and livestock prices remain at relatively high levels. 
Substantial discounting was reported for computers, hotels, fast 
food, and designer clothing. Respondents from banking and service 
sectors report stringent efforts to control costs in response to 
weak markets and competitive pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending remains sluggish throughout the Twelfth District. 
Auto sales in Utah Arizona, and Idaho are reported flat. Department 
store sales still are slow, but inventories remain under control. 
Some retailers are scaling back hiring substantially, especially in 
southern California. Japanese tourist visits to Hawaii have picked 
up recently, but their spending remains below pre-Gulf War levels. 
California state government workers are facing pay cuts, work 
furloughs, and reduced hours in response to budget cuts. Respondents 
report recent layoffs among lawyers, accountants, architects, real 
estate firms, banks, and community colleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing conditions in the West are mixed. Boeing continues to 
operate at or near capacity and has plans to expand and modernize 
facilities over a 10-year period. Metals industries, however, are 
facing sluggish demand and some firms supplying the aerospace 
industry currently are operating at less than 50 percent of 
capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Exports remain a source of strength for District manufacturers. 
During the first quarter, all new orders at Boeing were from foreign 
carriers. Small- to mid-sized communications, electronics, and 
paint-products firms reported increased orders during the second 
quarter. Foreign inquiries also have been made for the purchase of 
military helicopters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions in the Twelfth District are generally good, 
but recent unseasonable weather hurt some crops including the table 
grape crop in the southern San Joaquin Valley. Exports of 
agricultural products to Latin America are a source of strength. 
Mexico in particular is a growing market for California pears, 
peaches, wine, and nuts, and Washington apples.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumber industry conditions remain weak, with orders and prices 
slipping in recent weeks. Year-to-date lumber exports (volume terms) 
were up 2 percent through April, as a 37 percent decline in exports 
to Canada was offset by a doubling of exports to Mexico. Log export 
volume to Japan has dropped 32 percent, but exports to other Pacific 
Basin markets have increased 42 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate markets remain weak in much of the 
West. The rebound in California and Washington markets seen after 
the Gulf War shows signs of tailing off. Home sales have picked-up 
somewhat in Los Angeles, but the rebound has moderated in Sacramento 
and Seattle with unsold inventory putting downward pressure on 
prices. Commercial real estate in southern California continues to 
face high vacancy rates, declining rents, and a lack of financing. 
Respondents report that several southern California real estate 
development firms are under financial stress. Real estate markets in 
Utah remain strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial institutions in the Twelfth District report mixed 
conditions. In California, loan demand remains weak while deposit 
generation is solid, led by strong growth in money market deposit 
accounts. Mortgage demand is strong in Oregon and Utah. In Hawaii, 
loan demand remains high, but it is becoming more difficult to 
secure financing from mainland U.S. and Japanese banks. Respondents 
in southern California report the unavailability of long-term 
financing for commercial real estate except for "institutional 
grade" projects with long-term leases already in place.
