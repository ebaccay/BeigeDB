      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Some signs of a pickup in the Second District economy have appeared 
in recent weeks. Retailers report that August sales were the best in 
several months, and they attribute the slowdown in September to 
unseasonably warm weather and Hurricane Gloria. Business activity is 
generally described as stable or improved, despite continued layoffs 
by some manufacturers who are consolidating operations outside the 
District. Commercial leasing activity has increased in most areas, 
but office availability rates are still high. Throughout the 
District the demand for new homes remains strong. Small banks in the 
District report a decline in car loans due to lower cost financing 
by auto manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in August averaged 9 percent above year-earlier levels, 
the first substantial advance after a prolonged period of 
sluggishness. Brisk back-to-school business and a better-than-expected response to new fall fashions were cited as major factors. 
As a result, some stores posted their first above-plan sales figures 
in several months. Preliminary data indicate some slowing during 
September, but this was generally attributed to summer-like weather 
and the impact of Hurricane Gloria. However, one discount-chain 
contact suggested that the high level of consumer debt is hindering 
sales of its durable goods, and another retailer speculated that 
auto promotions have reduced general merchandise sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      After several months of heavy promotional activity, most department 
stores had trimmed their inventories to desired levels by the end of 
July. Inventories have remained on target, and District retailers 
are generally optimistic about the fall and holiday seasons ahead. 
Some are already stockpiling possible hot-selling items such as 
Cabbage Patch dolls and robot transformers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Second District was stable to somewhat 
improved in recent weeks. In both Buffalo and Rochester, for 
example, an increased percentage of purchasing managers reported 
that business conditions were either unchanged or better during 
August. Inventories there remain at comfortable levels. In other 
parts of New York State and New Jersey, conditions were also 
described as generally stable although some manufacturing firms 
continue laying off regional workers and consolidating operations 
outside the District in an attempt to become more competitive. 
Passaic, New Jersey was a major exception to this pattern of 
stability: a widespread fire in its industrial area recently 
destroyed 62 small plants which employed 2,200 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the September unemployment rates remained below the national 
average in New York State and New Jersey, some employment cutbacks 
are expected in the District as a result of restructuring plans 
recently announced by AT&amp;T Information Systems and Union Carbide. In 
addition, the redesign of an automotive plant in New Jersey will 
temporarily reduce employment in that sector by 4,200 workers over 
the next 12-16 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall effect on employment is difficult to project, however, 
since other firms continue to move into and expand within the 
District. Major investments recently announced included the purchase 
of a former Western Electric plant in New Jersey for conversion to 
an industrial park, the approval of the $15 million first step in 
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's $500 million 
waterfront project in New York City, and the purchase by local 
investors of two Buffalo area plants assuring the retention of at 
least 2,200 jobs and perhaps the addition of others.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and Real Estate
District homebuilders report no letup in the busy pace of their 
activity. Demand for new homes remains strong and the rush is on to 
complete as much work as possible before cold weather arrives. In 
addition, in Connecticut and Long Island where Hurricane Gloria was 
especially damaging, the demand for skilled labor and building 
supplies has increased even more. As a result, extensive delays in 
rebuilding and repairs have been noted there. Most District 
homebuilders expect residential construction to continue strong at 
least through early next year. However, they anticipate a somewhat 
less hectic pace than in 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential leasing activity has picked up in much of the 
District. Observers in Westchester and Fairfield Counties report an 
increase in leases signed. and in northern New Jersey the number of 
leasing inquiries is rising. In many areas, however, the supply of 
office space still greatly exceeds demand. Opinion is divided about 
the direction of the downtown Manhattan market. Although the 
availability rate there has increased, it remains among the nation's 
lowest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial Developments
The special incentive financings offered by auto manufacturers have 
reduced car lending activity at small District banks, especially in 
August and September. Since the cost of raising funds has not 
declined recently for small District banks, they were unable to 
match the rate reductions offered by finance companies. Although 
some banks noted that lending has begun to pick up, a new round of 
incentive financing on autos is expected soon.
