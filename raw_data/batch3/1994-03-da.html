      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy expanded moderately in January and 
February. Manufacturers reported continued steady growth in orders 
and a slight pick up in employment. Business service contacts said 
activity was growing slowly and retail sales increased moderately. 
Growth of construction and real estate activity remained steady. 
Frigid weather and snowstorms in the Northeast gave a short boost to 
the energy industry although oil prices and activity have returned 
to previously low levels. Bankers said that loan growth continued to 
improve. Dry weather continued to hamper agricultural production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Freezing weather and the California earthquake caused shipping 
delays for several industries. A few contacts reported that delays 
had negatively affected sales. Passage of the NAFTA heightened talk 
of increased trade opportunities. Border contacts, however, noted 
that inadequate infrastructure was causing serious delays at border 
crossings, particularly going into Mexico. These delays impaired 
sales for some contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers reported continued steady growth in orders 
and a slight pick up in employment. Brick producers said they had 
another record sales month and prices had increased. Glass producers 
also reported strong demand and slightly higher prices. Demand fell 
slightly for primary and fabricated metal products. Homebuilding 
continued to boost demand of metal products, although cold weather 
in the Midwest and Northeast delayed some sales. Demand for energy-
related metal products, however, was reported as still in a slump. 
Lumber sales and prices were higher, and contacts were optimistic 
that demand would remain strong. Increased construction in the 
District more than offset slower lumber sales to the Northeast. 
Paper contacts said that demand remained strong and prices were 
higher. An increase in advertising boosted demand for newsprint, 
while sales of corrugated containers were reported to be the 
strongest in the nation. Demand was higher for electrical and 
electronic machinery although prices remained unchanged or lower. 
Electrical contacts still anticipate a deceleration in sales because 
they believe demand has been growing at an unsustainable rate. Cold 
weather in the east increased demand for refined products. The 
demand spurt reduced inventories and improved prices and margins, 
but contacts said overcapacity will keep the industry outlook weak. 
Despite stronger demand for all chemicals, overcapacity keeps prices 
for many ethylene-based petrochemicals low. Producers of other 
chemical products report better prices, including polystyrene, 
benzene and some polymers. Despite a normal seasonal decline in the 
rig count, the demand for oil field machinery remains stable. Sales 
were slower for food and kindred products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business services was still increasing slowly. Demand was 
growing slowly for accounting, advertising and transportation 
services. Legal contacts reported little or no growth in demand 
while temporary services continued to report the strongest activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales increased moderately. Prices were stable or lower for 
most products. Auto sales increased strongly in January but showed 
signs of slowing in February. Sales of domestic trucks, minivans and 
sports vehicles were particularly strong. Some dealers reported that 
their inventories fell below desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate activity remained steady. New home 
sales were above last year's levels for all major markets and 
contacts do not anticipate any slowing in demand for at least six 
months, Apartment occupancy rates and rents are rising. Apartment 
markets remained particularly tight in Austin and San Antonio. 
Demand for warehouse space was strong and some speculative 
warehouses were under construction. Other commercial markets were 
unchanged although contacts were more optimistic that activity would 
increase, in part because of NAFTA. Contacts said that there was a 
surplus of sales people and development managers but a shortage of 
specialized tradesmen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Frigid weather and snowstorms in the Northeast caused a light flurry 
of activity in the energy industry and boosted futures prices for 
oil and natural gas. Oil prices quickly fell back to around $14 per 
barrel, but natural gas prices are not expected to fall until 
storage tanks are refilled in the spring and summer. Oil exploration 
fell sharply in January but was partially offset by more than 
expected drilling for natural gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers said that loan growth continued to improve across the 
District. Growth in loan demand in south Texas and Houston was 
primarily for real estate. Other parts of the District had higher 
demand for all types of loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dry conditions have hampered agricultural production. Texas wheat 
condition was rated at 55 percent of normal compared with 72 percent 
last year. Livestock conditions were reported to be fair to good. 
Ranges and pastures across much of the District remained short. Hay 
supplies continued to be tight and supplemental feeding remained 
steady. The January Texas All Crops Price Index was 19.3 percent 
above a year ago but the Livestock arid Livestock Products Price 
Index fell 6.8 percent.
