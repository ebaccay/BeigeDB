      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from nearly all sectors of the Third District economy 
surveyed in June reveal little, if any, growth in recent weeks. 
Manufacturers report that both new orders and production activity 
have been virtually steady since April. Retailers say current dollar 
sales are generally running just even with the pace of last spring. 
Bankers indicate that growth in loans and deposits continues, but at 
a slower rate since May than in the first four months of the year. 
Realtors say that home sales in April and May were very sluggish but 
appear to be picking up with the recent drop in mortgage rates; 
however, commercial real estate markets are beginning to show signs 
of weakening.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus outlook for the region's economy is for stable 
conditions, at best, through the summer. Manufacturers forecast 
steady to slightly slower activity for the second half of the year, 
and they are planning cuts in employment and smaller increases in 
capital spending. Retailers expect sales in the second half to run 
even with or fall below the current pace, in real terms. Bankers 
expect slower growth in loan demand from both businesses and 
consumers and they plan to reduce commercial real estate lending as 
well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers contacted in late May and early June 
generally report that business continues to run at an even pace, as 
it has since April. Just over half of the firms surveyed indicated 
steady business as June began and the rest are evenly divided 
between those noting a pickup since May and those for whom business 
slowed. While the overall picture is one of no change, durables 
producers are experiencing a drop-off in activity while nondurables 
producers are seeing some improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms in the region have seen a leveling off in the rate of new 
orders in the past few weeks, in contrast to the steady growth they 
had been experiencing, and order backlogs are falling as shipments 
continue on an upward trend. Nevertheless, inventory reduction, 
which had been reported for several months, appears to have stalled 
in June. Despite these indications of slackening demand for 
manufactured goods, industrial firms in the region are maintaining 
employment levels, although working hours are being trimmed at some 
plants. On the price front, increases in input costs are noted by 
nearly half of the companies contacted for this report and about 
one-quarter are raising the prices of their own products. These 
indications of price increases are not quite as widespread as they 
had been earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, sentiment among Third District manufacturers is 
widely divided but, overall, slightly negative. On balance, managers 
at area plants forecast slower business during the second half of 
the year, with new orders running just steady and shipments 
declining as order backlogs are worked down. In line with their 
forecasts of reduced output, local firms plan to trim payrolls and 
working hours somewhat by year-end, and they intend to reduce 
inventories as well. Capital spending plans still call for increased 
outlays over the next six months, on balance, but compared to 
reports over the last twelve months, fewer firms are boosting 
spending and more are cutting back on plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District merchants generally report that sales in May were 
only about even with the same month a year ago, in dollar terms. 
Although women's apparel sales continue to improve, sales in most 
other lines of goods are disappointing. Discount stores are 
achieving somewhat better results than other types of stores, but 
nearly all retailers contacted in early June describe consumers as 
cautious and reluctant to step up spending. Auto dealers have seen 
sales slip despite manufacturers' incentives, and many dealers are 
cutting back on orders to the factories in an effort to keep 
inventories under control.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers expect a soft unmet, and some predict that the year-over-
year gain in unit sales for the second half will drop below the 
increase posted in the first half. For 1989 as a whole, area 
merchants are in agreement that sales will increase by only a few 
percent above 1988, in dollar terms. With expectations receding, 
retailers are trimming inventories, cutting orders, and holding the 
line on hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at major Third District banks in mid-May was 
approximately 11 percent above the year-ago level as growth eased 
from the 13 percent year-over-year gain for the first quarter. 
Lending to both businesses and consumers continues to increase, 
according to bankers contacted in early June, but they note some 
slackening in the upward pace and they expect further slowing of 
growth in these loan categories in the second half. Real estate 
lending remains fairly strong, with rising commercial construction 
loans making up for slower growth in residential mortgage lending. 
Bankers say concern for credit quality in commercial real estate is 
growing, however, as rents and occupancy rates appear to be 
declining, and they expect to cut back on commitments for commercial 
real estate financing in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit growth at major Third District banks has slipped in the past 
month, according to bankers, but not by as much as asset growth has, 
so bankers generally do not express concern about gathering funds. 
Demand deposits declined for most banks in May, and bankers 
attribute this to consumers shifting to interest-bearing accounts in 
response to the first quarter increase in interest rates and to 
increased use of cash management services by corporate customers. 
Time deposit growth is described as healthy. Several banks are 
promoting certificates of deposit, especially in 9-month to 2-year 
maturities, and they are gaining significant deposits with rates of 
up to 10 percent for the 2-year term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most areas of the Third District, realtors say sales of 
residential properties are running well below last year's pace and 
price appreciation is only marginal. The usual spring upturn in 
sales did not materialize this year, according to realtors surveyed 
in early June, but some note signs of a pickup with the recent drop 
in mortgage rates. Nevertheless, some realtors say sales will not 
regain much strength because would-be first-time home buyers are 
hampered by an inability to make the typical 20 percent downpayment, 
despite having incomes that would qualify them for substantial 
monthly payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate in the Third District is also showing some 
signs of softness. Office occupancy rates remain fairly healthy in 
the Philadelphia central business district, according to realtors, 
but plans for several major new buildings have been postponed. In 
the suburbs, vacancy rates are rising for both office and retail 
space, but construction has not slowed significantly. Industrial 
construction contracts awarded since April have fallen below the 
first quarter rate, according to builders, but remain above the 
value of contracts let during the spring of last year.
