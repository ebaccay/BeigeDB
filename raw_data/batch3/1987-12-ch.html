      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity continues to expand in the District with few signs 
of significant effects on aggregate activity from the stock market 
crash. Employment has been trending upward. Apart from autos, 
industrial activity generally is rising. Nonauto consumer spending 
appears to be holding up well, overall, though reports are mixed. 
Capital spending is expanding in a number of industries. Sales of 
basic industrial supplies have strengthened. Machine tool orders 
have picked up recently. Lead times have lengthened considerably, 
and prices of industrial materials and intermediate products 
continued to press upward after the stock market crash. Building 
contracts in District states have risen this year, in contrast with 
a decline in the nation. District farmland values rose for the third 
consecutive quarter in the July-September period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Effects of the Stock Price Drop
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District contacts indicate that effects of the stock 
price drop, so far, are limited. Some retailers saw a slowdown in 
sales beginning October 19, but only for a couple of days. A few 
real estate transactions were cancelled shortly after October 19, 
and inquiries about selling homes rose from some worried 
participants in Chicago's financial exchanges (though few appear to 
have listed their homes as a result). The possibility was noted by 
our sources that sizable cuts in consumer or capital spending could 
still take place, leading to inventory adjustments and a more 
general slowing of activity, but they see no evidence that this is 
occurring. A contact at a large retailer, who has seen no sustained 
adverse effects on the firm's sales, suggests that, contrary to the 
recent trend to lower forecasts, projections for activity should be 
raised in view of the fall in interest rates and the dollar since 
October 19, and ample liquidity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Managers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Chicago-area purchasing managers reported that orders, backlogs, and 
production continued strong in October. Vendor delivery times 
lengthened, and price increases were widespread. Milwaukee 
purchasing managers indicated that lead times have lengthened 
considerably, resulting in a slower rate of rise in production and 
drawdowns of inventories of some materials. Orders and backlogs 
continue to increase. The lower dollar has sharply boosted exports. 
Buyers are concerned about the threat of higher inflation at the 
finished goods level from continued increases in prices of basic 
industrial inputs "across the board." Firms are still cautious about 
capital spending commitments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      One source describes metals producers as on a "capital spending 
spree" for process improvement. Their more efficient plants are 
operating at or near capacity. Glass and paper makers are also 
investing in new equipment, and some cement makers are building new 
plants. Japanese motor vehicle and parts manufacturers are investing 
in numerous plants in the U.S., and additional spending is thought 
likely due to the dollar's further fall over the past month. There 
are no signs that the fall in stock prices is leading to delays or 
cutbacks in capital spending projects already underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate sales are slow, and few loan applications 
are "in the pipeline." Rates quoted in the Chicago area for 30-year 
fixed-rate home mortgage loans have fallen from around 12 percent a 
month ago to 10.5 percent, with a few lenders at 10.25 percent. Loan 
applications are typically low at this time of year, but may also be 
held down in part by hopes that rates will fall further or by 
households' responses to the drop in stock prices. In contrast, a 
commercial mortgage banker reports that applications increased 
following the recent drop in mortgage interest rates; lower rates 
are viewed as a window of opportunity for refinancings and new 
projects. Residential construction contracts (in square feet of 
floor space) in the first nine months of 1987 were up 8 percent from 
last year in District states, compared to down 8 percent in the 
nation. Year-to-date mobile home production in District states 
(mainly Indiana) was 2 percent above last year, in contrast with 5 
percent lower for the U.S. Contracts for nonresidential buildings 
were 14 percent higher in the District and flat in the U.S. A large 
Chicago-area supplier of ready-mix concrete expects shipments in 
1988 to be at a good level but less than this year, mainly 
reflecting cuts in office buildings and other commercial structures. 
Numerous projects are in the planning stage. Public works and 
highway construction will be strong in 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Slow car sales are leading to further production cuts. Three 
Michigan assembly plants will be shutdown for 1-3 weeks in January 
with two of these plants then reopening at reduced line speeds. In 
part, the auto production cuts reflect the shift in consumer 
preferences toward small trucks, including vans, and the continued 
strength of imported carsâ€”both truck and imported car sales in 
October were highest ever for the month. Sources in Michigan remain 
concerned that announced auto production plans are too optimistic 
and that further cuts will be needed, adversely affecting suppliers 
and communities in that area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A diversified maker of consumer and industrial products reported 
that sales remained strong in October, with no weakening in any of 
its lines. Steel production at Chicago and Detroit area mills has 
continued to rise in recent weeks. Demand is relatively strong for 
gypsum board and cement in District states. Gypsum board pricing may 
have stabilized after a drop earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent cool weather has boosted sales of apparel. In the view of one 
retailer, the outlook is favorable for Christmas. Inventories of 
nonauto consumer durables and many non-durables are low and unlikely 
to pose problems for merchants. However, sharp increases in prices 
on imported women's apparel have led to cuts in consumer spending 
and extra promotional efforts by retailers to sell excess 
inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our latest survey of agricultural banks indicated that District 
farmland values, on average, rose more than 3 percent in the third 
quarter, the third consecutive quarterly rise since the downtrend 
ended in late 1986. Among District states, the third quarter trend 
in farmland values ranged from no change in Michigan to a rise of 
nearly 5.5 percent in Iowa. A large proportion of the surveyed 
bankers noted that demand to acquire farmland is up from a year ago, 
both among farmers and nonfarmer investors. However, there has been 
no apparent pickup in foreign investor interest in U.S. farmland.
