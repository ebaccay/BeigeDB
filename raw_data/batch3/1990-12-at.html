      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most business contacts report that activity weakened in October and 
November from earlier this year, with real sales revenues even with 
or lower than at this time last year. Manufacturers producing for 
domestic consumption indicate declining orders relative to this time 
last year, and are cutting production and shrinking employment as a 
consequence. On a more positive note, orders for defense-related 
goods and exports are said to be increasing, thus supporting 
production and limiting the overall employment drop. Businesses 
report only limited cost pass-through of oil-related price increases 
and an easing of previous labor shortages for selected occupations. 
Retailers generally report poor sales; they are increasingly 
pessimistic concerning the outlook for the holiday season. Our 
business contacts almost universally note an erosion of consumer 
confidence. Reports from bankers mirror those of our manufacturing 
and retail contacts, indicating weaker consumer spending and more 
cautious borrowing behavior in October and early November than in 
previous months. In the construction sector, contacts report that 
the level of overall activity declined in October as compared to 
earlier this year or to last October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The consumer spending slowdown is said to be rippling through the 
manufacturing sector with widespread reports of declining orders and 
employee layoffs. As orders fall, apparel producers say they are 
attempting to reduce inventory risk by placing orders for fabrics 
only after they receive firm orders from retailers. A producer of 
children's clothing, who claims his sales are usually recession-
proof, reports November orders are off by one-fourth compared to 
last year. Likewise, producers of shirts and hosiery report falling 
orders and continuing layoffs. A heavy equipment manufacturer 
reportedly will close a plant in November and more temporary 
shutdowns at auto assembly plants were announced this month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Positive developments within manufacturing are noted by producers of 
defense products in Georgia and Alabama. An executive a: a major 
utility reported that energy use was up 5 percent on average in 
October from a year earlier in the metals, paper, chemicals, and 
auto parts industries. Except for metals, export markets for these 
products are reportedly strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight costs are being affected by higher oil prices, though 
transportation companies say the economic environment is limiting 
their attempts to fully pass-through fuel cost increases. The cost 
of producing petroleum-derivative commodities such as styrofoam 
packaging materials, chemicals, and fertilizers is also up and in 
varying degree is being passed on to customers. Utility company 
executives report that prices of domestically-produced alternative 
fuels such as coal and natural gas are remaining stable, limiting 
the impact of higher-priced oil. In labor markets, scattered reports 
indicate both an easing of the nurse shortage because the economic 
slowing is causing some local labor force reentry and growth in the 
pool of available skilled and professional workers. The recent call-
up of reserves is reported to be having no significant impact yet on 
labor availability.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers and other business contacts generally used increasingly 
pessimistic terms to describe consumer spending. Most expect that 
real sales this holiday season will be down in Florida and Georgia, 
and only flat or up slightly elsewhere in the region relative to 
last year. Uncertainties about energy prices and the future of the 
economy are reported to continue their impact on consumer confidence 
and to limit buying of cars and other durable goods. In Florida, 
consumer confidence, as measured by a University of Florida survey, 
plummeted in October to the lowest level recorded in the survey's 
six year history. In Atlanta, a similar poll taken in mid-November 
by a private organization suggests holiday spending will be down 
this year compared to 1989. This poll also found that consumers are 
increasingly reluctant to make car or major appliance purchases as 
compared to sentiments expressed in August. Merchants elsewhere in 
the region also point to eroding consumer confidence and falling 
discretionary income as factors limiting consumer spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers are generally comfortable with inventory and employment 
levels that are about even with those at this time last year. Some 
merchants are taking advantage of contract opportunities to reduce 
orders, particularly for durable goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from bankers and other lenders across the region minor 
retailers' reports that consumer spending is slowing, with several 
contacts saying that consumer loan growth has weakened appreciably 
since summer. Lenders generally say they are even more concerned 
with deteriorating loan quality now than earlier this year. They 
indicate that weak economic growth, tighter regulatory scrutiny, and 
overbuilt real estate markets have caused them to apply credit 
standards more diligently to all types of lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall construction and absorption is reported to remain weak 
across the District. A contact in New Orleans says that real estate 
remains dormant there, and contacts in Atlanta say home sales are 
flat-to-down compared to last November. In Florida, a building 
materials producer reports that company sales in November were 
running 10-20 percent below expectations, and that a rebound is not 
expected in Florida until 1992. Florida and Georgia utility company 
executives note that monthly year-over-year rates of commercial and 
residential customer connections have been declining this year.
