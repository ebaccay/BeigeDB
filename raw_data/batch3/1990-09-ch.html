      Beige Book Report: Chicago

       September 19, 1990
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Midwest were somewhat uneven in August, 
but most of the District's economy continued on the slow growth path 
reported in recent months. Consumer spending in the District 
generally showed modest growth, except in Michigan. Purchasing 
manager surveys around the District gave mixed signals, but 
anecdotal evidence indicated slow expansion in the manufacturing 
sector. Construction and real estate activity slowed, but remained 
healthier in the Midwest than in the nation as a whole. While most 
large banks have not changed lending standards, some District loan 
officers reported a slight tightening, citing a less favorable 
economic outlook. District reports indicated no acceleration in the 
overall inflation rate since the recent rise in the price of oil. 
Crop conditions continued to be favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending growth in the District has been modest but stable 
in recent weeks, although local surveys conducted after the Middle 
East crisis showed sharp declines in consumer confidence. A 
spokesman for a department store chain reported "below-plan" 
national sales growth in recent months, but noted that growth in the 
Midwest remained intact during the summer. A representative of a 
discount chain stated that sales of back-to-school items were "very 
good," but overall sales in the Midwest were weak relative to other 
regions, in part due to unseasonably cool weather limiting sales of 
fans and air conditioners. An analyst for a general merchandise 
chain reported that August sales, after being down in the first week 
of the month, increased over the year-earlier period. District sales 
were mixed for this chain, however, with strength in some Midwestern 
markets partially offset by significant weakness in those areas of 
Michigan and Indiana linked to the auto industry. Results of several 
independent surveys in August, however, showed sharp declines in 
consumer confidence around the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales nationally were little changed in August from recent 
months, with sources indicating that the Middle East situation has 
not yet influenced sales. One Midwest dealers' association executive 
noted that orders for larger cars have not yet been cancelled. A 
District import car distributor experienced record July sales and 
reported that August sales were on track to be the best single month 
in the history of the distributorship. However, a domestic automaker 
estimated car sales in the remainder of 1990 could drop roughly 
500,000 units (saar) below previous estimates, if oil prices 
stabilize in the neighborhood of $25 per barrel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District generally continued to expand 
at a slow pace in recent weeks, although some soft spots exist. An 
auto economist reported production in the summer months to be 
slightly above normal, due to model changeovers taking place earlier 
in the year than normal. Downward revisions in production schedules 
over the remainder of the year will be resisted, in the hope of 
addressing union concerns about job security. A supplier of truck 
engines reported that sales softened in late July and early August, 
however, and truck producers recently lowered their 1990 sales 
estimates, citing the absence of a previously anticipated increase 
in demand for trucks produced prior to the introduction of new fuel 
efficiency standards for 1991 models. A steel economist reported 
full order books for the third quarter, and stated that fourth 
quarter bookings were doing "quite well." A major capital goods 
producer reported little change in July shipment growth from the 
steady growth experienced in earlier months, and new orders 
continued their slow upward trend. A producer of electronic and 
computer components, however, reported lower domestic sales growth 
than expected, which was attributed primarily to a slowdown in the 
development of new technology rather than to a fundamental shift in 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing manager surveys in the District showed mixed results for 
August, continuing an uneven pattern. On a seasonally adjusted 
basis, the Chicago index showed conditions improving slightly in 
August, led by production, new orders, and prices. The Milwaukee 
report was mixed, but indicated new strength in the new orders 
component. The Detroit index in August showed its sharpest drop 
since November 1987, with both the automotive and non-automotive 
sector indexes showing contraction. On balance, however, recent 
District activity has been relatively stronger than that reported in 
the national survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District construction and real estate activity slowed somewhat in 
recent weeks, but continue to fare well relative to the national 
trend. A supplier of gypsum board reported that Midwest residential 
and non-residential contract awards (in floor area) posted solid 
gains year-to-date (through July) in 1990, while awards declined 
nationally. A cement producer reported that industry shipments in 
the Great Lakes region grew on a year-over-year basis in the first 
half of the year, and that the firm's Chicago-area backlog in early 
August increased significantly from both a month earlier and a year 
earlier. However, a District service firm involved in the early 
construction process reported recent new building activity in 
several major metropolitan areas of the District has "slowed to a 
trickle."
     </p>
     <p>
      Area housing sales grew in July, compared to a national decline. The 
Midwestern market remains one of the "healthiest in the nation," 
according to a District realtor. However, this contact reported 
softening overall housing sales in recent weeks, citing a recent 
rise in mortgage rates, increased uncertainty generated by the 
Middle Eastern crisis, and a slowdown in company transfers. The 
Detroit market was reported to be running below last year's pace in 
the first half of the year, and slowed further recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While lending standards at several large District commercial banks 
have changed little in recent weeks, their loan officers cited some 
tightening in selected sectors. Several loan officers told of 
tighter standards for middle market commercial and industrial 
customers, while one reported stricter standards for both large and 
small firms. Stricter standards were generally attributed to a less 
favorable economic outlook, but one contact cited stress on the 
bank's capital position. Tightening occurred most often in the form 
of stricter covenants and collateral requirements. To the extent 
that tightening has occurred, standards for construction, land 
development, and other commercial real estate loans have been 
tightened somewhat more than for commercial and industrial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite the recent rise in the price of oil, several District 
contacts reported downward pressures on the prices of a variety of 
goods. An analyst with a major retail chain reported that pre-
Christmas type discounting by competitors is already beginning to 
occur.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although housing prices are holding up relatively well in the 
Midwest, the rate of increase has slowed substantially in recent 
months. On the manufacturing side, the price component of the 
Chicago purchasing manager survey indicated more respondents paying 
increased prices in August than in July, although the trend was 
basically unchanged from that in June and July. One District 
manufacturer of heavy moving equipment reported prices declining in 
the face of weaker demand. Crop prices have fallen in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Midwest crop conditions appear favorable. A high proportion of the 
corn and soybean acreage is rated good-to-excellent in District 
states. Recent warm temperatures are believed to have added somewhat 
to the harvest potential and eased concerns about an early frost on 
this year's late maturing crops. Crop prices, especially for corn, 
have retreated considerably in recent weeks as export prospects have 
deteriorated and the forthcoming harvest promises adequate (but 
still relatively tight) supplies for the year ahead. The declining 
corn export prospects reflect a large world wheat harvest this year 
and the likelihood that wheat will displace some corn in livestock 
feeding rations.
