     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Regional growth slackened a bit over the past six weeks as the 
housing sector responded to higher interest rates. Home builders 
reported lackluster sales, and the sales rate of existing homes fell 
in many areas. In addition, the rate of absorption slowed in the 
commercial office markets. Payroll employment expanded, but only 
moderately, as corporate mergers and restructurings partly offset 
some of the gains. Unemployment rates bounced up in June following a 
very sharp decline in May. Although seasonal adjustment problems may 
have affected the data, the general downward trend probably remains 
intact. Retail sales were mixed. Inexpensive chains and discounters 
reported moderate to strong year-over-year gains. and motor vehicle
sales were moderately strong, but general department stores reported 
small increases that were well below their expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported mixed sales results in June and the first two 
weeks of July. General department stores chalked up disappointing 
12-month gains of 0.5 to 5 percent. However, inexpensive department 
stores, discounters, and variety stores reported gains in the range 
of 7 to 10 percent in the Second District, better than their results 
in the rest of the nation. Managers at these stores commented that 
sales were good across the spectrum of men's, women's, and 
children's apparel, small and large appliances, and electric goods. 
The general department stores noted increased difficulty moving 
apparel, some unwanted inventory accumulation, and the consequent 
need for markdowns and sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Motor vehicle dealers reported strong demand -- unit sales ran about 
5 percent above year ago levels -- in June and early July. Dealers 
reported that the effects of higher interest rates were blunted by 
double-digit gains in leasing. Inventories of cars were slightly 
higher than desired, but supplies of light trucks were reportedly 
quite short.
     </p>
     <p>
      In New York City, tourism has picked up, driven by special events 
and foreign tourists attracted by favorable exchange rates, although 
the critical convention business remains weak. Hotels report 
climbing occupancy rates, well above year ago levels, and 
attractions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Empire 
State Building boast of long waiting lines and strong growth in 
admissions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates rose slightly in June to 7.0 percent in New York 
State and 7.1 percent in New Jersey following unsustainably large 
declines in May. In recent weeks, mergers, acquisitions and 
restructurings were announced for two retail chains which number 
among the nation's largest, two of the metropolitan area's largest 
thrifts, several smaller retail chains and thrifts, and a major 
pharmaceutical manufacturer. While the staff reductions following 
these changes have yet to be fully implemented, corporate changes 
earlier this year restrained the district's payroll employment 
growth to a 1.4 percent annual gain during the January - May period, 
and the future appears to hold similar constraints.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although there are isolated spots of strength, in general builders 
noted that momentum in new home sales dropped in June and early 
July. Prospective buyer traffic is definitely down and builders 
expect demand to be flat at best through the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rising interest rates are blamed for the softening of demand, but 
builders feel besieged on the supply side as well. Complaints about 
rising lumber prices have broadened to include price increases for a 
wide array of building materials. However, builders also noted that 
in most cases these were the first price increases in several years. 
Acquisition and development loans also remain difficult to obtain.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leasing activity slowed and office vacancy rates eked out only minor 
improvements in June. Earlier this year, the pace of absorption had 
been somewhat faster. In midtown Manhattan, the vacancy rate for 
prime commercial office space now hovers around 13.9 percent--well 
below the rate for most of the nation's central business districts. 
Vacancy rates for prime office space in most suburban areas in the 
Second District, including Long Island and Fairfield County, also 
show marked improvement compared to both year-ago levels and the 
prior quarter. Corporate restructuring and some deceleration in the 
volume of relocations have stymied improvements in the Westchester 
and Northern New Jersey office markets; however, vacancy rates in 
these suburbs rose slightly from March to June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      About one-third of the senior loan officers surveyed at small and 
midsized banks in the District reported stronger loan demand, while 
fewer than 20 percent reported weaker demand. Consumer loans showed 
the most strength with more than half of the respondents reporting 
increased demand. Residential mortgage and refinancing activities 
remained weak. In general, loan rates have continued to increase. 
Nearly three-quarters of the banks reported higher rates, though a 
few reported lower business loan rates. Fewer banks raised their 
rates on consumer loans than on any other type of loans, as was the 
case in the last survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      While three-quarters of banks surveyed reported no change in their 
willingness to lend, one-quarter did report an increase. In general, 
credit standards have not changed, and more than 90 percent of the 
banks surveyed reported stable or lower delinquency rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Approximately two-thirds of the respondents reported that deposit 
rates moved higher, and that the spread between the average lending 
rate and deposit rate was stable or narrowed.
