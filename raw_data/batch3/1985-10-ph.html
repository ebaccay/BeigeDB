      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District in early October are 
substantially the same as they were in September. The pace of 
manufacturing activity has not changed significantly since late 
summer and loan growth at commercial banks has been nearly flat. The 
housing and retail sectors remain buoyant although a major newspaper 
strike in Philadelphia may restrain retail sales in the city and its 
suburbs this month.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prevailing outlook among businesses in the Third District is 
positive. Manufacturers foresee improving business conditions and 
bankers expect increased commercial borrowing in the fourth quarter; 
some report a pickup in loan approvals already. Retailers are 
generally pleased with recent sales experience although some are 
becoming apprehensive about the effect on future sales of growing 
consumer debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of industrial activity in the Third District in October is 
about the same as it was in September, according to the latest 
Business Outlook Survey. This marks the seventh time in the last 10 
months that the majority of firms responding to the survey have 
reported no change in the rate of their production. Conditions 
appear to be about the same for both durable and nondurable goods 
producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to particular measures of current manufacturing 
activity, survey respondents indicate fractional increases in new 
orders and shipments but slight declines in unfilled orders and 
employment. Industrial prices in the District are stable; the 
majority of survey respondents report no changes in the prices of 
either raw materials or the products they manufacture.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, Third District manufacturers remain optimistic in their 
outlook for the next six months. Forty-three percent of the October 
survey respondents expect business conditions to improve over the 
next two quarters while only 22 percent anticipate a worsening 
climate. Expectations vary across industries, however. Durable goods 
manufacturers do not foresee as much improvement as do makers of 
nondurables. For the manufacturing sector as a whole in the Third 
District, participants in the October survey forecast moderate gains 
in new orders and shipments, and a slight increase in capital 
spending; but they anticipate a marginal decline in payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The improvement in retail trade in the Third District that began in 
the late summer appears to be continuing in early October. Store 
officials are sticking with their earlier prediction of a year-over-
year increase of approximately 8 percent in third-quarter sales. The 
back-to-school selling season was generally in accordance with 
expectations and all lines of merchandise shared in healthy sales 
during September and early October. Looking ahead, retailers cite 
the growing burden of consumer debt and a shorter holiday shopping 
season this year as factors that might limit fourth-quarter sales, 
although they expect total sales for 1985 to top 1984 levels by as 
much as 10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      A matter of concern to Philadelphia area retailers is a strike which 
has kept the city's two largest newspapers out of circulation since 
September 7. Although it is too early to quantify the impact of the 
strike on the retail sector, Chamber of Commerce representatives say 
that many specialty and department stores in the newspapers' 
circulation areas are experiencing lagging business which they 
attribute to the loss of these major advertising mediums.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at major Third District banks in late September is 
virtually unchanged from its level in August. Commercial and 
industrial loan amounts outstanding in September, while 18 percent 
above a year ago, are substantially the same as in August. However, 
some bank commercial lending officers say that the number of loans 
approved in recent weeks has increased and a rise in outstandings 
will follow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer loan volume in late September is also 18 percent above its 
level in September 1984 but has fallen slightly from August. Some 
Third District bankers say that demand for consumer credit at banks 
may have slackened in recent weeks because consumers are now 
becoming reluctant to increase their installment debt burden 
substantially. Moreover, those households that are borrowing to 
finance automobile purchases are taking advantage of the incentive 
financing offered by the manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate lending by commercial banks is increasing after a summer 
lull, outstanding loans are now rising toward their September 1984 
levels. Mortgage lenders report continued strong demand for fixed-
rate mortgages at the current interest rate of 12 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local bank economists expect economic growth to accelerate in the 
fourth quarter, bringing greater demand for credit, especially from 
the commercial and industrial sectors. Predicting a less 
accommodating stance from the Fed, they have raised their interest 
rate forecasts. The prevailing view is that the federal funds rate 
will be near 9 percent and long-term Treasury bonds over 11.5 
percent by year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand deposits at major Third District banks are up approximately 
13 percent from a year ago, little changed from the year-over-year 
increase experienced since June. Nontransactions deposits exhibit a 
similar pattern. Bank asset/liability managers in the District say 
that they have been able to meet targeted levels of time deposits in 
recent weeks without aggressive pricing.
