      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity is mixed across the Twelfth District. Economic 
recovery continues to elude California, while intermountain areas 
expand. In California, weakness continues to be reported in a broad 
range of sectors--including aerospace and defense-related 
manufacturing, trade, construction, finance, and government. Some 
strength is reported, however, in California's motion picture and 
nondurable manufacturing sectors. Sluggish conditions also are 
reported in western Washington, affected by retrenchment in 
aerospace, and Hawaii, undergoing a slump in the visitor industry. 
In contrast, conditions are stronger in eastern Washington, Utah, 
Idaho, and Nevada.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders is little changed 
from our July report. About half of the respondents expect the real 
economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate at or 
above trend growth. This proportion is about the same as in July and 
June, but is down from two-thirds in April and three-quarters in 
March. Most other respondents expect the economy to expand, but at a 
rate below trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many respondents expect the recent federal budget agreement to have 
short-run negative effects on their regions and industries. Defense 
cuts reportedly will hurt manufacturing in California; higher tax 
rates are expected to affect small business owners, farmers, and 
individuals in high-income states such as California and Hawaii; and 
residents in areas with tong driving distance are concerned about 
the effects of higher fuel taxes. Businesses and consumers are 
reportedly cautious due to the tax changes, and some hiring 
decisions also are being delayed due to uncertainty about health 
reform.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity varies widely across the District, and reflects the 
underlying regional economic strength. Low interest rates are 
reported to have had only a limited effect on purchasing decisions. 
In both northern and southern California, retail sales are flat and 
consumer confidence is reported down due to continued job losses. 
Retail sales in western Washington also are reported slow due to 
concern over the regional economy. In contrast, sales in eastern 
Washington have continued strong for more than a year and consumer 
confidence has remained high. Consumer confidence remains very 
strong in Utah and Idaho, with retail sales reported up nearly 10 
percent during the first halt of 1993 from a year earlier, and auto 
sales reported strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in service-related industries are mixed. Idaho and Utah 
are having record years in tourism. In contrast, the Hawaii visitor 
industry has slumped--affected by recessions in both California and 
Japan. During the first half of 1993, visitor totals in Hawaii hit a 
five-year low. In California, business services have strengthened 
recently, particularly in Orange County. Furthermore, the motion 
picture industry in Los Angeles is growing at a double-digit pace, 
and summer box-office revenues are at record levels. Local 
governments in California are suffering budget shortfalls and in 
parts of southern California they are asking for major wage 
concessions from public employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is mixed in the District, with weakness 
centered in aerospace and defense-related industries. In Washington, 
Boeing currently is cutting production of several aircraft models. 
Furthermore, concern is reported for future production levels at the 
company due to uncertainty about foreign orders. One contact with a 
smaller aerospace components firm expects that its current backlog 
of orders will fall 50 percent by 1994. California defense firms 
continue to shrink due to cutbacks and restructuring in defense and 
aerospace. Southern Arizona, however, is benefiting from a shift of 
aerospace production activity from California.
     </p>
     <p>
      A few manufacturing industries show signs of improvement. In 
California, orders and sales have risen in the semiconductor 
industry, but the increased demand has yet to translate into higher 
employment. Contacts also report strength in California textiles, 
apparel, and fruit and vegetable production. Strength outside of 
California includes electronics in Oregon and Idaho, and 
construction equipment in Utah.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts report a generally favorable outlook for agriculture. 
In California, most vegetable crops are reported to be in good 
condition. Tree fruit yields are high, but sales are slow and prices 
are low. In contrast, tomato yields are off but prices are reported 
very good. Cattle prices are rebounding from summer lows, demand is 
good, and export volume is expected to rise. Lumber prices are 
reported up 30 percent from a year earlier. A contact from Nevada 
reports that new mines are opening due to higher gold prices; higher 
fuel taxes, however, will increase delivery and transportation costs 
from remote locations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District construction and real estate markets are mixed. In 
California, despite low interest rates, single-family home sales are 
little changed from their year-earlier levels. In Hawaii, sales of 
existing homes are down 18 percent from a year earlier. The median 
sales price in Honolulu, however, stands at $358,000, up 5.6 percent 
from a year earlier and the highest in the nation. In Oregon, 
immigration from California and low interest rates are reported to 
have stimulated housing construction, and apartment market 
conditions are reported tight with vacancy rates less than 4 
percent. In Washington, downtown office vacancy rates have 
stabilized, but no major new demand or construction is reported 
except by owner/users. Reflecting at least in part a shift in 
aerospace production, the Tucson housing market is booming both in 
new construction and sales of existing homes. Idaho and Utah 
construction and real estate markets remain strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Varied conditions are reported across District financial markets. In 
California, contacts report condition in the banking industry as 
showing modest signs of improvement; outstanding loan volume 
continues to decline, but at a slower pace than has been seen in 
recent months, while some measures of asset quality are improving. 
One contact, however, reports that banks continue to be restrictive 
in providing financing to small businesses throughout California. In 
Oregon, banking conditions are reported good in part due to strong 
construction and mortgage lending in the Portland area. Contacts in 
Utah report strong bank earnings for the first half of 1993 and 
improvement in balance sheets at most financial institutions.
