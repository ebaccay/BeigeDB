      <strong>
       June 23, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Disparate economic conditions continue in the Twelfth District with 
the weakest performance reported in California. Contacts in most 
other District states are reporting expanding economic activity. In 
California, manufacturing activity continues to slump, construction 
and real estate markets remain weak, and retail sales and financial 
activity are flat. Weakness in aerospace also has dampened growth in 
western Washington. Outside of these regions, growth is reported in 
several sectors, with overall conditions strongest in eastern 
Washington, Utah, and Idaho. Overall business sentiment has 
deteriorated since early 1993, with most contacts expecting 
continued slow growth. Contacts report that uncertainty regarding 
several federal policies is delaying business investment and hiring 
decisions. Agricultural conditions are generally favorable, although 
recent wet, cool weather is harming several fruit and vegetable 
crops in California and Oregon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders has deteriorated 
since the first quarter of 1993. Less than half of the respondents 
now expect the real economy to expand during the next four quarters 
at a rate of at least 2.5 percent. This proportion is down from two-
thirds in April and three-quarters in March. The majority of our 
respondents expect the economy to expand, but at a rate less than 
2.5 percent. In general, contacts from Idaho, Oregon, and Utah 
expect their regions to perform better than the national average. 
Most contacts in California and Washington, however, expect their 
regions to underperform the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A national retailer reports that, while May was the best month of 
the year, sales at the beginning of June were sluggish and 
conditions in California remain flat. A national grocery retailer 
reports that consumers remain cautious and that California food 
sales are down, with club stores continuing to take business from 
grocery chains. A contact from California reports continued subpar 
consumer spending and continued corporate restructuring in retail 
trade. In contrast, a contact in telecommunications in California 
reports a slight pickup in demand during the past few months 
compared to the fourth quarter of 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are showing strength in certain markets. In the Puget 
Sound area, sales of domestic autos in May were reported up 8 
percent over a year earlier and import sales were reported up 12 
percent. Auto sales were also reported strong by contacts in 
Arizona, Idaho, and Utah.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is mixed in the District, with weakness 
centered in aerospace and defense-related industries. In Washington, 
aerospace employment is down due to cutbacks at Boeing. A contact 
from California reports that manufacturing remains in a serious 
slump, with aerospace hardest hit and primary and fabricated metals 
manufacturing activity also down. Overall activity in high-tech 
electronics also is down in California, except for selected computer 
products such as laptops which are experiencing strong demand. In 
Oregon, however, electronics production remains strong, and in Utah 
manufacturing activity is expanding in a diverse set of products 
including auto airbags, medical devices, sports equipment, and 
computer software. Railroad freight traffic is improving in western 
states, and is projected to be up 3.1 percent in the second quarter 
from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several contacts are reporting that uncertainty regarding federal 
tax and spending policies is delaying business investment and hiring 
plans. In Oregon, a contact reports that a number of projects 
expected to go into construction in the second half of the year are 
in jeopardy. The ongoing discussion regarding health care reform 
reportedly also is delaying investment in pharmaceutical and bio-
tech industries. Finally, uncertainty regarding trade policy is of 
concern for importers, and also is reported to have delayed some 
investment decisions. Trade policy towards China (now temporarily 
resolved) is reported especially important to the Washington 
economy, where new airplane orders from Chinese airlines to Boeing 
in part have made up for cancellations from domestic airlines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While most contacts report a generally good outlook for agriculture, 
the recent wet, cool weather is harming many crops. Field and 
vegetable crops are showing below normal growth, tree crops are 
tending to be light to normal, and mold and mildew are showing up on 
some fruit and grape crops. Contacts report generally good livestock 
conditions. The outlook for seafood, however, is reported poor and 
grain exports are reported slowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District real estate and construction markets show widely disparate 
conditions, with the weakest performance reported in southern 
California. A contact from the region reports that residential 
prices have fallen 10 to 40 percent in the last 2 years, depending 
on the market. Another contact reports that commercial real estate 
values in southern California continue to decline, with vacancy 
rates high and little building. A contact from northern California 
reports that while commercial real estate conditions remain slow 
with few sales, rents have stabilized. Other regions are showing 
strength. Conditions in Arizona are reported firm, with commercial 
rents increasing slightly and home sales strong. Housing markets in 
eastern Washington, Utah, and Idaho are reported to be very strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mixed conditions are reported across District financial markets. 
Contacts in California report continued weakness in loan demand. A 
contact from Arizona reports a general reluctance to borrow, and a 
lack of good lending opportunities. Utah banking continues strong, 
with slightly heavier demand for commercial loans. Loan demand in 
Hawaii is reported soft except for home loans. A shortage of 
insurance for real estate, however, is reported because of Hurricane 
Iniki.
