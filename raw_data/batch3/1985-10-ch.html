      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity in the Seventh District continues to lag the 
nation, with Illinois and Iowa, the leading agricultural states, 
particularly weak. Total employment in District states has risen 
more slowly than in the U.S. over the past twelve months, and since 
the turn of the year. Manufacturing employment has fallen more 
sharply in this region since the January peak than in the nation. 
Production of autos and light trucks, the only strong segments of 
manufacturing in the region, will do well to hold at current levels 
after the turn of the year. Chain store sales are somewhat improved, 
but still disappointing. Construction backlogs indicate that 
spending will stay near this year's much improved levels into 1986. 
Office overbuilding and uncertainties related to possible tax 
changes overhang these markets. Steel and most lines of mechanical 
capital goods remain depressed. Prices in most wholesale markets are 
under downward pressure. Inventories are generally low. So far, the 
decline in the dollar has not significantly increased demand for the 
region's manufactured goods, but analysts believe that a further 
significant decline will have the desired effect. District 
agriculture continues under severe financial stress. Large harvests 
will keep farm prices down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Job markets in the District remain weak. In August, nonfarm payroll 
employment in the five-state region was 1.9 percent above last year, 
compared with a 3.3 percent rise for the nation. Illinois was up 
less than one percent and Iowa was down slightly. Manufacturing 
employment has declined, particularly in Illinois, Iowa, and 
Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unsustainable surge in auto deliveries from mid-August through 
early October, mainly in response to cut-rate financing, largely 
eliminated the overhang of 1985 models. Production plans remain 
strong through year-end. Major automakers have extended less 
generous programs of below-market financing into November. Analysts 
expect very competitive markets for motor vehicles over the next 
several years, with imports and domestic production of foreign 
producers taking a larger share of the U.S. market. The decline in 
the value of the dollar since February has somewhat reduced but far 
from eliminated the foreign producers' cost advantage. Sales of 
medium- and heavy-duty trucks have softened, and are expected to be 
down next year. Mediums have held up this year better than heavies. 
Several producers are scheduling 5.6% reductions in output for 
October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers of steel continue to operate at unprofitable levels. The 
District's share of U.S. output has climbed somewhat in recent 
months. OECD exporters to this country are adhering to restraint 
agreements, but some others are not. Prices remain weak. Rising 
investment by steel producers is to cut costs, improve quality, and 
meet demand for particular types of steel, not to add to overall 
capacity. Strongest markets for steel include autos, appliances, 
office furniture, building components, and store fixtures. Most 
lines of machinery remain weak. A larger share of steel is moving 
through service centers, which aids user efforts to keep inventories 
low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for most types of heavy capital equipment, including those 
important in the Seventh District, remains weak. Railcar orders are 
low, though orders for auto carrying cars have increased. The farm 
equipment market is dismal, and more layoffs of production workers 
have recently been announced. Machine tool demand has improved, 
particularly from auto makers and the defense industry, but remains 
far below good levels reached in the l970s. Sales of pumps, widely 
used in numerous industries, have increased from recession levels 
but remain well below the 1981 peak, and have flattened in recent 
months. A substantial further fall in the dollar's value in foreign 
currency markets is estimated to be needed to provide much help to 
makers of many lines of machinery. However, the rise in the Japanese 
yen reportedly has spurred interest of potential buyers in 
construction equipment of a major Seventh District producer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Office building continues vigorous in the Chicago area, particularly 
downtown and in rapidly growing suburbs, despite widespread concerns 
about overbuilding. Construction of stores and rehab work also 
remain strong. Some of this activity is believed to reflect efforts 
to grandfather projects under existing tax incentives. Backlogs 
indicate continued strength in nonresidential building well into 
1986. Activity on large projects is limited by availability of 
skilled workers and capacity to pour ready-mix, reduced during the 
last recession. District-wide, nonresidential building contracts 
this year have continued to recover from their 1982 low, but remain 
well short of peaks reached in the late 1970s. Highway work is at 
high levels in District states. Contract lettings in Illinois 
earlier this year were the largest ever.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home and apartment building in District states in 1985 is slightly 
ahead of a year earlier and nearly double the recession low in 1982. 
The rise this year has been most pronounced in southeast Michigan, 
reflecting continued strength in motor vehicles. Apartment 
construction in the Chicago area is stimulated by low vacancy rates 
and proposed reduction of federal tax incentives. Activity is also 
up in Indianapolis, but has been flat to down somewhat from 1984 in 
most other areas. Tighter FNMA regulations on mortgages are believed 
to be constraining new construction somewhat. Despite improvement 
since 1982, the pace of residential construction in the District is 
less than half of the 1978 peak. In contrast, sales of used housing 
are nearer to pre-recession levels. One of the largest Chicago-area 
realtors reports a record volume of resales in recent months. Prices 
have probably averaged between flat and up 3 to 4 percent over the 
past year (no good statistics are available), but with wide 
variation among areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Chain store sales in September and early October have been 
disappointing but somewhat better than prior to mid-August. Demand 
for durables has picked up. Apparel is slow, and would be helped by 
cold weather. Inventories are normal, possibly somewhat tight in 
some lines, in contrast with excesses which developed in late 1984 
and early 1985. A high proportion of sales are on credit. 
Delinquencies are high but are not deteriorating further. A large 
area retailer reported that the decline in the value of the dollar 
will not be reflected in higher prices charged to consumers until 
mid-1986. Costs are "locked up" through spring. Japanese exporters 
are absorbing about half of the impact of the lower dollar in 
narrower margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farm commodity prices remain very depressed, but crop prices may be 
at or near harvest-season lows. Livestock prices have recently 
recovered somewhat. Farm credit conditions continue to deteriorate. 
Farmland values declined sharply again in the third quarter, 
according to preliminary results from our latest survey of District 
agricultural bankers. A recent action by the governor of Iowa allows 
judges in that state to delay foreclosure proceedings against farm 
real estate mortgages for one year. Whether such a moratorium can be 
used against foreclosure proceedings initiated by Federal Land 
Banks, the leading supplier of farm mortgage credit to farmers in 
Iowa, is under debate.
