      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 20, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent reports on District developments have tended to be somewhat 
weak. Retail sales were generally sluggish and in some parts of the 
District homebuilders reported that a shortage of credit is becoming 
a major problem. Office vacancy rates in Manhattan have reportedly 
reached their highest level in two decades but have stabilized in 
some other parts of the District. Nonetheless, District unemployment 
rates remain below the national average. Small and medium-sized 
banks stated that the demand for home equity loans is unchanged from 
a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales were generally sluggish since the last report. 
Two chains reported strong over-the-year gains during April and a 
marked slowdown in May, while others noted a slight improvement in 
May but with results that were well below plan in both months.
     </p>
     <p>
      During April over-the-year changes in sales ranged from -6.9 percent 
to +14.0 percent with several stores reporting declines despite 
Easter's falling in April this year. Year-to-year changes in May 
covered a narrower range-from -8.0 percent to +1.0 percent. Rain and 
unseasonably cold weather were cited as major factors behind the 
recent sluggishness, though one retailer characterized it as a more 
generalized slowdown in consumer spending which might or might not 
continue. Home furnishings and women's apparel were mentioned as the 
weakest selling items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the disappointing sales results, for the most part 
inventories remain in good shape due primarily to careful 
monitoring. Indeed, the reluctance of some suppliers to provide 
goods to stores in bankruptcy or with substantial debt has in some 
instances reportedly resulted in somewhat lower-than-desired 
inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In some parts of the District homebuilders reported that a shortage 
of credit for acquisition and construction loans is becoming a major 
problem. This was particularly true in downstate New York and 
northern New Jersey where many commercial banks as well as thrift 
institutions were described as reluctant to lend. One respondent 
noted increased buyer interest in the resale market because of more 
realistic pricing, but expressed concern that potential "move-up" 
sellers may be stymied if homebuilders are unable to obtain the 
necessary funds for construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      In both midtown and downtown Manhattan office vacancy rates have 
reportedly climbed to their highest levels in two decades as new 
buildings are completed in midtown, and financial services firms 
continue to contract and place superfluous space on the downtown 
market. In contrast, office vacancy rates have stabilized recently 
in other parts of the District including Westchester and Fairfield 
counties, northern New Jersey and Long Island. This has resulted 
from a slowdown in the delivery of new buildings together with 
strong leasing activity in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates in May remained below the national 
average. New Jersey's rate edged down to 4.8 percent from 4.9 
percent in April while New York's rate rose to 5.1 percent from 4.9 
percent. The growth in Second District nonfarm employment has lagged 
the national pace since 1986, however, due to substantial declines 
in the manufacturing sector and slower gains in nonmanufacturing 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      The percentage of Buffalo purchasing managers reporting a decline in 
new orders rose sharply in April as did the number of firms with 
lower production. The percentage of managers reporting higher input 
prices also increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to an expected decline in defense outlays, G. E. 
aerospace announced plans to eliminate 4200 jobs over the next two 
and a half years with 50 percent of the job losses in upstate New 
York. A partial offset will be the creation of 500 new jobs at a new 
G.E. electronic parts manufacturing center outside Binghamton, New 
York. In New York City, the second phase of a conversion of the 
Brooklyn Army Terminal into an industrial park is scheduled for 
completion this month. With 94 percent of the first phase already 
rented (primarily to printers and garment/accessories 
manufacturers), the city estimates that 4400 will be employed at the 
facility by year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expressing concern over the state's financial condition, its heavy 
debt load, and economic uncertainties in the region, Moody's 
Investors Service lowered its rating on New York's general 
obligation debt as Standard &amp; Poor's did earlier. Only Louisiana and 
Massachusetts now have a lower rating. New York State adopted a 
budget calling for a total of $1.4 billion in revenue increases. The 
New Jersey legislature continues to consider increasing revenues 
$1.4 billion to balance the budget. A further $1 1/4 billion 
proposed income tax increase would be mostly used to increase state 
aid to poorer school districts. According to press accounts this 
plan is broadly consistent with a recent New Jersey Supreme Court 
ruling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Based on a survey of small and medium-sized banks in the Second 
District, demand for home equity loans is generally unchanged from 
one year ago. While one banker noted that falling home values have 
eroded borrowers' collateral and driven down loan demand, another 
stated that declining home values had a positive effect because 
borrowers are reluctant to sell their homes at lower prices and are 
instead opting for home improvements. Most bankers anticipate strong 
demand for home equity loans over the next year since the tax 
deductibility of interest payments on other types of consumer loans 
is expiring at year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home equity loans as a share of consumer loans generally range 
between 15 and 35 percent at the surveyed banks. At moat banks this 
share has increased over the last year. However, respondents also 
stated that, in general, their lending policy has become more 
conservative. Some noted that they are staying away from speculative 
loans, such as those collateralized by non-owner occupied real-
estate, and a few bankers stated that they are basing ability to pay 
more on income than on collateral. Almost all bankers surveyed said 
that their loan-to-value ratio has been reduced, or is expected to 
be reduced soon, and many noted that they are discounting the 
appraisal value of homes. All but one banker said the interest 
charged is tied to the prime rate with most charging 2 percentage 
points above the prime. Bankers expect to continue charging this 
rate on home equity loans.
