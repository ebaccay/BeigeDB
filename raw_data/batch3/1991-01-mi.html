     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District economic conditions have been uneven. Labor marker 
conditions have been mixed. General merchandise sales growth has 
been slow to moderate. Automobile sales have declined from their 
year-ago levels. Housing activity has rebounded but has remained 
depressed from its levels in the late 80s. Conditions in 
construction and manufacturing have been mixed. Resource-related 
industries have been doing fairly well. Many respondents expressed 
concern about the economic effects of the situation in the Persian 
Gulf.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor marker conditions have been mixed in the district. Minnesota's 
unemployment rate was 3.8 percent in November, down from 4.2 percent 
in October, but up from 3.6 percent in November 1989. Unemployment 
rates in November were higher than a year earlier in Montana and the 
Upper Peninsula, but lower in North and South Dakota and western 
Wisconsin. Employment levels in the district in November were 
generally higher than their year-ago levels. In Minnesota, for 
example, the number of people employed in November was 1.5 percent 
higher than in November 1989. There are some signs of weakness, 
however. The help wanted index in Minnesota in November was 26.3 
percent lower than in November 1989. A nationwide survey of 
employers reports that in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area 
8 percent of employers intended to add employees and 13 percent 
intended to cut back their employment levels. The survey also 
reports that the metropolitan figures were slightly was than the 
national average. Wage and price increases have remained moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers of general merchandise report slow to moderate 
sales growth. One major retailer reports that December sales in 
comparable stores were 2.4 percent higher than in December 1989. 
Another retailer reports that while national sales were only 1.5 
percent higher in December than a year ago, sales in the Upper 
Midwest region of the country were 4 percent higher than a year ago. 
Retailers' comments generally reflect disappointing sales relative 
to their expectations. One retailer reports that discounting of 
prices was broader and deeper than expected. Retailers generally 
expressed a great deal of uncertainty about the outlook for the next 
few months, due in part to concerns about the conflict in the Middle 
East.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales in the district in December were generally lower than 
a year ago. Dealers report sales declines from last December ranging 
from 6 percent to 30 percent. Reports on truck sales in December 
relative to a year ago range from unchanged to a decline of 14 
percent. Dealers' reports on car and truck inventory levels range 
from moderate to high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing starts have rebounded from their depressed levels in 1990, 
but are still sharply lower than their levels two years ago. The 
number of new housing permits issued in Minnesota in November was 7 
percent higher than in November 1989, but 25 percent lower than in 
November 1988. Existing home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
metropolitan area have recently shown signs of slowing. In November 
they fell by 9.4 percent from November 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist activity has been moderately good. Ski resorts in Montana 
and parts of Wisconsin report fairly good conditions, while those in 
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan report that a lack of snow has 
slowed business. However, general tourist activity in the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan has been fairly good. The number of crossings 
over the Mackinac Bridge into the Peninsula in November was 7.2 
percent higher than the previous record levels of November 1989. The 
number of visitors to Yellowstone in 1990 was 6.1 percent higher 
than in 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the district's construction industry have been mixed. 
The overhang of office space in the Minneapolis - St. Paul 
metropolitan area is expected to depress construction activity in 
the area. The value of office buildings in downtown Minneapolis has 
declined recently, causing an expected erosion of about 10 percent 
in the city's commercial tax base.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the district's manufacturing industries have been 
mixed lately. An index of economic indicators shows that economic 
activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area fell in the 
third quarter from the second quarter, but was higher than in the 
third quarter of 1989. Computer and electronics industries in the 
district have continued to be in poor shape, but aircraft industry 
suppliers report rapid sales growth. Several respondents report that 
export demand has continued to be strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's resource-related industries have been doing fairly 
well. Ranchers in the district report that 1990 was an excellent 
year. Farmers generally report that crop yields in 1990 were fairly 
good. However, prices for farm products have generally declined. An 
index of prices received by farmers was 9 percent lower in November 
than in November 1989. Farmland values in the district rose 
approximately 4 percent during 1990. Precipitation in the district 
this winter has generally been below normal, which could adversely 
affect crop yields in 1991. Conditions in the district's mining 
industry have been fairly good. Iron ore production in Minnesota in 
1990 was 5.1 percent higher than in 1989.
