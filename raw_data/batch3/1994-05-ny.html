      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District economic developments were by and large more 
favorable in recent weeks, suggesting that the pace of economic 
activity has been picking up in recent months. Most retail contacts 
posted February and March sales results that were above 
expectations, homebuilders in several areas noted an increase in 
traffic and contracts, and office vacancy rates declined. District 
payroll employment continued to show over-the-year gains. Most loan 
officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change in their 
willingness to lend from two months earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retail contacts reported that March sales results (on 
a year-over-year basis) were well above plan, following February 
sales that a majority said were also greater than expected. The 
strong March gains occurred even after allowance was made for this 
year's earlier Easter and a severe storm in March, 1993 which 
reduced sales activity in much of the area. Widespread demand for 
most types of merchandise was reported with both big ticket items 
and nondurable goods selling well in recent weeks. Several retailers 
mentioned being particularly pleased by a resurgence of demand for 
women's apparel after several months of sluggish performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales changes ranged from -3 percent to +13 percent in 
February and from +3 percent to +17 percent in March, with the 
majority of contacts reporting double-digit gains in March. While 
better-than-expected sales reduced inventories more than was 
intended at some stores, the majority of respondents still found 
stocks to be at sufficiently comfortable levels to avoid any 
difficulties in meeting demand. In general, retailers were 
cautiously optimistic about what lies ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in much of the District have noted an increase in 
traffic and contracts written in recent weeks, after a long and cold 
winter during which little or no building activity could take place. 
The situation in several places was described as spotty, however, 
with some builders doing well, but others less well. Response to 
spring exhibitions of new homes was generally reported as good and 
exhibitors are hopeful that this will result in additional contracts 
being signed in the near future. Thus far, the rise in mortgage 
rates has apparently not had a negative effect. Some respondents 
said that, if anything, it is motivating people to act now before 
rates go any higher. Most contacts anticipate a slightly better year 
than in 1993, but also stated that this will depend in part on the 
future course of mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      After several years of little or no new construction activity in 
Manhattan, three large, mixed-use towers are going up in the Lincoln 
Center area that will contain substantial amounts of new retail and 
entertainment space together with rental and condominium apartments. 
Plans have also been announced to gut a nearby 44-story office 
building overlooking Central Park in order to reconstruct it with 
several hundred condominium apartments and possibly some offices as 
well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity was fairly brisk in much of the District 
recently, and primary vacancy rates declined in all of the areas for 
which data are available except Downtown Manhattan. Lower vacancy 
rates were posted in northern New Jersey, Westchester County, 
Fairfield County, Connecticut and on Long Island, which registered a 
large, two percentage point decline in the first quarter. In 
addition to the lower vacancy rates, rents have begun to stabilize 
and smaller concessions are now reportedly being offered to 
potential commercial space renters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New York reported an over-the-year increase in payroll employment of 
87,000 in March, its sixth consecutive over-the-year gain, and New 
Jersey posted an over-the-year rise of 32,000 in February, its 
seventh consecutive gain. Unemployment rates increased in both 
states during March. New York's rate rose to 8.1 percent from 7.8 
percent in February, while New Jersey's rose to 7.9 percent from 7.3 
percent in February.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the first time in several months, only a few large-scale 
employment cutbacks have been announced recently. Natwest will shift 
1300 jobs out of the District beginning in August; U.S. Surgical, 
which is headquartered here, will eliminate 900 jobs, and Fleet 
Financial Group plans to layoff 600 in New York State. The impact on 
Long Island of Northrup's recent purchase of Grumman remains to be 
seen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The March survey of purchasing managers in Buffalo showed an 
increase in the percentage of firms reporting improved orders, but a 
decrease in the percentage with greater production. The February 
survey of purchasing managers in Rochester recorded a rise in the 
percentage anticipating improved conditions during the next three 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the District indicated that they remain as willing to lend as they 
were two months ago. Several officers, however, did mention an 
increased willingness to lend, and a few reported easing credit 
standards. Loan demand was mixed, particularly for consumer loans 
and commercial and industrial loans. On balance, residential 
mortgage demand continued to decline due to the sharp drop in 
refinancing activity, but a few officers did report an increased 
demand for new home mortgages. The only loan category exhibiting 
significant improvement in demand was nonresidential mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lending rates were generally higher for all types of loans, although 
a few officers mentioned lowering rates on business loans "to meet 
competition for quality loans." While only a third of the 
respondents had raised rates on deposits, the majority of those who 
reported rates unchanged intend to increase them in the near future. 
Finally, almost all respondents reported either stable or lower 
delinquency rates during the preceding two months.
