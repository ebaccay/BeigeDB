      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District was increasing slightly in 
late August, according to reports from regional business contacts. 
Manufacturers said shipments and new orders were moving up and 
employment was steady. Retailers gave mixed reports on back-to-
school shopping, although sales overall appeared to be running 
slightly above the pace of a year ago. Auto dealers continued to 
report a healthy rate of sales. Banks were posting gains in consumer 
lending and some slight improvement in commercial and industrial 
lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations are generally positive, although not robust. About half 
of the manufacturers surveyed anticipate further gains in shipments 
and orders over the next six months; one-fourth expect slower 
business. Retailers expressed some concern about consumer confidence 
in the wake of rising interest rates, and although they see no 
indication of weakening, they are being cautious in forecasting 
sales for the fall. Bankers expect loan demand to continue moving up 
at its current modest rate, but they too are becoming concerned that 
recent increases in interest rates could lead to slower business 
activity and an easing in loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturing activity continued to move up at a 
moderate rate in August, according to reports from manufacturers. 
About one-third of those queried said shipments and new orders were 
on the rise, while nearly one-half said demand for their products 
was running at a steady pace. Producers of durable goods generally 
reported improving conditions, and most makers of nondurable goods 
indicated that business was steady. Manufacturers in the District 
reported that output has been matching demand, as evidenced by 
inventories and order backlogs that remain virtually unchanged. 
Staffing levels and working hours at area plants have also been 
steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasts by managers at industrial plants in the region are 
positive, on balance. About half expect orders and shipments to 
continue to increase while one-quarter foresee no change from the 
current pace of activity and one-quarter anticipate some slowing. 
Employment plans at area firms call for no overall change in hours 
or work forces. About half of the firms contacted for this report 
plan to keep capital spending at current rates, but nearly one-third 
intend to step up outlays.
     </p>
     <p>
      There appears to be some upward movement in industrial prices in the 
region. Just over half of the manufacturers reporting on prices said 
input costs have been rising, and just over one-quarter have raised 
prices for their own products. Few report any decreases for either 
input or output prices. Looking ahead, the balance of opinion among 
Third District manufacturers is that prices will increase for both 
the products they purchase and the goods they make.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the Third District gave mixed reports for the late 
August back-to-school shopping period. On balance, however, sales 
appeared to be running slightly above the rate of a year ago, in 
real terms As has been the case for much of this year, discount 
stores were posting better year-over-year gains than other types of 
stores. Several merchants noted that fall clothing styles were 
selling well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers said it is difficult to forecast sales for the upcoming 
fall months. Several expressed reservations about the strength of 
consumer confidence and voiced some concern that recent interest 
rate increases may lead consumers to revise their spending plans 
downward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers described the recent sales pace as good, although 
several said they were hampered by continuing problems in obtaining 
enough popular models to meet demand. Nevertheless, most of the 
dealers contacted for this report said they were satisfied with 
their current inventories and did not intend to increase them. 
Dealers generally expect sales to remain healthy as long as auto 
loan rates do not rise substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers said loan volume in late August was moving up 
slowly, propelled mainly by consumer lending. Most of the bankers 
contacted for this report said consumer installment lending was 
moving up on the strength of car sales and that lending on home 
equity credit lines was increasing in response to promotional 
efforts. Some bankers reported slight continuing gains in 
residential mortgage lending for home purchases, with adjustable 
rate loans predominating, but nearly all also said refinancing 
activity was at a low level. On balance, bankers indicated they were 
seeing slight growth in commercial lending, and they described the 
market for business loans as very competitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the bankers interviewed for this report foresee little 
change in business conditions in the region or nation for the rest 
of the year. They expect the pace of loan growth to remain around 
its current rate. Some said the possibility that business activity 
and lending could fade has risen because of recent interest rate 
increases as well as expectations that further rate increases may 
occur later this year.
