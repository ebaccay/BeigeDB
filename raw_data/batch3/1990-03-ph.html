      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from business contacts in the Third District in February 
were that economic activity was virtually flat, overall. The 
manufacturing sector continued on a downward path in February, with 
the orders picture even dimmer than in the past few months. 
Retailers reported only marginal year-over-year gains in dollar 
sales, while auto dealers said a healthy rate of sales early in the 
year was beginning to fade. Bankers noted a falloff in loan growth 
due to slackening demand and caution in extending commitments, 
especially for buyouts and real estate lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus in the Third District business community is that 
current conditions are likely to persist through most of the year. 
Negative opinions about future business activity edge out positive 
views among manufacturers, prompting plans to trim employment and 
capital spending. Retailers do not expect consumer demand to regain 
vigor, and they are being cautious in ordering merchandise. Bankers 
foresee only a slight advance in lending, at best.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued to decline in 
February, and indications from companies contacted during the month 
were that the downturn, which began last spring, was steepening. 
Within a generally soft manufacturing sector, conditions in durable 
goods industries are somewhat weaker than in nondurables.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most measures of industrial activity indicated a slowing pace of 
business in February. While shipments were edging up slightly, the 
rate of gain slipped from the pace set in the previous three months, 
and new orders, which had held up through the fall, were declining. 
Delivery times reported by industrial firms continued to grow 
shorter, reflecting the softening order situation. Despite the drop 
in orders, surveyed firms generally reported they were working down 
inventories. And, although the overall picture was dim, employment 
measures have shown little change; while area firms were trimming 
hours somewhat, overall, payrolls were being held steady. Industrial 
prices in the region show some signs of stabilizing; a majority of 
the companies contacted noted steady prices for the goods they 
purchase as well as for the products they make.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, pessimistic opinions about business conditions over 
the next six months slightly outnumber positive forecasts among 
Third District manufacturers, although in the aggregate, managers at 
area plants expect both new orders and shipments to run at steady 
rates over the period. But the slower pace of business observed 
since the beginning of the new year apparently is affecting 
production plans as local firms indicate they expect to pare back 
employment and working hours and make some cuts in capital spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers surveyed in late February generally 
indicated that sales for the month were only marginally above the 
February 1989 level in current dollar terms. While no line of goods 
stood out as selling particularly well or poorly, some merchants 
said that women's spring apparel was selling better than expected 
for this early in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retail contacts in the Third District expect sales for the rest 
of the year, in current dollars, just to inch above last year's 
level. Most are being very cautious in ordering merchandise. Orders 
by retailers are also being restrained by credit conditions, as 
factors financing inventories for some local stores have cut back on 
the amount of funds they are willing to advance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers generally posted sales in early February 
above the year-ago level, but sales after mid-month slipped to a 
level just even with the 1989 rate for the same period. Although 
some import dealers expect sales to continue to be healthy, most 
dealers, both of domestic models and of imports, expect further 
declines this year. Area dealers have cut back on orders to 
manufacturers and they consider their current inventories, at around 
one and one-half month's supply of cars, to be satisfactory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at major Third District banks in early February 
was approximately 15 percent above the year-ago level but bankers 
contacted late in the month said growth has slipped from that rate. 
A combination of slackening demand and tighter credit standards has 
reduced growth in nearly all categories of lending. Commercial and 
industrial loan volume has been virtually flat in recent weeks, 
according to bankers, and commitments for leveraged buyout and 
capital investment financing have dropped sharply. Most Third 
District banks also have curtailed lending for real estate 
acquisition, development, and construction. Consumer lending growth 
has been below bankers' expectations, and bankers describe personal 
loan demand as weak, except for home equity credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, bankers do not expect lending activity to pick up 
significantly. In the absence of more vigorous economic growth, they 
expect virtually flat commercial loan demand and only slight gains 
in consumer lending. Real estate lending will remain restricted. In 
line with this scenario, banks are not aggressively seeking 
deposits.
