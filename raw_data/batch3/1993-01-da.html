      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      While District economic activity continues to grow moderately 
overall, signs of a slight acceleration have begun to appear in some 
sectors. Most prices are reported to be stable, although those of 
some construction-related manufacturing products have increased. 
Optimism is pervasive across industries. Orders to manufacturing and 
service firms have increased. District retail and auto sales 
continue to expand at a moderately strong rate in general, although 
retail sales along the Mexican border appear to have fallen from a 
year ago. Construction and real estate activity continue to pick up. 
End-of-year oil field activity was particularly strong but overall 
the energy industry remains weak. The financial industry reports 
rising deposits but little change in loan demand. Agricultural 
yields were reported as good in most areas, but prices have declined 
slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity is picking up. Production increases are 
greatest for construction-related products, largely because of 
continued expansion in homebuilding. Demand remains strong for 
brick, cement, lumber and construction-related fabricated metals. 
Prices have been increasing for these products. Demand for oil and 
gas-related fabricated metals remains slow overall, but foreign 
demand recently picked up somewhat. Production of primary metals 
increased slightly last month. Part of the expansion was said to 
reflect an anticipated January 1 increase in the price of steel. 
Sales of glass to automakers have increased because of an expected 
uptick in nationwide auto sales; prices remain stable. Demand 
continues to be strong for personal computers and telecommunication 
equipment. Orders to chemical producers are mixed. A worldwide 
oversupply of industrial chemicals has slowed production and held 
prices stable but sales of pharmaceutical chemicals are strong and 
prices have increased. An end-of-year surge in domestic drilling 
boosted demand for oil field equipment. Sales of paper products 
remain above last year's level. Demand for food and kindred products 
has picked up slightly. Production of denim products continues to 
grow at a moderate rate while producers of high-end apparel report 
weak sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      The growth rate of the service activity has increased slightly but 
optimism has increased more. Demand has picked up slightly and some 
firms have increased hiring. Respondents note that they are 
expanding cautiously, however, and only in response to stronger 
sales. Prices are generally stable. District state governments face 
budget problems although no hiring freezes have been implemented. 
New Mexico is the only District state expecting a budget surplus 
this year. Louisiana is expecting a $900 million budget deficit and 
has proposed a 40 percent cut in state funding to higher education 
this year. The state is implementing riverboat gambling to raise 
revenue and produce jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      District retail and auto sales continue to grow at a moderately 
strong rate. Retailers report that prices are still competitive but 
inventories have been reduced without significant discounting. Wage 
costs are the same or lower than last year. Consumers have greatly 
increased credit card purchases, and one retailer speculated that 
this may be an indication of increased consumer confidence. District 
metropolitan areas, which had experienced sluggish retail sales 
growth throughout most of 1992, have now improved. Typically robust 
sales along the Mexican border, however, fell absolutely because of 
what respondents said was increased enforcement of import 
restrictions by the Mexican government.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate activity continue to increase slowly. 
Occupancy rates and rents have increased for multi-family real 
estate in Dallas and Austin, although rents in Fort Worth remain 
unchanged. New home demand is strong in Dallas, Austin and Houston. 
The office real estate market remains weak with the exception of 
Austin where rents are rising and office vacancy rates are falling. 
Austin is the District's first major metropolitan area in a decade 
to have office vacancy rates below the national average. While 
office vacancy rates are still high in Dallas, one respondent noted 
that prices have dropped to a point where property sales have begun 
to pick up. Industrial vacancy rates have fallen recently and rents 
seem to have stabilized after falling for the past several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expiring tax credits stimulated end-of-year oil field activity but 
low prices and weak demand have generally slowed the energy 
industry. Growing world inventories have kept crude oil prices 
hovering around $20 per barrel. Although natural gas prices are 
above last year's level, prices have weakened since October because 
of adequate supplies and competition from low oil prices. Some 
respondents expect natural gas prices to continue to decline. 
Refining margins remain low and profits have been estimated to be at 
their lowest levels since 1987. Many refineries have reduced 
capacity. After peaking at 935 in mid-December, the rig count ended 
the year just above 700 rigs, well below the 860 of 1991. A larger 
than normal spurt of natural gas drilling was prompted by expiring 
tax credits which reduced costs for wells started by December 31. A
slump in drilling is certain in January, although changes in the 
Alternative Minimum Tax will mitigate the loss of expired tax 
credits.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial industry reports rising deposits but little change in 
loan demand. Refinancing on residential and commercial properties 
continues to boost real estate lending activity and fee income.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural respondents in most areas of the District report higher 
yields but lower prices. Production in 1992 will be less than in 
1991 because producers planted fewer acres. Prices for most 
commodities are below year-earlier levels. The December Texas All 
Farm Products Index of Prices Received was 2.5 percent below 
December 1991. Prices are slightly higher for livestock commodities 
but lower for most crops.
