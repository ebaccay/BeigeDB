      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity softened further in November from a 
sluggish pace earlier this fall. Retail sales and manufacturing 
activity declined, and the housing market weakened. District 
financial institutions reported reduced demand for consumer loans 
and for commercial and industrial loans. Port activity was again 
mixed. On the brighter side, coal and timber production were strong. 
Financial conditions improved further in the District agricultural 
sector, and farmland values continued to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from various sources including our regular survey of 
retailers suggested that department stores in the District 
experienced declines in retail sales from October to mid-November. 
Some lines such as cosmetics were reported strong, but others such 
as apparel were weak. Sales of big ticket items such as furniture 
were mixed, but weaker on balance. Most department store executives, 
however, expect this Christmas season to be as good as or better 
than last year, and most do not plan to mark down merchandise as 
much as they did a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to our regular mail survey indicated a decrease in 
District manufacturing activity from mid-October to mid-November. 
Reports of declines outnumbered reports of increases in shipments, 
new orders, unfilled orders, employment, inventories, and the 
workweek. The largest declines were recorded in new and unfilled 
orders. New export orders were largely unchanged. The prices of 
finished goods and raw materials rose moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our November survey showed that most manufacturers remained 
optimistic about prospects for the U.S. economy and their own 
businesses, although they were somewhat less optimistic about the 
near-term outlook than in our previous survey. Most producers expect 
the nation's economy to grow at a slow to moderate rate during the 
next 18 months. Almost half of the respondents, however, up from 
one-third in September, expect a decrease in the nation's rate of 
economic expansion over the next six months. The percentage of 
respondents who expect a decrease in their own shipments in the next 
six months rose to 40 percent in November from 25 percent in 
September. The percentage planning to maintain or increase capital 
spending in the next six months declined slightly but remained high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from sources other than those surveyed by mail provided some 
specifics on District activity in particular industries in recent 
weeks. In the Carolinas, the furniture, textile, and apparel 
industries reduced their workweeks because of slow sales. In West 
Virginia, however, coal production was at a record pace and coal 
prices were strong. Timber production also maintained a robust pace 
in West Virginia and other District states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the three major District ports—Hampton Roads 
(Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimore—indicated that overall 
activity was mixed in October. Imports rose from September levels at 
Hampton Roads and Charleston, but declined at Baltimore. Exports 
increased at Charleston, decreased at. Baltimore, and remained about 
the same at Hampton Roads.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of home builders pointed to a weakening in 
residential construction activity in the first three weeks of 
November. Nearly all home builders reported declines in their 
housing starts. Most said that they were not building speculatively 
because inventories of unsold homes were high and home purchases 
were expected to remain weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Comments by realtors and others confirmed the builders' reports of 
softness in the District housing market in November. Sales of both 
new and existing homes were reported to be down in all but a few 
metropolitan areas. Some realtors reported an increase in open house 
traffic, which they attributed to good weather and lower mortgage 
rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bankers reported softness in loan demand in early November. 
Almost all indicated declines in the demand for commercial and 
industrial loans, and some said that these declines were large. Most 
bankers also reported that the demand for consumer loans was down. 
They attributed weakness in car loans to depressed automobile sales 
and to greater use of dealer financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of bankers commented on the high level of consumer debt and 
noted an increase in their consumer loan losses and delinquencies. 
Others saw problems ahead in particular sectors, such as commercial 
real estate and automobile dealerships.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent survey of agricultural bankers indicated that the health of 
District agriculture has improved further. The bankers said that 
farm loan repayment rates were better than average at their 
institutions, and almost two-thirds were actively seeking new farm 
loans. The demand for farm loans was normal across the District, but 
bankers expect weaker loan volume during the next several months 
because they look for their nonbank competitors to become more 
aggressive. Farmland prices continued to rise in recent months, but 
only a few of the bankers surveyed expect further increases in the 
months ahead. With respect to crop conditions, wet weather has 
delayed the sowing of winter wheat in parts of the District, though 
the planting of other small grains is on schedule.
