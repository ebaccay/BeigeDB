      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 22, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity increased moderately in May and early 
June. Tourism was robust, particularly over the Memorial Day 
weekend. Manufacturing indicators and retail sales increased, but 
service-producing firm activity rose only moderately and trade 
volume through District ports changed little. Mortgage lending 
activity declined although conditions in commercial real estate and 
housing improved. Reports indicated scattered labor shortages and 
some modest upward pressure on prices. In agriculture, spring 
planting neared completion, but some crops experienced heat stress.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to a regular mail survey indicated that District retail 
activity increased in May. Retailers reported gains in employment, 
wages, and sales, including those of big-ticket items. Other 
contacts, however, noted that auto sales weakened after April 15. 
Survey respondents indicated that retail prices increased 0.4 
percent in May and foresaw price increases of 1.1 percent during the 
next six months. Looking ahead, retailers expected demand for their 
products to strengthen in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A mail survey of District manufacturers showed increased factory 
activity in May. Shipments, new orders, and employment were higher 
in recent weeks. Finished goods prices increased slightly, and raw 
materials prices rose by less than the general inflation rate. 
Producers expected no change in employment, a longer average 
workweek, lower finished goods inventories, and a slight increase in 
prices during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service-Producing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District service-producing firms indicated that activity increased 
moderately in May. Revenues and wages rose, but employment was 
steady. Respondents reported a 0.6 percent increase in the prices of 
their services. They expected that in the coming months their prices 
would rise 1.4 percent and demand for their services would increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated robust tourist activity in recent weeks. Over the 
Memorial Day weekend, many beach areas were booked to capacity and 
several reported record-setting activity. Other tourist areas also 
experienced strong increases in bookings, which they attributed to 
unusually favorable weather and a surge in group reservations. Based 
on current bookings, respondents anticipated that summer tourist 
activity would far exceed last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at the ports of Baltimore, Charleston, and Hampton 
Roads (Norfolk) indicated that the volumes of exports and imports 
remained about the same in May as in April. Compared to a year ago, 
imports were higher and exports were unchanged. Baltimore and 
Hampton Roads expected exports to increase faster than imports 
during the next six months, but Charleston expected no change in 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions indicated that credit conditions 
were mixed during the last six weeks. Interest rates rose on both 
commercial and consumer loans. Consumer loan demand remained fairly 
strong, but commercial loan demand declined slightly. Mortgage 
lenders indicated that originations were relatively slow and that 
refinancing activity virtually disappeared. Commercial and mortgage 
loan officers were cautious but optimistic about loan demand in the 
months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to District contacts, housing sales and building permits 
were steady in April and May, but buyer traffic decreased. 
Homebuilders indicated that they started fewer houses because of the 
recent rise in mortgage rates and their uncertainty about future 
rates. Home prices remained stable, although lumber prices and 
construction wages increased. Some builders reported that non-lumber 
materials prices also rose, but at a slower pace than in previous 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate improved further in recent weeks, according 
to industry analysts. Office building vacancy rates fell in most 
areas of the District, but were unchanged in northern Maryland and 
in West Virginia. Commercial rents were steady, but contacts 
expected slight increases in the near future. The availability of 
large blocks of office space continued to tighten, particularly 
around Charlotte and Washington, D.C. Some construction of office 
buildings for owner/occupants was underway across the District, but 
no new speculative projects were reported. Several contacts 
indicated that renovations of older office buildings temporarily 
lessened the need for new office building construction in their 
areas. Large discount retailers continued to expand in North 
Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, and demand for warehouse 
space remained strong in northern Maryland and in Greenville, S.C.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State government tax revenues continued to grow at healthy rates in 
most areas of the District. Based on May sales tax receipts, state 
forecasters indicated that retail sales ranged from "good" in 
Maryland to 'booming" in North Carolina. Analysts suggested that 
overall revenue collections were consistent with real economic 
growth rates of 2.5 to 3.5 percent, except in the District of 
Columbia, where revenue growth was just keeping pace with inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unseasonably warm, dry weather in recent weeks aided farmers' 
planting and harvesting activity but stressed some recently planted 
crops. District planting activity was ahead of its normal pace, as 
was the harvesting of wheat and other small grains in the Carolinas. 
Early yields indicated that the small grain crop had not been 
substantially damaged by the severe cold of last winter. Inadequate 
soil moisture in many areas of the District, however, hampered the 
development of corn, soybeans, and peanuts. In West Virginia, the 
peach crop was in poor condition as a result of damage to orchards 
from last winter's ice storms.
