      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The growth of the regional economy has slowed a bit since the 
beginning of the year. While most manufacturing industries exhibit 
strong growth, business services and trade are slackening. With the 
exception of autos, retail sales remain lackluster. Although 
residential construction continues to sag, nonresidential 
construction has picked up. Bank loan activity in May varied across 
the District but in most states modest growth occurred. Higher crop 
prices should help farmers prosper, however, the potential for yield 
losses from dry weather is increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity in the region has slowed somewhat since the last 
reporting period. Employment growth in some sectors has cooled while 
others continue to operate at capacity levels. New orders are 
falling for textile producers and inventories are building. Business 
services as well as trade are off the pace of previous months due in 
part to slower consumer spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, most manufacturing, and particularly companies 
producing paper and chemicals, continue to report strong business 
activity. In the paper industry, price increases were noted in both 
kraft sheet from which corrugated shipping containers are 
manufactured and in chemicals used in the paper production process.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the region report that disappointing spring sales 
continued in May. Memorial Day weekend sales ranged from poor in 
Mississippi to good in Florida. However, most areas found sales 
mediocre and at about the same dollar level as last May. Inventories 
remain at acceptable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car sales continued to be helped by extended manufacturers 
incentives and intense competition among dealers through mid-May. 
Domestic car and truck sales in particular are benefitting from the 
recent surge in buying. The first quarter's new motor vehicle 
registrations in the Southeast rose 13 percent over 1987's level. 
This performance represents a marked improvement over the sluggish 
sales pace registered in the first quarter of 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales in the Sixth District were mixed throughout May as 
mortgage interest rates turned up. Residential construction value in 
the region was down 13 percent through April well below the 8 
percent decline for the nation. Construction is expected to decline 
further in the months ahead. Alabama and Florida report that home 
sales have been strong as mortgage interest rates have bottomed out. 
Tennessee's housing market has improved steadily in 1988, but still 
is down from last year's pace. In Louisiana and Mississippi, home 
sales remain depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, nonresidential construction has regained momentum in 
the Southeast this spring, posting a 3 percent rise in construction 
value over the first four months of 1987. Much of the District's 
increase has been in Georgia, which was boosted by Atlanta's 64 
percent increase through April. Tennessee's construction has also 
surged ahead of last year's pace. Downtown office construction in 
Jacksonville and in New Orleans have led the way for their 
respective states over the last two months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Large banks in the Sixth District experienced flat to moderate 
growth in loans during May. Business loans were sluggish while real 
estate loans were strong. All contacts agreed that it is too early 
to discern the impact of higher interest rates on loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers throughout Florida agree that loan growth was flat in May, 
but lenders in Georgia reported steady growth in total loan volume. 
Consumer loans accounted for the majority of Georgia's loan growth. 
Louisiana is the only state to register strength in business loans. 
Other states generally reported flat or declining trends in both 
business and real estate lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism was slow in May but rapid increases were expected by mid-
June. Foreign visitors have been flocking to the Southeast, 
especially Orlando, Daytona Beach, Miami, and New Orleans. Reasons 
for this include the weak dollar, direct marketing abroad, and 
increased international flights directly to Miami and Orlando. 
Despite the increased traffic, hotel occupancy has either been 
holding steady or declining throughout the Southeast partially due 
to the fact that more travelers are staying with family and friends 
while on vacation. National Park attendance is already up 4 percent 
this year and is expected to climb even more.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Pork and egg producers are experiencing sharp declines in revenue as 
a result of weak prices. Cattlemen, however, are enjoying 
substantial gains from sharply higher prices. Crops are in good 
condition at present but soil moisture levels are perilously low. 
Further dry weather will quickly reduce yields. Crop prices are much 
higher than a year ago and could increase even more if weather 
damage occurs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumber and building products industries are experiencing weaker 
prices due to the decline in housing starts in the Southeast. One 
bright spot, however, is a further decline in competition from 
Canadian lumber as price differences widen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil production stabilized in recent weeks after falling slowly 
throughout the winter. Nonetheless, production remains down 5 
percent from the same period last year. Conditions in the coal 
industry are stable; coal production is up 4 percent over last year 
thus far.
