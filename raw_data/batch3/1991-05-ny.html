      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 1, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy since the last report 
remained soft to mixed. Sales results at department stores were 
generally sluggish during February and March though some improvement 
occurred as the period progressed. Unemployment rose substantially 
in March and office leasing slowed during recent weeks. On the 
positive side, the latest surveys of purchasing managers indicate 
some pickup in business activity among manufacturers in Buffalo and 
stabilizing in the Rochester area. Moreover, homebuilders noted a 
substantial increase in traffic though sales remained soft. Most 
senior officers surveyed at small and midsized banks reported that 
overall demand for real estate loans in mid-April was the same as a 
year ago with the majority noting moderate growth in residential 
real estate loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results at District department stores were generally sluggish 
during February and March, but in some cases where stores had been 
planning for sizable over-the-year declines, March results were 
actually better than anticipated. Year-to-year changes in March 
ranged from -11 percent to +6.8 percent and in February from -16 
percent to +1.5 percent. The only contact with a worse performance 
in March than in February attributed it to the fact that a major 
promotional campaign that occurred in March 1990 is scheduled for 
April this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of furniture and other durable goods continued slow though one 
respondent saw signs of a bottoming out. High priced women's apparel 
also moved slowly but other types of clothing and cosmetics sold 
relatively well. The inventory situation was mixed. Some were 
pleased that stocks are below plan since sales have been sluggish 
while others reported more of an inventory buildup than was 
intended. All of our contacts were pessimistic about the outlook 
until the economy revives.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in most of the District have noted a substantial 
increase in traffic in recent weeks though sales remained soft. They 
attribute the heightened interest to "the lowest mortgage rates in 
years", an improved consumer outlook following the cease fire in the 
Gulf, and more resale activity resulting from lowered prices on 
existing homes. Observers varied in the expectations for the year 
from those simply hoping for a near-term turnaround to those who 
anticipate a pretty good year. Mortgage money is considered 
plentiful in all areas but bank financing for acquisition and site 
development continues to be restricted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing slowed in the District during recent weeks as 
activity in midtown Manhattan declined to its lowest level in three 
years. Nonetheless, the primary vacancy rate in midtown was 
unchanged because of virtually no new addition of space. A sizable 
amount of newly excess space was marketed in downtown Manhattan, 
however, and the primary vacancy rate rose substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      March unemployment rates rose in New York by 0.6 percentage point 
and in New Jersey by 0.5 percentage point to match the national 
average of 6.8	percent. This is the highest level in New York 
since May 1986 and in New Jersey since January 1994. The District's 
employment outlook is dimmed by several recent announcements of 
large-scale cutbacks planned by area companies. Due in large part to 
reduced defense spending, Grumman will lay off 1900 more workers by 
yearend-three-quarters of them on Long Island-and Metropolitan Life 
anticipates the loss of about 1000 jobs as the result of moving 
several thousand jobs from its Manhattan headquarters during a 
renovation project. In addition, both New York State and New York 
City continue discussing the layoff of large numbers of employees to 
help close budget gaps. More positively, the Pentagon selected 
Sikorsky Aircraft in Fairfield County, Connecticut as part of a team 
to build a new generation of combat helicopters with six prototypes 
to be built by 1996. The latest surveys of purchasing managers 
indicate some pickup in business activity among manufacturers in 
Buffalo and stabilizing in the Rochester area. In March, 48 percent 
of firms surveyed in Buffalo reported increased production, up from 
24 percent in February, and 43 percent reported higher orders, up 
from 27 percent in February. Almost three-quarters of the firms in 
the Rochester survey reported unchanged business conditions in 
February compared with 60 percent in January. Both surveys showed a 
sizable increase in the percentage of firms with lower input costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior officers surveyed at small and mid-sized banks in the 
Second District reported that overall demand for real estate loans 
in mid-April was the same as a year ago. Although almost all 
respondents saw no particularly strong or weak sector of the real 
estate market, the majority noted moderate growth in the demand for 
residential real estate loans, especially among first-time 
homebuyers. Of the banks reporting this moderate demand growth, more 
than half had an increase in loans for new purchases and the 
remainder had an increase in mortgage refinancings. Reasons cited 
for the growth in demand were declining home prices and interest 
rates as well as a recovery of consumer confidence. When asked about 
demand for commercial real estate loans as compared to last year, 
responses varied from "still down" to "substantially off". Bankers 
cited the soft economy and earlier overbuilding as major factors 
behind the current lackluster commercial real estate sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Credit standards for real estate loans at the majority of surveyed 
banks have not changed over the last three months though a few 
mentioned lower loan to value ratios as well as more caution with 
respect to land development loans and home equity lines. All 
respondents stated that over the last three months their qualifying 
procedures for real estate loans have not changed and nearly all 
said that their interest rates on real estate loans have been "low 
and stable" or have declined slightly. Most respondents reported 
that the ratio of their real estate loans to total loans has not 
changed over the last year. The only one noting an increase stated 
that this was mainly due to purchases of RTC assets.
