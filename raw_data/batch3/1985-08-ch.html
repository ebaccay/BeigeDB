      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions in the Seventh District continue sluggish, with 
no sign of significant improvement in the months ahead. Forecasts 
have been revised down. While analysts and executives are cautious 
and uneasy, few anticipate a general decline. Total payroll 
employment has increased modestly in the five-state area in recent 
months, but manufacturing employment has declined. Indiana and 
Michigan, aided by the recovery in motor vehicle output, have paced 
the District, while Iowa and Illinois, more associated with the 
depressed agricultural sector, have enjoyed very little improvement. 
Demand for most capital goods produced in the District has shown 
only partial recovery, and in some cases none at all. Heavy trucks 
and trailers, which were strong early this year, have weakened in 
recent months. Steel output has declined since last spring, contrary 
to earlier expectations. Construction activity has been helped by 
lower interest rates. Retail sales of general merchandise have been 
below forecast, and credit delinquencies have increased. However, 
retail inventories, generally, have been brought into line. There 
are no problems in procurement, and order leadtimes have shortened 
on many items. Prices in wholesale markets have been soft, 
especially steel, nonferrous metals, and paperboard.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Layoffs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of large District firms are in the midst of painful staff 
reduction programs to reduce financial deficits. Deep cuts sometimes 
involve veterans with 30 or more years service. Included are 
railroads, airlines, steel, capital goods, electronics, utilities, 
financial institutions, and conglomerates. Staff reductions take the 
form of attrition, retirement incentives, and outright discharge. 
Mergers and acquisitions, a large factor among firms headquartered 
in the District, typically result in elimination of employees deemed 
redundant.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total auto deliveries have remained at a high level, but slipped in 
June and early July, at least partly because of the expiration or 
reduction of incentive programs for domestics. Imports have 
increased as Japanese cars have become more available. Some popular 
domestic models are in short supply, a situation that should be 
eased by strong third quarter production schedules. The largest auto 
manufacturers were pleased by the plan to amend the CAFE requirement 
penalizing production of full-size cars. Sales of light trucks have 
remained vigorous. However, orders for heavy trucks fell well below 
production in the first half, and backlogs are lowest in 2 years. 
Second half output is expected to be 25 percent lower than in the 
first half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With orders disappointing, raw steel output has declined, and 
overall operations have remained below break-even levels. Producers 
continue strenuous cost-cutting efforts. Industry analysts view the 
effectiveness of the Administration's import restraint program as 
doubtful. Auto industry needs are the main support of steel order 
books. Light construction steel also is in good demand. Steel for 
heavy construction and capital goods remains soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand is down from last year for various lines of equipment, 
including oil and gas development, food processing, and materials 
handling. Construction equipment remains very depressed. Farm 
equipment sales have been below last year's miserable level. Rail 
equipment orders are still in driblets. Two computer and 
semiconductor manufacturers headquartered in the Seventh District 
are reducing staff in response to the weakening in that industry, 
but most production is outside the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Constructionâ€”Nonresidential
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonresidential building in the District showed a small advance in 
the first half of 1985, after two years of vigorous growth. 
Nevertheless, activity remains well short of good levels of the late 
1970s. Michigan, which was most depressed, has had the sharpest gain 
over the past 3 years. Commercial construction has been strongest in 
the District--new office and retail buildings and substantial 
rehabilitation work. Additional large office buildings are planned 
to be started in downtown Chicago and strategic suburban centers, 
despite a "substantially overbuilt" market. Proposed tax changes 
would reduce incentives for developers. Concessions on leases are 
large and widespread. New space is constantly coming on the market 
as new buildings are completed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Constructionâ€”Residential
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential building in District states, except Michigan, has been 
somewhat below a year ago. Construction has improved in all states 
from 1984's second half. Activity, overall, is only about half the 
level of 7-8 years ago. New work is severely depressed in 
communities dependent on agriculture or hard hit manufacturing 
firms. Mortgage interest rates, recently at the lowest levels since 
the late 1970s, continue to support sales of new and used homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Highway Work
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Highway construction is a source of strength in the District. Most 
of the new federal highway money is being used for small, urgent 
projects, usually involving asphalt resurfacing. Government 
authorities are said to be reluctant to start big projects because 
the flow of federal funds could halt again this fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major general merchandise retailers found sales to be disappointing 
in May, June, and early July. Moreover, credit delinquencies have 
been rising. However, inventories have been reduced from somewhat 
excessive levels several months ago, through tight restraints on 
ordering. An industry analyst notes the possibility of shortages in 
the pre-Christmas buying season. Home appliance shipments were at 
record levels in the second quarter. (Appliance manufacturing is 
important in the District.) Most lines were strong, but the leader 
has been microwave ovens, the majority of which are imported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Distress
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District farmers continue under pressure from weaker crop prices and 
declining farmland values. Our survey of District agricultural banks 
shows that farmland values at mid-year were down nearly 5 percent 
from March, down 20 percent from a year ago, and down 40 percent 
from the peak in 1981. Most bankers expect further declines. 
Prospective crop yields in Iowa and some other areas of the District 
have been reduced somewhat because of dry weather in recent weeks. 
Overall harvest prospects, however, remain favorable. Corn and 
soybean prices, already down about 20 percent from year-earlier 
levels, are drifting lower, reflecting expectations that this year's 
harvest will substantially exceed requirements. Farm loan portfolios 
continue to deteriorate. In our mid-year survey, agricultural 
bankers reported "major or severe" repayment problems with about 17 
percent of their farm loans, up from 12 percent a year ago.
