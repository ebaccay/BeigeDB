      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity, especially in the eastern and southern 
parts of the District, has been hampered somewhat by severe winter 
weather. Sales and employment reports from other parts of the 
District are mixed. Residential construction activity, while slow in 
some areas because of ice and heavy snow, continues to be 
unseasonably strong. Most categories of loans outstanding at large 
District banks have grown in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales and employment reports from District firms are mixed. Severe 
weather, especially in the eastern and southern portions of the 
District, has hampered business operations and forced many small and 
large businesses to close temporarily. Auto plants in Louisville and 
St. Louis, operating with just-in-time inventory systems, shut down 
because snowy and icy conditions prevented the delivery of parts. 
Interstate commerce in the Louisville area was suspended for about 
four days when a record 16-inch snowfall effectively shut down the 
city and interstate highways. Many small businesses were closed for 
almost a week, incurring losses not easily recouped. Memphis and 
Little Rock also experienced icy conditions severe enough to close 
many businesses and government operations. Parts of southern 
Arkansas and northern Mississippi were without power for almost two 
weeks after the ice storm knocked out power lines and toppled 
electrical towers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several employment reductions were reported that were unrelated to 
bad weather. The most prominent was from a shoe manufacturer, which 
had already downsized. This manufacturer announced another 5,660 
layoffs nationwide, almost 1,750 of which are in Missouri, and the 
closing of five factories and numerous retail outlets because of 
increased foreign competition. An aluminum producer released 350 
workers because of a worldwide excess supply of aluminum. A beverage 
company moved an Illinois instant tea plant to New Jersey, 
eliminating 180 District jobs. A St. Louis-area school district will 
lay off 700 employees, 400 of whom are teachers, because of budget 
shortfalls.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, numerous expansions throughout the District have 
been announced. For example, a mortgage company will open a loan 
processing center in St. Louis, initially employing 500 workers, 
with 1,500 more workers expected to be added within the next two 
years. An appliance producer in Louisville has already added more 
than 350 people this year because of high demand for its products. 
The poultry industry continues to grow, with one firm expanding its 
processing plant and hatchery, adding 175 workers, and another soon 
opening four new plants (exact locations not yet determined). A 
bicycle manufacturer is coming to Missouri with 500 jobs, and a 
trucking company is hiring 500 more St. Louis employees to meet its 
shipping demands. In addition, various manufacturers report sales 
increases in January of between 4 percent and 30 percent over one 
year ago. Finally, a Mississippi manufacturer of bathroom fixtures 
reports that it has made its first export shipment to Japan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A backlog of orders resulting from wet weather in 1993 continues to 
keep area homebuilders busy, despite occasional stoppages because of 
more recent inclement weather. In St. Louis, more single-family 
permits were issued in December than in any other month of 1993. 
Severe winter weather in Louisville brought construction to a 
standstill for several days, although January permits held steady 
from their year-ago level. In Little Rock and Memphis, construction 
activity remained above its year-ago pace during the last two months 
of 1993. Recent increases in lumber prices are being passed on to 
homebuyers; in St. Louis, builders expect new home prices to rise 3 
percent to 5 percent as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans on the books of 11 large District banks decreased 2.7 
percent in January after a 1.1 percent increase in December. The 
decline in total loans was due entirely to shrinkage in real estate 
loans, which fell 6.4 percent during the month. Business loans rose 
3.1 percent in January and consumer loans rose a modest 0.3 percent. 
District bankers continue to report modest increases in loan demand 
from both commercial and retail customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Severe winter weather disrupted transportation in the Eighth 
District over the past month. A record January snowstorm forced the 
Louisville airport to close for approximately 24 hours, causing a 
major parcel package distributor there to incur tens of millions of 
dollars of additional expenses and lost revenues. The snowstorm also 
closed most of the state's major highways, substantially delaying 
shipment of goods that traverse the state. In February, a major ice 
storm caused significant disruptions in southern Arkansas, northern 
Mississippi and parts of Tennessee. The Memphis airport did not 
close, but operated at reduced capacity for two days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Army Corps of Engineers reports rising river levels in many 
places along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. In some cases, this is 
normal for this time of year. Reports from the Corps and the 
National Weather Service predict that, over the next 30 days, the 
Mississippi River will exceed flood stage in some areas south of St. 
Louis and approach flood stage north of St. Louis. No major flooding 
is expected at this time, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Southern pine lumber mills report that orders on a year-to-date 
basis are down nearly 12 percent over the same period last year. An 
industry contact, however, reports that such mills expect to see 
some increase in demand stemming from the rebuilding efforts in the 
aftermath of the California earthquake.
