      <strong>
       September 18, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy expanded modestly in July and August, 
according to most contacts, despite sluggish consumer spending 
growth. The overall manufacturing sector strengthened further, with 
continued gains in consumer durable goods production joined by hints 
of recovery in several capital goods industries. Residential real 
estate transaction activity softened somewhat, but remained 
sufficiently brisk to support gains in household goods production. 
The outlook for commercial construction and supplier industries was 
little changed. Bank asset and retail deposit growth in the District 
was restrained by both supply and demand factors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts generally indicated that growth in District consumer 
spending remained sluggish. One large general merchandise chain 
reported relatively flat sales in August (in nominal dollars, year-
over-year) in the District, in line with the national average, and 
stated that regional differences in sales results have narrowed 
markedly over the year. A large discount chain reported that its 
sales in larger markets in the District declined in August (compared 
to last year), in part due to competitive pressures, while sales 
rose nationally. A retailers' association in Michigan reported that 
members continued to experience depressed traffic and sales levels, 
but conditions have stabilized in recent months. A liquidation 
trustee reported that retail contacts have experienced some upturn 
in sales in the past month. A large automaker reported that car 
sales declined in recent weeks, but still remained stronger than 
earlier in the year. However, anticipated strengthening in sales to 
fleets over the next two months is expected to boost total sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recovery in the District's manufacturing sector continued in 
recent weeks. Gains in consumer durable goods production were joined 
by signs that some capital goods production began to turn upward, 
although weak spots still exist. Purchasing managers' surveys in 
Detroit, Indianapolis. Western Michigan and Chicago showed 
increasingly widespread expansion. Detroit reported some softening 
in responses from nonautomotive businesses, but widespread gains 
were again recorded in the automotive sector. The results from 
Indianapolis registered a significant turnaround in the second 
quarter, with an important contribution from the automotive sector. 
Western Michigan showed continued solid expansion in July and 
August, with new signs of improvement from several capital goods 
respondents. Chicago's index moved strongly into expansionary 
territory in August, after gradually rising from low levels early in 
the year. Each of the monthly surveys recorded consistent inventory 
liquidation thus far in 1991, both during the contractions recorded 
early in the year and during the recoveries seen in more recent 
months. Most anecdotal reports also suggested strengthening among 
consumer durable goods producers and their suppliers. A large steel 
producer reported that shipments in the summer months were better 
than expected, with important contributions from shipments to auto 
and appliance manufacturers, although most customers still show 
little inventory rebuilding. A large electronics firm reported that 
semiconductor order growth continued to trend upward, with orders 
from automakers making an important contribution. Semiconductor 
orders from the previously weak capital goods sector were expected 
to turn up m the fourth quarter. An electric utility in Michigan 
reported its first monthly year-over-year gain in power sales to 
industrial customers in August. Several small suppliers to the auto 
industry reported new hiring activity, although a large automaker 
plans to use overtime rather than new hiring to meet labor 
requirements for the balance of the year. A producer of paper 
containers reported that demand from appliance producers has been 
stronger than expected, and a large appliance manufacturer stated 
that the industry trough had passed. Reports from the capital goods 
sector were mixed. but generally better than earlier in the year. A 
July survey of metalworking firms reflected improved expectations 
for business conditions, although appraisals of current conditions 
remained weak. After recording flat sales in the first half of 1991, 
a heavy machinery producer reported solid order gains in recent 
months. A large manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks reported renewed 
softness in industry orders. A producer of a wide range of 
specialized machinery reported that order gains remained relatively 
soft, however with improved orders for food processing equipment 
offsetting continued weakness elsewhere. A large manufacturer of 
construction equipment experienced a renewed slump in orders in 
August and stated that dealers continued to cut inventory amid low 
sales expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several contacts reported that the sharp pickup in the District's 
residential real estate sector earlier in the year may have softened 
somewhat recently, but activity is still running at respectable 
levels. A large District realtor reported that residential sales 
gains have been running in line with seasonal expectations in recent 
months. After home sales rose sharply in the second quarter, housing 
permits in Indianapolis rose fairly sharply in July. A realtors 
association reported that home sales in Wisconsin remained brisk in 
the summer, and 1991 sales are running at a record pace. A producer 
of gypsum wallboard reported that industry shipments into the 
Midwest strengthened in July. An appliance distributor reported that 
orders from homebuilders in the Midwest had Improved over the past 
several months, with continued gains expected in the second half of 
the year. Year-to-date industry appliance shipments to dealers in 
the Midwest were essentially flat, according to one large 
manufacturer, which is relatively strong performance compared to 
much of the rest of the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity generally remained subdued in 
August, although the pickup in District manufacturing activity may 
be beginning to boost the demand for industrial space. A brokerage 
firm reported that rental rates for downtown Chicago office space 
continued to decline in the second quarter, with rising vacancy 
rates joined by negative net absorption. A large District cement 
producer tied to commercial construction reported continued year-
over-year shipments declines, with little near-term improvement 
expected for shipments in the Chicago metropolitan area. A group of 
small commercial lighting companies anticipate a 3 to 5 year 
depression in sales for nonresidential building in the Chicago 
market. The office market in metropolitan Detroit remained soft in 
recent months, according to a brokerage firm, with vacancy rates 
continuing to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Few District banks reported new tightening in standards for new 
commercial real estate loans in recent months, but financing 
generally remained difficult to obtain, with strict preleasing and 
borrower equity requirements in place. Lending terms have become 
increasingly costly, particularly for loan extensions. One District 
retail store chain recently completed a large equity offering 
designed to allow the retailer to internally finance its store 
expansion program. Previously, expansion had been constrained by the 
inability of real estate developers to obtain construction financing 
from banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from several large banks in the District reinforced earlier 
indications that both demand and supply factors worked to suppress 
bank credit and retail deposit growth in June and July. Several 
large banks reported that demand for retail deposits was dampened by 
increasingly competitive returns on nondeposit instruments and 
sluggish economic conditions in deposit market areas. At the same 
time, banks themselves reported somewhat less aggressiveness in 
promoting retail deposits. Generally, slower asset growth led to 
some softening in the desired growth for wholesale liabilities, but 
neither increased deposit insurance premiums nor slower asset growth
affected the desired growth for retail deposits. Still, several 
respondents indicated that they were likely to be less aggressive in 
attracting retail deposits over the balance of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most banks contacted reported weak asset growth since the end of 
May. Each bank that reported weak asset growth cited softer loan 
demand, although other factors (including planned reduction in 
lending and securitization) were also cited. At the same time, most 
banks reported little change in standards for commercial and 
industrial leading in recent months, after more frequent indications 
of tighter standards being adopted earlier in the year. Weaker loan 
demand was generally concentrated among larger corporate customers, 
with banks noting several reasons, including lower financing 
requirements for inventory and capital investment, as well as 
alternative nonbank and/or capital market financing sources. Some 
reports of increased loan demand from medium-sized and smaller firms 
arose, with one bank reporting increased capital spending by smaller 
businesses.
