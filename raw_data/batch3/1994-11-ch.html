      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic activity gained some upward momentum in 
recent months, with renewed strength in retail sales joining greater 
expansion in manufacturing output. Housing activity has slowed 
during 1994, but remains at relatively high levels. Commercial real 
estate markets strengthened further. District labor markets 
continued to firm up, but concerns over job security and heightened 
competition in the temporary help industry continued to dampen labor 
cost pressures. Large supplies have undermined farm commodity prices 
and will likely trim farm sector earnings and expenditures in the 
months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Survey data and reports from large retailers suggest that retail 
sales advanced at an improved pace on a seasonally adjusted basis in 
recent months. Sales growth in the District has fallen more closely 
in line with the national average, but sales were relatively strong 
here during 1993. A regular survey of retailers in Illinois and 
northern Indiana showed some improvement in the most recent survey, 
after sales comparisons weakened during the second quarter and into 
the early stages of the third. A survey of independent retailers in 
Michigan showed a large majority anticipating greater sales gains in 
coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      One large national chain reported that sales growth improved in the 
first half of October on a seasonally adjusted basis, after some 
slowing in the summer. This contact noted that sales of appliances 
slowed around mid-year. then picked up again in recent months. Total 
inventories (for this retailer as well as its suppliers) are running 
in line with plan and moderately higher than last year. However, a 
higher turn rate and increased confidence in the purchasing 
department are expected to make the company's own inventory posture 
somewhat more aggressive in the months ahead. A manufacturer of 
consumer electronics also reported that inventory levels have been 
increasing, both at the company and among its dealers, even as 
inventory has been turning at a faster rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity in the region has trended sideways in recent months 
on a seasonally adjusted basis, although activity remains at 
relatively high levels. Recent reports showed new slowing in permit 
issuance for housing construction in Iowa (where gains held up 
relatively well through the first half of the year), and slower home 
sales in Illinois. One of the largest realtors in the District 
reported a slight upturn in transaction volume in August and 
September, after activity slowed during the second quarter and into 
July. This contact still believes that sales will soften further on 
a seasonally adjusted basis as the year comes to a close. Even so, 
"we are still showing good numbers, and there isn't too much 
grousing among the salespeople." An association of homebuilders 
reported that sales and traffic continued to ease downward on a 
seasonally adjusted basis. This contact stated that members' 
expectations point to a further slowdown in 1995, "or perhaps some 
stabilization. 1995 should still be a good year, though, and we 
aren't complaining."
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets continued to strengthen. A large real 
estate services company stated that the downtown Chicago office 
market "continues to move in the right direction," and the overall 
vacancy rate has fallen to its lowest level in over three years. 
This firm found stronger conditions in the suburban marketplace than 
the downtown area, with most of the surveyed areas showing record 
low vacancy rates. A large bank stated that industrial and 
commercial real estate markets in Chicago are showing "considerable 
strength, with signs of speculative activity arising for the first 
time in a long time." A large steel manufacturer noted that an 
increasing share of new construction projects seems to have a 
"hurry-up" quality, as firms authorize projects "and scramble to 
catch up" to meet tighter completion dates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District industrial output gained momentum in recent months, after 
expansion slowed during the summer. Production readings from the 
Chicago and Milwaukee purchasing managers' surveys remained quite 
vigorous during September, and the Detroit survey showed new 
strengthening. Surveys conducted in western Michigan have been 
depicting some of the strongest results in the District, and these 
surveys showed even greater momentum in late September.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among key District industries, steel production moved higher on a 
seasonally adjusted basis in recent weeks in the region, after plant 
shutdowns for maintenance contributed to a greater slowdown in 
output than the seasonal norm late in the summer. One industry 
analyst stated that nearly all of the major markets for steel 
produced in the Midwest remain strong, including appliances, heavy 
equipment, and autos. This contact stated that producers' steel 
inventories are relatively low, partly because customers have 
demonstrated greater willingness to hold steel of their own accord. 
A large auto supplier reported that demand from transplant 
operations has shown recent renewed strengthening, joining continued 
strong sales to domestically based manufacturers. This firm expected 
continued moderate growth in 1995. The company has been adding 
capacity this year, and "only recently have we seen some 
stabilization in our ability to meet demand without using overtime." 
An association of home appliance manufacturers reported that the 
industry is headed for a record shipments year, topping its previous 
high in 1987. However, the association is expecting "some kind of a 
slowdown" in 1995. A number of large manufacturers noted greater 
momentum in exports to Europe, including producers of construction 
machinery, material handling equipment, and industrial automation 
controls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District labor markets continued to tighten, and reports of 
worker shortages seemed to grow somewhat more frequent. At the same 
time, few manufacturers or retailers reported significant new wage 
pressures in permanent positions. A regular survey of Wisconsin 
businesses showed a substantial, continuing majority planning to 
increase their employment. One large manufacturer recently began 
adding full-time workers to its operations in Milwaukee for the 
first time since 1978. Fully 95 percent of 100 senior executives of 
mid-sized companies surveyed recently in the Chicago area expect 
employment to remain stable or increase further, and this percentage 
has been on the rise consistently since the fourth quarter of 1993. 
Help-wanted advertising in the East North Central region fell back 
somewhat from July to August, according to the most recent 
Conference Board index, but only after especially strong gains in 
previous months, and the underlying trend continued to climb faster 
than the national average. A Chicago newspaper recently moved help 
wanted advertising to the front of its classified section, noting 
that demand climbed especially sharply in recent months, and the 
paper has increased its rates for help-wanted ad space.
     </p>
     <p>
      A growing number of contacts reported difficulty finding skilled 
workers, but reports of tight labor markets are not universal, even 
in some of the strongest states in the District. One regional 
analyst stated that recent cutbacks by three significant employers 
in central Wisconsin have reinforced a continuing skepticism among 
workers that labor markets lack the strength and stability apparent 
in reported statistics. This contact stated that "many workers sense 
increased risk, and don't see a higher return." Temporary help 
companies have been reporting increased difficulty attracting 
employees for available positions, hut heightened competition in the 
industry has held in check the prices these companies charge the 
ultimate employer. One large retailer stressed that the company has 
experienced no abnormal price pressures arising from labor costs, 
with base wage increases continuing to run below the increases seen 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Large supplies have undermined farm commodity prices and will likely 
trim farm sector earnings and expenditures in the months ahead. The 
winding down of a record-breaking fall harvest, both in this 
District and nationwide, is straining grain storage and handling 
facilities and pushing corn and soybean prices to the lowest levels 
in several years. Likewise, livestock prices have retreated as 
updated reports show the record-setting pace in meat production will 
extend well into next year. Hog prices have fallen the most, down 
more than a fourth from last year and the lowest in fourteen years.
