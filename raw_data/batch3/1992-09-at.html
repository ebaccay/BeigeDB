      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 23, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the Sixth District reported that economic activity 
expanded quite slowly through Labor Day. Merchants recorded steady 
to slightly higher sales, and factories were generally busier than 
earlier in the summer. Home sales and construction improved in most 
of the District, but apartment development and commercial 
construction was flat. Except for the recent surge in refinancing, 
business and consumer loan demand at District banks remains stalled. 
Wages have been relatively stable under conditions of job 
uncertainty, and attempts to raise product prices have met with 
little success. A summary of Hurricane Andrew's economic impact on 
south Florida and Louisiana is presented in the final section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported marginal sales increases in August compared with 
year-ago levels. Back-to-school sales generally met retailers' 
conservative expectations. Discount stores continue to post the best 
gains, led by sales of apparel and other nondurable goods. Looking 
ahead, merchants are not expecting significant gains over last 
year's lackluster Holiday season. Auto sales have been mixed to only 
slightly higher, but most dealers are comfortable with the 
relatively low inventories of 1992 models still on the lots.
     </p>
     <p>
      Convention traffic in most states is exceeding year-ago levels and 
is expected to remain strong into next year. Tourism enjoyed 
moderate increases through late summer, bolstered by the air fare 
wars and an influx of European visitors responding to sharp declines 
in the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A large majority of manufacturing contacts reported steady to higher 
orders, production, and shipments. However, only a quarter of these 
contacts added to employment rolls or lengthened the workweek in 
August. Inventories of material inputs and finished goods continue 
to drift downward, mostly by design.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, firms that rely on NASA or defense contracts reported 
decreasing orders and are not optimistic about the outlook over the 
next six months. Petroleum industry suppliers stated that the energy 
business remains slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most realtors noted sales gains for starter homes and some have seen 
increased interest in the trade-up market. Ample existing home 
inventories have kept prices stable even as the number of 
transactions has risen. Responding to market conditions, builders 
are putting up more low-to-mid priced homes and expect slow but 
steady improvement for the rest of the year. Although there have 
been some reports of rising occupancy rates and modestly increasing 
effective rental rates, multifamily construction has yet to respond. 
On the commercial side, some brokers sense that effective rental 
rates are beginning to firm. Even so, rental rates remain far below 
those required for speculative development.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers around the region reported that consumer and business loan 
demand was generally flat in July and August. However, almost all 
contacts are seeing a deluge of mortgage refinancing that may 
eclipse the record volume posted earlier this year. Commercial loan 
activity was generally weak. Several business contacts noted that 
increased regulatory burdens and conservative lending practices 
continue to hamper access to credit. Consumer loans were mixed with 
some contacts reporting increases in auto loans in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Materials prices for most manufacturers were steady to slightly 
higher in August. However, firms have generally been unable to pass 
these through on final products because of sluggish demand and 
competitive pressure. Businesses across all sectors have not 
experienced upward wage pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Hurricane Andrew
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hurricane Andrew devastated parts of southern Florida and sparsely 
populated south central Louisiana. However, after an initial period 
of disruption, a surge in economic activity is expected as 
rebuilding commences. South Florida will likely experience a local 
building boom. Retail sales will rise significantly in both states, 
and to a lesser extent, across the region. South Florida bankers are 
expecting new deposits and increased loan activity as insurance 
money and aid pours into the region to fund reconstruction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The extent of damage to oil and gas platforms off the Louisiana 
coast is still being assessed. According to most recent reports, 
about 200 installations show storm-related losses. Decisions 
regarding restoration of the most seriously damaged structures are 
pending. Natural gas prices, which had already been trending upward, 
were pushed sharply higher by the interruption in supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Florida, the lime, avocado, mango, and foliage plant crops were 
all severely damaged or destroyed. It will take several years to 
establish new production for many of the tree crops. Salt water 
intrusion into fields may delay planting of the winter vegetable 
crop. However, except for limes, fruit and vegetable prices have 
remained relatively stable as lost supplies have been displaced by 
imports. In Louisiana, 25 percent of the sugarcane crop was 
destroyed. The fishing and shrimping industries were also disrupted, 
and oyster harvesting has been suspended pending pollution test 
results. Although the affected areas may experience a net gain in 
jobs and income for one to two years, the stimulus from rebuilding 
activity is ultimately transitory and is not expected to displace 
the loss in agricultural and personal wealth incurred by large 
uninsured losses.
