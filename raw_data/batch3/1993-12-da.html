      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy expanded at a moderate pace in October and 
November. Manufacturing respondents said that orders and output 
increased at a steady rate. Retail sales increased slowly. Business 
service companies reported a moderate increase in demand, and 
particular strength was noted by temporary employment agencies. 
Commercial loan demand was reported to be flat at district banks. 
Oil and gas prices and drilling activity declined. Agricultural 
producers reported a generally good harvest, an increase in crop 
prices and lower livestock prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most District manufacturers reported steady growth in orders and 
output. Many respondents noted that the passage of NAFTA had 
improved their outlook for next year. Construction-related 
manufacturing respondents reported continued strong orders. Primary 
metal manufacturers said that demand was flat to slightly improved. 
Semiconductor manufacturers said that demand decelerated but that 
the reduction in growth from very high rates was expected. 
Respondents in the telecommunications industry reported continued 
strength in output and employment. Producers of corrugated box 
liners and fine and industrial grade paper noted an increase in 
demand. The petrochemical industry reported strong demand, although 
overcapacity problems continued to shrink profit margins for 
producers of ethylene and propylene. Oil field machinery companies 
reported continued revenue growth due to the expansion of drilling 
in the Gulf of Mexico. Employment and output at apparel industries 
were reported to be steady. Transportation equipment manufacturers 
who produce for the private sector reported some slight gains while 
those producing defense products reported continued declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall retail sales increased slowly in October and November. 
Responses were more mixed than usual with some retailers reporting 
far better sales than others. Retailing remains very competitive and 
price increases are rare. Even though some reported weak growth, all 
contacts were confident that sales growth would improve slowly. Auto 
sales increased in October, keeping year-to-date sales above last 
year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      All of the District banking respondents reported that commercial 
loan demand was flat. Most stated that their customers are being 
cautious or had a wait-and-see attitude about the economy before 
committing to additional borrowing. Most respondents did not expect 
a significant upswing in the coming months. Mortgage bankers report 
continued strength due to strong home building and refinancings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil and natural gas prices and drilling declined. The price of crude 
oil fell below $16 per barrel in late November. From January to mid-
November, West Texas Intermediate crude averaged only $18.94 per 
barrel, the lowest price in real terms since 1976. Respondents said 
that heavy exports from the North Sea and from the former Soviet 
Union have combined with slack global demand to put downward 
pressure on prices. Spot natural gas prices weakened in October and 
futures prices for November, December and January also weakened, As 
of mid-November, the seasonally-adjusted rig count had fallen 8 
consecutive weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business services increased moderately. Business activity 
at legal and accounting firms was up slightly. A number of 
respondents in these industries reported that they are increasing 
revenues through productivity improvements rather than fee 
increases. Hiring is flat to slightly up. Temporary employment 
agencies reported that demand had improved and that they had 
increased their hiring of workers. A temporary employment firm in 
Dallas reported that a rise in demand for temporary workers was 
broad-based across industries. Transportation firms report an 
increase in cargo shipments. Hotels reported stable demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home construction remained healthy and inventories remained tight. 
Home building respondents were optimistic about 1994. Austin and San 
Antonio were still booming, Dallas was strong and Houston remained 
weak. Respondents in Austin and San Antonio continued to express 
concern over a shortage of qualified construction laborers and sales 
people. Commercial market respondents noted a pickup in retail 
building. Austin was reported as one of the hottest multi-family 
markets in the country with reported occupancy rates at 98 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural producers reported generally favorable conditions, with 
most crops harvested before the Thanksgiving storm. Some producers 
expressed concern that the freeze would negatively affect livestock. 
Prior to the storm, livestock were reported to be in fair to good 
condition across the state. Texas corn production in 1993 is 
expected to reach a record high, an increase of 8 percent above last 
year's level. Cotton yields were reported to be good but lower 
planted acreage reduced production. Texas 1993 cotton production is 
expected to be 59 percent of last year's level. Lower prices for 
wheat, beef cattle and milk caused the October Texas All Farm 
Products Index of Prices Received to decline 1 percent from a year 
ago. The All Crops Price Index was 4 percent higher than a year ago 
while the Livestock and Livestock Products index decreased 3
percent.
