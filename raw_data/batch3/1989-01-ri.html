      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 25, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District economy generally continued to grow at a moderate pace 
in December and early January, and in some regions—such as the 
Washington metropolitan area—growth was still very strong. Retail 
sales were stronger than in November, and department stores 
experienced a somewhat better Christmas season than a year ago. 
Manufacturing shipments rose again; other measures of producer 
activity were mixed. The demand for commercial and industrial loans 
stayed flat, while the demand for consumer credit remained 
relatively strong. Export activity increased at District ports, 
while import volume was largely unchanged. In the agricultural 
sector, below normal precipitation continued to be a concern. Most 
business, financial, and agricultural respondents were optimistic 
about prospects for their businesses and for the economy in general 
in 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to our regular survey of District retailers indicated that 
seasonally adjusted retail sales during the first half of January 
were above those of the last half of December and those reported in 
November. Almost half of the respondents to this month's survey 
reported increased sales while about 40 percent reported declines. 
In contrast, November reports of declines were about equal to 
reports of increases. Most automobile dealers reported increased 
sales during the first three weeks after Christmas, and almost half 
of the department stores reported increases. Three-fourths of the 
retailers expect sales to increase in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Christmas sales were reported to be somewhat stronger than last year 
by department stores in the District. Over half of the respondents 
said their sales were higher than a year ago, while 15 percent said 
their sales were lower. Most respondents said merchandise markdowns 
during the Christmas season were about the same as usual.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity was mixed in mid-January compared to 
a month earlier according to our regular mail survey. About half of 
the survey respondents indicated no change in their activity. Among 
those reporting changes, reports of increases in shipments and new 
orders outnumbered reports of declines, but reports of declines in 
backlogs of orders exceeded reports of increases. The length of the 
workweek and the level of employment were generally unchanged; labor 
was reported to be scarce in some areas. As compared with our 
previous survey of manufacturers in mid-November, our most recent 
survey indicated a slightly slower expansion in producer activity. 
Reports of higher prices of materials were made by about 60 percent 
of the respondents-slightly above the percentage reporting increases 
in our November survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among manufacturers who export, about half said their export volume 
was flat in 1988, while about 45 percent reported increases. Only 
two respondents, both textile producers, indicated declines in their 
exports. Looking ahead, about three out of every five respondents 
expect increases in their exports in 1989 over 1988. Only one 
respondent expects his firm's exports to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      In this latest survey, more District manufacturers were optimistic 
than in our previous survey. Forty-nine percent of the January 
survey respondents expect their shipments to rise in the next six 
months and 15 percent expect declines, compared to 34 and 26 
percent, respectively, in November. In the January survey, 
respondents expecting increases in each category of manufacturing 
activity—new orders, shipments, backlogs of orders, employment, and 
the workweek—outnumbered those expecting declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives from the three major District ports—Baltimore, 
Charleston, and Hampton Roads (Norfolk)—noted increases in exports 
in December compared to November. Imports were apparently steady, 
with shipments reported to be only slightly higher at Hampton Roads 
and unchanged at Charleston and Baltimore. Strong increases in 
export activity are expected at the two largest District ports over 
the next six months; the port of Charleston expects export activity 
to remain about the same. When asked to compare their current 
activity to that of a year ago, all port representatives indicated 
that their export activity was growing faster than their import 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of Fifth District bankers responding to our telephone 
survey reported that demand for commercial and industrial loans, 
particularly commercial construction loans, had been relatively flat 
in recent weeks. However, roughly two-thirds of the respondents 
characterized the demand for consumer credit as relatively strong. 
The bankers contacted held divergent expectations of loan activity 
in 1989, but several indicated that they expected reduced lending 
activity. Their assessments of the national economic outlook were 
also mixed, and several respondents emphasized that the economy's 
course will depend on future fiscal policy. Only one respondent 
expects a recession in 1989. A large majority expect a further rise 
in interest rates through mid-year, followed by a leveling off and 
then a decline in rates during the second half of 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although rainfall in most of the District was about normal from 
September through November, a relatively dry December left pond and 
stream levels lower than normal. Our contacts were optimistic that 
grain prices would strengthen in 1989. One large poultry producer 
expressed concern that low stocks of corn and the resumption of 
exports to the U.S.S.R. could drive feed costs even higher in the 
coming months.
