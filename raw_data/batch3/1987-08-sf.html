      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, the Twelfth District economy appears healthy, although wide 
variations across regions and industries exist. Trade and the 
services are among the strongest sectors in most areas. 
Manufacturing activity appears to be picking up, and the forest 
products industry remains strong despite the rise in interest rates 
that occurred last spring. The new immigration bill has caused some 
disruptions in the apparel and agriculture industries, although 
production levels do not appear to have suffered substantially. 
Construction activity has slowed markedly, particularly in the 
multi-family and nonresidential segments of the market. The higher 
interest rates seen this spring appear to have reduced the overall 
demand for mortgage financing, and many banks have changed mortgage 
features in order to boost demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The trade and service sectors continue to pace economic growth 
throughout the Twelfth District. In Tacoma, a recent survey found 
that 41 percent of the area's employers intended to increase staff 
during July, August, and September, a sharp increase from 11 percent 
last year. The strong demand has led to wage increases for many 
categories of office workers in the Puget Sound area. Tourist 
activity in the Puget Sound area also is reported strong, with the 
number of ferry passenger trips running 10 percent ahead of last 
year, and highway traffic up 6.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several aluminum plants in Washington have come back on line after 
complete shutdowns, due to a combination of higher output prices, 
the lower value of the dollar, Increased demand generated by 
economic expansion during the first quarter, and accommodative 
pricing by the Bonneville Power Administration. In Utah, USX is 
reopening its Geneva steel plant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel production in the Los Angeles area reportedly exceeds last 
year's pace, although the uncertainty generated by the new 
immigration bill has created problems for some producers. For 
example, some small apparel firms are operating below full capacity 
due to labor shortages, while other southern California producers 
reportedly have moved their plant operations to Mexico to take 
advantage of easier access to low-priced labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In many areas, agricultural labor markets have been affected by 
uncertainties associated with the new immigration bill, but reports 
of actual crop losses have been relatively infrequent. The impact 
has been mitigated in most regions by strong recruiting efforts, 
changes in enforcement procedures, and wage increases. For example, 
in Washington, wages reportedly rose from $3-4 per hour to $5-6 per 
hour. Unusually large strawberry harvests in the Northwest and grape 
and tree fruit shipments In the San Joaquin Valley confirm that crop 
losses thus far appear to ha it been relatively minor. However, one 
estimate puts crop losses in Oregon due to labor shortages at $300 
million to $1 billion. Several growers report that their paperwork 
and administrative costs have increased substantially, and many are 
devoting significant resources to providing documentation for 
workers seeking legal residency. In Washington, the upcoming apple 
harvest is expected to be larger than usual, which could increase 
labor demand and, along with possible lower product prices, create a 
tight squeeze on profit margins. Moreover, an Oregon rancher says 
that farmers of some labor-intensive crops, such as sugar beets and 
onions, may cut back on plantings of those crops in future years if 
difficulty in recruiting good workers continues.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production and profitability in the Northwest lumber industry appear 
to be holding up despite concerns regarding the impact of higher 
interest rates. The low value of the dollar continues to make U.S. 
exports attractive on world markets. In addition, Northwest 
producers' competitive positions vis-a-vis Canada have been enhanced 
by the 15 percent tariff on Canadian lumber exported to the U.S. and 
by a recent increase in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to 
the U.S. dollar. The industry continues to operate at or near 
capacity in Oregon, while strong Japanese demand for pulp is 
stimulating Alaska's timber industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity has slowed markedly in most parts of the 
District, with relatively mild declines in single-family 
construction activity exacerbating the more severe downturns in 
multifamily and nonresidential building. In the Seattle area, the 
number of housing permits currently stands 9 percent below its year-
earlier level. In the Phoenix area, construction employment has 
dropped by about 11 percent during the past year. In Utah, 
multifamily construction is down 76 percent from last year and 
single-family starts are down 12 percent. In Alaska, which has been 
hard hit by oil-related weakness, real estate values reportedly have 
fallen by some 21 percent over the past year. Finally, in the San 
Diego area, one of the fastest growing regions of the country, a 
banker reports that new construction loans dropped 56 percent 
between March and June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The changes in financial conditions during the second quarter have 
tilted the mix of mortgage lending away from fixed and toward 
variable-rate instruments for most lenders. One California banker 
reports that fixed-rate mortgage business has dropped by 50 to 60 
percent from the levels of early this year, raising average overhead 
costs, reducing profit margins, and leading to a virtual price war 
over ARMs. However, a Seattle-area banker reports no such change, 
arguing that buyers are doing all they can to qualify for fixed-rate 
instruments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rise in rates has squeezed many banks' profit margins, and the 
decrease in buying activity has reduced mortgage fee income as well. 
Some larger banks have developed new mortgage products to boost 
demand. Innovations include lower mortgage fees, longer loan rate 
commitments, shorter maturities, balloon mortgages, bimonthly and 
biweekly payment plans, and ARMs that are convertible to fixed rates 
at some point early in the life of the mortgage.
