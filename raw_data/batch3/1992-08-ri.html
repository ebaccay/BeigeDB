      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District business conditions and attitudes in June and early July 
were little changed from the weeks before. Economic activity 
continued to grow modestly, and while survey participants remained 
concerned about the pace and sustainability of that growth, on 
balance they were optimistic about business prospects in coming 
months. Activity increased in manufacturing, ports and finance. 
Buyer traffic rose in residential and nonresidential real estate but 
sales remained flat in most areas. Consumer spending and tourism 
were flat. In agriculture, recent rains partially reversed earlier 
damage to crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey indicated little change in retail activity 
in recent weeks. Retail sales and shopper traffic were unchanged, 
and employment was stable. Wholesale prices, retail prices and wages 
apparently rose. Inventories increased, as did capital expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers were optimistic about their prospects for the next six 
months. They expected sales, shopper traffic and employment to 
increase. They also anticipated higher employee wages, wholesale 
prices and retail prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey of manufacturers showed that District 
factory activity and general economic conditions improved moderately 
in recent weeks. Respondents reported increases in shipments, new 
orders and employee hours. Prices rose, and most other indicators 
were stable. Manufacturers noted that, besides poor sales, 
government regulations and excess capacity were their most important 
current problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers' forecasts for the coming months remained optimistic. 
They anticipated increases in all measures of economic activity 
except inventories and employment, which they thought would be 
stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hotels, motels and resorts throughout district reported that tourist 
activity in July was below that in June but about the same as a year 
ago. About half of the respondents reported that bookings were 
slightly below last year's levels while one-third reported 
increases. Several respondents attributed the increases to an 
unusually good Fourth of July weekend, while those who experienced 
declines blamed general economic conditions. About half expected 
tourist activity to pick up through the remainder of the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone indicated 
that credit conditions improved somewhat over the last six weeks. 
Commercial loan demand, while still weak, had strengthened. Consumer 
loan demand was steady. Loan rates had fallen somewhat for 
commercial, consumer and mortgage loans. Mortgage demand rose, but 
the bulk of the activity was in refinancings rather than in 
originations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports--Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk)--reported that both imports and exports 
increased in June from May. Compared with a year ago, import 
activity was mixed, while export activity was generally higher. 
Export activity was expected to continue increasing at Charleston 
and at Hampton Roads but to decline at Baltimore during the next six 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of real estate agents and homebuilders indicated 
that activity had been mixed in the residential market since mid-
June. Many respondents noted that buyer inquiries had increased, but 
that sales had remained generally flat. Respondents in several 
jurisdictions reported growth in the sales of lower-priced homes. 
Home sales appeared to have risen more in South Carolina than in 
other jurisdictions in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several respondents believed that a homebuyer's market existed and 
that many sellers had lowered prices. Most respondents said that 
lower interest rates had not improved their sales. As in previous 
surveys, some real estate agents said that the concern of 
prospective clients about their job security was causing them to 
delay home purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate agents surveyed by telephone said that the 
nonresidential market had been flat or had grown slowly over the 
past six weeks. On balance, the reports suggested a slight pickup in 
traffic across the District. District sales and leases had been 
flat, although weak growth was reported by some respondents, 
particularly in the Carolinas. Rents and prices on commercial real 
estate had been stable, and few nonresidential construction starts 
were reported. Most respondents thought that lower interest rates 
were having little effect on their markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent scattered rain throughout the District has brought some 
relief to heat- and drought-stressed crops, according to 
agricultural analysts. They indicated that unfavorable weather in 
early to mid-July probably had reduced corn yields somewhat and had 
slowed the development of soybeans. Hay and pasture conditions were 
said to be fair to poor, but were expected to rebound quickly with 
the rain. Vegetable crops and tobacco were reported to be in 
generally good condition, with harvesting underway. The peach crop 
in the Carolinas, however, was poor.
