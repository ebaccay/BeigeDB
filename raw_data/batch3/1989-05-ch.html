      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 3, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the Seventh District indicate that economic expansion is 
continuing but is less rapid than earlier. Payroll employment 
through February continued to trend upward in the District states 
about in line with the nation. Unemployment in the region averaged 
5.3 percent of the labor force in February, down nearly to the 
national average of 5.1 percent after being higher since 1979. 
However, in March unemployment rose in Illinois and Michigan in 
contrast with the further national decline. Hiring plans are strong 
in the Midwest. Chicago purchasing managers surveyed in March 
indicated that expansion of production, orders, and backlogs 
continued but was less widespread than last year. This less heated 
expansion was reflected in prices paid, which showed widespread 
increases but less so than earlier. Milwaukee purchasers' reports 
have shown a similar trend over the past year. Higher petroleum 
prices are boosting costs for industry, transportation, and 
consumers. Contacts with industrial firms in the District have noted 
slower increases in orders or shipments for some types of machinery, 
paperboard, electronics, and rail transport. Others noted continued 
strength in the industries in which they do business, including 
industrial chemicals, industrial controls, construction steel, and 
heavy trucks. A diversified manufacturer with sales growing more 
slowly indicates that the slowdown is confined to U.S. markets, and 
that its overseas business is very robust. A minority among our 
sources indicated an expectation of an imminent U.S. recession. 
Others are cautious, watching closely for signs of weakness. Farm 
field work has been slowed by cool spring weather, and there is 
concern about dry conditions in part of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on equipment markets are diverse, with strength widespread, 
but some sectors softening. A producer or various types of machinery 
reported that its commercial machinery backlog is well above a year 
ago. Major home appliance shipments are at record levels. Demand is 
brisk for electrical equipment installed in construction projects. 
Industrial markets for electrical controls and related components 
are strong though some buyers expect a slowdown in this year's 
second half. Sales of equipment to utilities are holding up well 
after being very strong late last year. Demand for locomotives has 
improved but prospects are viewed very cautiously. Orders for 
defense machinery have declined significantly. Weakening was 
reported in light construction equipment, reflecting the housing 
slowdown. Signs of weakness in markets for material handling 
equipment were also noted. Petroleum equipment orders are low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonresidential construction activity is at a relatively high level 
in the Midwest. Construction contracts for nonresidential buildings 
last year were at their peak for this expansion in the District 
states. Construction activity remains vigorous on office buildings 
in Chicago's Loop and on industrial structures. Chicago-area 
shopping centers, mostly in the suburbs, are set to open at a record 
pace in 1989 and 1990, even though some observers regard the area as 
already "overstored." Public works construction is expected to rise 
this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction activity is described as still vigorous in 
the Chicago area. Resales are growing, however, attributed to higher 
interest rates. Housing prices are up sharply. Mortgage interest 
rates of 11 percent for fixed-rate loans became more widespread in 
March. Interest rates on adjustable-rate loans at area lenders 
climbed considerably in the year to mid-March. Mortgage rates, on 
average, have edged down since then.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel production in the District, through early April, was above a 
year earlier. Orders are also above last year. Demand from machinery 
manufacturers reflects the continued growth of capital spending. 
Sales of construction steel are particularly strongâ€”"through the 
roof," according to one sourceâ€”at variance with weaker indicators 
of the pace of construction nationwide such as contracts. Auto and 
appliance markets for steel are holding up well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After another month of lackluster car sales and inventory 
accumulation at dealers, sales perked up in early April following 
announcement of enhanced buyer incentives. In addition, assembly 
plans for the second quarter were revised downward modestly in the 
past month, though they remain near last year's strong pace. 
Industry observers speculate that auto makers will stretch out third 
quarter model changeover shutdowns to pare inventories, though 
components suppliers reportedly are not seeing indications of this.
     </p>
     <p>
      Truck sales in the first quarter were at a high level but somewhat 
below 1988's all-time high. Truck production, on the other hand, has 
been at a record pace. The heavy truck market is strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       General Merchandise
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from retailers in the District were mixed. One noted that 
the shift in the timing of Easter, from April 1988 to March this 
year, renders questionable both comparisons of the latest month with 
a year earlier, and seasonally adjusted sales. Inventories are 
regarded as low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Spring field work in District states is off to a slower start than 
in recent years, largely because of cool temperatures. There is 
considerable apprehension about the continuing drought conditions in 
much or Iowa and western Illinois. Elsewhere in the District, soil 
moisture appears adequate for the start of the growing season. In 
general, however, precipitation patterns over the next few months 
will be more critical to the development of spring-planted crops 
than the pattern of the past few months.
