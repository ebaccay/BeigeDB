      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Tenth District economy continues to grow moderately. Overall 
retail sales continue to increase, although new car sales are weak. 
Increases in manufacturers' input prices are moderating and most 
materials are readily available. Retailers and manufacturers are 
both trimming inventories. Drilling activity, while variable from 
month to month, is below its year-ago level. Housing activity 
remains weak, with the effect of slightly lower mortgage rates not 
yet evident. Loan demand at commercial banks is flat to somewhat 
stronger for most loan categories. Lower yields likely held winter 
wheat production below average despite acreage increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Tenth District retailers report sales increases over last year 
and over the last three months. However, merchandise sales are 
expected to be flat over the rest of this year and most respondents 
are reducing their inventories. Prices have been steady and are 
expected to remain so in the near future. Tenth District automobile 
dealers report weak new car sales over the last month. Dealers 
expect 1989 sales at or below 1988 sales and are trying to trim 
inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents report that input prices rose moderately over the 
last year. However, input prices changed little over the last three 
months, and only small increases are expected over the next three 
months. Although some lead times have lengthened, most materials are 
readily available. Nearly all respondents are trimming their 
inventories and plan to trim further in coming months. The inventory 
reductions reflect a recent build-up of excess inventories at some 
firms as well as long-term efforts to reduce normal inventory 
levels. Most Tenth District manufacturing plants are operating near 
full capacity. However, one steel manufacturer reports that the 
recent strength of the dollar has hurt sales of U.S. produced pipe 
and rails. Several firms report problems in finding skilled labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Volatility in oil prices appears to be contributing to month-to-
month variability in district drilling activity. Drilling activity 
also remains below year-ago levels. After falling in June to 225, 
the average number of active drilling rigs in the district increased 
sharply to 246 in July. Exploration and development activity, 
therefore, stands about 8 percent below the level of one year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District housing activity is down from a year ago, and most 
homebuilders report a slight decline in starts from a month earlier. 
New single-family home sales and prices have been steady and 
multifamily construction is virtually at a standstill. Most 
respondents expect little change in housing activity for the rest of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit inflows at district savings and loan institutions are 
slightly higher than a month ago but lower than a year ago. However, 
deposit inflows vary substantially from one institution to another. 
Some respondents attribute the recent behavior of deposit flows to 
uncertainty about the new savings and loan legislation. Although 
mortgage demand has been mixed, modest growth is expected in the 
near future. Nearly all respondents report slightly lower mortgage 
rates, but most expect stable rates in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District commercial bank respondents report more increases in loan 
demand than decreases. Increased demand is reported to be most 
apparent for commercial and industrial loans, home equity loans, and 
agricultural loans. Decreased demand is evident for home 
construction and commercial real estate loans. Demand for other 
types of loans is said to be generally unchanged. Among responding 
banks, loan-to-deposit ratios are about the same as a month ago but 
somewhat higher than a year ago. At most banks, lending rates both 
to businesses and consumers have either fallen in the last month or 
are expected to decline in the near future. Deposit levels are 
generally the same or somewhat higher than a month ago. Demand 
deposits and small time and savings deposits have shown the greatest 
strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Winter wheat yields and quality vary widely across the district as 
the harvest nears completion. Some fields in Kansas and Nebraska 
were not harvested due to crop damage from cold weather, drought, 
insects, or hail. Wheat quality in Kansas was reduced by harvest 
delays due to late season rainfall. In other parts of the district, 
however, wheat yields and quality were average or above average. 
Overall, yields likely held winter wheat production below average 
despite acreage increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The district corn, soybean, and milo crops are generally in good 
condition. Across most of the district, recent rainfall has improved 
crop growing conditions, and good yields are likely if further 
timely rainfall is received. But in some areas, where planting was 
delayed last spring, crops could be threatened by an early frost.
     </p>
     <p>
      Little expansion in district cattle and hog numbers is expected this 
year. District fed cattle prices remain strong, but cattle feeding 
margins are being squeezed by the high price of feeder cattle. High 
feeder cattle prices, in turn, are contributing to large profit 
margins for cattle ranchers. Although such profits would typically 
result in an expansion of cattle herds, drought-diminished feed 
supplies are likely to restrict herd expansion this year. Slaughter 
hog prices are higher, but little expansion in hog-feeding activity 
is likely because feeding margins remain near break-even levels.
