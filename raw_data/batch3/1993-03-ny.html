      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic developments in the Second District were mixed in recent 
weeks but seemed slightly more positive on balance. Most District 
retail contacts reported better-than-expected sales results in 
January and positive over-the-year changes. District homebuilders 
appear to have become more widely optimistic in recent weeks with 
respondents noting an increase in buyer traffic and a reduction in 
the volume of homes for resale. Office leasing activity slowed in 
recent weeks and changes in vacancy rates were mixed. New Jersey's 
unemployment rate fell sharply in January while New York's was 
unchanged. Our manufacturing contacts suggest a moderate increase in 
activity over the period immediately ahead with eight of the twenty-five firms expecting unit sales to grow by 5 percent or more over 
the next six months. The latest survey of small and midsized banks 
in the District showed a sharp increase in their willingness to make 
certain types of loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retail contacts reported better-than-expected sales 
results in January and positive over-the-year changes. In addition, 
with smaller post-Christmas inventories than in recent years, fewer 
and smaller markdowns were required during the January clearance 
period. Retailers remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook, 
however, noting that consumer reception to the new spring 
merchandise will be the test of what lies immediately ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      The majority of stores had year-to-year gains in January ranging 
from 1 to 6.5 percent. However, one chain reported a small decline. 
Categories of merchandise cited as posting strong increases were TVs 
and VCRs. furniture, linens, and various kinds of apparel. 
Inventories are generally at satisfactory levels though a little 
below plan in some areas.
     </p>
     &lt;&gt;
     <strong>
      &gt;Residential Construction and Real Estate
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A somewhat more pervasive optimism has developed among District 
homebuilders recently as respondents noted an increase in buyer 
traffic and a reduction in the number of houses for resale. The 
improvement was attributed to the decline in mortgage rates and 
stronger demand. Builders said that two factors could prove 
problematic, however: a continuing lack of credit for acquisition 
and development loans and a recent skyrocketing of lumber prices.
     <p>
      <p>
       Office leasing activity slowed in recent weeks and vacancy rates in 
areas such as downtown Manhattan, Westchester and Long Island moved 
somewhat higher. Rates edged lower in midtown Manhattan and Northern 
New Jersey, however, and stabilized in Fairfield County as little 
additional commercial space was brought to market.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       New Jersey's January unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent from 8.0 
percent in December while New York's rate was unchanged at 8.5 
percent. New York has exhausted its unemployment insurance funds for 
the first time since 1977, one of only five states confronting this 
problem. Several recent announcements will impact negatively on 
District employment. I.B.M. now plans to eliminate some 6000 
positions at its New York mainframe and technology product plants, 
almost twice the initial estimate, and Kodak will lay off another 
2000 workers, mostly in its headquarters city of Rochester. On a 
smaller scale, May Department Stores will move its merchandising 
office to St. Louis, eliminating 430 jobs in New York City by June.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discussions were recently held with 25 manufacturing firms in the 
District regarding sales, prices, wages, investment plans and 
exports. On the whole, our contacts point to a moderate increase in 
sales over the next six months. Eight firms project sales to rise at 
least by 5 percent while all but three expect either flat or 
moderately higher sales. Most of the firms feel they cannot 
successfully raise prices by any significant amount in the current 
environment. More than half the firms are cutting back on capital 
spending in 1993 and there appears to be continued pressure to 
moderate wage increases and reduce employment. Two-thirds of the 
firms expect exports to grow at the same rate or somewhat faster 
than last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employment in the District will probably be boosted by the 
construction of a new 776-bed building by New York Hospital and a 
new $250 million Westchester shopping mall for which construction 
financing was recently arranged. The mall is, reportedly, largely 
pre-leased to several well-known retail chains. Upstate, the 
Syracuse area will soon have a new plastics container plant, 
initially employing 200 workers, and the area will see the expansion 
of an automotive plant which will create almost 200 more jobs. 
Finally, the District's entertainment industry has received some 
good news: the David Letterman show will remain in New York City 
and, after a period of reduced activity, some film companies are 
reportedly again producing movies in the City.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The latest survey of small and midsized banks in the Second District 
showed a sharp increase in banks' willingness to make certain types 
of loans. The percentage of banks more willing to make 
nonresidential, and commercial and industrial loans was the highest 
since a year ago, while the percentage of banks more willing to make 
consumer loans was comparable to June 1992. The percentage of banks 
more willing to make residential loans showed little change from 
previous months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Responses concerning loan demand were mixed. A majority of officers 
reported that loan demand from small businesses was unchanged or 
higher than one year ago. Respondents noted, however, that consumer 
loan demand weakened over the past two months, and that refinancing 
remained sort after heavy activity during October and November.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly all loan officers reported no change in their credit 
standards during the preceding two months, and delinquency rates for 
all types of loans were unchanged or lower.
