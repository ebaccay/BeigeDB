      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      It is increasingly apparent that the California economy is growing 
modestly, and in the remainder of the Twelfth District economic 
conditions generally remain strong. However, reports suggest that 
economic growth in Idaho and Utah is moderating relative to the 
earlier robust pace. Among sectors, retail sales are strong, and 
conditions in the service industry generally remain solid. 
Manufacturing production remains strong outside of the aerospace 
industry. Agricultural conditions are mixed, with weak prices 
reported for several important District crops. Real estate and 
construction activity remains at high levels in most pans of the 
District, but expectations for future construction levels have been 
marked down. Loan demand generally is increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The survey of Twelfth District business leaders finds they generally 
remain optimistic about real activity, but they expect a pickup in 
inflation over the next four quarters. About two-thirds of the 
respondents expect inflation to worsen, and most of the remaining 
one-third expect no further progress on inflation next year. About 
two-thirds of the respondents expect national growth to exceed 2 1/2 
percent during the next four quarters, a higher fraction than in 
September. Regional growth over the next four quarters is expected 
to exceed the national average in Arizona, Oregon, and the 
intermountain states, match the national average in Washington, and 
be only slightly weaker than the nation in California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Generally solid retail and service sector conditions continue to be 
reported in most parts of the District. In California, Idaho, and 
Oregon, motor vehicle sales are reported to be strong, creating 
shortages of some new models, especially full-size domestic trucks. 
In Southern California, retail sales in August were up 1.8 percent 
from a year earlier. Reports from Reno, Nevada and the San Francisco 
Bay Area are cautiously optimistic about holiday season retail 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism is strong or improving in most of the District. Hotel 
occupancy in Salt Lake City remains high. In Southern California, 
hotel industry conditions have improved significantly but remain 
below pre-recession levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions are mixed among other service industries. In Oregon, 
business services employment growth has been strong. In the tri-
cities area of eastern Washington, economic activity is being held 
down by cost-cutting at firms under contract to the Department of 
Energy. In some areas, sales of hospital suppliers are weak, as 
continued mergers have slowed major purchasing decisions at 
hospitals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets are reported to be tight in many areas, especially for 
jobs in the retail and service sectors. In several District states, 
openings for entry level jobs in food stores are remaining vacant at 
current wages; food store wages are expected to rise 4 to 5 percent 
in 1995, after rising 3 to 3 1/2 percent in 1994. In Idaho, wages 
for experienced computer programmers have increased sharply in the 
past year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing production is recovering further, although 
additional restructuring is holding down employment in some areas. 
In the Pacific Northwest, heavy-duty truck manufacturing is 
expanding, but commercial aerospace production has not yet 
rebounded. Pulp, paper, and newsprint orders are strong, and 
inventories are declining. In Oregon, further increases in several 
large high technology projects have been announced. In Idaho, the 
elimination of 600 jobs by one large high technology manufacturer is 
expected to be partly offset by expansion at another manufacturing 
firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural production remains strong, but farm income is being 
held down by falling prices for some crops. Prices are reported weak 
for potatoes, apples, barley, and corn. In eastern Oregon and 
Washington, wheat yields are good and prices are high. California 
specialty crop producers report continued strong export demand and 
note that packaging and ocean freight costs are increasing. Cattle 
prices remain low, and the cattle feeding industry is reported to 
have lost a substantial amount of equity in the last several years. 
Cattle producers in eastern Oregon report a lack of irrigation 
water. Without sufficient rainfall, drought conditions in 1995 are 
predicted to be severe in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate activity generally remains at high levels despite some 
slowing in parts of the District. In the intermountain states, home 
sales have slowed, especially at the higher end of the market; sales 
price increases are expected to moderate in 1995. In Idaho, 
apartment vacancy rates are reported to be increasing. In the 
Pacific Northwest, some slowing of Washington home sales was 
reported, but otherwise activity remains robust. Within California, 
home prices are reported below year-earlier levels in most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity remains at a high level in many parts of the 
District, but growth has moderated in some areas. After earlier 
strong gains, housing starts slowed in Utah, and commercial 
construction activity slowed in Idaho. In Los Angeles as a whole, 
housing permits are up sharply, but construction of affordable 
housing remains weak. Increases in building activity continue in 
Arizona and Oregon. Respondents from Idaho, Oregon, and Utah noted a 
shortage of skilled construction workers. Construction wages and 
costs of raw materials are reported to be increasing rapidly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking conditions generally are strong, with solid loan 
demand in most areas. At large California banks, business loan 
demand has picked up, but consumer lending remains sluggish. Bank 
lending policies are reported to be increasingly aggressive. In most 
geographic areas, employment at banks is expected to remain weak, 
owing to consolidations and other cost-cutting efforts. Wage 
increases at banks are expected to be moderate, except for some 
entry level positions.
