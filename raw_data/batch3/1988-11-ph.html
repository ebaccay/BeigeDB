      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 30, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A mid-November survey of business conditions in the Third District 
indicates continuing growth in most sectors. Manufacturing was 
posting its tenth month of expansion, with growth running at about 
the same pace as it has since spring. Retail sales were rising 
modestly, and a slight pickup in year-to-year gains first noted in 
October was continuing. Automobile sales in October and early 
November were up from the same period last year for domestic makes 
but down for imports. Business and personal lending continue to 
rise, although the pace of growth appeared to be easing in recent 
weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business continuity is for more 
growth, but with some reservations about the extent of further gains 
over the winter. Manufacturers see the current expansion continuing, 
but optimistic forecasts are not as prevalent as current reports of 
improvement. Nevertheless, capital spending plans are fairly strong, 
on balance, and firms scheduling additions to plant and equipment 
are looking to boost capacity by 5 to 20 percent over the next six 
months. Retailers forecast fiscal fourth quarter sales of about 3 
percent above last year, in real terms, but express more than the 
usual amount of uncertainty about the outlook. Bankers see signs 
that growth in loan demand is slowing, but they say money market 
conditions could push lending rates up nevertheless.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's manufacturing sector is still on an upward track, 
according to the November Business Outlook Survey. Among firms 
polled for the survey, 34 percent said business was picking up from 
October while only 6 percent said business was off. Manufacturers of 
nondurable goods reported somewhat better conditions than did 
durable goods makers, but both sectors showed improvement month-to-
month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly all indicators of industrial activity were signaling growth 
in November. New orders and shipments were rising, order backlogs 
were edging up, and delivery times were being stretched somewhat as 
local manufacturers posted the tenth consecutive month of growth. 
Employment continued to gain as well. Twenty-four percent of the 
firms participating in the November survey were adding to payrolls 
while only 11 percent were cutting back.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward price pressure is still being reported. Among November survey 
respondents, 61 percent noted rising input costs and 32 percent 
indicated they were raising the prices of their own products. 
Looking ahead, 66 percent expect to pay higher prices for the goods 
they will buy over the next six months and 60 percent intend to 
charge more for the goods they make.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area manufacturers see good business conditions lasting at least 
through the winter. Thirty-eight percent of the firms contacted in 
November expect more growth over the next six months while 17 
percent see signs of a slowdown ahead. Overall, survey participants 
forecast increases in employment, new orders and shipments, although 
they anticipate an easing in order backlogs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local manufacturers' capital spending plans call for increases, on 
balance, for the next six months. Thirty-six percent of the November 
survey respondents intend to step up investment while only 13 
percent will cut back. Planned increases, for both modernization and 
capacity expansion, are prevalent in the chemical, textile, and 
nonelectrical machinery industries. Some area firms in these 
industries have scheduled investment projects that will boost 
capacity in a range of 5-20 percent at certain plants over the next 
six months, although most describe the amount of the increase in 
their capital expenditures as modest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers report that sales were better than expected 
in October and a good pace was being maintained in the first half of 
November. Sales of women's apparel appear to be on the rebound after 
a long period of weakness, but merchants say price increases are 
coming that could dampen shoppers' enthusiasm. Store officials 
indicate that inventories are in line with current and projected 
sales, and they say that discounting, while widespread, is in 
accordance with planned pricing strategies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area merchants are reluctant to predict the outcome of the Christmas 
shopping season because the competitive situation in the region is 
in flux, with major chains still working out their consolidation 
moves. Nevertheless, most retailers anticipate a satisfactory 
season, although expectations are that the year-to-year improvement 
in 1988 will be less than in the past few seasons. The consensus 
forecast is that fiscal fourth quarter (November-January) sales will 
be around 3 percent higher, in real terms, than the year-ago period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers in the region report mixed results for October 
and early November. Domestic makes are selling above last year's 
pace but imported cars are selling below the rate of a year ago. 
Dealers expect sales to be good through the end of the year, after 
accounting for the usual winter slowness. However, dealer 
inventories have inched up lately and there could be a step-up in 
manufacturers' rebates and dealer discounts to boost sales in 
December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers contacted in mid-November described loan 
growth as good, but easing in recent weeks. Total loan volume at 
major Third District banks grew at an annual rate of 12 percent in 
October, but bankers say most categories of lending have been 
growing somewhat more slowly since. Commercial and industrial 
lending in October was up 18 percent from the year-ago period at 
major banks but growth appeared to be declining in November. Lending 
officers say requests for commercial credit are continuing at a high 
rate, but the average credit quality of business loan applicants has 
fallen below standards, and growth in loans booked is slackening as 
a result. Real estate lending, while still expanding strongly, 
continues on its year-long trend of slowing growth. The rate of 
increase in consumer loan volume eased somewhat in October, but 
bankers said recent promotional efforts were reviving the pace of 
growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      While deposits at major banks have been growing at a fairly steady 6 
percent annual rate since mid-year, bankers interviewed in mid-November said their costs of funds have been rising. According to 
some, current money market conditions make increases in bank lending 
rates likely.
