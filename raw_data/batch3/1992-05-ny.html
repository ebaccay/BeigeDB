     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on recent developments in the District remain basically 
mixed but with a more positive tone about the outlook than in recent 
months. District homebuilders noted increased buyer interest and 
office leasing activity continued at a moderate pace. District 
unemployment rates fell in March. March sales results varied widely 
at District department stores while the surveys of purchasing 
managers in Buffalo and Rochester moved in divergent directions. 
Most loan officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change 
in their willingness to lend from two months earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results at District department stores varied widely during 
March from sizable over-the-year declines to sizable over-the-year 
gains. Year-to-year changes ranged from -13 percent to +13 percent 
and from somewhat below to substantially above plan. However, most 
contacts stressed the difficulty of evaluating their results because 
of the different Easter dates this year and last. In addition, 
several chains hold major spring promotional events which shift from 
year to year between March and April.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the first time in many months several respondents cited 
furniture and various kinds of home furnishings as the best-selling 
items in March. Men's and women's apparel sales were mixed. 
Inventories at the end of March were generally on or slightly below 
plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Groundbreaking is scheduled for the first week in May at a long-
delayed shopping mall on Long Island and plans were announced for 
construction of a three-level, glass-enclosed mall in the Bronx 
close to the huge Co-op City apartment complex. Two major department 
store chains have agreed to be the anchors at the Bronx mall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders report increased buyer interest during recent 
weeks which they attributed to lower mortgage rates and two years' 
worth of pent-up demand. Attendance at spring home shows has been 
greater than in 1991 and in many areas sales of new and existing 
homes are relatively strong. As a result builders are more 
optimistic about the housing market than they have been in quite 
awhile and definitely expect sales in 1992 to be stronger than last 
year's. A regional builders' association is projecting an increase 
in New York State housing starts this year of about 12 percent from 
their record-low 1991 level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity continued at a moderate pace in recent weeks 
as firms took advantage of lower rents and other concessions in 
newer buildings to upgrade their quarters. Nevertheless, office 
vacancy rates rose during the first quarter in several areas 
including northern New Jersey, Westchester County, and Fairfield 
County (Connecticut). Corporate restructuring, moves out of the 
region, and, in New Jersey, a sizable amount of new construction, 
were major factors putting upward pressure on vacancy rates. Despite 
these trends, vacancy rates on Long Island and in downtown Manhattan 
showed some improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates fell in March, reversing their February 
increases. New York's rate dropped to 8.0 percent from 8.9 percent 
in February while New Jersey's declined to 7.1 percent from 7.6 
percent in February. Against March's improved unemployment rates, 
the regional Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner recently stated 
that, between April 1989 and February 1992, job losses in New York 
State totaled 500,000, the state's most severe contraction on 
record. In recent months, however, job losses in both New York and 
New Jersey have slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The March surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
were mixed. An increased percentage of Rochester firms reported 
better business conditions whereas in Buffalo fewer firms reported 
an improvement in new orders and production. In both areas, however, 
as has persistently been the case, the majority of firms reported 
stable to improved conditions. The percentage of firms noting higher 
input prices declined in both areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      A recent favorable development was New York City's announcement that 
it will end this fiscal year with a surplus rather than the 
previously projected deficit. Due in part to record profits on Wall 
Street, revenues were higher than expected. Also reflecting the 
improvement on Wall Street, investment banks have reportedly hired 
twice the number of MBAs as in 1991. New York City's economy is also 
getting a boost from the largest number of Broadway shows in recent 
memory, several of which are sell-outs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District indicated that they are as willing to lend as 
they were two months ago, although a few respondents did report 
tightening their credit standards and none reported easing. The 
number of banks reporting an increased willingness to make consumer 
loans grew slightly, to one quarter of those surveyed, while the 
percentage expressing increased willingness to make real estate or 
business loans declined relative to the last survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand was reported to be generally stable or somewhat 
increased. Demand for residential mortgages remained steady, though 
refinancing activity slowed. Consumer loan demand showed signs of 
improvement during the period, despite a weakness in the demand for 
automobile loans. In addition, several respondents indicated an 
increase in the demand for business loans relative to two months 
ago. Loan rates largely remained unchanged, although some surveyed 
loan officers did indicate lowering their rates recently in response 
to a downward trend evident in the market. A majority of respondents 
also reported no change or a decrease in loan delinquency rates 
during the period, which they attributed to their increased internal 
controls as well as improvements in the economic environment.
