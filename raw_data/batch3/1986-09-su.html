      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 10, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      All districts continue to report sluggish economic growth. Retail 
sales continued to improve over the summer with moat districts 
reporting strong consumer demand. Prices are stable and largely 
unaffected by the lower value of the dollar. Manufacturing, however, 
generally remains weak. Homebuilding continues strong, but high 
vacancy rates and the provisions of the new tax legislation have 
caused nonresidential construction to lag. Both commercial and 
consumer lending  have slowed, while mortgage lending remains 
strong. Crop yields will set new records in many Midwestern states, 
but will strain grain storage capacity. Recent rains have improved 
prospects for some crops in the drought-affected Southeast, but have 
arrived too late to help the corn crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts report strong retail sales. This general strength 
represents an improvement over the last Beige Book. Boston and New 
York indicated sales above retailers' expectations. New York 
reported that merchants feel that the lower value of the dollar is 
responsible for increased sales to foreign visitors. Dallas 
indicated that, although sales remain depressed, retailers 
anticipate improvements later in the year. Inventories were reported 
to be at desirable levels. All districts reporting on prices 
signaled continued price stability and little or no evidence of 
increasing import prices due to the lower value of the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts reported sluggish domestic auto sales. Philadelphia 
and Chicago, however, reported strong sales. Sales of imported cars 
were strong in all reporting districts despite recent price 
increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cleveland and Minneapolis reported declines in unemployment rates, 
while weakening labor markets were noted by Atlanta and St. Louis. 
The steel industry showed little improvement, with the month-long 
shutdown of USX lingering and a layoff of 2,000 workers in the 
Midwest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chicago indicated that work stoppages this year have held back 
production more than in recent years. Both New York and Chicago 
reported shortages of skilled labor for the homebuilding industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although Philadelphia and Richmond noted that shipments and new 
orders were up in August, widespread reports of flat or slightly 
decreased industrial activity suggest little improvement in the 
performance of the manufacturing sector in most parts of the 
country.
     </p>
     <p>
      San Francisco indicated that the dollar's depreciation has had 
little impact on most manufacturers, while Atlanta reported that it 
has helped the pulp and paper industry by allowing higher prices for 
some of their products. Boston reported downward pressure on the 
prices of manufactured goods due to competition from both importers 
and domestic producers. Philadelphia and Atlanta indicated 
manufacturers in their districts expect improvement in the next six 
months; those in the Fourth District anticipate little change. 
Chicago reported that demand for steel for appliances and 
construction has increased this year, but is down for autos and the 
oil and gas industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco reported lower levels of oil 
rig activity. All three districts, however, indicated that the 
recent increases in the price of oil may signal a bottom to the 
decline of oil drilling activity. Minneapolis also indicated lower 
production of oil, gas and coal in North Dakota and Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts continue to report healthy homebuilding activity. 
Contacts in Cleveland expect a robust residential housing market for 
the remainder of 1986 and into 1987. The Southern Florida and 
Atlanta markets are softening, and contacts in Kansas City 
anticipate housing starts to flatten or decline for the rest of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction is slowing in most areas. High vacancy 
rates reported by New York and Atlanta and concern over tax reform 
have affected commercial construction. Atlanta noted, however, that 
the national concern over the effects of tax reform on commercial 
real estate is not shared by local developers who feel that regional 
economic conditions will far outweigh any negative effects of tax 
reform.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans appear to be expanding at a slower rate than previously 
reported. The growth of commercial and industrial lending has slowed 
in most districts. San Francisco attributed this slackening to 
reduced loan demand for tax shelter and commercial real estate 
projects as a result of expected tax law changes. Philadelphia and 
St. Louis, however, reported strong commercial loan activity. Small- 
and mid-sized banks in the Second District indicated increased 
competition for commercial loans stemming primarily from the large 
regional banks and smaller bank holding companies. Most districts 
noted that the rate of consumer loan growth is slowing. Philadelphia
reported that the growth of credit card lending in particular has 
slackened and Third District bankers expect a further slowing in 
consumer lending. Cleveland, on the other hand, noted strength in 
consumer installment lending, expanding at an annual rate of 15 
percent thus far in the third quarter. Residential mortgage demand 
remains strong in most regions with Atlanta attributing their real 
estate loan growth to heavy refinancing activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Very favorable growing conditions will result in record-breaking 
yields of corn and soybeans in Midwestern states. The expected large 
harvests and low prices have caused a shortage of grain storage 
capacity. Livestock producers in most regions are benefiting from 
low feed costs and higher livestock prices. Recent rainfall in the 
Southeast has improved prospects for the area's soybeans, cotton and 
pastures, but has come too late to help the corn crop. Reports from 
San Francisco suggest the lower value of the dollar has reduced 
imports of foreign seafood and has aided the increase in exports of 
forest products to Far Eastern markets.
