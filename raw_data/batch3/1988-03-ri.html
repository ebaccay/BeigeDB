      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity expanded in February, although 
homebuilding and housing sales were unchanged, and retail sales 
declined. Manufacturers reported strong growth, and they are 
optimistic about growth prospects in the next six months. District 
retailers, too, are optimistic about growth prospects in the next 
six months, despite sluggish sales in recent weeks. Financial 
institutions report higher loan demand in all major categories, and 
bankers share the optimism of retailers and producers. Agriculture 
is reported to be in generally better condition than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Thirty-eight percent of the District retailers responding to our 
regular mail survey reported declines in sales in February, while 30 
percent reported increases. Many respondents indicated that they had 
increased discounting and promotions since the beginning of the 
year. Although the majority of the respondents indicated no change 
in inventories, 32 percent reported increases. Two-thirds of the 
retailers expect increases in sales in the next six months, compared 
to 14 percent who expect declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from department stores generally indicated weaker activity 
than in the retail sector as a whole. Half of the department store 
respondents said sales declined during February, while 25 percent 
said sales had increased. Nearly 70 percent experienced declines in 
sales of big ticket items. Department stores also reported slight 
declines in employment and little change in inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity increased in February compared to 
its pace in January. Forty-six percent of the respondents to our 
survey reported higher shipments in February, up from 34 percent who 
reported increases in January. Reports of reduced shipments remained 
at only about 15 percent. Increases were also reported in new 
orders, backlogs of orders, employment, and the length of the 
workweek. About half of our respondents reported that inventories of 
finished goods and raw materials were unchanged from a month 
earlier, while about one-third reported increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prices of raw materials and finished products rose further, 
according to District manufacturers. One-third said they had raised 
their product prices, and 64 percent said the prices they paid for 
raw materials had risen. Almost none reported price reductions. In 
addition, two-thirds of our survey respondents who use imported 
materials noted price increases in these inputs since the beginning 
of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers expert their activity to continue to rise in the next 
six months. About 48 percent of the respondents believe their 
shipments and new orders  will rise—a proportion almost equal to 
the high recorded in the early fall of 1987—while about 14 percent 
expect orders to decline. One-third expect the lower dollar to boost 
their sales this year. Thirty-nine percent plan to increase their 
capital expenditures in the next six months—the highest 
percentage reporting such expansion plans since last August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal production in the District during the first three weeks of 
February was slightly above production during the same period last 
year. Although the United Mine Workers contract expired on January 
31, there were no reported work stoppages. Most union-affiliated 
coal companies in the District are operating under new contracts, 
although a few are still negotiating.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Half of the District realtors and builders surveyed by telephone 
reported that home sales in February were unchanged from a year ago. 
The remaining half was about evenly split between those reporting 
increases and those reporting declines. Most of the activity in the 
market was in homes priced above $150,000. In the Washington, D.C., 
area, however, condominiums priced near $100,000 were selling well. 
In Baltimore, sales of new homes in the $80,000 to $100,000 range 
have been depressed in recent months, although lower and higher 
priced houses have been selling well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our contacts in the agriculture sector report that farmland prices 
appear to be strengthening throughout the District, and that farmers 
are generally optimistic about their income prospects. Tobacco 
exports are expected to continue strong. Peach growers expect a good 
crop as the winter weather has been cold enough to keep buds from 
swelling and opening prematurely. However, poultry processors and 
pork producers are in the down phase of their cycle, with lower 
prices expected to persist. Subsoil moisture conditions are reported 
to be good in Maryland and Virginia, but conditions have been dry in 
parts of the Carolinas, prompting alerts of forest fire dangers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our telephone survey of District financial institutions indicated 
slightly higher demand for commercial, consumer, and home mortgage 
loans in February. Two-thirds of the respondents said they 
anticipate increased demand for both consumer loans and loans 
secured by real estate over the next six months. Bankers also 
reported that prospects are good for commercial and industrial loans 
in the months ahead. Respondents attribute their optimism to lower 
interest rates and to their belief that rates will not rise.
