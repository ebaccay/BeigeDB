      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District appears to be relatively 
sluggish. Retail sales are down slightly from a year ago, although 
auto sales remain comparable to sales a year earlier. Prices remain 
generally stable, at retail and for manufacturers' inputs. Housing 
starts are also off from a year ago, though sales of new homes are 
generally up. Future mortgage demand is expected to be stronger, as 
rates are expected to decline further. Agricultural lenders and 
borrowers in the district are both facing continuing difficulties. A 
good winter wheat harvest is well under way in Tenth District 
states. Bank loan demand is flat while deposits are generally 
higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers report that sales are down slightly from year-ago 
levels. Clothing, home furnishings, appliances, and electronic items 
are all selling more slowly. As a result, some retailers are 
trimming their inventories. Most retailers expect sales to pick up 
before yearend, however, and plan no major cutbacks in inventories. 
Retail prices remained stable during the past three months and are 
expected to remain stable in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile dealers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers report that sales are comparable with year-ago 
levels. Sales are being spurred by manufacturers' low financing 
rates and, to a less extent, by recent declines in other interest 
rates. Inventory levels are largely satisfactory, and caution rules 
out inventory building in the near future. Most dealers, however, 
are optimistic that 1985 sales will be as good or slightly better 
than strong 1984 sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report that input prices remained constant during 
the past three months. Most expect constant input prices through the 
end of the year. No difficulties in obtaining materials are 
reported, and none are anticipated. Satisfaction with current 
materials inventories is mixed. Most agents report some trimming of 
inventories due to seasonal and firm-specific factors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders report that housing starts are down slightly to sharply 
from a year ago. Starts are expected to remain steady or increase 
slightly through the end of the year. Building materials are readily 
available, and materials prices are stable or rising slowly. Sales 
of new homes are generally up, as are new home prices. Savings and 
loans report that mortgage demand and commitments are up except in 
Colorado and Wyoming. Future mortgage demand is expected to be 
strong, since mortgage rates have declined recently and are expected 
to decline further. Savings and loans report larger savings inflows 
than a year ago but expect inflows to slow in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural lenders throughout the Tenth District are continuing to 
write down the value of farm assets, both because examiners are 
pressing banks to keep up with declining asset values, and for 
closer monitoring of loans. Some lenders in Missouri and Oklahoma 
report that their banks have already written farm asset values down 
to market levels. Aggressive writing down of asset values may cause 
these banks to reconsider the creditworthiness of some borrowers. 
Agencies of the farm credit systemâ€”Production Credit Associations 
(PCAs) and Federal Land Bank Associations (FLBAs)â€”appear to be 
writing down farm asset values as well. Bankers in Nebraska and 
Colorado report that some farm credit system borrowers are looking 
for new lenders due in part to rising interest rates on farm credit 
loans, and to perceived risk associated with capital stock in the 
PCA's and FLBA's.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nebraska and Colorado have been especially hard hit by agricultural 
bank closings this year. In both states, farm borrowers at closed 
banks are having difficulty finding alternative sources of credit. 
Agricultural lenders in these states report that successor banks 
have applied higher credit standards, and other banks generally are 
not picking up customers of failed banks. As many as half of these 
customers may be unable to find new sources of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      The wheat crop in the Tenth District is expected to be very good. 
Until interrupted by recent rains, the harvest in Oklahoma and 
southern Kansas was running a week to ten days ahead of schedule, 
and is 95 percent complete in southwest Oklahoma.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spring planting of corn, soybeans, and sorghum in the Tenth District 
is generally on schedule, and in some cases well ahead of the usual 
date. Successful spring planting has produced optimism about crop 
production prospects for the 1985 season, with crop conditions 
overall reported as good to excellent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District banks report total loan demand was constant during 
the last month. Commercial and industrial loans were steady, but 
consumer loan demand grew somewhat. Residential and commercial real 
estate lending were stable, although the strength of real estate 
loan demand varied widely by locality. Several bankers note that the 
level of agricultural lending remains low and that loan quality 
problems persist. All surveyed banks reduced their prime rate during 
the last month, but only half lowered consumer loan rates. Total 
deposits were generally higher with widespread growth in demand 
deposits, Super NOWs, and MMDAs. Although inflows subsided after the 
April 15 tax deadline, IRA and Keogh accounts still rose slightly 
over the month.
