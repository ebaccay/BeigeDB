      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continues to expand in all Federal Reserve 
districts, according to business contacts; there are signs of 
acceleration in the Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia 
districts, while growth has slowed somewhat in the New York 
district. Consumer spending generally remains strong. Many districts 
report increased spending, but several districts report flat or 
slackening retail sales. Auto sales remain very strong. 
Manufacturing activity increased in nearly all districts, and demand 
for business services where reported, has accelerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Single-family construction has declined from fairly high levels 
across much of the country. Most districts report gains in 
commercial real estate activity. Loan demand is advancing at a 
healthy pace in most districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Better-than-expected crop yields have added to record-breaking crop 
and livestock production nationwide, and large supplies have pushed 
down agricultural prices. Energy activity has improved, despite 
relatively weak oil and natural gas prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets are tight or tightening in most districts, although 
tightness is limited to specific sectors. There are a few reports of 
rising wages. Prices of raw and intermediate materials continue to 
rise, and there are increasing reports that manufacturers are 
passing along these costs by raising selling prices. Most districts 
report no change in retail prices, although pressure is building in 
some districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending (which includes automobiles) has picked up in many 
districts and is strong in most. Auto sales continue to be very 
strong across the country, and many dealers still complain that 
inventory shortages are curtailing sales of popular models. 
Generally, however, retailers are comfortable with inventory levels. 
Retail sales were unchanged or below expectations in the Atlanta, 
Cleveland, New York, and Richmond districts. Demand continues to be 
strongest for durable goods, such as furniture, appliances, and 
electronics. Several districts report weak apparel sales, 
particularly women's clothing. Contacts in the Atlanta, Boston, 
Cleveland, and New York districts suggest that unseasonably warm 
weather in September contributed to slow apparel sales. Retailers 
are optimistic about holiday retail sales growth in the Atlanta, 
Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco 
districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity has increased in all districts, and only 
Atlanta and Richmond note a slowing rate of growth since the last 
Beige Book. Demand remains particularly strong for heavy-duty 
trucks, automotive inputs and parts, steel, home appliances, 
electronics, furniture, chemicals, paper, and packaging. Several 
districts report that pulp, paper, and newsprint inventories are 
low, and food producers in the Dallas and San Francisco districts 
note higher packaging costs. In most districts, manufacturers have 
indicated that input prices are rising, and there are increasing 
reports that manufacturers are passing these costs along to 
consumers through higher selling prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The San Francisco district reports continued weakness in the 
commercial aerospace industry, and in the Boston district, demand 
for aircraft parts has dropped at double-digit rates. In Central 
Florida, defense manufacturers' ongoing downsizing and the space 
industry's cutbacks are slowing economic activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The apparel sector continues to shrink in the Atlanta district. 
Apparel demand is steady in Dallas, and producers are optimistic in 
the St. Louis district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In those districts reporting on the service sector, activity appears 
to be accelerating. Demand for business services has increased in 
the Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Richmond, and San Francisco districts. 
Temporary service firms continue to report the strongest growth. 
Tourist activity is reported to be very high in the Atlanta, 
Minneapolis, Richmond, and San Francisco districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family construction continues to decline in most districts, 
but activity remains at fairly high levels in the Atlanta, Chicago, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts and parts of the St. Louis 
district. Sales of existing homes also have slipped in several 
districts, but sales were reported as brisk in the St. Louis 
district and strong in the city of Philadelphia. Home prices are 
reported as stable or lower in the Atlanta, Boston, Kansas City, 
Philadelphia, and Richmond districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets have strengthened in the Atlanta, 
Chicago, Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts, and construction 
is reported as increasing in many of these markets. Lower vacancy 
rates are reported for office markets in the Atlanta, Chicago, 
Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts, and markets for 
multifamily real estate have tightened in the Atlanta and Dallas 
districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand is advancing at a healthy pace across the country. Most 
districts report solid gains in commercial and industrial lending, 
but residential mortgage and refinancing activity continued to slow 
or decline in many districts. Consumer lending is increasing 
modestly in many parts of the country but has declined moderately in 
the Richmond district. Competition among banks for loan customers is 
squeezing margins in several districts, but most bankers report no 
change in credit standards. The San Francisco district reports weak 
bank employment as part of consolidations and other cost-cutting 
efforts. The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts report that 
increased competition for deposits is placing upward pressure on 
funding costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Better-than-expected crop yields in several districts are adding to 
record-breaking crop and livestock production nationwide. High crop 
yields are straining grain storage and handling facilities and 
pushing prices to very low levels. Record levels of production also 
have pushed down livestock prices, and the Chicago district reports 
that hog prices have reached the lowest level in fourteen years. The 
Chicago and Minneapolis districts expect low prices to limit farm 
household income and capital spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts report that 
energy activity has improved, despite relatively weak oil and 
natural gas prices. On-shore drilling in the Dallas and Kansas City 
districts is reported to be below year-ago levels, although drilling 
activity was strong in the Gulf of Mexico, where the number of 
working rigs is the highest since 1990. Mines in the Minneapolis 
district are reported to be running at capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of labor market tightness have increased in most districts, 
but they are limited to specific sectors. There are a few reports of 
rising wages. The Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, 
and St. Louis districts report tighter labor markets, although wages 
are not reported to be rising. In a few parts of the Atlanta 
district, labor market tightness is making it difficult for firms in 
the retail, service, and light industrial sectors to attract and 
retain employees. Cleveland reports labor shortages in the 
industrial sector, while Dallas reports hiring difficulties at 
temporary and trucking firms and in large metropolitan areas. A few 
manufacturers in the Kansas City district report shortages of 
skilled labor, and many contacts in the St. Louis district report a 
shortage of qualified workers for both permanent and seasonal work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor market tightness has led to rising wages only in the Boston, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. San Francisco reports 
tight labor markets, especially for the retail and service sectors, 
and wages are rising at food stores and for experienced computer 
programmers. The San Francisco district also reports a shortage of 
skilled construction workers in Idaho, Oregon, and Utah, where wages 
are increasing rapidly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts continue to report that prices of raw and 
intermediate materials are rising, particularly prices of chemicals, 
plastic, paper, steel, and cotton. Prices of medical and computer 
equipment continue to decline, however. The Dallas, Philadelphia, 
and Richmond districts report that higher costs are being passed 
along through manufacturers' selling prices. A growing number of 
factory contacts in the Atlanta and Cleveland districts expect cost 
pressures to be reflected in finished goods prices soon. Most 
districts report that retail prices have not risen. In the Atlanta 
district, however, pressures are growing, and in the Dallas 
district, retail prices are continuing to fall but at a slower pace.
