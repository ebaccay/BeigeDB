      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 31, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District was generally sluggish in 
mid-October, with further weakening in manufacturing and retail 
trade and mixed reports from the banking sector. Manufacturing 
activity in the region continued to fall in October, and reports of 
slower business were more widespread than they were a month ago. 
Area firms noted declines in orders and shipments and said they were 
trimming employment. Retailers generally said sales were weaker than 
they had expected for the fall. Most reported sales running at or 
below year-ago levels, in dollar terms. Large Third District banks 
have been posting very slight gains in loan volume, overall, during 
the past six weeks. Most of the growth has been in consumer lending, 
including home equity loans, while commercial and industrial loan 
volume continued to fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District business contacts express concern that the regional 
economy could weaken further. Manufacturers expect business to drop 
further over the winter. They generally intend to hold capital 
spending to a steady rate over the next six months, and they plan 
more cuts in employment. Retailers are growing more cautious in 
their outlook. They hope to match the dollar sales level reached in 
the final quarter of last year, but they expect profits to suffer if 
extensive discounting is required to achieve this. Bankers 
anticipate slackening loan demand in all credit categories until the 
economy regains strength and they foresee only a modest rebound in 
lending even with a renewed business expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers in the Third District continued to report 
deteriorating business in October. Over half of the firms contacted 
indicated that activity at their plants in the region was slowing, 
and weakness was noted in every major industry in the region with 
the exception of stone, clay, and glass products. Area firms 
generally were experiencing a downtrend in both new orders and 
shipments, and the declines were more widespread in October than 
they were a month ago. In tandem with the drop in shipments, 
reductions in inventories reported by area firms indicated a slowing 
pace of output. Falling production activity was also reflected in 
deteriorating employment measures; virtually none of the firms 
polled was adding workers, and more than a third of the companies 
surveyed were scaling back working hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the next six months among surveyed manufacturers 
remains pessimistic, on balance. About a third of the local plant 
managers surveyed expect a turn for the better but nearly half 
anticipate further weakening in the industrial sector. The consensus 
forecast is that the slowing trend in new orders and shipments will 
continue over the winter. With the declining pace of business, area 
firms expect to work down both order backlogs and inventories 
further between now and next spring. They also plan more cuts in 
employment. In line with their cautious outlook, area manufacturers 
said they will hold capital spending to a steady rate over the next 
six months, on balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in mid-October overwhelmingly 
indicated that the pace of sales was below their expectations. Most 
said that sales for the past six weeks were flat or below the year-
ago period, in current dollars. The usual fall upturn in sales has 
not materialized, according to merchants, and while some attributed 
this to unseasonably warm weather in recent weeks, the slow sales 
rate has affected all types of goods-not just seasonal merchandise-
and all types of stores in the Third District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants are becoming apprehensive about sales for the rest of the 
year. They hope to match the 1989 final quarter, in dollar terms, 
but say that if price markdowns are necessary to do this their 
profits will drop significantly. Store officials generally said they 
are satisfied with inventories, but stocks could prove excessive if 
sales decline further. One merchant noted that vendors are becoming 
more reluctant to ship under the usual credit terms in light of 
generally poor retail sales prospects and the continuing financial 
difficulties of certain major stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks barely 
increased in September after slipping in July and August, and while 
lending continued to gain slightly in early October, area bankers 
said they did not believe a sustained pickup in loan demand was 
getting underway. Most of the recent growth has been in consumer 
loans; bankers contacted in mid-October said credit card and other 
personal installment lending was moving up slowly but steadily, 
although auto loans were dropping fairly sharply as a result of both 
falling demand and tightened credit standards. Real estate lending 
was also moving up, and bank loan officers indicated that a 
substantial portion of the increase was the result of recent home 
equity loan promotions. Also, some banks were taking residential 
mortgage loans onto their own books as opposed to placing them with 
their mortgage company affiliates. Commercial and industrial loan 
volume in mid-October was still on the downward trend that began 
during the summer. Bankers generally noted weak demand for credit by 
businesses and some said their outstandings were reduced by recent 
charge-offs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District bankers expect a falloff in loan 
demand until the economy regains strength. They anticipate drops in 
all categories of credit until business and consumer spending picks 
up. Some bankers believe that even with an economic upturn, lending, 
especially to businesses, will grow only slowly, due to heightened 
concerns for credit quality and moves by banks generally to improve 
capital ratios.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total deposits at large Third District banks declined in September 
although, overall, deposits have been steady in recent months. 
Bankers surveyed in mid-October said the funding situation was 
adequate given slow current and anticipated asset growth. However, 
some noted developments that portend funding difficulties in the 
longer term; bankers referred to the recent severing of some long-
standing interbank borrowing relationships and declining interest by 
institutional investors in placing uninsured funds with banking 
companies.
