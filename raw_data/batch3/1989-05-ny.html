      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 3, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pattern of developments in the Second District economy was mixed 
since the last report. Unemployment rates fell sharply in New Jersey 
and New York during March, though primarily as a result of fewer job 
seekers, and office leasing activity continued at a moderately rapid 
pace. In contrast, however, demand for new housing varied 
considerably over the District and consumer spending was generally 
slow in March. Most small and mid-sized banks reported that demand 
for home mortgages is approximately unchanged from what it was last 
spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales were sluggish during March. Several 
respondents reported over-the-year declines despite the fact that 
Easter occurred in March this year instead of April as in 1988. As a 
result, sales fell well below targeted levels at most stores 
contacted. Only one chain of department stores reported that sales 
were "right on plan." While some retailers attributed the 
disappointing March results to "un-spring" like weather, others were 
at a loss for explanations. Year-to-year changes in March ranged 
from -6.0 percent to +3.2 percent with sluggishness noted in many 
categories. One category in which sales generally remained good was 
women's apparel, a slow seller throughout 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      In spite of the lackluster sales results, most respondents reported 
that inventories were at satisfactory levels, due in part to large 
markdowns on some items. Based on one weeks results, April is 
showing a better tone than March and respondents were hopeful that 
this would continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey fell by almost one 
percentage point in March as New Jersey's rate hit a record low. The 
improvement was primarily the result of fewer persons seeking work 
rather than a marked increase in employment and may not be 
sustainable in the months ahead. On Long Island, for example, the 
local economy is braced for the continuing impact of the Navy's 
cancellation last December of an attack bomber contract. A loss of 
several thousand more jobs is expected at the aircraft company and 
its suppliers by year-end. In addition, the recent announcement by a 
major New York City securities firm that it plans a substantial 
restructuring which could result in the layoff of a couple of 
thousand employees is also a source of concern. The brokerage 
industry is still feeling the effects of the October 1987 stock 
market crash and a slowdown in retail activity since that time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eighty-four percent of purchasing managers in Rochester and 75 
percent in Buffalo reported stable to improved general business 
conditions in March, virtually unchanged from the February numbers. 
In both cities more than half the surveyed firms reported higher 
prices on the commodities they purchased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Few new investment projects were announced in recent weeks. Among 
the largest of these was a $70 million business park in the 
Rochester area which Eastman Kodak and Pioneer Development 
Corporation hope to begin constructing this year. The park would 
include office buildings, shops, restaurants and hotels to be built 
on vacant land owned by Kodak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for new housing in the District has been mixed in recent 
weeks. A glut of homes in the resale market was cited as a major 
deterrent to homebuilding activity in the New York metropolitan area 
and northern New Jersey. Existing home prices have begun to come 
down somewhat, but many observers believe still lower prices are 
needed before current owners can sell and "move up" to new homes. In 
sharp contrast, homebuilders in several upstate New York communities 
are quite active and home prices are rising in response to strong 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity has been at a moderately strong pace since 
the last report, with vacancy rates showing little or no change. 
Upward pressure on vacancy rates in Manhattan is expected to build, 
however, with the completion of many new commercial buildings now 
under construction and an increased supply of existing office space 
as these new buildings become occupied. Elsewhere in the District, 
the volume of new construction in northern New Jersey and Fairfield 
County has slowed somewhat and some observers believe this 
represents a turning point in the prolonged and rapid expansion of 
those suburban areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Senior officers of most small and mid-sized banks in the Second 
District survey reported that demand for home mortgages is 
approximately the same as last spring. Responses were mixed 
regarding the strength of the bankers' local residential real estate 
market. About half described their local real estate market as 
active, while half, particularly those in the New York City 
metropolitan area, characterized it as soft. Most of the respondents 
have noticed that homebuyers are currently showing greater interest 
in fixed-rate loans, possibly because the rise in interest rates 
from a year ago has seen less for fixed-rate loans than for 
adjustable-rate mortgages. Others speculated that buyers have become 
more favorable toward fixed-rate mortgages because of uncertainty 
about the future course of interest rates. Moreover, despite 
aggressive marketing of home mortgages at some of the banks, few 
were offering concessionary, or so-called "teaser", first-year rates 
on adjustable-rate loans. Though some surveyed bankers believe rates 
will remain stable, most expect rates will decline somewhat over the 
next six months.
