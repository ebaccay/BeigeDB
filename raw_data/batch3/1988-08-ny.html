      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 2, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The expansion in the Second District economy seems to have slowed 
somewhat in recent weeks. The latest purchasing managers surveys 
showed slightly fewer firms reporting stable to improved business 
conditions and retailers experienced lackluster sales. The pace of 
residential construction continues below the year-earlier level and 
demand for luxury housing is down. Office leasing activity has 
picked up, however. Most small- and medium-sized banks have not 
raised interest rates on consumer loans since the prime rate 
increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales at District department stores have continued sluggish since 
the last report. May was especially weak with over-the-year sales 
changes ranging from -5 percent to +2 percent. Although June brought 
some improvement, year-to-year sales results of -1.4 percent to .8 
percent were all below respondents' targets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Various kinds of apparel were cited as problem areas in recent 
weeks. Sales of women's apparel remained poor and sales of young 
men's sportswear were soft as well. In addition, furniture sales 
were down from a year earlier. Accessories, cosmetics and housewares 
moved fairly well, however. Inventories are comfortable for the most 
part, due to heavy promotional activity. Retailers do not anticipate 
much improvement for the rest of the summer but are cautiously 
optimistic about the fall season and the new fashion lineup.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some slowing of the District's economic expansion occurred in recent 
weeks. In both Buffalo and Rochester the percentage of purchasing 
managers reporting improved business conditions declined and the 
percentage reporting a worsening increased. Nonetheless, by far the 
majority of firms-95 percent in Rochester and 79 percent in Buffalo-
report stable to improved conditions. Inventories were generally 
satisfactory following a paring of stocks by some Rochester firms 
with unintended accumulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Foreign corporations figured prominently in recent District 
developments. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held in New Jersey for 
the U.S. headquarters of Jaguar Cars, Inc. and, in its second major 
expansion project in New York in two years, Swiss Bank Corp. bought 
a 27-story building in lower Manhattan to house a training center as 
well as headquarters and offices for some of its U.S. operations. In 
addition, a Japanese firm announced that its new U.S. subsidiary 
will begin producing printer ribbons on Long Island, and a 
subsidiary of a Swedish company plans a $10 million capital 
expansion in Utica.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of homebuilding activity in the Second District generally 
remains somewhat slower than a year ago. Most pent-up demand has 
already been met and buyer resistance to the high level of new home 
prices has been noted in several areas. A few upstate communities 
report strong buying and high levels of residential construction, 
however. While demand for luxury housing has slowed somewhat, a 
number of projects to provide more affordable housing in the New 
York metropolitan area have recently been started or announced. Work 
was begun this spring on a new, 1,200-unit, middle-income townhouse 
complex in the Bronx, the largest low-rise development ever 
undertaken in that borough of New York City. On Long Island in an 
area where 430 moderate-income units are already being built, plans 
are being finalized for 600 more moderately-priced single and two-
family homes on the site of a former, large state hospital complex. 
Finally, in Brooklyn some 300 low-income, low-rise units are being 
built under a new New York City tax abatement program for private 
developers of such housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pickup occurred in commercial real estate activity. Westchester 
County witnessed one of its largest transactions in the past two 
years when a communications company purchased a large office 
building in order to expand operations there. Elsewhere in that 
county, brisk leasing was reported at an office park which is under 
construction. The signing of several large transactions boosted 
office leasing activity in midtown Manhattan recently, and some 
signs of stabilization were noted in downtown Manhattan as well. 
Finally, what is reportedly the largest office lease ever taken by a 
Japanese firm in the U.S. was signed at the $10 billion Newport City 
mixed-use project under construction in Jersey City.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of small- and medium-sized banks in the Second District 
indicated that most have not raised interest rates on loans to 
consumers since the July 14 increase in the prima rate. Though some 
officers anticipate that their bank may raise mortgage rates, few 
expect an increase in rates on consumer installment loans. One 
banker consented that interest rates on consumer loans generally 
fluctuate much less than those on home mortgages. Nearly all 
respondents anticipate rising market interest rates in the second 
half of 1988, though some predicted only minor increases. Most 
bankers said the current market for auto and other consumer 
installment loans is rather weak, with demand either flat or down 
compared with last year. Those with an increase in applications 
noted that their banks had recently mounted aggressive marketing 
campaigns. Several bankers mentioned that home equity loans have 
eroded the popularity of conventional consumer financing due to the 
Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the demand for them continues very 
strong. Delinquency rates on consumer loans have remained steady or 
declined from this time last year, and many respondents were pleased 
with the low delinquency rates on their loan portfolios. Demand for 
bank credit cards was described as good and comparable to last year. 
Some bankers believe future demand will not be as strong due to tax 
law changes reducing interest deductions.
