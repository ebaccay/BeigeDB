      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from business contacts in the Third District in early 
January indicated that economic activity was expanding at a modest 
rate. Manufacturers noted continuing gains in shipments and new 
orders and rising levels of unfilled orders. Retailers said results 
for the Christmas shopping period were in line with or above 
expectations. They reported year-over-year gains averaging around 
five percent, in current dollars, without significant last-minute 
price reductions. Auto dealers reported rising sales. Bankers 
generally said loan volumes outstanding were rising modestly, due 
mainly to growth in consumer lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is for 
continued modest growth. Manufacturers forecast further expansion 
with some gains in employment possible by midyear. Retailers expect 
sales to rise during the first half but they are planning cautiously 
for the period. Auto dealers have a similar outlook. Bankers 
generally anticipate only slight growth for all types of lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued on an upward 
trend as the new year began, according to reports from area 
manufacturers in early January. Almost half of those contacted said 
business was expanding while half indicated they were operating at a 
steady pace. Positive reports outnumbered negative ones in virtually 
all major industries in the District. Around half of all the firms 
contacted were posting gains in both shipments and new orders, and 
only a small percentage were registering decreases. While around 
half noted steady order backlogs, those indicating rising levels of 
unfilled orders outnumbered those with declines by two-to-one. 
Although slightly more companies were hiring now workers and 
expanding hours than were cutting back, a majority was maintaining 
steady employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers generally forecast continued expansion. 
Two-thirds expect shipments and orders to advance at least through 
June and one-third anticipate further increases in order backlogs. 
Although most firms indicate they will hold employment at current 
levels, one-third plan to step up hiring and boost hours over the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Third District retailers contacted for this report said sales 
for the Christmas shopping period met or slightly exceeded their 
expectations. Year-over-year gains averaged around five percent, in 
current dollars. Although some retailers said they were left with 
inventories somewhat above plan for the beginning of January, none 
expressed concern that clearance sales would have a significant 
negative effect on fiscal fourth quarter (November-January) 
profitability.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the relatively good holiday sales results, few Third 
District retailers have expectations of strong growth in the first 
half of 1993. Several noted that credit card usage was high in 
December, and they anticipate a period of slacker sales while 
consumers pay down balances. In general, merchants forecast only 
modest growth in sales through the spring and they expect 
competition among stores to remain keen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers said sales had risen in recent weeks. They are cautious 
in forecasting for 1993 but believe sales for the year could exceed 
the 1992 level by a healthy amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District bankers contacted in early January said 
total loan volumes at their institutions wore rising, albeit slowly. 
Consumer lending was most often mentioned as the strongest credit 
category. Several bankers said demand for auto loans and leases had 
increased in December and there was some carryover of the upward 
trend into early January. Home equity credit lines were also 
reported to be on the rise; however, several bankers noted that loan 
consolidation seemed to be motivating much of the increase as not 
net lending to home equity borrowers was slight. Most of the bankers 
contacted for this report said business loan volume outstanding was 
posting only sluggish growth. In general, they said demand for 
commercial and industrial loans was not strong, and they described 
loan pricing as very competitive. Most bankers also said mortgage 
refinancings were trending down and that the rate of growth in 
purchase-mortgage lending was easing.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, Third District bankers forecast slight growth in lending 
during the first quarter. They say there is little evidence that 
business loan demand will increase substantially and they do not 
expect sustained growth in consumer loan demand until employment and 
incomes are firmly on an upward trend.
