      <strong>
       September 16, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Introduction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month's commentaries on economic developments by the twelve 
Federal Reserve banks suggest general stability, with neither 
accelerating growth nor significant deterioration as near term 
prospects. This is indicated in key words and phrases in district 
summaries: Boston, "retail sales improving, manufacturing in the 
doldrums"; New York, "little growth"; Philadelphia, "same as 
August"; Cleveland, "soft and uneven"; Richmond, no "broadbased 
improvement"; Atlanta, "healthy on balance"; Chicago, "no overall 
pickup or weakening"; St. Louis, "continues to lag"; Minneapolis, "a 
bit weaker"; Kansas City and Dallas, "sluggish"; and San Francisco, 
"signals are mixed". Among economic sectors, however, there are 
significant variations. Perhaps the most troubled sector, at 
present, is agriculture, with prices and income severely depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total employment is growing moderately, but with great variation by 
region. Manufacturing output, overall, is about stable. Mining, 
including oil and gas development, is depressed. Retail sales are 
somewhat stronger, but mainly disappointing. Auto sales have been 
stimulated by special financing. Inventories are in fairly good 
balance, and all types of goods readily available. General price 
inflation is still in check—partly because of the heavy influx of 
imports of a wide range of goods. Business purchases of equipment 
are cautious. Residential construction and demand for building 
materials is vigorous. Nonresidential construction is strong, but 
with concern about overbuilding. Bountiful harvests arc pushing down 
farm prices and income, and causing increasing concern over farm 
credits. Interest rates have not changed much in recent weeks. 
Private credit demand is about stable, with mortgage and consumer 
loans growing, and business loans soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little change is expected in wholesale prices, which are held down 
by ample domestic capacity, large agricultural crops, weak oil and 
gas prices, import competition, and sluggish growth in total 
spending. Surveys in Kansas City, Richmond, and St. Louis suggest 
little change in input or selling prices of manufacturers, and only 
moderate increases at retail.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several districts are not participating in the strong employment 
growth reported for the nation in recent months. Weakest job markets 
are in the Midwest, especially in the Chicago, Cleveland, and St. 
Louis districts. But even San Francisco reports widespread layoffs 
because of the slump in electronics. The strongest job markets may 
be in the Northeast, especially parts of' the Boston and New York 
districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on retail sales are mixed. Boston, Philadelphia, and 
Richmond see improvement, while Kansas City and San Francisco find 
sales stable or down somewhat. Consumer price resistance and heavy 
promotion activity to move merchandise are common. Inventories, 
overall, seem to be in good condition, with increases in line with 
plans. Auto sales have responded strongly to cut rate financing 
programs, but Philadelphia reports concern that sales may drop when 
incentives expire. Cleveland indicates some car dealers regard 
inventories as excessive and may cut orders significantly. Atlanta 
reports increased attendance at District tourist attractions, except 
during the Labor Day weekend, disrupted by Hurricane Elena.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory output, overall, has changed little in the past year, and is 
not likely to rise significantly in the months ahead. Imports 
continue to account for a large, and often growing, share of 
domestic consumption of steel, vehicles, machinery, wood products, 
furniture, textiles and apparel, and chemicals. Among the strongest 
manufacturing sectors are building materials and food processing. 
Motor vehicle production is holding at high levels, but is not 
expected to rise further. Producers of advanced electronics are in a 
severe slump after a rapid rise in 1983-84.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Expenditures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business capital spending prospects appear somewhat weaker, with 
cuts in plans in Philadelphia, Boston, and San Francisco. Chicago 
and Cleveland report reduced demand for heavy trucks and trailers. 
Machine tool orders are mainly for the auto industry and defense, 
with total backlogs far below the levels of the late 1970s.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With some exceptions, business inventories are at acceptable levels, 
even low. Cleveland states that some manufacturers are cutting 
stocks, but Boston reports factory inventories to be "very lean". 
All items are readily available, and, with wholesale prices soft, 
there is no incentive to accumulate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Extractive Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Declines in oil and gas drilling and synfuel facility construction 
are depressing activity in the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, and San 
Francisco districts. A further drop in world oil prices could hit 
these activities even harder. Mining of metal ores is very 
depressed. Richmond reports coal mining as "flat", but likely to 
improve because of low inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction is generally strong, though Chicago reports 
activity far short of peaks in the late 1970s, and Minneapolis and 
San Francisco note that activity varies widely among areas. 
Respondents in Cleveland expect current strength, helped by state 
subsidized mortgage funds as well as lower mortgage rates, to wane. 
New York, however, reports that a high level of activity is expected 
through 1985, with shortages of skilled labor and certain materials. 
Home prices are generally rising in the New York District but co-op 
and condo prices have fallen. Atlanta and San Francisco note that 
the condo market is depressed in some areas. Dallas, in contrast, 
has seen a rise in multifamily permits, after earlier declines. 
Apartment building has been vigorous in the Chicago area, and has 
been boosted in Manhattan ahead of expiration of a local tax break. 
New York and Cleveland report minimal speculative building. 
Philadelphia and Cleveland say demand for mortgages is concentrated 
in fixed-rate loans. San Francisco reports strong demand to 
refinance fixed-rate mortgage loans at lower fixed rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction is reported strong in several districts, but 
vacancy rates are rising. Boston and New York note use of 
concessions such as free rent. Bidding volume suggests continued 
strength in nonresidential building in Chicago into 1986. However, 
Dallas reports that plans are being deferred, suggesting a decline 
in contracts soon. Kansas City notes a shift from office building 
construction toward shopping centers. Construction of streets, 
highways, and water treatment plants is also strong, according to 
several reports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All districts with extensive agriculture report excellent harvests, 
low farm prices, and depressed income. Farm sector problems in 
paying bills and servicing debt are growing. Strong statements on 
the "plight or the farmer" are made by Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, 
Kansas City, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Perhaps the 
greatest stress is in the corn and soybean areas. Farmers in the 
western plains have the additional problem of low yields caused by 
drought.
