      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 31, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Sixth District firms contacted in October report marginally 
slower growth than last month and generally flat year-over-year 
sales. Retailers, with few exceptions, report slower sales in 
September than in August and attribute this to a further erosion in 
consumer confidence. Banking contacts supported this view and 
indicated that in the last month or so consumers have become more 
conservative in taking on new debt and business loan demand has 
softened. Retail contacts were less optimistic this month than last 
concerning their outlook for sales for the remainder of the year and 
into 1991, sentiments echoed by District manufacturers of consumer 
and nondefense goods. However, defense and oil related producers 
cited a recent increase in orders. Most realtors report weaker 
residential and commercial sales in September than in August but a 
few areas in the District are reporting improvements. Recent 
contacts report shortages of skilled labor in oil producing regions 
in the District. They generally indicate that oil price increases 
have not yet been incorporated into the price of most finished 
goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers generally report flat year-over-year sales volume in 
September, as compared to slight growth in previous reports. 
Contacts in Florida and Georgia, our two largest states, report that 
small retailers and department stores are seeing a significant 
reduction in gross receipts. These contacts indicate that 
announcements of layoffs at retail stores are becoming more common, 
some associated with debt-ridden parent companies but others 
associated with weakening sales. In contrast, discount department 
stores are reportedly showing some strength and are largely 
responsible for the aggregate level of retail sales remaining flat. 
Most retail contacts report that floor traffic is off from last 
month and consumers are purchasing less expensive items. These 
reporters still attribute the recent slowing to reduced consumer 
confidence resulting from the recent political and economic 
uncertainties and fueled by the media. A contact in Florida reported 
that the most recent (September) University of Florida Consumer 
Confidence index fell from the July level (their last survey) and 
that the survey's report on the percent of consumers willing to 
undertake big-ticket purchases also slipped. While this survey is 
limited to Florida, the findings generally agree with the 
observations of most retail contacts in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking contacts also report that growing consumer uncertainty was 
reflected in their attitude toward taking on new debt. Consumer loan 
growth in September was at less than half the pace of a year ago. 
Most of the lending officers that were contacted also indicated that 
business loan demand weakened in September reflecting slower 
business activity. The major exception was credit demand by firms 
associated with the health care industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on manufacturing around the District were mixed, with 
defense and oil related activities showing strength while orders 
slowed for most other producers. Contacts in Alabama report that 
military apparel producers are running at full capacity with tens of 
millions of dollars in new contracts awarded since July. Florida 
contacts indicated a pickup in high tech military orders destined 
for the Mid East. Most manufacturing contacts producing goods for 
the private sector reported flat to weakening orders in September. A 
manufacturer of pump and metering equipment reports that orders are 
down 5 to 10 percent. According to this contact, both domestic and 
foreign orders were down: domestic, because his manufacturing 
customers are reducing capital expenditures, and foreign, reflecting 
cessation of business with Iraq and Kuwait. A producer of heating 
and air conditioning equipment reports that total current sales are 
even with a year ago but distributors are now cutting new orders and 
reducing inventories and pre-season air conditioner orders are 
running 14 percent below last year's level. Textile and apparel 
contacts expect the continuing slowdown in orders to last through 
the first of the year. Apparel producers without military contracts 
continue to announce layoffs and plant closings. Textile producers 
report a weakening of orders in the past few weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction contacts indicate that construction activity is 
generally flat throughout the Southeast relative to last year. 
Several contacts indicated that a number of new commercial and 
residential projects were placed on "hold" in September. Realtors in 
most areas of the District indicate substantially weaker sales in 
September relative to last month especially in Florida and Georgia 
while in other areas, such as Louisiana and Alabama, reports were of 
flat to slightly stronger sales. These later reports come from oil 
producing or support areas and areas with significant aerospace 
activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported continued tightening in labor market conditions 
for certain types of workers in oil producing areas. Skilled workers 
such as welders, pipe fitters, engineers, geologists and 
geophysicists are reportedly in short supply in Louisiana. Most 
manufacturing and transportation companies report that oil price 
increases are not yet reflected in higher final product prices to 
consumers. A textile producer noted that the price of synthetic 
fibers has escalated dramatically during the past month with the 
price of nylon, the major component of most synthetic carpet, 
increasing by 12 percent. He added that market conditions for carpet 
do not allow these increases to be passed through to consumers at 
present so the increased costs are shrinking profit margins.
