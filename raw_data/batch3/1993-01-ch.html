      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy strengthened further in December and 
early January, led by consumer spending on durable goods. District 
retailers generally reported that holiday season sales gains 
exceeded expectations, and several retailers noted that sales gains 
held up well in the early post-holiday period. After losing some 
momentum in the third quarter, District manufacturing activity 
strengthened in November and December, particularly as motor vehicle 
production rose. Indicators of District employment remained mixed. 
The consensus forecast of a group of economists from Midwest firms 
called for modest but steady GDP growth in 1993, with key 
contributions from motor vehicles and business fixed investment, two 
areas important for Seventh District manufacturing activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers generally reported better-than-expected holiday 
sales results, and several reports suggested that sales gains held 
up well in late December and early January. Responding to somewhat 
better-than-expected sales, a large department store chain raised 
its plan for first-quarter same-store sales gains to a level in line 
with its experience in the holiday season, and above the pace 
planned for the first quarter at this time last year. Another large 
department store chain reported that same-store sales gains in the 
Midwest ran roughly 5 percentage points above the national average 
during the holiday mason. A toy retailer's sales gains in the 
Chicago area were significantly above its national average. An 
association of small retailers in Illinois reported that members' 
sales gains ran in the high single digits, on average, during the 
holiday season. An association of small retailers in Michigan stated 
that "our people are generally euphoric." One retailer's mail order 
business performed well above plan during the holiday season. This 
contact stated that "hopefully, we've turned the corner, but we 
don't want to get fooled again."
     </p>
     <p>
      Several retailers noted that January will be a critical month for 
this year's plans, and sales gains appear to have held up well in 
the early post-holiday period. A report from a large department 
store chain indicated that sales growth strengthened in the last two 
weeks of December. A large retail chain reported that year-over-year 
sales gains in early January were in line with those posted in 
December, despite a more difficult comparison, and results in the 
Midwest were running slightly ahead of the national average. Early 
January sales gains were led by durable goods, notably appliances, 
furniture, and personal computers. Another large retail chain stated 
that durable goods sales gains held up in early January, after a 
resurgence in the fourth quarter of 1992. This firm recently
accelerated receipt dates for spring merchandise, which should lead 
to more aggressive ordering. A large discount chain reported 
disappointing results for early January, but was optimistic about 
overall consumer spending growth holding up in the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers' surveys and reports from individual 
manufacturers suggest that District manufacturing activity turned 
higher on a seasonally adjusted basis in November and December. In 
December, the overall index for the Chicago survey reached its 
highest level since the official onset of the national recession. 
The recent rebound in the overall index was concentrated in the 
production and new orders components, although the employment 
component also contributed. After slipping slightly in recent 
months, the price component rose in December, but remained at a 
level well below those experienced in the late 1980s. The director 
of the Detroit purchasing managers' survey characterized December's 
results as "no doubt the most encouraging news we've had in several 
years ... the economy is maintaining the recovery momentum it 
developed late last year." The survey's overall index remained 
essentially flat in December, but only after a spike in November 
that lifted it to a three-year high. In the fourth quarter of 1992, 
the strengthening in the overall Detroit Index was led by responses 
from participants in the auto industry. A large auto producer 
reported that showroom traffic posted a strong increase on a 
seasonally adjusted basis in recent months. Citing improvement in 
orders from the auto industry, a steel industry analyst expected 
steel production to rise in the first quarter to a level 18 percent 
above a relatively weak year-earlier period. A machine tool producer 
reported some slowing in orders in recent months, but this was 
attributed to temporary uncertainty about prospective tax 
legislation. An office furniture producer stated that sales ran flat 
with weak year-earlier levels during recent months, but the company 
also reported new orders' gains and expected improved sales in the 
new year. An electronics manufacturer stated that orders for 
semiconductors from overseas markets have been holding up well in 
spite of slowing growth in those economies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Alternative data sources continued to depict varying degrees of 
recovery in District labor markets, but the overall picture is 
generally one of improvement. Household survey estimates for 
Illinois and Michigan and local area unemployment statistics data 
for the other District states show a continuing recovery in total 
District employment in recent months. Since late 1991, when total 
employment (as measured by the household survey data) bottomed out, 
the recovery in these measures has been closely in line with the 
pace of the recovery from the 1981-82 recession, and total District 
employment now exceeds the levels that prevailed at the onset of the 
recession. Establishment survey estimates for Illinois and Michigan 
hint at a modest upturn in recent months, but the estimates for 
these states have been essentially flat since their recessionary 
lows in 1991. In Indiana, Iowa, and Wisconsin, where direct 
household survey estimates are unavailable, establishment survey 
estimates have reached and exceeded current measures of pre-
recession levels. The underlying trend in the employment components 
of the Chicago and Milwaukee purchasing managers' surveys have 
followed paths similar to past recoveries. Employers continued to 
express concern about the impact of rising health care costs as a 
factor in restraining hiring and contributing to layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A reserved but optimistic mood prevailed at a recent outlook 
conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Concerns 
persisted in some areas, but belief in the sustainability of the 
recovery seemed increasingly firmly rooted. The median forecast of 
24 economists called for year-over-year real GDP growth of 28 
percent in 1993. Key contributions were anticipated for business 
fixed investment and consumer spending on motor vehicles, two 
important sectors for District production. Car and light truck sales 
were forecast to rise about 10 percent to 14.0 million units in the 
new year, while the median forecast for housing starts called for a 
12 percent increase to 1.353 million units in 1993.
