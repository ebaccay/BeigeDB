      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District remain favorable. Orders and shipments in 
the industrial sector are continuing to expand, and an increasing 
proportion of manufacturers report adding workers to their payrolls. 
Construction activity is still good, with perhaps less of the new 
growth coming from residential and more from commercial and 
industrial building. The retail sector appears to have rebounded 
from its spring slowdown, although weather and price discounting may 
have temporarily propped up apparel sales. Loan demand is holding 
solid, with household borrowing reportedly brisk. Commercial 
borrowing is also growing, although alternative credit sources have 
apparently cut into the business of some commercial banks for this 
product.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's industrial sector continues to exhibit vigorous growth, 
particularly in areas related to motor vehicle production and 
capital goods. Several District producers report record shipments 
and orders for the second quarter, and early third-quarter returns 
suggest a continuation of that trend. A few capital goods makers 
indicate backlogs of six to eight months, roughly twice the typical 
level. While domestic demand for capital goods remains high, foreign 
orders are apparently on the rise. Even capital goods orders for 
European customers have apparently turned the corner and are now 
headed modestly higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicle producers are equally upbeat, and this strength is reflected 
across a range of suppliers. Paints, metals, glass, and components 
producers are all reporting solid production levels. New hires are 
becoming increasingly common, and several firms note shortages of 
skilled labor. Cost pressures remain moderate, although rising 
prices are noted for metals and paperboard and packaging. Despite 
the exceptional orders and production numbers, many manufacturers in 
the District indicate that competitive pressures are still 
restraining their ability to raise prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retailers report that sales picked up substantially 
in June after declines in May and April, and the pace of improvement 
apparently increased during the first two weeks of July. Much of the 
early July gain appears to have been associated with aggressive 
post-holiday clearance sales, and retailers generally expect markets 
to settle into a slower, more sustainable growth pattern moving into 
the fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      While electronics, furniture, and building materials continue to 
sell well, demand has broadened to include "soft" goods such as home 
furnishings-perhaps a lagged effect of the strong residential 
building activity earlier in the year. Apparel sales have also 
improved, although District sources say that hot June temperatures 
and summer price discounts may have had a temporary influence.
     </p>
     <p>
      Traditional department stores appear to be the primary beneficiaries 
of the recent sales gains, with most reporting year-to-year 
improvements of 5 percent or so. Sales by discounters are being 
spread over an increasing number of competitors and individual 
companies have had mixed results. Specialty stores, especially 
apparel outlets, continue to lose ground in year-to-year 
comparisons, although monthly declines are diminishing. By contrast, 
these same companies are reporting growth in their catalog 
divisions-in most cases double-digit improvements from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price competition is reported to be severe in most retail markets, 
and some margins are being squeezed by rising merchandise costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District motor vehicle dealers are upbeat about their recent 
sales performance as well as about the upcoming 1995 model year. 
After a brief spring respite, most were again reporting year-to-year 
sales gains in June, and although profit margins remain thin, they 
have improved as consumer demand has risen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dealers report continuing shortages of popular auto and sport 
utility vehicles. Given demand levels and capacity constraints faced 
by U.S. motor vehicle manufacturers, dealer association respondents 
anticipate continuing shortages of certain cars and trucks 
throughout the remainder of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area dealers are following the industry trend of increasing leases 
as a percentage of total sales They note that some automakers are 
boosting incentives on leases even as they reduce them on straight 
sales. Lease arrangements have also become more attractive as 
interest rates have risen 50 to 75 basis points in major Fourth 
District markets over the past few months. The Japanese automakers 
have been particularly successful in the leasing segment of the new 
car market. Even as the rising yen and other factors have pressured 
purchase prices upward on new vehicles, aggressive leasing plans 
have allowed them to offer competitive monthly payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, respondents say that they expect price increases on the 
1995 models to average in the 3 to 6 percent range, as new car 
demand is expected to remain high. They do not believe sales have 
been significantly affected by recent interest rates hikes, although 
cash sales have reportedly picked up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lending Activity
Lending activity round the District is good, with most borrowing 
occurring at the household level. Consumer credit demand is up, and 
some banks report an improving mortgage credit market However, the 
rise in mortgage rates was generally thought to have lessened the 
pace of home sales. Also expanding are commercial loans, 
particularly for small and mid-sized borrowers. A few institutions 
indicate that the fall-off in residential construction activity has 
been offset by an increased incidence of commercial building, and at 
least one banker observed that loan covenants on commercial building 
had been relaxed. Several banks indicated that nonbank credit 
sources remain a competitive alternative to commercial banks. While 
some deposit runoff has been seen, the fund outflows from commercial 
banks have apparently been modest, and a few institutions report a 
small rise in retail CD volume.
