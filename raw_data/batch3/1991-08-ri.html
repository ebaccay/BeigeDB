      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic performance was mixed from June through mid-July, 
and some of those surveyed expressed concern over the evidently slow 
and uneven pace of the recovery. Manufacturing improved, but 
retailing and commercial lending apparently did not, and no 
improvement was seen or expected in commercial real estate. Most 
state budgets had been balanced; at the time of the survey, however, 
South Carolina and the District of Columbia were still revising 
their spending plans. Agricultural conditions remained favorable, 
though inadequate rain threatened crops in some parts of the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular survey of retailers indicated that business slowed in 
the past month. Most retailers noted declines in their sales and 
shopper traffic, as well as in their inventories, employment, and 
capital expenditures. Their wages and prices rose somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite slower current activity, respondents were optimistic about 
the business outlook for the next six months. Most expected general 
economic conditions to improve locally and nationally, and they also 
expected a rise in their own sales and shopper traffic. Wholesale 
and retail prices were also expected to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey of manufacturers indicated that District 
factory activity improved slightly in July. Manufacturers reported 
stable to higher levels of shipments and new orders. Inventories and 
order backlogs apparently fell, while other business indicators 
remained steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of manufacturers foresaw improvement over the next six 
months in national and regional business conditions and increases in 
their own shipments, new orders, and prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Recovery
      </strong>
      <br/>
      We asked our manufacturing and retailing respondents if they thought 
the recession was over. Nearly half of the manufacturers believed 
the recession had bottomed out--both for themselves and for the 
economy as a whole--while less than a fourth thought it had not. 
Retailers had mixed feelings about whether general economic recovery 
had begun; almost half believed that the retail sector was still in 
a downturn, while less than a third thought the downturn had ended.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports--Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk)--indicated that exports rose and imports 
fell in June from May and from a year earlier. Exports were expected 
to increase faster than imports throughout the remainder of the 
summer and fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those surveyed thought that the declining dollar had boosted 
exports. Hampton Roads reported stronger exports of higher-valued 
items -- such as industrial machinery -- to Northern Europe. Coal 
exports rose at both Hampton Roads and Baltimore.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of District hotels, motels and resorts indicated 
that tourist activity remained flat in July despite some reports of 
a strong July 4th. A majority of respondents expected tourism to 
remain lackluster for the rest of the summer and into the fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone indicated 
that the demand for commercial and industrial loans weakened 
slightly in June and early July. Few new businesses reportedly 
sought financing. Loan delinquency rates evidently edged down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Budgets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a telephone survey of state budget forecasters, four 
Fifth District states entered the new fiscal year with their budgets 
balanced. South Carolina was in the process of revising its spending 
plans in response to new revenue estimates. West Virginia had no 
shortfall going into the new fiscal year, and the other states 
corrected their shortfalls by either reducing spending, increasing 
taxes or a combination of both. The District of Columbia's fiscal 
year ends September 30 and some revenue shortfall remained when the 
survey was taken. Further budgetary actions were expected, including 
possible D.C. government employee layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of homebuilders suggested that the housing market was 
steady in recent weeks. Builders reported little change in starts 
and most indicated that sales were flat or slightly up, with low-
priced and medium-priced homes selling best. Inventories of unsold 
homes reportedly fell. Nearly all builders said that home prices 
were steady, despite a rise in lumber prices. Most expected no 
improvement in housing activity over the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate contacts said that District commercial construction had 
come to a standstill. Weakness was especially pronounced in the 
Washington, D.C. area, where prospects for an upturn ware termed 
poor because of high vacancy rates. In other large cities, 
commercial real estate markets were sluggish--though less than in 
Washington--and problems were even less severe in smaller District 
cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's farm sector were generally favorable, 
according to analysts contacted, but hot and dry weather conditions 
in Virginia and Maryland threatened crops. Throughout the District, 
the planting of soybeans and the harvesting of small grains were 
almost complete. The condition of soybeans, corn, pastures, fruits 
and vegetables was reported to be good in most areas. Tobacco 
marketing was underway with both production and prices reported 
strong. In Virginia and Maryland, hot temperatures and scarce 
rainfall had begun to stress crops. Corn, soybean, and peanut yield 
prospects were beginning to dim, and the crops faced severe damage 
if adequate rain were not received soon.
