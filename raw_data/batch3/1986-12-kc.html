      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Only modest improvement is apparent in Tenth District economic 
activity. Retail sales continue to improve, although district auto 
sales shared in the national decline. Inventory levels generally are 
viewed as satisfactory, and prices are expected to remain relatively 
stable. The energy and agriculture sectors remain weak. Some 
weakening in housing activity is expected. Demand for mortgage funds 
has moderated and mortgage rates are expected to remain steady. 
Total loan demand at commercial banks was generally constant or down 
over the past month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District retailers report that sales are moderately stronger 
than a year ago and generally have been improving over the last 
three months. Recently, retail sales of furniture, electronics, and 
women's apparel have been particularly strong. Prices have changed 
little during the last three months and are expected to remain 
relatively stable. Most retailers are satisfied with their current 
inventory levels, although some would prefer to trim their 
inventories modestly. Most retailers expect sales during the holiday 
season to be as good as or better than last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District automobile dealers experienced poor sales in October 
following the end of low-interest factory incentives. Inventories of 
1986 models have been depleted, but dealers are building their 
stocks of 1987 models cautiously because they are not optimistic 
about the short-run sales outlook. Buyers have been conditioned to 
expect incentive programs, and many dealers expect that sluggish 
sales will soon force the automobile manufacturers into a new round 
of incentives.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents in the Tenth District continue to report slightly 
higher input prices, due partly to the depreciation of the dollar 
and the steel strike. Most purchasing agents expect relatively 
stable prices over the next three months. Materials are readily 
available, and no problems with availability or lead times are 
expected. Inventory levels generally are regarded as satisfactory. 
Some firms, however, have been trimming inventories and plan to 
continue this policy for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most homebuilders report that single-family housing starts have 
increased from last year's levels, but multifamily starts have 
varied widely by locality. Homebuilders expect normal seasonal 
declines in single-family starts during the winter. Multifamily 
construction, however, is expected to be substantially weaker 
because of overbuilding in many areas. New home sales are generally 
above year-ago levels. Builders report no problems with either the 
availability or delivery of housing materials. Materials prices have 
been steady, although some builders expect rising lumber prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many Tenth District savings institutions have accepted limited 
savings inflows in the face of intense rate competition and flat 
loan demand. Most expect this situation to continue into 1987. 
Demand for mortgage funds has moderated. Mortgage interest rates 
have stabilized and are expected to remain steady or trend slightly 
downward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's weakened energy industry continues to suffer from the 
uncertainty surrounding international crude oil markets, oil prices 
have firmed somewhat, but remain well below year-ago levels. As a 
result, exploration and development activity in the district has 
rebounded slightly but remains generally depressed. The average 
weekly number of operating drilling rigs in the Tenth District was 
up again to 223 in October from 215 in September, but remains far 
below the 550 rigs working in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wet fall weather conditions have delayed harvest operations in many 
regions of the Tenth District. The corn, soybean, and milo harvest 
is 85 to 100 percent complete in some areas, but elsewhere 50 to 65 
percent of the crop is still in the field. Yields have been high 
across the district, with record yields expected in many areas. Many 
regions are experiencing tight storage conditions, but storage 
shortages are expected to ease as more of last year's stocks are 
marketed. Most areas report good to excellent winter wheat and wheat 
pasture conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Harvest delays have meant production loan paydown delays, but many 
lenders still expect paydowns to improve over last year. Lenders 
also suggest no loosening in credit conditions for the coming 
production year, with credit refusal rates expected to be about the 
same as last year. Effects of the new farm bankruptcy legislation 
may be reflected in the 1987 farm credit situation. Lenders feel 
that the new Chapter 12 provisions weaken their position with 
troubled loans and marginal borrowers. Lenders expect the added 
creditor risk to lead to tougher credit review standards and more 
cautious lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand was generally constant or down, and total deposit 
activity was mixed at Tenth District banks during the past month. In 
all categories of loan demand, more bankers reported increased 
weakness than reported increased strength. Consumer, real estate, 
and agricultural loans were areas of particular weakness. While most 
banks have lowered rates on consumer loans, further interest rate 
declines are generally not expected. Demand deposits, large CDs, and 
small time deposits tended to remain constant or decline, while 
NOWs, Super-NOWs, and passbook savings accounts tended to remain 
constant or increase. MMDAs, IRAs, and Keogh accounts, on balance, 
remained unchanged. Most banks are considering lowering their 
passbook savings rate below 5 1/2 percent. if they have not already 
done so.
