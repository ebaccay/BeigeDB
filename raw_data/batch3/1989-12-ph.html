      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District appears to be just steady 
overall, according to businesses surveyed in November, although 
conditions vary among sectors. Manufacturing remains on the downward 
trend that set in during the summer, although the extent of the 
decline among area firms may be diminishing. Retailers report that 
sales are running just level with the year-ago pace, in dollar 
terms, as the holiday shopping season begins. Bankers note that 
consumer lending is nearly stagnant; financing of auto purchases has 
fallen off with the drop in sales, and other categories of personal 
lending remain sluggish. Business lending is advancing moderately 
and real estate loan growth is being restrained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations among Third District businesses are that conditions may 
improve, but just slightly in the first half of 1990. Managers at 
area manufacturing plants anticipate an end to the current decline 
but foresee only marginal gains in the next six months. Retailers 
expect sales for their fourth quarter (November-January) to run just 
modestly above the year-ago period. Bankers expect some further 
gains in commercial and industrial lending but they generally are 
planning to be very cautious in extending their exposure to 
commercial real estate. Bankers do not anticipate renewed vigor in 
consumer loan growth until overall economic growth accelerates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District continues to edge down, 
according to firms surveyed in early November, as the region's 
industrial sector remains on a downward trend that began in July. 
However, negative reports from local manufacturers are less 
prevalent now than they have been since mid-summer. Most of the 
firms reporting slower business are durable goods producers, while 
makers of nondurables generally report steady conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specific measures of industrial activity, while mixed, generally 
reflect an overall picture of softening business. Although shipments 
are increasing, new orders are virtually flat; the resulting drop in 
unfilled orders continues a downward trend that started in June. And 
while employment is being held steady, on balance, area firms 
apparently are trimming production in response to the weak orders 
situation by cutting working hours slightly. Although one-third of 
the firms contacted recently report that the costs of the goods they 
purchase continue to rise, most indicate that prices of both inputs 
and outputs are stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the future, sentiment among area manufacturers is divided 
nearly equally among those expecting further slowing, those 
anticipating steady business, and those predicting some improvement 
over the next six months; a slight plurality favors the optimistic 
scenario. On balance, while firms contacted this month expect an 
upturn in orders and shipments by the spring of next year, they 
expect order backlogs to continue edging down, and they anticipate 
some cuts in payrolls, as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in late November described 
current dollar sales for the month up to Thanksgiving as flat 
compared to the same period last year. Stores specializing in 
women's apparel were posting good year-over-year gains, but much of 
the apparent improvement is attributed to depressed sales in this 
line last year. Although some discount and off-price retailers 
achieved what were described as healthy advances over last year's 
results for the Thanksgiving weekend, most stores ran just even with 
or marginally above their 1988 performance. Retailers said markdowns 
were fairly widespread.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area merchants generally expect modest year-to-year gains in dollar 
sales for the holiday period and for the fiscal fourth quarter 
(November-January) as a whole. Although most of the store officials 
contacted for this report said inventories were in line with sales, 
many said they were planning promotional efforts to give Christmas 
sales an early boost rather than waiting for a possible last-minute 
rush.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers contacted in November report modest loan growth overall, 
with business lending on the rise and consumer lending virtually 
flat. Lending officers indicate that commercial and industrial loans 
outstanding have been rising moderately and they expect a step-up in 
the rate of growth as the year comes to an end. Some banks have 
boosted loan commitments recently, and they expect these credit 
lines to be drawn down soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer lending in the Third District is moving up only sluggishly 
despite some banks' promotional efforts. Bankers believe the fall-
off in auto sales has diminished the demand for credit from 
individuals in recent weeks; furthermore, some expect overall 
consumer spending to remain lackluster, holding down growth of 
personal loan volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers generally indicate that they are continuing to restrict 
expansion of lending for development and construction. Lending for 
construction of offices and stores is expected to flatten or even 
decline as banks grow more cautious, and demand for funds to finance 
industrial development is expected to diminish in response to the 
slackness in the manufacturing sector. While some bankers note 
increased demand for credit from firms involved in infrastructure 
construction, especially highways, bankers' expectations are that 
total real estate and construction lending will ease from its recent 
rapid growth.
