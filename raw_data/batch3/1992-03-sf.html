      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Twelfth District range from persistent 
weakness in California to moderate growth in intermountain regions. 
Sales of homes and autos are responding positively to recent 
interest rate reductions. Continued employment declines, however, 
are reported in the defense-related manufacturing, banking, legal, 
and government sectors. Wage and price increases are modest, with 
the exception of health care. Mortgage refinancing activity appears 
to have peaked, and overall loan demand remains weak. Recent rains 
have improved agricultural prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expectations of Twelfth District business leaders improved 
modestly since our last report. Only 12 percent of respondents now 
expect output to decline in at least two of the next four quarters, 
compared to 32 percent in January and 25 percent in November. Most 
respondents (70 percent) expect the economy to expand, but at a rate 
below 2.5 percent. The proportion of business leaders expecting 
improved business investment, consumer spending, and housing starts 
continues to increase. Expectations regarding housing starts were 
particularly optimistic. with 79 percent of the respondents 
projecting some improvement in the next four quarters, up from 40 
percent in November. Ninety-one percent expect inflation to decline 
or remain stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward pressures on wages and prices remain minimal throughout most 
of the Twelfth District. Most wage increases in the Twelfth District 
are reported in the 3 to 4 percent range. Smaller increases are 
projected for state workers. Employee benefits, however, continue to 
rise due to health costs, which continue to increase at double-digit 
rates. Lumber prices are rising, due to decreased supply and rising 
demand. Outside of these sectors, inflationary pressures are hard to 
find. Contacts in retail establishments report continued discounting 
and flat wholesale prices. Materials prices are reported down for 
several industries, with paint materials prices down 2 to 3 percent, 
and discounting of newsprint expected to continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales remain soft in most of the Twelfth District. A major 
retailer reports inventories are at their planned levels, and that 
no shortages exist. Another retailer reports they continue to reduce 
staff size, and that all retailers are emphasizing cost control. One 
bright spot is auto sales, however, with dealers in several markets 
reporting increased activity since January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professional firms in Washington expect flat to modest growth, with 
some increased competition in the legal field reported. Print media 
contacts in California report that circulation and advertising 
volume remain below their year-earlier levels. Classified ads in 
employment, real estate, and autos are down. Conditions in 
California public education remain uncertain, with hiring plans 
being delayed due to possible budget cutbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Twelfth District remains sluggish, 
with layoffs continuing in aerospace, electronics, and defense-
related industries. Orders for helicopters and transport aircraft 
have fallen in Oregon. Boeing's Washington payroll has dropped about 
2,700 since its 1989 peak, with 600 lost since October, mostly in 
defense and without direct layoffs. Another 6,500 reduction has been 
announced for 1992 with a layoff of 2,400 by May. Boeing projects 
its long-term prospects as strong, however, forecasting a 5.2 
percent annual increase in passenger traffic through 2010. Their 
expansion plans appear firm. The overall outlook for business 
investment has improved, but contacts report little immediate impact 
of interest rate reductions on capital spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural outlook in the Twelfth District has improved 
somewhat due to recent rains. Farmers in California are now hoping 
for increased allocations of water, though the lingering effects of 
the drought will limit deliveries and keep pumping costs higher. 
Timber sales for this fiscal year are severely restricted. Ponderosa 
pine and Douglas fir lumber prices are up dramatically due to scarce 
supply, with prices in many grades at historic levels. Spot natural 
gas prices are down 6 percent from last year's already low levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate markets show signs of improvement. Sales 
activity has increased in several District markets, and housing 
starts are up in Idaho, Utah, and eastern Washington. Renewed 
investor interest in housing developments is reported, though 
financing remains tight. Conditions in the nonresidential 
construction industry, however, continue to weaken in several 
states, with a contact in Oregon expecting weak conditions for 1 to 
2 years. Median sales prices for single-family homes are stable or 
increasing slightly in most District markets, and the drop in prices 
of the upper-end residential market in California appears to have 
slowed. Some decline, however, is reported in commercial building 
sales prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District financial institutions report continued but 
moderating interest in home mortgage refinancings, but otherwise 
flat demand for loans. Commercial and construction loans continue to 
decline, and consumer loan categories are weak with the exception of 
home equity credit lines. Some deposit outflow is reported, as 
interest rate reductions are inducing investors to seek higher 
returns. Banks in California appear to remain cautious in making 
loans, and contacts outside the financial industries report problems 
in finding credit for real estate development and small business. 
Small business loan demand is strong and usage of Small Business 
Administration guarantees is reported up both locally and 
nationwide.
