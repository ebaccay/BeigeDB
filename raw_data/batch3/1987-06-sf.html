      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions are healthy in most parts of the Twelfth 
District, although weakness persists in the intermountain area and 
in Alaska. Spending on consumer products, including automobiles, has 
slackened in recent months, but the pace of manufacturing activity 
has improved. Forest products activity continues at a strong pace, 
while higher prices for many western agricultural products bode well 
for mining and farming enterprises. The recent upturn in oil prices 
has sparked optimism among California oil producers, but oil-related 
problems in Alaska continue to mount. Higher interest rates have had 
little impact on construction activity in most areas, as residential 
markets continue generally healthy and nonresidential activity 
already had been slowed by high vacancy rates and tax reform. 
Financial institutions have experienced sharp reductions in home 
mortgage refinancing applications, and many report a renewed 
interest in adjustable rate instruments. However, few bankers report 
significant declines in mortgage applications for home purchase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In many parts of the District, the pace of consumer spending has 
slowed in recent months. Sales of both domestic and imported cars 
are reported to be lackluster in several areas, including the 
otherwise economically healthy San Francisco and Seattle areas. In 
the San Francisco area, auto sales reportedly are down 21 percent 
from last year, with inventories rising. Several respondents noted 
that although new car sales are down, used cars are selling very 
well. In the Eugene, Oregon, area one auto dealer estimates that he 
sells two used cars for every new car sold.
     </p>
     <p>
      More generally, respondents in Arizona and Washington report 
moderating of the previously robust activity in those two states. In 
Idaho, sales tax receipts for April were higher than they were in 
March, but remained substantially lower than their year-earlier 
level. Import-dependent retailers and distributors are being hurt by 
the reduction in imports that has taken hold in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers of some products that compete against low-cost imports 
report strengthening sales and orders which they attribute to the 
reduced value of the U.S. dollar. Sectors reporting improvement 
include apparel, semiconductors, and computers. One large 
semiconductor maker has announced that it intends to complete two 
Oregon facilities which were put on hold in 1985 due to the 
semiconductor industry slump.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lumber production continues to be strong, and many mills are running 
at peak levels. China is becoming an increasingly important market 
for these products. Already this year, 8.5 million tons of railroad 
ties have been exported through Portland to China, and shipment of 
10.5 million board-feet of lumber to China will begin in August. 
Demand in Japan and Europe also has been bolstered, by the reduced 
value of the dollar. Overall, lumber exports are 28 percent higher 
than they were a year ago. The volume of orders declined in April 
and early May due to the increase in mortgage interest rates, but as 
rates stabilized later in the month orders picked up again.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prospects for many western farmers have improved. Cattle 
producers are enjoying higher prices and lower feed costs, while 
potato and fruit growers benefit from a mild winter and increased 
production. California cotton commands prices double the level of 
last year, as strong foreign markets, notably in China, buoy demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, dry weather in some parts of the District has raised 
concerns about summer yields. Wheat farmers, among others, continue 
to experience low prices. Despite high participation rates in 
government acreage-reduction programs that should reduce the current 
oversupply problem, they see little prospect of improvement. These 
problems are particularly apparent in eastern Washington and Oregon, 
in southern Idaho, and Utah.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Kern County, California, oil industry prospects have improved 
modestly since the price of local oil rose to $13 per barrel from 
less than $10 a year ago. In contrast, Alaska's economy continues to 
founder. One company reports that the volume of freight it ships to 
Prudhoe Bay is down 70 percent from last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents reported that the increase in interest rates this 
spring has had little effect on the volume of real estate activity 
in their areas. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the real 
estate market has been healthy through May. One East Bay developer 
placed forty-seven "spec' lots on the market, at prices of $75,000 
and up, and sold forty of them on the first weekend. Although 
residential construction activity remains largely unaffected at this 
point, some builders reportedly are scaling back plans for 
residential units in 1987, and generally are taking a more cautious 
attitude. Moreover, some building materials dealers have reported a 
sharp drop in low-end housing starts, since low income buyers are 
particularly sensitive to higher interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      High vacancy rates and changes in the tax law caused a slowdown in 
commercial construction activity earlier in the year, and higher 
interest rates appear to have had little additional impact. A few 
projects which do not pencil out at the higher rates have been 
squeezed out. One banker argues that some developers have withdrawn 
loan applications, hoping that rates will fall later in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The initial jump in mortgage interest rates caused a flurry of 
activity in April, apparently due to concern about the possibility 
of further rate increases. Several bankers report that the increase 
in interest rates has reduced demand for mortgage refinancing and 
renewed interest in adjustable-rate instruments. For example, one 
banker reports that refinancing applications have fallen to thirty 
percent of their previous level. The same banker notes that while 
fixed-rate mortgages previously comprised about 85 percent of his 
bank's mortgages closings, they now account for only 60 percent of 
its total. Most bankers report little change in the number of 
mortgage applications for housing purchases, but one claims that the 
number of applications has dropped to a third of the level seen 
several months ago.
