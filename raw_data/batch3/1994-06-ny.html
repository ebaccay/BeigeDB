      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 22, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District continued its moderate expansion since the last 
report although some signs of softness were noted. Unemployment 
rates fell substantially in May, and discussions with manufacturing 
firms suggest a continuing improvement in that sector. Office 
leasing activity in Manhattan resulted in lower vacancy rates in 
both the downtown and midtown areas. In addition, several recent and 
upcoming events indicate a pickup in the District's entertainment 
and tourist sectors. On the other hand, most District retailers 
reported disappointing sales results in May, and though homebuilders 
were generally positive, a slowing of traffic was noted in some 
areas. Officers surveyed at small and midsized banks reported a 
recent drop in mortgage loan demand but some strength in the demand 
for business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retailers reported disappointing sales results in May 
following April year-over-year changes that were better than 
expected at several chains. The slowdown in May was attributed in 
part to unseasonably cool weather which dampened interest in summer 
apparel. In addition, several contacts noted greater reluctance to 
spend.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost all retailers reported over-the-year sales gains in April 
despite the fact that Easter shifted from April in 1993 to this 
year's March. Sales results generally ranged from -2 percent to +10 
percent with athletic apparel, jewelry, furniture, and electrical 
appliances cited as most in demand. With activity slackening in May, 
several retailers stated that sales were flat over the year and only 
one chain had results that were greater than plan. Durable goods 
sold more readily than soft goods in May. Inventories were generally 
at comfortable levels, aided by greater-than-planned markdowns at 
some stores. Retailers were hopeful that the May slowdown will prove 
to be a short-lived aberration.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in the District were generally positive about 
conditions in the market for new homes though in some areas a 
slowing of traffic was noted in recent weeks. Higher mortgage rates 
were cited as the reason for this slowing, but observers in other 
areas stated that rates were still relatively low and the increases 
had motivated buyers to act before rates moved still higher. A 
majority of respondents expected starts to be somewhat above last 
year's level, but this was on the assumption that interest rates 
would not rise much further.
     </p>
     <p>
      In New York City, two long-delayed projects are scheduled to get 
underway in June. In Queens, ground will be broken for the $2.3 
billion Hunters Point riverfront project, under discussion for some 
ten years which when completed is to comprise 15 apartment buildings 
and four commercial buildings. In Brooklyn, construction of the 
first in a group of 126 three-family homes is to start. The project, 
initially planned in the 80's, will eventually include two large 
retail centers as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity in Manhattan during recent weeks resulted in 
lower vacancy rates in both the downtown and midtown areas. The 
midtown vacancy raw on primary properties is now at its lowest level 
since the end of 1989, but, on balance, the downtown rate has shown 
little overall improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As was true nationally, unemployment rates in the District dropped 
substantially in May. New York State's rate fell to 6.5 percent from 
8.2 percent in April while New Jersey's declined to 6.9 percent from 
7.2 percent in April. It is possible that the seasonal adjustment 
factors for the revised household survey exaggerated New York's 
improvement. Nonfarm employment has been growing steadily in New 
York since last October and rose strongly in New Jersey during April 
following a moderate increase in March and a decline in February. No 
major new layoffs or expansions were announced lately in the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The results of recent discussions held with 25 manufacturing firms 
suggest a continuing improvement in the District's manufacturing 
sector. While a few large firms plan further employment cuts, most 
firms anticipate flat or rising employment, increasing unit sales, 
wage growth of 2-4 percent, and flat or rising capital spending. 
Such expectations contrast sharply with discussions a year ago which 
were dominated by anticipated sales declines, and contracting 
employment and capital expenditures. Price competition, however, 
remains intense. All but one firm expect that unit prices will 
remain unchanged or decline in the next six months. A sizable 
majority anticipate strong gains in exports, well in excess of the 
expected growth rates for domestic sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several recent and upcoming events indicate a pickup in the 
District's entertainment and tourist sectors. During the 1993-4 
season attendance at Broadway theaters reached its highest level in 
six years, and hotel occupancy has been steadily rising since last 
fall in New York City. Looking ahead, more than one million visitors 
from all over the world are expected in late June to attend three 
World Cup soccer games in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and to 
participate in and watch the eight-day Olympic-style Gay Games and 
Cultural Festival to be held at numerous locations in the New York 
metropolitan area. In addition, the New York Knicks made the NBA 
finals, and the Rangers won their first Stanley Cup in 54 years--the 
extra games played in the City aided the region's economy as well as 
dominated the headlines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in the 
District reported a marked difference in mortgage and business loan 
demand. There was a pronounced decline in the residential mortgage 
and refinancing segments where four-fifths of the officers reported 
a decrease. The demand for commercial and industrial loans was 
stronger, with about a quarter of loan officers reporting higher 
demand and fewer than one-sixth, lower demand. Overall, loan demand 
was down, and most bankers attributed the decline to higher interest 
rates. Without exception, surveyed banks were charging higher rates 
on commercial and industrial loans, and almost all reported higher 
mortgage rates as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      More than two-thirds of loan officers noted that spreads have 
widened between their average lending and deposit rates. Credit 
standards have generally remained unchanged, and most officers arc 
as willing to lend now as they were two months ago. Delinquency 
rates have been stable.
