      Beige Book Report: Chicago

      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic expansion gathered increased momentum in 
recent months. Retail sales growth seemed to strengthen in October 
and November, and sales results for the Thanksgiving weekend 
generally met or exceeded retailers expectations. Manufacturing 
activity strengthened further, as auto output climbed back toward 
previously scheduled levels and as production gains spread to a 
wider range of industries. The pickup in business activity has 
bolstered labor markets in the region, after the employment recovery 
faltered earlier in 1993. A survey indicated that loan standards and 
terms at the largest District banks remained on a modest easing 
trend, although only a bare majority reported increased demand for 
commercial and industrial loans. Our latest survey of agricultural 
bankers indicated that land values generally remained stable this 
summer, although banks in flooded areas expressed some concern about 
farm earnings and loan repayment rates. Reports of price increases 
became somewhat more prominent in recent months, but many of them 
seemed concentrated in basic materials responding to market-specific 
developments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Survey data and reports from individual firms indicate that retail 
sales growth strengthened in the District in October and November. A 
nationwide survey indicated that Midwest retailers expect modestly 
stronger holiday season sales gains than the national average. A 
survey of retailers in Michigan indicated that expectations for 
holiday season sales were running in line with those held at the 
same time last year, which were appreciably higher than expectations 
in 1988 through 1991. A survey of retailers in the Chicago 
metropolitan area showed an improving trend in same-store sales 
growth in recent months. A large retail chain reported that sales 
continued to strengthen "along a steady uptrend" through October, 
and sales gains then gathered greater momentum in the first two 
weeks of November, with further relative strength in sales of 
furniture and appliances. A large distributor of appliances reported 
that retail demand softened modestly in early November, but only 
from record levels, and demand strengthened anew in the latter half 
of November. One of the largest auto dealers in the District stated 
that inventory shortages constrained sales gains during the third 
quarter, but margins improved as underlying consumer demand remained 
relatively strong. The shortages eased in October and November, 
however, and sales picked up further from already-active levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Surveys and reports from retailers indicated that retail sales and 
traffic generally met or exceeded expectations over the Thanksgiving 
holiday weekend, despite difficult weather around much of the 
District. For example, a large department store chain stated that 
"we were very pleased" with sales over the weekend, with sales 
exceeding projections. A check authorization firm reported a 5 
percent year-over-year increase in day-after-Thanksgiving sales in 
the Chicago area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District industrial output strengthened in recent months, 
particularly as auto production climbed back toward scheduled 
levels. Purchasing managers' surveys in Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, 
and Western Michigan generally indicated an improving pace of 
activity. Auto industry suppliers provided the initial boost to the 
improvement seen in these surveys late in the third quarter, but the 
most recent reports showed production gains spreading to a wider 
variety of manufacturers. A steel industry analyst reported that 
integrated mills are still completely booked for the fourth quarter, 
and bookings are extended further into 1994 than is normal for this 
time of the year. A manufacturer of corrugated paper containers 
reported that its overall orders growth strengthened in recent 
months, particularly from firms in appliance, auto, and printing-
related industries. A large manufacturer of consumer durable goods 
reported that dealer orders posted significant year-over-year gains 
in November. A manufacturer of gypsum wallboard stated that two 
large plants were brought back on-line in the industry in October to 
meet strong demand. A large diversified manufacturer reported 
continuing weakness in several important overseas markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recent pickup in overall business activity has bolstered 
employment gains in the District, following a loss of momentum 
earlier in 1993. A survey by a large personnel services company 
found significant improvement in hiring plans among Midwest 
businesses during the fourth quarter, with renewed relative strength 
indicated for the region, driven in part by responses from 
manufacturers of durable goods. The employment components of 
District purchasing managers' surveys generally drifted higher in 
recent months. Temporary help firms specializing in clerical 
personnel reported a higher pace of permanent hiring by client firms 
in recent months. A contingency-based executive search firm stated 
that permanent placements were improving in the fourth quarter. A 
firm engaged in residential reconstruction in high-end markets, 
where a recovery had lagged economic recovery as a whole, stated 
that "We're swamped. We're also hiring, something we haven't done 
for a year and a half."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent survey of loan officers in the District indicated that 
standards for approving applications for commercial and industrial 
loans generally continued to ease among large District banks, while 
a modest majority of surveyed banks reported improvement in 
commercial and industrial loan demand. Most respondents indicated 
that standards for commercial real estate loans remained 
restrictive, although some banks did report selectively easing their 
standards for approving applications for construction and land 
development loans. One middle-market lender stated that much of the 
increase in commercial and industrial bank lending activity has 
resulted from a fight for market share, with little new net lending 
growth in the aggregate. Another bank stated that loan demand from 
large commercial accounts remained relatively weak in recent months, 
citing continued competition from alternative financing channels and 
a slower-than-normal cyclical recovery in requirements for inventory 
financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The fall harvest is nearly complete. Crops in many areas were 
confronted with sizable drying charges and price discounts for low 
quality. Yields were down in general, but varied widely across the 
District. State average corn and soybean yields in Iowa -- the state 
hardest-hit by the flood -- dropped to levels comparable to those in 
the drought-disaster of 1988. At the other extreme, soybean yields 
in Illinois and Indiana reached new highs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our latest survey of agricultural bankers found that District 
farmland values were stable this summer, in general, and up about 3 
percent from a year ago. The bankers' views on credit conditions 
varied widely, however, with most of the difference seemingly tied 
to the extent of crop damage from the summer floods. Bankers in the 
harder-hit states of Iowa and Wisconsin are concerned about farm 
earnings and loan repayment rates, while bankers elsewhere in the 
District generally expect earnings and loan repayment rates to match 
or exceed year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of price increases became somewhat more prominent in recent 
months, but they were often restricted to basic material prices 
reacting to market-specific developments. A steel industry analyst 
stated that scrap prices have appreciated over 35 percent this year, 
partly because of hedging prior to a strike deadline, but mainly as 
a result of stronger underlying demand. A manufacturer of paper 
containers expected an industry-wide price hike to hold firm in 
coming months, after flat-to-modestly-declining prices accompanied 
sporadic and unsuccessful attempts at price increases over the past 
three years. A manufacturer of gypsum wallboard reported that 
another price increase was announced in its industry. This contact 
also noted that paper used to cover wallboard was in short supply. 
District retailing contacts generally reported that competitive 
pressures continue to constrain price increases. One large retailer 
noted that "customers are shopping with a purpose," during the 
holiday season, with a greater share of traffic using lists and 
comparison shopping. A large distributor of paint sold for 
commercial construction purposes reported that competition continued 
to drive down prices in its markets, despite improvement in demand.
