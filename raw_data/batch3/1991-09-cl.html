      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 18, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recovery underway in both the nation and the District appears to be 
at a slower pace than in even the mildest of the postwar recoveries, 
according to most District respondents. Real consumer spending is 
still sluggish, with second-half growth predicted between 1% and 3% 
this half. Continued recovery in Fourth District industrial 
production, which began last spring, is expected to be supported by 
a slowing of inventory liquidation and by revival in most capital 
goods industries. The real estate market has weakened. Lenders 
report continued softness in bank loans, and recent declines for 
mortgage refinancing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents uniformly agree that recoveries in both the nation and 
the District are off to a slow start, and most also expect that 
output growth, at least for the first year of the upturn, will fall 
short of the mildest of the past business recoveries. Most predict 
that real GNP will expand this quarter in a 2% to 3% range, but a 
few still expect a fourth-quarter real GNP growth rate of about 3% 
to 4%.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Ohio, manufacturing output, which often lags the national 
recovery, rebounded last quarter, and respondents anticipate 
continued growth based on the strength of exports coupled with an 
ending to inventory liquidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the late sinner months have been relatively flat, 
and early September sales were up only a few percentage points from 
a year ago, according to a retailer, Still, another retailer managed 
to liquidate the bulk of its excess stocks. Retailers are reported 
to be very cautious in planning inventories for the Christmas season 
in order to avoid large inventory overruns and subsequent 
discounting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists associated with consumer goods are uncertain about the 
short-term outlook for real consumer spending. Some expect about a 
3% growth rate this half, but several others anticipate only l% to 
2% growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto industry sources estimate that domestic new car sales will 
average about a 6.5-million-unit-annual rate this quarter and next, 
up a few percent from last quarter. New car dealers believe that a 
shortage of many 1991 models may account for some of the sales 
declines in August. They uniformly believe that further price 
incentives will not be necessary to clear the remaining car 
inventory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's recovery in manufacturing output, which began last 
spring, has continued into the summer, led especially by higher auto 
output. Several producers and suppliers expect that auto output will 
continue to edge to upward. Domestic car production this quarter is 
estimated at about a 5.8-million-unit annual rate; slightly more 
than a 6 million-unit rate is expected next quarter. Some concern 
was expressed that the slowly rising trend in production might be 
interrupted by consumer resistance to higher prices for 1992 models, 
which would leave the industry with larger-than-desired inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers in the District have been operating at about 70% of 
capacity for most of the year, but they expect a gradual 
strengthening over the balance of the year. Steel inventory 
liquidation appears to have run its course sooner than expected 
because of a recent spurt in orders from the auto and appliance 
industries, according to steel sources. Recent steel price increases 
appear to be sticking, an indication of stronger demand, and some 
workers who were laid off are currently being recalled.
     </p>
     <p>
      The machinery and industrial equipment industries are probably close 
to a trough, and prospects for a turnaround have improved since 
operating rates in manufacturing have begun climbing, according to a 
capital goods producer. A producer of industrial controls equipment 
expects that the contraction in industrial equipment will end this 
quarter. Domestic shipments of commercial aircraft are expected to 
rebound this quarter from last, and the gradual recovery in heavy-
duty truck orders and production should gain strength by year-end in 
response to rising operating rates in manufacturing. Another capital 
goods producer reported a sizable pickup in sales and profits for 
its third quarter, attributable to both domestic and international 
sales. Finally, a supplier to capital equipment producers reports 
that its orders from general machinery producers and the steel 
industry are showing signs of recovery, and that its delivery 
schedules have begun to lengthen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The massive reduction of business inventories during the latest 
recession will be largely completed this quarter, according to an 
industry economist. The source noted that July's inventory-to-sales 
ratio for nonauto durable goods was back to its 1987-89 average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lenders and realtors generally report that demand for housing has 
slowed in recent months, although some lenders experienced a pickup 
in new loans in August. Listings are fewer-than-usual for the 
summer. Some attribute the less-than-seasonal strength in housing 
starts and sales this summer to a lack of consumer confidence. They 
claim that mortgage funds are readily available to creditworthy 
buyers, and report that mortgage rates eased recently to an 8-3/4% 
to 9-1/4% range for a 30-year conventional loan mortgage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most lenders report little change in total loan activity in recent 
months, except for declines in mortgage loan refinancing following a 
surge in the spring and early summer months. Some sources believe 
that continued softness in business loans may reflect low working 
capital needs because of the large liquidation of inventories, and 
that future growth of business loans may be constrained by 
increasing business bankruptcies. Some easing in mortgage loans for 
new and existing homes is also noted, but a few banks report some 
pickup in auto installment loans in August, and continued growth in 
home equity loans. Several depositors acknowledge that they have not 
been aggressively seeking loans because of capital constraints or 
soft demand for credit. They also report further reductions in 
interest rates on deposits in recent weeks.
