     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 30, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The strength of the current economic expansion is reflected in the 
southeastern economy, although pressure on prices is being partially 
countered by capacity expansion and weaker domestic demand for some 
products. Several makers of producer goods like ball bearings, air-
powered tools, custom-made machinery, paperboard, and metal 
buildings report that they have been running virtually at 100 
percent of capacity. They are currently trying to expand capacity by 
either adding new space, replacing old equipment with modern 
machinery, or adding extra shifts of workers. In general, capital 
investment in the District appears strong and the demand for capital 
goods produced in the region also seems robust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although they are operating near capacity, these manufacturers seem 
to be satisfied with their ability to keep up with deliveries to 
their customers. Some report that their suppliers are delaying 
shipments, while others are having no trouble with input delays. 
Input prices show no consistent movements, ranging from no increase 
to an increase of about 5 percent over the year for most products. 
The prices of metals have increased considerably more. Some 
substitution of domestic for imported inputs has taken place, 
although imports are not used to a great extent by southeastern 
manufacturers. Most point out that wages have increased between 4 
and 6 percent over the year; expected increases for 1989 are about 
the same. Manufacturers in Tennessee and Alabama have had little
trouble hiring skilled workers; those reporting difficulty in 
finding skilled workers are located in rural areas of Mississippi or 
southern Georgia and Alabama, areas that historically have had fewer 
skilled workers. Many report pressures on the cost of employee 
benefits, especially health related ones.
     </p>
     <p>
      The localized tightness in some labor markets, supplier delays, and 
input cost increases have yet to result in any consistent increases 
in final product prices. The manufacturers we contacted say they 
have not increased their prices because domestic competition is 
strong. Inventories of materials are lower than usual for these 
manufacturers, although they seem to prefer to purchase these inputs 
as new orders arrive rather than maintain larger inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chemical industry centered in Louisiana is also running at high 
capacity levels. Some contacts report that there are "bidding wars" 
for skilled labor. Supplies of ethylene and propylene are tight, and 
chemicals used in the textile industry, especially those used in 
rayon, are becoming more expensive. Strong export demand is keeping 
chemical prices up.
     </p>
     <p>
      The textile and apparel industries are concentrated in the 
Southeast, and there has been some retreat from the high levels of 
capacity utilization seen earlier this year. The weakness seems to 
be centered in those plants heavily involved in the production of 
apparel fabrics. Competition from imported apparel is still strong, 
while domestic demand is showing some weakness, and this has caused 
some domestic producers to shift out of apparel fabrics and into 
products like commercial carpets, towels and bedding, and infant 
clothing (perhaps a result of the baby-boom echo). Except for 
carpets, weaker demand is preventing increased production costs from 
being passed on to consumers. The shift in production has been 
accompanied by the closure of older plants and the expansion or 
construction of new plants. Labor saving spinning and weaving 
machines are being installed. Skilled workers, however, are 
reportedly in short supply, and wages have been rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong export demand has been offsetting weak domestic demand for 
several southeastern industries. Steel producers note that foreign 
demand for steel pipe has been strong. The weakness in domestic 
purchases stems from a decline in orders from the oil and gas 
industry, particularly for replacement pipe for older gas pipelines. 
A producer in Alabama has suggested that steel supplies are 
plentiful compared to the tight markets earlier this year, with the 
price of scrap steel now showing some decline. Modernization and 
construction of new steel and aluminum plants in Alabama are 
underway. They are technologically state-of-the-art, and while they 
will expand capacity substantially, they will not result in great 
employment gains. Appliance manufacturers have reported increases in
the prices of steel and aluminum. Because of weak demand owing to 
the slowdown in the housing market, they have not been able to raise 
their prices and cover their higher costs. In trucking, however, 
these increases seem likely to show through. The industry is 
expanding, and the demand for carriers is brisk.
     </p>
     <p>
      Foreign demand for hardwoods is supporting the price of raw timber 
and logs. Japan is a large buyer of hardwoods, and the United 
Kingdom has been importing hardwoods for flooring. Demand from 
domestic furniture makers has weakened, resulting in some price 
declines for certain grades of finished hardwood. The earlier 
retreat in housing starts has weakened the market for construction 
grade softwoods. Inventories are increasing as producers hold on to 
output in hopes of receiving a better price later. Lumber producers 
do not expect exports to help much in 1989, partly because of 
competition with Canadian exports and higher interest rates in the 
United Kingdom that have slowed the housing market there.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although residential, office, and retail construction is slow in the 
District, industrial and warehouse construction has been expanding. 
The strength in exports has resulted in new warehouse construction 
in Miami and Savannah. Speculative industrial building has been 
going on in Birmingham, Mobile, and Nashville, where low vacancy 
rates have encouraged new development. One respondent felt, however, 
that in Atlanta overbuilding now extended into the industrial and 
warehouse sector as well as the commercial market. The prospect of 
more foreign companies moving to the Nashville area has spurred 
construction there as well.
