     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After moderating for several months, growth in the District economy 
softened further in July. Activity was flat in some sectors and 
actually declined in others. Retail sales were weak on balance, and 
manufacturing activity decreased. Home sales were below their 
earlier level, and tourism and port activity were mixed. On the 
financial front, loan demand was generally weak. Despite the current 
sluggishness in their sectors, manufacturers, retailers, 
homebuilders and bankers are optimistic that their own business 
activity will increase in the next six months. Agriculture and 
forestry offer the brightest prospects for growth, as a good season 
will likely boost farm receipts, and strong foreign demand is 
supporting lumber sales and prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      About half of the retailers responding to our regular mail survey 
reported lower sales in July while only a few reported increases. 
Most retailers, however, expect their sales to rise over the next 
six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailer responses to our July survey were generally unchanged from 
May. Most car dealers again indicated slower sales, while department 
store volume increased slightly, as sales of big ticket items 
apparently improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity, which has been weakening in recent 
months, fell in July according to our regular mail survey. Reports 
of declines outnumbered reports of increases in shipments, new 
orders, and unfilled orders. Export orders, employment, and the 
length of the workweek were largely unchanged. Inventories of 
materials evidently declined, while inventories of finished goods 
were unchanged. Prices for both finished products and raw materials 
apparently continued to rise, but at a slightly slower rate than was 
reported in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers continue to be more optimistic about 
prospects for their own businesses than for general business 
activity in the nation. Respondents who expect increases in sales 
and unfilled orders in the next six months slightly outnumbered 
those who expect declines. The majority look for employment and the 
workweek at their respective plants to remain at current levels. 
Only one District producer in five, however, expects the general 
economy to improve over the next six months, while two in five 
expect it to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Expectations of Inflation and Foreign Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In their responses to our July mail surveys, District manufacturers 
and retailers also indicated their expectations about U.S. prices, 
wages, exports, and imports. As in our previous survey, most 
respondents expect the rate of increase in prices and wages to 
stabilize or slow in the next six months. Slightly more July than 
May respondents look for the trade deficit to widen. The July survey 
results are summarized below.

      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports received from the three major District portsâ€”Hampton Roads 
  (Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimoreâ€”show that import volume was 
  unchanged in July from June. The export picture was mixed, with 
  shipments higher at Charleston and Hampton Roads but about the same 
  at Baltimore. Compared to a year ago, increases in export activity 
  exceeded increases in import activity, and representatives expect 
  this trend to continue during the next six months. At Hampton Roads, 
  the largest coal port in the nation, coal exports have reportedly 
  been at normal levels in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to our telephone survey of financial institutions, 
  commercial and industrial loan demand was generally flat to lower in 
  July. Mortgage demand was mixed with half of those surveyed 
  reporting higher demand and the other half lower demand. Of those 
  reporting higher mortgage demand, most attributed the strength to 
  refinancing activity. Auto loan demand was sluggish at banking 
  institutions, and respondents felt that more dealer financing was 
  the cause. Many bankers expect loan demand to firm once borrowers 
  perceive that interest rates have bottomed out.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing
  Housing activity in the District was reported as mixed overall, but 
  still well behind last year's levels according to our telephone 
  survey of builders and realtors. The suburban Washington, D.C., 
  market has been especially slow recently, primarily because of large 
  inventories of higher-priced homes. Most respondents noted that 
  lower mortgage rates had begun to have a small positive effect. 
  Several respondents said reduced mortgage rates had not resulted in 
  heavier customer traffic but had allowed buyers to purchase more 
  expensive homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District hotel and motel representatives contacted by telephone 
  indicated that tourist activity was mixed compared to last summer. 
  About half reported that bookings were higher than last year at this 
  time, which they attributed to more repeat customers, better 
  convention business, and better weather. About one-third reported 
  lower bookings. Our contacts gave mixed views on prospects for 
  tourism for the rest of the summer; 40 percent expect increases, and 
  33 percent expect decreases from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Abundant rainfall and moderate temperatures throughout much of the 
  District during July have raised optimism that fall yields will be 
  strong. The apple crop is in generally good condition. The harvest 
  of early peaches has begun, with that crop also rated as good.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's lumber industry has apparently benefited from strong 
  foreign demand that has largely offset the weakness in domestic 
  demand due to softness in construction. Foreign buyers of lumber 
  were said to have bought all grades and to have paid top prices.
