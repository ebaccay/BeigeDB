      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District varied among sectors in 
recent weeks. In moat areas general business conditions improved 
somewhat further, and office leasing was strong. However, conditions 
in residential construction and retail sales were mixed, and in the 
wake of the stock market crash, concern has developed regarding the 
outlook for the New York City economy. Small and mid-sized banks 
report that demand for consumer installment loans remains strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of retail sales in the District has been mixed in recent 
weeks. While, in general, respondents reported that sales for the 
month of October were on or above plan, their experience following 
the mid-month stock market crash varied. Some retailers had an 
initial falloff in sales, particularly for big-ticket items, which 
was followed by a rebound, while others noted continued weakening 
since the crash. Still others have thus far seen no effect on their 
sales. Reflecting this variation in sales, descriptions of inventory 
levels ranged from "on target" to "4 to 5 percent above plan".
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales gains in October generally ranged from 9 to 13 
percent although one retailer reported a much smaller increase at 
his suburban stores in the District. Soft goods such as apparel and 
accessories, shoes, and jewelry were mentioned as selling well, but 
some higher priced items like furniture, furs, and rugs moved 
slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      District retailers are not overly optimistic concerning the upcoming 
holiday season. Several respondents have adopted a wait-and-see 
attitude in response to what one termed "the new conservatism among 
consumers".
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some further improvement occurred in much of the District's economy 
since the last meeting. However, in the wake of the stock market 
crash, considerable concern has developed regarding the outlook for 
the New York city economy where several investment firms have 
already announced staff reductions. The Rochester survey of 
purchasing managers reported an increase in the number of firms with 
improved general business conditions, and no respondents reported a 
worsening. Also, nearly 90 percent of the survey respondents stated 
that their company's plans for the future have not been affected by 
recent events in the stock market. Those reporting that the stock 
decline has affected plans indicated that it did so because of the 
effect on their company's ability to raise capital and not because
of any change in business conditions. Meanwhile, 85 percent of those 
surveyed in Buffalo reported better or stable conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some planned projects, most of them announced since the stock market 
crash, point to a positive impact on the District's economy. After 
several months' search, two large banks have chosen Buffalo as the 
location for their new facilities. Goldome announced that it will 
buy the former Bethlehem Steel regional headquarters building for 
use as its new telecommunications center, while Marine Midland will 
construct a 840 million back-office facility there. In addition, 
three manufacturing firms also announced plans to expand in the 
Buffalo area. Groundbreaking ceremonies recently took place in the 
Syracuse area for the regional distribution center of a package 
handling company which will provide several hundred new jobs upon 
completion. Meanwhile, in northern New Jersey, Hudson County's first 
shopping mall opened at Newport City, the multibillion dollar 
residential and commercial development under construction there. 
Some 2500 jobs are expected to be created at the mall with first 
preference going to county residents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's residential construction industry 
remain mixed. In much of the New York metropolitan area the pace is 
described as slow with few people out looking for new homes and a 
large inventory of existing homes available. Moreover, in some of 
these areas where the high prices of homes had already been cited as 
a major deterrent, the drop in the stock market has reportedly had a 
further depressing effect on potential homebuyers. Away from the New 
York metropolitan area, however, homebuilders are still quite active 
although some slackening is anticipated as the holiday season and 
winter weather approach.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity continued strong in much of the District 
though some slowing occurred in the downtown Manhattan market. 
Analysts attributed this slowdown to employment cutbacks at some 
brokerage firms and plans announced by others to review their 
staffing needs. Concern over the additional impact that the stock 
market crash will have on the securities and financial services 
industries added to the cautious tone in the downtown market. 
Expansion in these industries has been a major source of demand for 
new office space in recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Senior officers at small and mid-sized banks in the Second District 
stated that demand for consumer installment loans has remained 
strong since the stock market crash, and applications for mortgages 
and home equity loans have not fallen appreciably. One banker noted 
that the real estate market in her area has weakened since the 
spring, but she did not see a pronounced reduction in mortgage 
activity following the crash. Most officers also reported no unusual 
deposit inflows as a result of the steep decline in the stock 
market, contrary to the widespread expectation that nervous 
investors would rush to deposit their funds in federally insured 
accounts. Most banks in the survey have cut their interest rates in 
recent weeks, though some bankers voiced doubts that further 
declines would occur. Because of the steady demand for consumer 
loans, bankers generally anticipated that the crash would cause only 
a mild reduction, if any, in their lending activity through the 
first half of 1988.
