      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 20, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District in June varied among major 
sectors, with most marked by some signs of current or developing 
softness. Manufacturing activity was close to leveling off after a 
year-long decline although employment was still being cut. Retail 
sales were barely up from a year ago, in current dollars, with 
results hampered by slow sales of summer goods, and auto sales have 
declined. Bank lending was fairly healthy year-over-year, but there 
were indications that growth was ebbing. Real estate activity, both 
residential and commercial, was sluggish, and construction, 
especially of offices, was dropping.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is subdued. 
Manufacturers generally foresee a modest increase in production in 
the second half of the year, but they do not expect to step up 
hiring. Retailers are being cautious in their sales forecasts for 
the balance of the year, and they said planning is complicated by 
continued uncertainty with respect to industry restructuring. 
Bankers expect loan growth to continue to slacken as a result of 
weakening loan demand and tightening of credit standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers contacted in late May and early June 
gave indications that the year-long decline in activity might be 
leveling off. Over half of the firms surveyed said business was 
running at a steady pace, and the number of firms reporting improved 
business nearly matched the number noting declines. Although the 
overall picture is one of little change, reports by industry sector 
vary widely. Improvement was noted among producers of chemicals, 
electrical machinery, and stone, clay, and glass products. Most of 
the firms experiencing slower business were producers of nondurable 
goods such as apparel, food products, and paper and paper goods, 
although primary metal producers indicated some weakness, also.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, Third District manufacturers noted a steady rate of new 
orders, a marginal pickup in shipments, and a drop in order 
backlogs. Although most of the firms surveyed were maintaining 
steady employment levels and working hours, on net, they continued 
to make fractional cuts in personnel and hours. Industrial prices in 
the region were steady, with three-fourths of the companies polled 
holding prices of their products steady and nearly nine-out-of-ten 
reporting stable input costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District manufacturers generally foresee 
improvement in the second half of the year. On balance, they expect 
a pickup in orders and they plan to boost shipments accordingly, 
without a buildup in order backlogs. Although they expect to step up 
the pace of production, area firms are planning to hold the line on 
working hours and make some further cuts in payrolls by the end of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District retailers in June indicated that sales 
in the region were generally running only marginally above the pace 
set last spring, in dollar terms, but with a great deal of variation 
from store to store. Auto sales were running below the year-ago 
rate. Merchants said that no particular product lines were standout 
successes or laggards, although there were reports that summer goods 
got off to a slow start. Retail executives attributed the greater 
than usual store-to-store variance to specific situations, and they 
said differences in stocking levels, pricing, and product quality 
accounted for the range of performance. According to merchants, 
consumers are shopping carefully for the best price and quality 
combination on goods for which they feel relatively urgent need, and 
are not spending freely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District merchants were growing more cautious in their outlook 
for the rest of the year. Several said they have been trimming sales 
forecasts since early spring and they saw no signs of a pickup for 
the summer or fall. Some noted that discounting appeared to be 
spreading even to stores that traditionally have been able to avoid 
recourse to price reductions to spur sales. Merchants said that with 
excess capacity in retailing and little evidence of resurgent 
economic growth, prospects for the industry will not brighten soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at major Third District banks in mid-May was 
approximately 13 percent above the May 1989 level. Loan growth has 
continued on a steady pace for the past three quarters, but bankers 
contacted in June saw signs of a slowdown developing. Consumer 
lending, although strong year-over-year, has begun to slip, 
according to bankers. They reported a drop in auto loans in line 
with falling auto sales, and easing growth in home equity, credit 
card, and other installment outstandings. Commercial and industrial 
lending was described by bankers as growing modestly, but they 
expect growth to lag as loan demand eases and tighter credit 
standards are implemented, especially for construction financing. 
Bankers also generally reported a continuing moderation in the 
growth of real estate financing, both commercial and residential.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate markets remain soft throughout the Third District. 
Realtors and mortgage lenders indicated that housing sales were 
sluggish and average selling prices were declining as sales of 
higher-priced homes have fallen off more than sales of lower-priced 
homes. Realtors believe activity in the higher price ranges has 
slackened because concern about job security has risen among typical 
move-up buyers (cutbacks in the financial services and defense 
industries were mentioned) while first-time home buyers are still 
motivated to buy, and are able to obtain mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and residential construction continued to decline in June 
as office vacancies increased and credit available to developers 
shrunk. Suburban office and speculative housing construction were 
relatively weakest, while industrial construction, which is not 
typically speculative, and pre-sold residential building retained 
some health.
