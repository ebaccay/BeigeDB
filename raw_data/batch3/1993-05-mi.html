      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Ninth District is growing moderately. Consumer 
spending on merchandise, automobiles and new homes continues to grow 
and provide impetus for the economy. Moreover, other indicators 
signal that the recovery is firming. Commercial and heavy 
construction is reviving, with substantial state and local 
government projects slated for some areas. Recent indicators suggest 
some growth in manufacturing. In agriculture, cattle and hog numbers 
continue to rise in response to very favorable feed and slaughter 
prices. While current mining output is unchanged, industry officials 
predict an improved year for iron mining and profitability has 
improved for gold producers. Oil industry prospects ate positive for 
the first time in years. Cold, wet weather is severely delaying 
grain planting but has helped ensure that soil moisture levels are 
adequate across virtually all of the Ninth District. However, labor 
markets show slight growth in total employment coupled with steady 
to slightly higher unemployment rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobiles constitute one strong area of consumer spending. In 
March, new registrations of passenger autos and pickups in Minnesota 
were 6 percent above year-earlier levels. North and South Dakota 
also report strong auto sales. "The first quarter has been very 
good," said a South Dakota auto dealers association spokesperson.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spending on general merchandise apparently continued at levels 3 to 
5 percent above year earlier levels for the month of March and for 
the first quarter of 1993. A major Minneapolis-based general 
retailer characterized its March same-store sales, up 3.6 percent 
from a year earlier, as "disappointing" in comparison to increases 
achieved in January and February. However, such levels seem typical 
for much of the district. Advisory council members, Ninth District 
directors and newspapers generally also report good retail sales 
conditions but no spectacular growth. And the Minnesota Department 
of Revenue announced that sales tax receipts through the first 
quarter were above projections.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Heavy and commercial construction is strong. A trade publication 
that tabulates construction industry data for all publicly-tendered 
contracts in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota reports that 
contract awards for the first quarter of 1993 are 45 percent above 
the first quarter of 1992. Some local units of government reportedly 
will spend substantial amounts on construction in 1993, with $75 
million announced for Sioux Falls. S.D. Directors and newspapers 
also report substantial amounts of small and medium-scale commercial 
construction that is not generally awarded through public bids.
     </p>
     <p>
      New single-family bowing permits in February for Minneapolis-St. 
Paul remained below year-earlier levels but rose after declines the 
previous two months. And industry spokespersons across the district 
continue to describe residential construction as strong. A 
Minneapolis area builder's association representative characterized 
sales as "very strong" and a newspaper noted a building boom in the 
Sioux Falls. S.D., area. A district director from western South 
Dakota described the housing market in the Rapid City area as "very 
tight', noting that many new single-family residences were planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Available indicators point to some growth in the manufacturing 
sector. Minnesota's employment in manufacturing in February was 
about 2 percent above year-earlier levels. Weekly hours in 
manufacturing stood at 41.0, up slightly from the prior month and 
nearly an hour above February 1992 levels. An electrical utility 
serving most of the Ninth District manufacturing in South Dakota, 
Minnesota and Wisconsin reported that weather-normalized electrical 
use in industry grew at about 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 
1993 compared to the same period in 1992. Food processing and non-
electrical machinery manufacturing showed the greatest increases. 
And recent earnings reports of publicly-traded manufacturing firms 
in the district show a pattern of sales and earnings generally well
above year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining and Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions have improved somewhat in mining. One Minnesota 
iron mining industry spokesman estimated that 1993 shipments would 
be 2 million tons or 5 percent above 1992 levels. Recent price 
increases have improved profitability in South Dakota and Montana 
gold mining, and output and employment remain steady. Copper prices 
remain low, but no new production cuts or layoffs have been reported 
recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      One high producing new oil well was completed near Dickinson. N.D. 
Ninth District directors from North Dakota and Montana report that 
oil companies show renewed interest in leasing and exploration and 
believe that with tight cost control, new production wells can be 
profitable at current oil price levels. Drilling rig counts for 
April are approximately equal to the same period in 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Livestock are the most positive component in agriculture. Slaughter 
cattle and hog prices are strong. Good fat cattle prices combined 
with low feed costs have pushed feeder cattle prices to historic 
highs, and earnings by ranchers in western South Dakota and Montana 
are reported to be strong. Numbers of livestock on farms as well as 
slaughter numbers are high. One problem is that cold, wet weather 
has increased newborn calf mortality for beef producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The crop sector is still emerging from winter inactivity. Grain 
prices in mid-April are largely unchanged since February with the 
exception of an increase in the corn price. Unusually cool, wet 
weather has delayed field preparation and crop planting in all 
district states and for all major crops. Soil moisture levels are 
adequate to surplus across virtually all agricultural regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In spite of indications of at least moderate growth in the sectors 
reviewed above, labor markets show little significant change in 
early spring. Indicators for February generally show slight 
increases in total employment compared to month and year-earlier 
figures combined with steady to slightly higher unemployment rates. 
Minnesota, with over half of the district's labor force, had an 
unemployment rate of 6.4 percent for February, one-half point higher 
than in January and 1.1 points higher than a year earlier. 
Unemployment rates also rose in South Dakota in spite of modest 
increases in employment levels. Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where 
unemployment rates have fallen 3 points in the last year to February 
levels of 10 percent, is one region with improvement. In Minnesota 
and the Dakotas, March initial claims for unemployment generally 
rose from February levels but were somewhat below year-earlier 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      In spite of positive developments in the general economy noted 
above, such weakness in labor markets may continue due so ongoing 
processes of corporate restructuring and military downsizing that 
continue to affect the Ninth District. A large computer manufacturer 
announced that 700 full-time and 1,200 part-time or temporary 
workers will be laid off at its Rochester, Minn., plant out of a 
total of some 7,600 workers. And the Department of Defense announced 
that K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, located in Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula, was on its list of facilities slated for closing. Sawyer 
AFB, with 3,300 military and 1,000 civilian personnel, is a major 
factor in Upper Peninsula employment and spending.
