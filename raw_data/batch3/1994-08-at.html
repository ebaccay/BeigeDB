      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <strong>
      August 3, 1994
     </strong>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Southeast economy continues to expand, although business 
contacts in the region have reported modest slowing in scattered 
sectors. Retailers reported higher sales levels in June and July, 
and most seem more encouraged about fall sales prospects. District 
manufacturers reported some moderation in production activity in 
June, but producers of building-related materials, auto parts, 
steel, paper, and chemicals all reported expanding operations. Home 
sales in the District remain good, but homebuilders are expecting a 
slowing in single-family construction activity in the next few 
months. Multifamily and commercial real estate activity continues to 
improve. Sixth District bankers reported that consumer loan demand 
was mixed but commercial loan activity has increased. Contacts 
report that consumer prices remain generally stable, but tight labor 
markets in some areas are pushing up wage rates. Georgia flood loss 
estimates now run on the order of one billion dollars, although 
initial infrastructure loss estimates are often revised down. There 
has apparently been little economic disruption outside the directly 
affected areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After slowing considerably in the spring, Sixth District retailers 
reported generally improving sales of late. Contacts continue to 
note that strong competition in most areas is holding down prices at 
both the wholesale and retail level. Apparel sales, which fell off 
sharply in April and May, rebounded in June and July. However, much 
of this improvement was said to be due to increased discounting and 
promotions. Nonetheless, contacts seem generally more optimistic 
than they were in late spring about back-to-school sales, with most 
expecting increases of 3 to 6 percent over last years' levels. 
Retailers are no longer reporting year-over-year gains for sales of 
home-related products, such as furnishings and appliances, in 
conjunction with the maturing housing cycle. Auto dealers in the 
District continue to report healthy car and truck sales, though 
business customers note that the cost of new autos is rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity moderated slightly in the Southeast in early 
summer, reflected by slowing shipments and orders for some 
producers. However, most factory contacts remain optimistic about 
the near-term outlook. Producers of construction equipment are 
expanding in overseas and domestic markets aided by the lower dollar 
and growing commercial construction activity. Production levels 
remain high for carpet producers, and some apparel fabric 
manufacturers are encouraged by a recent strengthening in demand. 
The chemical industry, steel producers, and auto parts manufacturers 
are expanding operations and adding jobs. At the same time, mergers 
and consolidations continue to cause layoffs in Florida's aerospace 
industry, and other large companies continue to trim payrolls in the 
region. The demand for paper is said to be rebounding in foreign and 
domestic markets, and prices have started to trend upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity remains healthy in most of the region. Overseas 
travel to Georgia has surged since Atlanta was named the site for 
the next summer Olympics, and tourism and trade officials expect the 
trend to continue. Miami's cruise industry reports that bookings 
have been good. Despite the temporary uptick provided by World Cup 
visitors, tourism is still off in central Florida. Hotel occupancies 
are down from a year ago due in part to fewer British and German 
tourists. Casino gambling continues to attract a record number of 
tourists to Mississippi's Gulf Coast, and the summer convention 
trade in New Orleans is at an all-time high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District realtors reported brisk home sales in June and July. Most 
contacts noted that despite higher mortgage rates, home sales this 
summer have equaled last year's very strong level. Starter and mid-
priced homes continue to sell well, but there have been some reports 
of first-time home buyers being squeezed out of the market by higher 
mortgage rates. Luxury home sales continue to improve. Demand for 
new homes remains strong, but many realtors and builders are 
expecting a gradual slowing in building activity in the next several 
months, with some regions reporting the slowing already occurring. 
However, an unseasonably wet summer has delayed building in many 
areas of the District, and it may take builders some time to get 
caught up on planned building activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report 
improving conditions in their markets. Multifamily occupancy and 
rental rates are rising in most areas of the District, and many 
cities are seeing new multifamily development underway. In addition, 
commercial realtors are also reporting improved leasing activity and 
falling vacancy rates. While almost all new commercial construction 
in the District is either public or build-to-suit, some contacts 
have noted that they anticipate some speculative building in 
selected areas within the next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers around the region reported that overall loan demand was 
steady or up moderately in June and July. Consumer loan demand was 
mixed from bank to bank. Mortgage lending has picked up a little in 
the summer months, but the loan pipeline seems to be emptying in 
many areas. Commercial loan activity was consistently reported as 
stronger, although in a very competitive market. Several bankers 
reported seeing more real estate deals, while one reported 
experiencing double digit growth on the commercial side.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets are tightening in parts of the District. In Tennessee, 
clerical support and skilled laborers are reported to be in strong 
demand pushing wages upward. In New Orleans, the demand for 
temporary workers is said to be the highest it has been in four 
years. Price increases have generally held steady since the last 
report, although some contacts in the paper- and construction-
related industries report larger but sporadic gains. Some apparel 
producers note increasing raw material prices, but retail prices 
remain flat.
