      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District in late July appeared 
mixed. Manufacturers indicated that business continued to improve. 
Reports from retailers varied; but, overall, sales appeared to be 
sluggish. Bankers generally were experiencing declining loan demand. 
Real estate contacts said commercial leasing activity was slow but 
showing some signs of improvement, and residential sales were 
picking up also; however, construction activity remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, sentiment among Third District business contacts is 
slightly positive, although reservations about commercial real 
estate persist, and the outlook for bank lending is clouded. The 
balance of opinion among manufacturers is optimistic, with 
improvement anticipated in orders and shipments, and gains 
forecasted for employment. Retailers look for some slight 
improvement in the fall and winter. Bankers said a rebound in 
lending is dependent upon an economic recovery, which they do not 
believe is firmly established yet. Realtors expect further increases 
in residential sales, but believe significant improvement in 
commercial activity is at least a year away. The pace of 
construction is expected to remain slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued on the 
uptrend that began in May, according to firms contacted in July. 
Although half of the companies polled reported just steady business 
in recent weeks, one-third noted improvement. Gains were fairly 
evenly spread across industries in the region except for 
manufacturers of industrial equipment and building products; these 
firms indicated that demand for their products remained weak. 
Overall, however, both new orders and shipments were moving up at 
plants in the District, and both delivery times and order backlogs 
were edging up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Improving business conditions were not being accompanied by 
increases in employment. Two-thirds of the manufacturers contacted 
said they were holding the line on payrolls, and one-fourth were 
making cuts. Most firms also reported no change in the length of the 
workweek in July, and those reporting increases just offset those 
reporting decreases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, most of Third District manufacturers surveyed expect 
business to continue to improve over the next six months. On 
balance, they foresee gains in new orders and shipments. In line 
with this outlook, they plan to add workers and step up capital 
spending during the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers contacted in late July gave mixed reports on recent sales 
results. Some specialty retailers, particularly those selling 
apparel and jewelry, indicated that sales were improving, but 
general merchandise and department stores appeared to be 
experiencing sluggish sales. Some store officials said that although 
hotter than normal weather boosted sales of fans and air 
conditioners, the heat was having an overall depressing effect on 
sales by reducing store traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Opinions about the balance of the year vary. Some merchants believe 
a pickup may begin, this fall but others think that sales could 
remain slow until the Christmas shopping season. Few merchants 
expect a strong recovery, and some said they were being cautious in 
placing orders for merchandise intended to be sold during the fourth 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers generally indicated that sales slipped somewhat in July 
after a pickup in June. The selling rate has varied considerably 
month-to-month so far this year, according to dealers, and they say 
it is difficult to predict sales for the second half. On balance, 
however, they expect auto sales will improve only slowly even with 
an overall economic expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Third District bankers contacted in late July said loan volumes 
outstanding were falling in nearly every credit category. Home 
equity loan volume was showing the least slippage, and some bankers 
said they were promoting these loans aggressively. Other types of 
consumer credit have been declining at a more rapid rate, as have 
real estate and business loan volumes. While some bankers said they 
were continuing to trim real estate portfolios, several said they 
were stepping up promotion efforts for business lending but meeting 
slack demand from creditworthy potential borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers generally indicated that they expect loan 
demand to remain slack in the near future. Several said they did not 
believe an economic recovery was firmly under way yet, and most 
expect only a slow expansion following the current recession. 
Nevertheless, some optimism was expressed that loan growth would 
resume with a recovery as consumer demand increases and improved 
business revenues qualify more firms for credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District real estate executives reported that commercial 
leasing activity for the first half was quite low compared to the 
past few years, but some noted a pickup in the past month. Estimates 
of vacancy rates for office space in the Philadelphia area range 
from 14 percent for the central business district to 26 percent in 
some suburban areas. Some realtors believe vacancy rates could 
decline during the second half given the lack of significant 
construction activity in the region; however, most expect that solid 
improvement in overall commercial real estate--including hotel, 
retail, and office space--is at least a year away.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential realtors expressed some optimism that the sales trend 
may be improving. Many reported a sales pickup in February and 
March, and, while there are indications that the upward momentum has 
flagged recently, realtors do not expect sales to fall off, after 
taking into account seasonal factors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, construction activity in the Third District remains weak 
and the latest reports on new contract values in the Philadelphia 
SMSA (May) indicate a continuing downward trend. Industry contacts 
polled in July said that some financially strong residential 
builders were continuing work on projects and that some new 
commercial construction was being planned for the fall; but, 
overall, private construction activity is expected to remain low. 
Significant increases in public construction are precluded by budget 
pressures on state and local governments, according to industry 
sources.
