      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Southeast continues to show moderately increasing employment and 
falling unemployment rates, even in Louisiana and Mississippi where 
rates have been in double digits. Manufacturing employment has been 
increasing, especially in textiles. Construction of office buildings 
and homes has slowed, although warehouse and industrial construction 
is still strong. Production of oil and gas seems to have bottomed 
out.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The employment picture improved moderately in the region for the 
latest reporting period. Notably, the unemployment rate in Louisiana 
fell by over one percentage point from March to April, and total 
employment expanded. Transportation equipment employment increased 
in the state due to more activity in ship building and repair. 
Increased activity in the lumber and wood sector also accounted for 
some of the state's employment gains. The employment declines in the 
energy-producing sector appear to have bottomed out.
     </p>
     <p>
      District chemical producers supplying the apparel and textile 
industry have been prospering as a result of the rebound in 
textiles. The tire industry is strong as a result of lower prices 
for petrochemical raw products and growing demand attributable to 
increased auto travel. Food manufacturing is getting a strong lift 
from the expansion in poultry and fish processing industries. 
Spokesmen from the furniture manufacturing industry are optimistic, 
at least for the near term. The machinery industry, however, suffers 
from excess capacity and weak demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      During May, southeastern retailers generally posted slight increases 
over last May's sales. While overall sales fulfilled merchants' 
expectations, activity continued to be sluggish in Mississippi and 
Louisiana. Retailers do not plan to increase inventory levels in 
anticipation of higher prices, and they seem content with their 
present inventory as they head into the summer months. Although 
profit margins on foreign goods are decreasing for some, retailers 
generally have not yet raised prices on imported merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car sales in the District were disappointing in May as major U.S. 
and Japanese manufacturers posted sharp declines in sales from 
levels a year earlier. Dealers' hopes for the traditionally strong 
pre-summer months were dashed despite attractive car-maker incentive 
programs to lure new buyers. Meanwhile, minivan, utility vehicle, 
and light truck sales are still growing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family building permits held steady in April for the Sixth 
District and the nation (three-month average, seasonally adjusted). 
Contacts in Birmingham, Atlanta, and Nashville report an oversupply 
of homes priced over $200,000 but note that the sale of medium-
priced homes is still strong. Additions and renovations to existing 
buildings make up the bulk of construction in New Orleans. The 
mortgage rate increase has dampened sales and led to closing delays, 
say realtors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orlando builders report a decrease in office vacancy rates, although 
contacts in Atlanta and Birmingham say the construction pace has yet 
to slow enough to see significant rate declines. Office vacancy 
rates in the central business districts of Ft. Lauderdale and 
Memphis rank among the nation's highest. Contacts say the 
concentration of new office space in the suburbs of these cities is 
largely to blame.
     </p>
     <p>
      District builders are more optimistic about development of 
industrial distribution and warehouse space. Atlanta's strong 
absorption rate has spurred assemblage of large land tracts for 
industrial development despite falling rental rates. Orlando 
contacts expect strong demand this year and steadily declining 
vacancy rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan growth at the District's larger commercial banks edged 
downward in April, caused largely by a steep drop in the growth rate 
of consumer loans. Contacts speculate that reductions in outstanding 
credit card debt, along with weak auto sales and uncertainty about 
the economy, may have dampened consumer lending growth this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With visitor registration in May up strongly from last year, there 
are expectations throughout the Southeast of a strong summer season 
for tourism. Cities throughout the District are posting increases in 
air travel well above the national average, which is partially a 
result of more airlines selecting southern cities as hubs for their 
operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lower dollar appears to be slowly fueling export growth in the 
District. Miami port officials report gradual improvements in 
exports to Latin America. Even so, exports and total port tonnage 
were both 10 percent below year-earlier levels for the first seven 
months of the fiscal year beginning in August 1986. In New Orleans, 
a rise in exports of pulp and paper and other manufactured products 
has substantially boosted port employment and revenues. Rebounding 
foreign sales of phosphates in the first four months this year 
pushed Tampa's export tonnage up by about 5 percent from the 
depressed level in the same period last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District oil rig activity remained stable in May for the third 
consecutive month. Even so, the number of rigs in operation is still 
30 percent below last year's depressed figures. Although two-thirds 
of the ocean rigs in the Gulf of Mexico are idle at present, one 
source predicts active rig numbers will double by 1988 because of 
the improving price outlook. Coal production in Alabama and 
Tennessee experienced more than a seasonal decline in April and May; 
output fell short of year-ago levels by 12 percent. With higher 
prices for petroleum products, demand for coal should improve during 
the balance of 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, crop prospects currently appear favorable. There is some 
concern over low rainfall totals in the eastern half of the 
District. The poultry industry, suffering from production-induced 
price declines, is experiencing shrinking profits. Pork and cattle 
herds are apparently being rebuilt.
