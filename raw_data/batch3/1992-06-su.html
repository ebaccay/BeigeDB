      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continues to improve. The manufacturing sector 
appears to be strengthening in all districts. The Chicago, Dallas 
and St. Louis districts report gains in nonmanufacturing sectors as 
well. All districts except Boston, New York and San Francisco report 
moderate increases in consumer spending. Residential construction 
activity remains well above year-ago levels in most districts, and 
new home prices have risen in several regions. Loan demand appears 
to be increasing in most districts. Price stability in the retailing 
and manufacturing sectors seems to be the rule across districts. 
Adverse weather has affected agricultural prospects in many 
districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All districts report improving manufacturing conditions, except for 
the defense and aerospace industries. The Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, 
Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Francisco districts report that 
orders are increasing modestly, while Atlanta and Chicago note much 
sharper gains. Most of the increases come from durables-producing 
industries within each district. Employment at manufacturing firms 
continues to rise in the Chicago, Philadelphia and Richmond 
districts. The Atlanta district reports that some firms have 
increased hours in response to increased demand. The Boston, New 
York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts also report that at least 
one-fourth of the surveyed firms will hire new employees during the 
next six months. The Chicago district adds that an increase in 
orders for new cars is expected to require additional shifts and/or 
overtime. The St. Louis district reports employment declines because 
of plant closures and relocations, while the San Francisco district 
reports significant declines because of defense industry cutbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reported inventory levels are mixed. San Francisco district firms 
report no inventory concerns, while firms in the Kansas City 
district find their inventories either satisfactory or slightly 
high. Richmond district firms experienced no changes in inventories 
or backlogs and foresee no changes in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for exports of manufactured goods seems to be waning because 
of weakening foreign economies. For example, the Boston, 
Minneapolis, Richmond and San Francisco districts report a drop-off 
in the volume of durables exports, especially electronics to Japan 
and appliances to Canada. The San Francisco district, however, 
reports that exports of electronic components to other Pacific-Rim 
nations remain strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonmanufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The St. Louis district reports strengthening in the growth of 
nonmanufacturing employment. Southern California, on the other hand, 
has experienced a large loss of retail and service-related jobs in 
the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, and the New York district 
will post significant retail job losses by this fall when 15 major 
department stores in the New York metropolitan area are closed. 
Outside of retailing, the Chicago and Dallas districts report 
increased activity in business-related services. The San Francisco 
district indicates growth in advertising but declines in 
telecommunications.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts report increases in non-auto merchandise sales. All 
districts except Boston, Cleveland, New York and San Francisco 
report modest gains in April and May, while the Minneapolis, 
Philadelphia and St. Louis districts note year-over-year gains as 
well. Much of this growth is attributed to the late Easter season. 
The Dallas, Philadelphia and Richmond districts identify big-ticket 
items as slow movers, and Atlanta concurs by stating that 
nondurables are selling better than durables. The Dallas district 
notes greater improvement at mid- to upper-scale stores than at 
discounters, while San Francisco indicates increases at both 
department and discount stores. Contacts in the Boston and New York 
districts blame unseasonably cool weather and the news of potential 
additional layoffs for their poor sales. Auto dealership traffic and 
sales are increasing steadily in most districts; the Dallas and San 
Francisco districts, however, report slower or "spotty" growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity continues to be a source of 
strength in most districts. While construction has stabilized or 
dropped off slightly in some districts since its first-quarter 
surge, contacts in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond 
and St. Louis districts describe the pace of residential building 
activity as strong. New home prices are reportedly higher in the 
Dallas, Kansas City and Richmond districts because of increased 
lumber costs and low inventories. New and existing home sales are 
mixed, with the Atlanta and Minneapolis districts reporting a slight 
downward trend in sales and the Kansas City and Richmond districts 
reporting a continued increase in sales. No appreciable improvement 
in commercial real estate markets is reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to have increased slightly in most districts. 
Contacts in the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Richmond and 
San Francisco districts report stable-to-stronger loan demand. The 
Philadelphia district describes loan demand as soft, and the St. 
Louis district reports that loan demand appears to have weakened in 
recent weeks. The source of increased demand varies by district; 
some report increases in consumer loan demand, while others note 
improvements in business loan demand. The Kansas City and San 
Francisco districts report increases in both categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inflationary expectations in retailing and manufacturing remain 
relatively subdued. Contacts in the Boston, Dallas and Philadelphia 
districts report retail prices as stable, while contacts in the 
Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond and San Francisco 
districts report slight-to-moderate price increases. Manufacturing 
and retailing wage pressures remain moderate-to-low across most 
districts. Manufacturing materials prices remain relatively stable 
across districts, although steel producers in the Chicago district 
report higher input prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agriculture, Energy and Natural-Resources-Related Industries
Many districts report that unseasonably cool weather and inadequate 
soil moisture have hampered the planting and development of many 
crops. In the Chicago, Kansas City and St. Louis districts, adverse 
weather has affected the corn, cotton, soybean and winter wheat 
crops. Declining livestock prices have recently led cattle and pork 
producers in the Kansas City district to curtail production. The San 
Francisco district reports that, except for grains, agricultural 
exports to Mexico and the Pacific Rim (excluding Japan) have been 
strong lately. Despite the recent firming of oil and gas prices, the 
Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts 
indicate that the energy sector remains weak. Lumber production is 
up significantly in the St. Louis district, but down in the San 
Francisco district.
