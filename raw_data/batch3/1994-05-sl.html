      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District economy has expanded robustly in recent months with 
many firms reporting expansions, additions to payrolls and increases 
in sales. Auto manufacturers in particular report booming activity, 
and expect to increase auto production employment in St. Louis to 
the highest level since 1989. Input price pressures remain muted for 
many firms. In a recent survey of District small businesses, about 
30 percent believe economic conditions will improve further during 
the next quarter. The District's real estate sector remains in high 
gear, as evidenced by double-digit increases in building permits and 
frequent assessments that homes available for sale are in short 
supply. Loan demand, especially for consumer loans, continues to 
pick up at area banks. Fertilizer prices have risen dramatically 
from year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District firms, particularly manufacturing firms, report healthy 
growth, citing plant expansions and new hirings. Announcements of 
expansions by two of the three auto makers in St. Louis will boost 
the region's auto production significantly. One firm will reopen its 
second plant to build pickup trucks and minivans. The other firm 
will build both minivans and sport utility vehicles in the same 
plant. Reports are that these moves, along with the third auto 
firm's plant reopening in 1995 to build full-size vans, will bring 
St. Louis auto production employment to 15,000, its highest level 
since 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      A St. Louis-based defense contractor received the Administration's 
approval to sell fighter jets to Israel, guaranteeing about 5,000 
jobs through mid-1998. One of the nation's largest trucking 
companies is hiring 300 more drivers for its Memphis terminal to 
meet higher demand. A maker of screen-printed T-shirts in Louisville 
will add 220 workers because of increased demand. A maker of 
refrigeration compressors in northwest Mississippi will add 400 
workers as it undergoes an $80 million expansion. An Arkansas 
poultry processor selected Pine Bluff for its first of four new 
plants to be built, bringing another 400 jobs into the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms in northeast Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee also report 
growth. For example, a building supplies company reports a 10 
percent year-to-date sales increase over last year, and a metal 
salvage company reports year-to-date revenues up 40 percent over 
last year. A conveyor manufacturer and a caster manufacturer report 
year-to-date sales increases of between 3 percent and 5 percent over 
last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      There were, however, also some reports of layoffs. An apparel maker 
is letting 250 workers go from its Arkansas plant because of cuts in 
production. A paper products maker sold its Memphis plant to another 
firm, resulting in the loss of 650 jobs. A shoe manufacturer will 
lay off 350 employees from its Missouri plant; about 100 of these 
workers will be offered positions at other plants, though.
     </p>
     <p>
      A recent National Federation of Independent Businesses survey of 
District firms reveals that about 19 percent think now is a good 
time to expand and about 30 percent believe general economic 
conditions will improve during the next quarter. During the first 
quarter, 14 percent increased employment, and 20 percent plan to 
increase employment this quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to the aforementioned NFIB survey, about 17 percent of 
small firms reported price increases during the first quarter of the 
year, while nearly 30 percent plan to increase their prices this 
quarter. Elsewhere, an informal survey of several mostly large 
Eighth District firms suggests that, in general, cost pressures 
remain modest to nonexistent. A large appliance manufacturer, for 
example, reports that it continues to resist price pressures from 
its suppliers where possible; this behavior was also noted by other 
firms. A few firms reported that prices of important raw materials-
for example, steel, aluminum and certain petrochemicals-have 
increased recently. A bathroom fixture manufacturer reports that 
significant price pressures have developed in certain resins, 
chemicals and corrugated cardboard. A food and beverage manufacturer 
reports that lower packaging costs in the first quarter (year-over-
year basis) more than offset higher prices for raw ingredients. Some 
firms suggest that they expect to see increased price pressures for 
raw materials beginning early next year. On the output side, nearly 
all firms surveyed report that competitive pressures preclude any 
substantive price increases. Some firms, however, are trying to 
increase prices where possible, with varying degrees of success.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity remains brisk, and recent 
increases in long-term interest rates have apparently spurred "fence 
sitters" into the market. Despite recent cost pressures especially 
for lumber, two-thirds of District construction respondents in a 
first quarter 1994 small-business survey had no plans to increase 
prices in the next three months. District real estate agents report 
a shortage of houses on the market, especially in the mid-priced 
range, and note that many sellers are receiving two or more bids at 
the asking price or higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand continues to pick up modestly in most parts of the 
District. Consumer loan demand is generally characterized as 
stronger than commercial loan demand. Rates paid on deposits have 
risen only slightly in response to the general pick-up in interest 
rates. Mortgage refinancing activity has slowed considerably because 
of the recent increases in long-term rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fertilizer prices have increased substantially over last year's 
relatively low levels according to three large manufacturers. Prices 
have increased because of reduced ammonia supplies from the former 
Soviet Union, unanticipated shutdowns of domestic plants and an 
increase in demand stemming from a relatively large U.S. corn 
acreage. These prices are expected to prevail throughout the 
planting season and into late May.
