      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic growth is reported as slow to moderate in most 
Federal Reserve districts. Consumer spending is mixed, with a number 
of districts describing retail sales as steady to growing slowly. 
Manufacturing activity is also mixed, with some districts reporting 
weakness in orders and shipments. Weakness of construction in some 
markets contrasts with evidence of some improvement elsewhere. 
Resource industries, including the energy sector, appear to be 
improving, as is agriculture generally. Loan demand at commercial 
banks continues to vary by region and type of loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports show that retail sales have been mixed across the 
country. Overall retail sales are described as steady to growing 
slowly in several districts (Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco). Dallas reports a recent 
acceleration in retail sales increases, Cleveland notes better-than-expected sales recently, and Minneapolis says general merchandise 
spending is strong. Boston and New York report mixed retail sales 
results. Where specific lines of goods are mentioned, sales of 
apparel, basic housewares, and other nondurables are described as 
relatively strong. Sales are weaker for discretionary, big-ticket 
items such as furniture, home appliances, and consumer electronics; 
auto sales have also been weakening recently. Retail sales 
expectations for the upcoming holiday season are modest in the 
Boston district, average in the Kansas City district, generally 
positive in the Philadelphia district, and optimistic in the 
Cleveland and Dallas districts. Most businesses in the San Francisco 
area have resumed operations since the earthquake, but road closures 
and property damage are delaying a complete return to business as 
usual.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing performance is mixed, both among districts and across 
industries. Philadelphia reports further declines in manufacturing 
activity, especially for durable goods, as orders and backlogs fall. 
Chicago reports slower growth, and some declines in orders and 
sales, for most manufacturers. Producers of both high-tech and 
traditional capital goods in the Cleveland district report slower 
growth or outright declines in orders and production in recent 
months. Boston reports sales and orders up modestly for most 
manufacturers, and Dallas notes a slight expansion overall in its 
manufacturing sector. San Francisco reports solid manufacturing 
activity in the West. Richmond and St. Louis report varied business 
conditions for their district manufacturers. Prices of materials 
inputs are reported as mostly stable by four districts, while 
Richmond reports a slower rise in input prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Significant variations in manufacturing performance also exist 
across industries. Minneapolis says "troubles have continued to 
mount in the computer and electronics industries," citing recent 
employment reductions by Minnesota computer manufacturers. But 
Cleveland notes that orders for office equipment may be leveling 
out, following a decline. And Chicago says the slowdown in 
communications equipment demand appears to have bottomed out. 
Producers of construction machinery and heavy duty trucks in the 
Cleveland district report further slowdowns in orders and sales. 
Chicago reports steel shipments are down as "industrial procurement 
of steel has peaked," but that order backlogs will continue to 
support steel production. Auto industry contacts are optimistic 
about maintaining current assembly schedules, and shipments of large 
farm tractors and combines are well above those of a year ago. St. 
Louis reports declines in manufacturing employment in several 
sectors, with recent layoffs by makers of autos and home appliances. 
San Francisco reports capacity constraints in commercial aircraft 
manufacturing still exist but are no longer worsening.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Signs of weakness in housing markets in some districts contrast with 
some evidence of improvement elsewhere. Residential construction is 
showing signs of weakness in the St. Louis district, with 
considerable weakening in Louisville and St. Louis. Kansas City 
reports soft housing activity with starts down and sales stable to 
down slightly. Atlanta says residential construction continues to be 
slow across the Southeast. Dallas reports little change lately in 
residential building. Chicago is receiving mixed reports on 
residential sales, while Richmond reports stronger demand for 
mortgage loans in most parts of its district. Home sales have picked 
up somewhat in the Boston district, due partly to lower prices and 
creative financing. New York reports strong demand for new housing 
in Buffalo and Syracuse, but an abundance of resale homes weakens 
the market in the New York metropolitan area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity also varies among districts. 
Signs of weakness in nonresidential building are present in the St. 
Louis district. Office construction continues to be slow in the 
Atlanta district, but some manufacturing plant expansions are 
underway. Construction is holding up well in much of the Chicago 
district, as evidenced by strength in shipments of construction 
materials. Commercial building in downtown Chicago remains at a high 
level. Dallas reports a mild improvement in nonresidential building. 
Office vacancy rates, though still high, are falling in most cities 
in the Dallas district, and industrial vacancy rates are also 
falling. Office leasing activity has picked up recently in the New
York district, especially in midtown Manhattan. Construction and 
real estate activity have been strong in the San Francisco district, 
except in Arizona.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource Industries and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions appear to be improving in some resource industries, 
including the energy sector. Minneapolis reports a good year for 
mining, especially copper mining, and continued expansion for the 
lumber industry. Both Dallas and Kansas City report further gradual 
expansion in oil and gas drilling activity. Exploration and 
development activity are significantly above the year-ago 1evel in 
the Kansas City district. Dallas reports a slow steady increase in 
its drilling rig count. All of the increase has been in Texas, with 
declines elsewhere in the district. A turnaround is expected in 
Louisiana and New Mexico along with further growth in Texas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Minneapolis reports moderately strong tourist activity. Yellowstone 
National Park received a large number of visitors this summer, but 
their spending was lower than expected. Tourist activity in the 
Richmond district is up from a year ago in spite of Charleston's 
lost business due to Hurricane Hugo. With about 85 percent of the 
city's hotels reopened, however, bookings for the fall are about the 
same as a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the farm sector generally continue to improve. The 
fall harvest brought better than expected crop yields to the Chicago 
district, especially in Iowa. While cool, wet weather delayed the 
harvest of cotton and soybeans in the St. Louis district, other fall 
crops were harvested on schedule. Fall crop yields were average to 
above average in the Kansas City district, where good prices for 
wheat and feeder cattle are maintaining farm incomes. Minneapolis 
reports generally good agricultural conditions and notes that the 
Montana range recovered well from last year's drought. Soil, 
moisture conditions have improved for much of the Dallas district, 
but parts of southern and central Texas still have serious drought 
problems. In the Richmond district, yields were excellent for most 
fall crops, farm income prospects are bright, and land prices are 
steady to rising in most areas. Hurricane Hugo severely affected the 
agricultural sectors of North and South Carolina, bringing extensive 
damage to crops and structures as well as considerable destruction 
of livestock and poultry. Total damage to the farm sector in both 
states has been estimated at nearly $1.2 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at commercial banks continues to vary by region and type 
of loan. Demand for business and real estate loans has been slow to 
moderate at small and medium-sized banks in the New York district. 
Philadelphia reports strong growth in most types of lending at major 
banks, but growth in consumer loans and real estate loans is 
expected to slow soon. Slow-growing or steady loan demand is noted 
by Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City. Atlanta reports slightly 
higher—but still low—demand for most consumer and business loans; 
real estate and auto loans are weak. In the St. Louis district, 
total lending by large banks is growing. San Francisco reports strong growth in construction loan activity during recent weeks.
