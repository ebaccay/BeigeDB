      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 24, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity is expanding slowly in most of the nation, with 
conditions somewhat stronger in the West than the East. Retail sales 
in the holiday season ranged from "disappointing" in Boston to 
modest in Philadelphia and Atlanta and relatively strong in Chicago, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco; however, widespread discounting 
generally reduced store profits. Manufacturing activity is generally 
sluggish with production declines in some industries (autos, in 
particular) offsetting gains in others (such as commercial aircraft 
and oilfield equipment). Several Districts reported that the steel 
and computer industries, among others, may be "bottoming out."
     </p>
     <p>
      Unseasonably cold weather dampened construction activity in some 
areas, but real estate markets generally held steady. Cold or dry 
weather also adversely affected citrus, vegetable, and winter wheat 
crops. Other agricultural and resource-related sectors did 
moderately well. The outlook is for slow growth in all regions in 
1990; some respondents expect improvement late in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail results for the Christmas season were mixed. Most Districts 
in the eastern third of the nation - Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
Richmond, and Atlanta - found sales up about 5 percent. New York 
respondents reported stronger sales and Boston somewhat weaker 
sales. Retailers in Districts farther west -Chicago, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco - had a better 
holiday season. Consumer durables, such as furniture and housewares, 
moved less briskly than apparel and other nondurables. Inventories 
of certain items were high in Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago, as 
Christmas sales ran below expectations and promotions failed to 
bring stocks into line. Auto sales were reported to be weak 
nationwide, although Chicago cited national data indicating that 
sales picked up at the turn of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts reported widespread discounting. In some Districts, 
especially steep discounting by department stores adversely affected 
sales at discount and specialty stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers expect flat sales or modest increases through the first 
six months of 1990. Results in the first weeks of January were said 
to be encouraging.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity was reported to be slow in most of the 
Districts. In Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, 
however, some industries were said to be showing signs of "bottoming 
out" and were posting slight gains in orders from year-ago levels. 
Food, apparel, lumber, commercial aircraft, and farm, oilfield, and 
some electric equipment all made gains. Defense, construction, and 
automotive products continued to face weak demand; however, 
respondents from Chicago and Cleveland suggested that current 
cutbacks in auto production may prove adequate to eliminate the 
industry's inventory overhang. Orders for first-quarter delivery 
also suggest a gradual improvement for steel. Although a Minneapolis 
computer firm recently made a large layoff, Dallas and San Francisco 
reported signs of a pickup in that industry as well. Manufacturers 
in the Chicago, Dallas, and Boston Districts found that significant 
foreign sales are helping to offset weak domestic demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing employment was reportedly flat to down compared with 
earlier in 1989, with firms in the New York, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts facing major layoffs in 
autos, aerospace, or computers. Except for fuel, input prices were 
said to be steady or falling. Scattered evidence suggests that 
selling prices were also steady or falling, with discounting 
occurring in some industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite weakness in autos and parts of aerospace, New York and San 
Francisco reported major investment projects by firms in those 
industries. Boston, Cleveland, and Atlanta also indicated that 
several respondents plan capital spending above 1989 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturers expected slow growth in 1990, with a weak first 
half followed by gradual improvement. Despite widespread public 
concern about possible defense cutbacks, defense contractors in the 
Boston and St. Louis Districts expected declines in defense spending 
to be gradual, with limited local impact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      December's severe cold weather adversely affected some agricultural 
sectors and led to large increases in fruit and vegetable prices. 
Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City also noted 
possible or confirmed damage to winter wheat crops due to cold, dry 
weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from other agricultural and resource-based sectors were more 
positive. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all 
mentioned high cattle prices and strength in the beef or dairy 
industries. Atlanta and St. Louis referred to sharp energy price 
increases, believed to be temporary and weather-related, while 
Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco described greater oil and 
gas exploration or drilling activity. Mining and lumber industries 
were reported to be doing well in the Minneapolis and San Francisco 
Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional financial conditions varied by District and by type of 
loan. Bankers in Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, the Pacific 
Northwest and central California reported increased demand for 
business or consumer loans. By contrast, New York District banks saw 
a decline in demand for most types of credit. While Philadelphia 
lenders experienced an increase from year-earlier levels in total 
loans outstanding, they noted a recent decline in loan demand. 
Mortgage lending is down, according to New York, Atlanta and St. 
Louis institutions, while San Francisco mentioned that some Arizona 
and Alaska banks face real-estate related problems. Several 
Districts noted that banks have initiated credit reviews and were 
tightening criteria for making loansâ€”especially for real estate 
purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts discussing real estate reported steady or modestly 
improved conditions. Atlanta, Kansas City, and Philadelphia noted 
some signs of weakness, however. Expected declines in mortgage 
interest rates provided some reason for optimism in the real estate 
outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Homebuilding activity was mixed. Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and 
San Francisco showed strength in at least some parts of their 
Districts, but New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City experienced slow 
or declining activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reductions in home prices in Boston and the New York metropolitan 
area have boosted sales activity but have not eliminated the 
oversupply of homes available for resale in either region. Real 
estate prices were also said to be declining in St. Louis; by 
contrast, they were reported steady in Kansas City and up sharply in 
the state of Washington. Sales of expensive homes were said to be 
holding up well in parts of Miami, while lower-priced homes were the 
top performers in California and Boston.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential property markets were generally slow. Office 
vacancies rose in Manhattan and Florida, and Atlanta reported slower 
pre-leasing of new projects in its downtown. Dallas, in contrast, 
found increases in office building occupancy.
