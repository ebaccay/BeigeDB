      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the West are little changed. Most reports 
indicate that western businesses continue to do relatively well, 
although most respondents still expect slow national growth. War and 
price increases in the West continue to cluster in the 3 to 5 
percent range, although larger price increases as well as price 
declines also have been reported. Sales of nondurable goods are 
reported to be continuing at a solid pace. Most reports on service 
industries are relatively upbeat. Conditions in manufacturing 
industries seem to be good overall. Current conditions are 
satisfactory in most resource industries, but signals suggest that 
activity may slow in the near future. Conditions in western 
construction and real estate markets remain fundamentally unchanged, 
with healthy activity reported in most parts of the West. Most 
bankers in the West report "good" or "stable" conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Western business leaders continue to anticipate relatively slow 
economic growth during the next twelve months, although the 
proportion of respondents anticipating healthy growth has increased 
during the last month. No respondents anticipate that economic 
growth will exceed the 2 1/2 to 3 percent range and only about 15 
percent expect improvements in business investment, housing starts, 
or consumer spending. 44 percent of the respondents do anticipate 
some improvement in the trade balance, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage and price increases in the West continue to have a "central 
tendency" in the 3 to 5 percent range. Changes in construction costs 
have a particularly wide range, with bids in the booming Sun Valley 
market up 12 percent in the past few months, and prospects of slower 
building activity in the Los Angeles area reducing bids there by as 
much as 15 percent in the last eight months. Wage pressures seem 
relatively intense in Hawaii, where a recently negotiated hotel 
workers' contract calls for average increases of 10 percent per year 
over the next five years, and bus driven recently settled on a new 
contract with wages up 7 percent. Grain prices have fallen 
substantially, while health care cost increases continue to flirt 
with the double-digit range. Timber and paper prices appear to have 
stabilized.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of nondurable goods are reported to be continuing at a solid 
pace. One retail chain reports that, while sales continue strong at 
most of its western stores, it has noted some softening in the Los 
Angeles market for the first time. The wholesale apparel market is 
still in the process of recovering from the disarray associated with 
the financial problems of a few large retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most reports on service industries are relatively upbeat. However, a 
publisher reports that help-wanted advertising has fallen 
significantly during recent weeks, with a recent dropoff noted in 
advertising for health care positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in manufacturing industries seem to be good overall. 
Activity remains robust in commercial aerospace, with companies 
trying to increase production further so that they can make more 
progress on their sizeable order backlogs. However, obtaining timely 
delivery of materials, parts, and sub-assemblies is constraining 
production increases for some companies. In addition, there is some 
evidence of increased export activity by manufacturers of 
specialized products such as precision machine tools, scientific 
instruments and safety airbags for automobiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Current conditions are satisfactory in most resource industries, but 
signals suggest that activity may slow in the near future. Farmers 
in many parts of the West face water shortages after the fourth 
straight year of substandard moisture. In California, where farmers 
have been relatively unaffected by water shortages in recent years, 
farm water allotments for this summer are being reduced by as much 
as 50 percent. Higher water costs and changes in plantings are 
likely results. Growing conditions are better in most of Washington 
and Oregon, where water currently is more plentiful. Deliveries of 
logs currently are strong, but forest products companies face
cutbacks in logging allowances due to environmental concerns. The 
effects of these cutbacks are likely to he most severe in Oregon, 
where Forest Service land historically has supplied a majority of 
logs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in western construction and real estate markets remain 
fundamentally unchanged. Activity in California is returning to more 
"normal" levels in the previous hot coastal markets, but prices and 
sales activity remain robust in the more affordable parts of the 
state, such as Sacramento, Riverside, and San Bernardino. In Oregon, 
residential construction activity continues to strengthen. Seattle 
housing market activity continues to he relatively frenetic, 
although anecdotal evidence suggests that selling times may have 
lengthened slightly in recent weeks. Observers in Utah and Idaho 
report some improvement in activity in those states. Construction 
activity remains strong in Hawaii, while problems persist in 
Arizona.
     </p>
     <p>
      A southern California developer reports that major properties seem 
to be selling at a slower pace, probably due to extra caution on the 
part of buyers. At this point, the dropoff in buyer interest has 
been most noticeable for buildings whose quality does not warrant a 
Class A rating.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most bankers in the West report "good" or 'stable" conditions. Loan 
demand is strong or growing in most parts of the District. Mortgage 
demand continues strong in Washington, and more than doubled for 
some Utah banks during the past year.
     </p>
     <p>
      There currently is little evidence of a "credit crunch" in the 
Twelfth District. Most contacts indicate that they have neither 
experienced recent changes in credit conditions, nor are aware of 
others that have experienced significant changes. However, more 
stringent regulatory limits on the amount that one borrower can 
receive from a single lender are reported to he restraining lending 
activity in some cases. Moreover, about a fifth of the contacts 
report that lenders they regularly deal with have increased 
collateral requirements on new loans, increased required down 
payments, shortened loan terms, or otherwise tightened lending 
policies.
