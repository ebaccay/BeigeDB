      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 7, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to business contacts, the Southeast economy grew at a 
healthy pace through the end of November, although recent year-over-
year gains have been smaller than they were earlier in the year. The 
holiday shopping season got off to a good start over the 
Thanksgiving weekend, with most retailers reporting that sales had 
met or exceeded their optimistic expectations. Tourism and business 
travel remain above year-ago levels in most of the District, and 
recent reports indicate that many Florida tourist markets have begun 
to see a rebound. Factory activity in the District was reported to 
be mixed, with strength in some industries offsetting weakness in 
others. Single-family home sales and construction slowed on a year-
over-yen basis in November, but multifamily and commercial 
construction continued to show improvement. Reports of increasing 
wage pressures have become more frequent in the last month, and 
firms in a growing number of industries say that they are having 
difficulty finding qualified workers. Although many contacts 
continue to report rising raw materials prices, most producers 
continue to indicate that they have not raised prices of their own 
products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A majority of the District retailers contacted after the 
Thanksgiving holiday weekend said that sales generally had met or 
exceeded their expectations. The strongest selling items were 
reported to be gift items and home-related products, although 
apparel sales also were relatively brisk. Retailers generally said 
they expect holiday sales to exceed last year's levels by between 5 
and 7 percent. However, several retailers predicted that December 
sales will be dominated by promotions and discounts similar to those 
offered during the last several years. Although most retailers said 
that unexpectedly pleasant weather put a damper on sales in early 
November, the return of cooler weather in the second half of the 
month brought shoppers back into the stores. Auto sales around the 
District were said to be flat with some dealers noting year-over-
year declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from manufacturers were somewhat mixed in November, with 
weakness in a few industries offset by strength in the majority of 
others. At the same time, most firms indicated that they were 
optimistic about their prospects for the next six months. Firms in 
the paper, wood, chemicals, and aluminum industries all continued to 
report increasing levels of current activity. Auto makers and auto 
parts suppliers again commented on strong demand for their products. 
Although many District manufacturers of lumber and other building 
materials said that they were operating as near capacity, several 
firms indicated that current shipments have begun to slow. Firms 
producing home appliances, heating and cooling equipment, and 
carpeting also noted a slowdown in current shipments, although 
several carpet producers reported that exports had begun to pick up. 
Reports from the apparel industry, however, were much less positive, 
with most firms reporting declines in output as well as the factory 
workweek and payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist and business travel remain a bright spot in the District 
economy. Hotel occupancy rates were reported to be well above year-
ago levels in Atlanta, Nashville, and New Orleans, while tourism 
along the Gulf coast continues to flourish. Although tourist travel 
to many Florida destinations remains below year-ago levels, winter 
bookings were reported to be up, particularly from Latin American 
and Canadian visitors. Several major resort areas in Florida 
recently have announced expansion plans aimed at reversing the 
attendance slump of the last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family home sales and construction slowed throughout the 
District in November; however, real estate agents emphasized that 
the level of activity in most market areas remains near the strong 
year-ago performance. Builders reported that new home inventories 
have begun to increase slightly, and home prices generally have 
stabilized. Some realtors have begun to report price concessions on 
the part of sellers. Looking forward, realtors and builders 
generally expect the pace of home sales and construction to decline 
in 1995, although overall activity is expected to remain relatively 
high.
     </p>
     <p>
      In multifamily and commercial real estate marks by contrast, real 
estate agents continue to report improving conditions. Apartment 
occupancy levels were described as extremely high in many District 
market areas. Apartment rental rates have continued to rise, and in 
recent weeks plans for several new multifamily developments were 
announced. Commercial realtors also reported falling vacancy rates 
and improved leasing of industrial, office, and retail space. 
Commercial construction has accelerated in many areas of the 
District. However, shortages of qualified labor continue to push 
building costs up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on loan demand from bankers in the District were mixed in 
November. While some contacts noted that the demand for home 
mortgage lending had declined substantially, others reported 
increased commercial and industrial lending. Consumer loan demand 
was generally described as flat, while auto lending declined 
modestly. Several banks noted that the competition for loans remains 
fierce. Both commercial and consumer loan default rates remain near 
lows for the past decade.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage pressures were again described as on the rise amid tightening 
labor markets. In addition to the construction sector, food service 
and retail establishments have begun to report difficulty in filling 
available positions. This has been particularly true of retailers 
who have sought to hire temporary employees for the holiday shopping 
season. As a result, an increasing number of firms report that they 
have had to offer wage increases in order both to attract new 
workers, as well as to retain current employees. According to 
manufacturers, raw materials prices also continue to rise. However, 
many firms reported that they have not been able to increase their 
prices because of intense competition. Although most retailers 
concurred that competitive pressures have kept a lid on price 
increases to this point, many indicated that they expect their 
suppliers to increase prices on many items after the first of the 
year.
