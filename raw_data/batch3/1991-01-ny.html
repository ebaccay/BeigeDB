     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy since the last report 
remain soft to mixed. Retail contacts reported disappointing sales 
results on balance despite some improvement just before and after 
Christmas. The underlying demand for new homes remains weak, and 
office vacancy rates in Manhattan rose somewhat further from already 
high levels. More positively, both the Buffalo and Rochester surveys 
of purchasing managers reported an increase in firms with improved 
business conditions in November, though more recent news from 
upstate New York suggests some slackening. Nearly all small and 
medium-size banks surveyed reduced their prime rate recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail contacts reported disappointing sales results in 
both November and December though several experienced a decided 
improvement during the last two weeks of the year. The sales 
environment was very competitive and marked by a high level of 
price-cutting throughout the period even though most stores entered 
the holiday season with inventories substantially reduced from year-
earlier levels. Retailers cited concerns about impending layoffs and 
the Middle East crisis as well as unseasonably warm weather for the 
recent consumer apathy. Over-the-year sales changes at department 
stores ranged from -3.5 percent to -13 percent in November and from 
flat to -14 percent in December. A survey conducted by the Retail 
Council of New York State covering some 200 stores across the state 
found sales during the pre-Christmas period to be basically 
unchanged from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Items which sold well included some women's and children's apparel, 
men's shirts and costume jewelry as well as certain toys. Furniture 
and rugs remained weak, however, and sales of cold weather items 
such as outerwear and comforters were also slow. Due in large part 
to a pickup in sales during the last two weeks of December, 
inventories are generally at or slightly below targeted levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity is seasonally slow throughout the District. 
Moreover, the underlying demand for new homes remains weak. A glut 
of homes for both resale and initial purchase continues to plague 
most of the Nest York metropolitan area and has spread to upstate 
areas as well. Sales in some New York City cooperative and 
condominium apartment buildings have slowed to such a point that one 
realty firm recently announced plans to hold an auction for 
individual apartment owners. Some developers and lenders in the 
District have already been holding auctions in order to pare their 
housing inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office vacancy rates in both midtown and downtown Manhattan moved 
higher in recent weeks. In midtown, where an additional 2 million 
square feet of space is scheduled for completion in 1991, the higher 
rate resulted from slow leasing activity over the past few months. 
Although leasing activity has been more brisk in downtown Manhattan, 
blocks of excess space continue to he added to the market in the 
wake of consolidations and cutbacks in the financial services 
sector. Elsewhere in the District, the recent annual survey of 
Buffalo's downtown office space found the vacancy rate there had 
jumped to the highest level in more than five years, in part due to 
restructuring in the financial services sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Both the Buffalo and Rochester surveys of purchasing managers 
reported an increase in the percentage of firms with improved 
business conditions in November. However, more recent news reports 
from upstate suggest that some slackening in economic activity is 
now occurring. Several of these communities are hopeful that 
Canada's mid-December imposition of a 7 percent sales tax will bring 
an increase in Canadian shoppers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The unemployment rate rose in New Jersey during the last quarter of 
1990 but showed little change in New York State. In December, New 
Jersey' s rate stood at 5.9 percent, up from 5.2 percent in 
September while New York's December rate of 5. 5 percent was 
unchanged from September. Although New York's unemployment rate has 
remained stable, some observers are concerned because the number of 
employed persons has declined. Both New York City and State 
anticipate substantial layoffs more because of their budget gaps, 
and several corporations have announced impending cutbacks as 
further restructurings occur. One possible bright spot: the Navy is 
reportedly considering modifying an old Grumman jet fighter built on 
Long Island now that the Pentagon has canceled further work on the 
A-12 attack plane.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all small and medium-size banks surveyed in the Second 
District recently reduced their prime rate. When asked what factors 
determined their bank's decision, most senior loan officers 
indicated that their banks tend to follow a particular bank or large 
money center banks while taking into account their credit risks, 
competitive environment, and profitability. Bankers generally 
reported that from twenty to thirty-five percent of loans 
outstanding are directly tied to the prime. The vast majority of 
their loans are above prime, usually by one or two percentage 
points. Most bankers stated that the reduction in the prime had not 
affected other lending rates but some banks did lower rates on other 
business and commercial real estate loans. A few banks also reported 
a slight easing of rates on some categories of consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the bankers surveyed indicated reduced willingness to make 
business and real estate-related loans. Respondents were evenly 
divided on the desirability of making consumer loans between 
"willing", "less willing", and "not willing". Most banks reported 
some strength in demand for either consumer or commercial real 
estate loans, but two noted weak demand in all sectors. Half 
expected loan demand to increase over the next three months, and 
half expected loan demand to weaken or stay uncharged. Factors 
contributing to reluctance to lend over the next few months included 
a national recession and a worsening of local unemployment and 
business failures.
