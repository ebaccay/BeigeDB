      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The worst of the contraction in real GNP and industrial production 
occurred last quarter, according to a panel of 23 Fourth District 
economists. Labor markets in Ohio have held up better than for the 
nation in recent months, but the unemployment rate is expected to 
rise more rapidly in the next few months. Manufacturing in the 
Fourth District has also fared better than in the nation, but 
conditions in the automotive, capital goods, and steel industries 
have deteriorated in recent weeks. Most retailers report that sales 
in late December and early January picked up from the weak 
performances in October and November. Lower interest rates have not 
had a visible effect on loan demand, which remains weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The National Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All but two of a group of 23 economists with the Fourth District 
Roundtable believe that the worst of the contraction in real GNP and 
industrial production occurred last quarter. They estimate that real 
GNP declined at about a 2.7% annual rate in 1990:IVQ, and will 
decline at rates of 1.7% and 0.2% in the first and second quarters 
of this year. Growth in real GNP is expected to rebound at a 2.7% 
annual rate in the second half of 1992 and a 3% rate in the first 
half of 1991. The forecasts assume no outbreak of war in the Middle 
East.
     </p>
     <p>
      The panel also believes that the worst of the latest inflation bulge 
was in 1990:IVQ, when overall prices rose at an estimated 4.9% rate. 
Prices are expected to increase by about a 3.3% annual rate between 
1991:IIIQ and 1992: IIQ.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Regional Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the District have remained better than in 
the nation. Nonfarm employment in Ohio inched up in December, and 
was slightly higher than a year earlier. The unemployment rate rose 
0.3% in December but averaged 5.7% in the latest three months. Some 
labor market officials believe, however, that the unemployment rate 
will rise more rapidly toward the national average in the next few 
months, especially because of further layoffs in the automotive and 
steel industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Output and employment have been stronger in the District than in the 
nation, but deterioration occurred in key industries during 
December, resulting in sizable layoffs in mid- and late January 
especially in the automotive industry. Auto production this quarter, 
however, is expected to increase by about 5% to 10% from the weak 
fourth quarter, according to several auto analysts. A similar 
increase in production is expected for next quarter, assuming 
revival in consumer confidence if the instability in the Persian 
Gulf is resolved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some capital-goods producers have marked down their forecasts of 
output for this year because of a weaker-than-expected economy. 
Nevertheless, a common view is that capital spending will hold up 
better than it did in past periods of business weakness. A machine 
tool builder reports that orders have been declining in each of the 
last three months, but the declines have been far less than in 
previous episodes of business slowdown.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heavy-duty truck business sagged unexpectedly in November and 
apparently in December, following a brief revival through mid-autumn 
when orders were pulled forward into 1990 because of new 
environmental regulations effective in 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers report a sharp deterioration in orders and 
operations in recent weeks. The drastic cutback in auto output last 
month and higher-than-expected volume in steel imports last quarter 
cut the operating rate in the domestic steel industry to about 70% 
of capacity late last month from an 84% rate in November. Operations 
are expected to average in the low 70s this quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      A defense contractor noted substantial pickup in the last few months 
for special military goods destined for the Middle East. They 
anticipate, however, no reversal in the decline of defense spending, 
and have not experienced a revival in defense orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers report that sales in late December and early January 
improved from a weak October and November, but sales were widely 
mixed among retailers. Consequently, inventories for some retailers 
are in better balance now than before the Christmas season, while a 
little higher than desired for others. Retailers see little prospect 
that sales will improve much, at least until the Gulf situation is 
resolved. Improved real income, especially because of lower gasoline 
prices, is a positive sign for near-term sales, but most retailers 
expect consumer spending will be lackluster through midyear.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car dealers in the District report that sales have weakened 
sharply for this time of year, but that inventories of new cars are 
lower than a year ago. Dealers have no trouble obtaining financing 
for inventory, but report that consumers are finding financing more 
difficult than a few months ago. Dealers of domestic nameplates are 
not ordering for additional inventories, but Honda and Toyota 
dealers apparently are adding to inventories in anticipation of 
higher sales in the spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Latest interest rate declines have had no visible effect on demand 
for credit by consumers or businesses. Lenders assert that rising 
concerns over employment and uncertainty about the Persian Gulf 
situation are constraints on consumer demand. Rates on conventional 
30-year fixed-rate mortgages in the Cleveland area average about 
9.5%, with some lenders offering mortgages as low as 9.0%, but 
without much consumer response.
     </p>
     <p>
      Builders of new homes claim that construction is off more than usual 
for this time of year, and a major developer cancelled plans for a 
shopping mall because of the uncertain economy and increased 
difficulties in funding from his usual sources of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      A reasonably well-capitalized bank with a large portfolio of real 
estate loans is shifting away from commercial loans toward consumer 
loans. Some other well-capitalized banks still report that they have 
an ample supply of credit available to qualified borrowers, but loan 
demand remains weak.
