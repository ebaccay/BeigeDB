      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District firms continue to report expansions and new hirings. At the 
same time, plant closures and layoffs have dulled the momentum 
witnessed earlier this year. Residential construction activity is 
mixed, but new and existing home sales are still strong in most 
areas of the District. Business, real estate and consumer loans 
outstanding at large District banks have increased moderately in 
recent months. Record crops in many areas have buoyed District 
farmers after last year's poor harvest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District firms continue to report modest growth, although some firms 
are laying off workers and shutting down plants. Sales, for the most 
part, continue strong in many industries. Many contacts, 
particularly in the Memphis, northern Mississippi and eastern 
Arkansas areas, are reporting a shortage of qualified workers for 
both permanent and seasonal work.
     </p>
     <p>
      One contact in the paper industry reports that the third quarter was 
the best since 1989, with capacity at about 96 percent. A contact in 
the heating and cooling industry reports a record year, with sales 
greatly surpassing last year's levels. This contact also noted that 
a slowdown in orders for the fourth quarter was larger than the 
normal seasonal decline. A farm equipment dealer states that new 
equipment sales have picked up very well over the past two months, 
while used equipment sales have dropped off somewhat. The poultry 
processing industry is entering Kentucky en masse; another firm 
announced plans to open a new plant, bringing the total to four 
within the past year. Makers of wood furniture in northeast 
Mississippi report that plants are operating at or above capacity, 
overtime is the norm, and plans for expansion are commonplace. An 
apparel manufacturer reports optimism about sales for the rest of 
the year given the current level of orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some manufacturing firms in the southern part of the District report 
year-to-date sales increases of between 5 percent and 26 percent 
over last year. Firms throughout the District also report increases 
in employment levels. For example, a dry cleaning company will bring 
300 new jobs into southern Indiana when it moves into refurbished 
Army facilities. An engine manufacturer will bring 600 jobs to 
central Missouri when its new plant opens next year. A maker of 
plumbing fixtures is building a new plant in western Tennessee and 
will hire at least 200 workers initially. Because of a new contract 
with a fast food chain, a poultry processor is adding 200 employees 
at its Missouri plant and will hire almost 500 in Kentucky. A maker 
of mobile homes that closed a plant in 1991 has reopened it because 
of high demand; the company has a 600- to 700-home backlog.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the news is not positive, however, as layoffs and plant closings 
have also occurred. For example, a maker of tissues and other paper 
products closed its Memphis plant, eliminating 640 jobs. A maker of 
plastic products closed its Missouri plant, eliminating 200 
positions. An Arkansas shoe company has placed all production 
employees on a four-day workweek in an attempt to avoid layoffs. A 
hydraulic pump manufacturer will lay off 175 workers when at closes 
early next year because of excess capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some softening of single-family residential construction, largely 
attributed to rising interest rates, is being reported in several 
areas of the District. Although single-family building permits are 
still up on a year-to-date basis, they were at or below their year-
ago levels in July and August in both Louisville and Memphis. In St. 
Louis, permits were still above their year-ago levels in August and 
September, but the pace of activity is markedly slower than it was 
earlier in the year. Some pockets of strength still exist, however, 
as residential construction in northeast Mississippi, and in central 
and northwestern Arkansas continues at a strong pace. Even in areas 
of slowing construction, however, realtors still report fairly brisk 
sales of existing homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans and leases at 11 large District banks rose 1.7 percent 
during the past two months, after declining 1.9 percent in the prior 
two months. Each category of loans showed growth during this most 
recent two-month period: Commercial and industrial (C&amp;I;) loans rose 
1.7 percent, real estate loans were up 1.1 percent and consumer 
loans increased 3.2 percent. In the prior two-month period, C&amp;I; 
loans were down 0.9 percent, real estate loans had declined 3.6 
percent and consumer loans were up a modest 1.3 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The fall harvest is reported as better-than-expected in many areas. 
Arkansas farmers, for example, expect to harvest a record rice crop, 
with milling quality generally reported as good to excellent. 
Similarly, Delta cotton farmers report that warm, dry weather in 
September has produced good yields, although recent rains may have 
diminished the quality of the crop somewhat. Corn and soybean yields 
are reported as above average in most areas, with some farmers 
reporting record yields. Even some fields in Missouri that were 
damaged in last year's floods have reportedly yielded unexpectedly 
good crops. Bumper crop prospects, however, have caused most grain 
prices to fall well below last year's levels. Despite low river 
levels in the southern parts of the District, primarily on the 
Mississippi, barge traffic has not been impaired. In fact, barge 
operators are expecting business to pick up because of the record 
fall harvests and the prospects of increased grain exports.
