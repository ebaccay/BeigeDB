      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 19, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District economic conditions have been moderately good lately. 
While labor market and manufacturing conditions have been mixed and 
construction activity has been weak, tourist spending has been 
strong, and new-car sales and retail sales in general have been 
fairly good. Resource-related industries have been doing well. In 
general, wage and price increases have been moderate. The Gulf 
crisis has not yet affected the district's economy much.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions have been mixed in the district. After 
showing signs of improvement during the second quarter of the year, 
Minnesota's unemployment rates have begun to drift up. The state's 
overall unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in July, up from 4.2 
percent in June and 4.1 percent in July 1989. In the district's 
other states, unemployment rates in June and July were roughly at 
the same level as last year. At the same time, firms throughout the 
district continue to report difficulties in filling entry-level and 
part-time positions, even at wages well above the minimum wage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage and price increases in the district have remained moderate. 
Wages have generally increased only at annual rates of 3 to 5 
percent. The Gulf crisis has not resulted in a sharp acceleration in 
the district's inflation rate—though, as is to be expected, 
gasoline prices have risen sharply. Some prices charged by freight 
companies have also increased. Prices of agricultural products have 
recently been declining, though they are still well above the levels 
of a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers of general merchandise report good sales growth 
lately. One major retailer reports that, compared to a year earlier, 
sales in August were up 8 percent and sales in the first eight 
months of the year were up 6.1 percent. An appliance retailer 
reports that sales in August were 3 percent higher this year than 
last. In North Dakota and Montana, retailers report that shoppers 
from Canada have contributed to strong sales. In North Dakota, sales 
tax collections have risen sharply from a year ago. Throughout the 
district, inventories are reported to be at acceptable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism remains the brightest spot in the district's economy. 
Motorcycle enthusiasts recently held their 50th annual gathering in 
the Black Hills of South Dakota. This rally reportedly brought an 
estimated $30 million into the local economy. Also, resort owners in 
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin's Arrowhead region, and 
northern Minnesota report fairly high levels of reservations for the 
fall colors viewing season. However, district resort owners 
generally are apprehensive that the recent rise in gasoline prices 
may crimp tourist activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      New-car sales have been fairly good recently. One major dealer 
reports that sales at the end of August were strong. Dealers are 
cautiously optimistic about prospects for the second half of the 
year. Inventories of cars and trucks are reportedly at comfortable 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The district's housing activity has improved recently, after having 
shown signs of softening earlier in the year. The number of new 
housing permits issued in Minnesota, for example, was 6 percent 
higher this July than last. The number of houses sold in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area during the first eight months of the year 
was 6.6 percent higher than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the district's construction industry in general have 
been weak recently, particularly in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
metropolitan area. In that area, the dollar value of contracts for 
future construction in June was 27 percent below the value a year 
ago. This area's weakness is expected to continue for at least a 
couple of years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the district's manufacturing industries have been 
mixed lately. Domestic orders for producer equipment have been lower 
than last year, but strong foreign demand has more than made up for 
that. The medical technology industry has grown strongly, but the 
electronics industry has continued to struggle. Manufacturing firms, 
in general, express serious concern about the increased probability 
of a recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's resource-related industries appear to be fairly 
healthy. Excellent rainfall throughout the district has improved the 
outlook for farmers. The spring wheat harvest in Minnesota is 
expected to be the best in three years. In that state, the corn 
harvest is expected to be 5 percent higher than last year, but the 
soybean harvest is expected to be 10 percent lower, due primarily to 
fewer acres being planted. Farmers in North Dakota have had the best 
wheat crop on record. The mining industry is also doing well. 
However, the lumber and paper products industry, which has been 
growing strongly for the last two years, reports recent setbacks. 
Prices of products used in home construction have declined sharply. 
And according to several firms, finished paper inventories have been 
rising.
