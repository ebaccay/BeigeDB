      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent developments suggest a relatively stable near-term outlook 
for business activity in the District—no new vigor and no 
significant setbacks. Growth of total employment in the District 
continues to trail the U.S. Auto and light truck output are expected 
to remain strong into 1986. Steel production and orders continue at 
disappointing levels, with strength mainly in motor vehicles, 
appliances, and construction, and at service centers. Demand for 
most types of capital goods remains weak—not getting worse, but not 
improving either. Residential, commercial, and highway construction 
are strong, but generally far short of past peaks. Sales of suburban 
industrial buildings have picked up. Inventories are judged to be 
fairly lean. General merchandise sales recently have been sluggish. 
Modest recoveries in grain and livestock prices in recent weeks have 
been encouraging, but far from sufficient to alter the distressed 
conditions facing the District agricultural sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       St. Lawrence Seaway
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Round-the-clock repair work on the 53-year old Welland Canal allowed 
vessels to resume passage of this section of the St. Lawrence Seaway 
on November 7. A line of waiting vessels had grown since October 14 
when a 150-foot concrete section of a lock wall collapsed. The 24-day cutoff caused consternation among ship operators, shippers, 
sailors, and terminal employees directly affected, but no 
significant wider impact on output and employment in the District. 
Attractiveness of the Seaway for shippers is limited by the winter 
closing, bottlenecks at locks in peak periods, availability of 
improved and often cheaper and faster alternative means of 
transport, limits on size of vessels which increase costs, and 
vulnerability to delays caused by accidents or breakdowns. The 
Seaway has never played the major role envisaged for it when it 
opened in 1959.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales fell sharply as expected in October, after being boosted 
to record levels in September by auto makers' buyer incentive 
programs. Inventories, very low at the end of September, have been 
increased to more normal levels. Domestic auto makers plan high 
production levels into next year. Truck sales continue to set 
records, but the strength is in light-duty models, especially 
imports. Sales of heavy-duty trucks have declined, and growth of 
demand for medium trucks has slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total demand for steel continues slow. Buying by heavy capital goods 
producers remains soft. Strength is concentrated in motor vehicles, 
appliances, and construction. Shipments to steel service centers 
also continue strong, as steel users try to hold lower inventories. 
Major steel producers, whose steel operations have been at 
unprofitable levels, are attempting to push through price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for most types of mechanical business equipment are still 
slow. Oil development gear and food processing equipment are off 
substantially from last year. Farm equipment remains severely 
depressed. An airline recently announced a 'record' order for 
aircraft, but the only firm order was for 20 aircraft to be 
delivered starting in the fall of 1986. As a result of the decline 
in the foreign exchange value of the dollar since February, some 
District equipment manufacturers are receiving inquiries from abroad 
again after a long lapse. Although there is only limited evidence 
yet of increased orders for mechanical capital goods as a result of 
the lower dollar, one District company reported that some orders are 
being placed with domestic suppliers for types of machinery which 
had previously been ordered abroad, in response to the shift in 
relative prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Over the past year, and since the end of recession in 1982, 
nonresidential building has risen more vigorously in the District 
than in the nation, despite weakness in Iowa, but remains far below 
the good levels of the 1970s. The rise in Michigan has been 
strongest. Commercial construction, mainly stores and office 
buildings, has accounted for much of the increase in activity, 
Office vacancies are large and growing as new buildings are 
completed. However, new starts on major office buildings in downtown 
Chicago are expected. Commercial mortgage rates have eased about 1/4 
percentage point since September, to 11 percent on 10-year loans and 
11-1/2 percent on 15-year loans. The resale market for smaller
industrial and warehouse properties in suburban areas of Chicago has 
strengthened significantly in recent months. Overbuilding in 
industrial parks is being absorbed rapidly. But construction of 
large manufacturing buildings is at a low level, except for motor 
vehicle assembly plants and parts plants of domestic and Japanese 
companies. Highway construction, mostly repaving, continues strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Building
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction of housing has continued to recover in the District, 
but is still only about half of the pace of 1978. Recovery has been 
uneven, with Michigan up most strongly, and Iowa weakest. Used home 
sales, which did not fall off as sharply as new homes in the 
recession, are highest ever (number of units as well as dollars) at 
some large realtors. Residential mortgage rates have eased slightly. 
Lenders and mortgage insurers are applying tighter standards, but 
credit is readily available for qualified buyers. Last year's market 
was dominated by first-time buyers. This year more sales have 
reflected people "trading up". In the Chicago area, there has been a 
strong rise in apartment construction, but from a low base and not 
enough to approach past peaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major District retailers report continued sluggish sales of general 
merchandise. Inventories are mostly within a normal range. Appliance 
sales have been good. Airline traffic has flattened, and excess 
capacity has led to severe and widespread price cutting. Increases 
in prices paid by consumers generally remain low, but rates for auto 
and home owners' insurance are rising at least 5-6 percent this year 
in most areas, and much more in some localities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lower meat production and an unusually heavy movement of grain under 
price support loan with the Commodity Credit Corporation account for 
most of the recent upturn in farm commodity prices. Corn and soybean 
production estimates for District states were revised upward again 
in November. Corn production is projected up 16 percent from last 
year and soybean production up 24 percent However, wet weather 
continues to delay completion of the fall harvest Hardest hit areas 
include Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Some yield losses will likely 
result, inflicting more adversity on the financially-stressed 
farmers affected by the delays. But any weather-related yield losses 
will not materially alter the fundamental situation of excess grain 
supplies.
