      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 18, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions remain weak in much of the Twelfth District, 
with areas that have felt the impact of the recession reporting few 
signs of recovery. In intermountain areas where the recession has 
had only modest effects, economic conditions continue to be much 
better than in the District as a whole. Wage and price increases 
throughout the District are modest, and consumer spending continues 
to be sluggish. Slow retail sales have hurt sales tax revenues in 
many jurisdictions, further squeezing already-tight state and local 
government budgets. Manufacturing activity remains mixed, with the 
aluminum industry reporting worsening conditions. Some District 
farmers report disappointing fruit harvests, due either to poorer 
than expected quality or disappointing volumes. Construction and 
real estate activity remain slow, especially in California. Loan 
demand continues to be sluggish in California, while Utah financial 
institutions report relatively good conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expectations of Twelfth District business leaders improved 
slightly in September. While a majority of respondents still foresee 
GNP growth of less than 2.5 percent during the next four quarters, 
only 5 percent now expect the next four quarters to be characterized 
by recession. More than half of respondents project improvement 
during the next four quarters in business investment, housing 
starts, and consumer spending. Expectations about inflation also 
seem to be improving, with 61 percent of respondents now projecting 
some reduction in inflation during the next four quarters compared 
with 50 percent six weeks ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall wages and prices are increasing modestly in the Twelfth 
District. Retail prices are reported to be relatively stable, while 
prices have fallen during the past year for many food products. 
Prices also are reported down significantly for some office 
electronic products. Increases in health care costs still outpace 
the general inflation rate by a wide margin. Wage increases continue 
to cluster in the 3.5 to 5 percent range throughout the District. In 
California, however, tight state government fiscal conditions have 
forced many middle and upper level state employees to take 5 percent 
salary cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending remains weak in most parts of the Twelfth 
District. A soft goods retailer reports that sales still are very 
sluggish in California, Oregon, and Alaska. For his chain, sales are 
slightly stronger in Washington and very good in Utah. In 
California, higher sales tax rates are blamed for some of the 
slowdown in retail sales. Auto sales remain weak in much of the 
District, although some improvement was noted in Arizona and among 
higher-end cars in Idaho. Year-over-year declines in newspaper 
advertising volume have moderated somewhat in recent months, but 
July volume was still l8 percent below its year-earlier level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the West is mixed. Metals industries 
continue to report weak conditions. Layoffs are mounting in the 
aluminum industry, with one firm in the Pacific Northwest reportedly 
cutting employment by more than 50 percent. Aluminum and zinc prices 
are down, while copper prices have stabilized recently. Employment 
in the aerospace industry continues to suffer from defense cuts. 
Helicopter manufacturing employment in the US. is expected to fall 2 
percent in 1991, despite improving exports. Boeing continues to 
receive orders for commercial aircraft although the pace of new 
orders has slowed in recent months. In Utah, some non-durable 
manufacturing industries report growth in orders of 8 to 10 percent 
from last year. A chemical products manufacturer reports that orders 
have picked up in recent months, but remain 7 percent below a year 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions in the Twelfth District have weakened 
somewhat. Fruit growers in California report that harvests were 
large, but some growers had trouble meeting size and quality 
standards. Hot August weather in Washington reduced the volumes of 
the apple and grape crops. Many commodity prices are reported down 
from a year ago. Potato prices are off 50 percent, while hay prices 
are reported down 15 percent. Beef prices also are lower as a result 
of increasing inventories and low demand. In California, 
agricultural exports continue to expand despite a curtailment of the 
state's export promotion program as a result of budget cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The forest products industry remains in poor shape, although one 
report from the Pacific Northwest suggests that some lumber mills 
have begun to rehire workers. Lumber prices have fallen back after a 
sharp run-up in the second quarter. Forest products industry 
employment in Oregon and Washington remains well below its level a 
year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity remain sluggish in many parts 
of the Twelfth District. In California, home sales are reported to 
have slowed following the rebound seen this spring, while median 
home prices seem to have stabilized. Commercial markets in southern 
California continue to languish, with vacancy rates in downtown Los 
Angeles expected to rise as new space comes on line. Residential 
prices also are reported soft in Washington, and residential 
construction activity there has fallen sharply since last year. 
Conditions in Utah and Idaho are much better, with relatively strong 
prices and sales activity. The median home price is reported up in 
Arizona.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions at Twelfth District financial institutions remain mixed. 
In California, loan demand continues weak for most categories of 
loans while credit quality is deteriorating and write-offs are 
increasing. Loan demand also is reported soft in Arizona, although 
auto and residential real estate loan volumes have improved. Banking 
conditions in Utah remain solid.
