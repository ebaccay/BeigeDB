      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from various sectors of the Third District economy were 
mixed in August, although indications were that overall activity was 
steady. Manufacturers reported steady orders but a drop in 
shipments. Retailers indicated sales were seasonally slow but 
slightly above the level in August of last year. Auto dealers said 
at upward trend in sales persisted through the month. Bankers 
generally indicated that overall loan volumes were edging up, with 
weakness in commercial loan demand being offset by increased 
consumer lending. Mortgage refinancing volume was growing. Realtors 
and builders said sales were up compared with last year for new and 
existing homes in lower price ranges, but were off for higher priced 
homes. Commercial real estate activity remained weak, especially in 
the Philadelphia central business district, but there were some 
reports that demand for office space in suburban areas was a bit 
firmer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, manufacturers expect conditions to improve, but they 
do not plan to step up hiring. Retailers express cautious optimism 
for the fall, and auto dealers expect the upward trend in sales to 
continue through the rest of the year. Bankers generally expect 
consumer lending to continue moving up modestly, but most do not 
expect commercial loan demand to strengthen in the immediate future. 
Realtors anticipate continued weakness in commercial real estate 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers continued to report slack conditions in 
August. Around half said new orders and shipments were running at a 
steady pace. While as many firms reported increases in orders as 
reported decreases, the number of firms that indicated shipments had 
dropped was slightly greater than the number that posted increases. 
Around three-fourths of the firms contacted in August said they were 
holding payrolls steady, but nearly one-fourth were making cuts. 
Inventories were generally described as steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, nearly half of the manufacturers surveyed in August 
expect conditions to improve over the next six months, while only 
one in ten anticipates further weakening. On balance, industrial 
firms in the region expect rising orders and shipments. Overall, 
area firms' plans for the next six months call for some slight 
increases in capital spending but no change from current employment 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District retailers contacted in late August said 
sales were seasonally slow as the back-to-school shopping period was 
just getting under way. Many noted that sales were running a bit 
above the pace set last August, and they expect slight year-over-
year gains to persist through the fall months. Auto dealers 
generally indicated that sales in August were above the level of 
August 1992. They expect the growth trend that began this spring to 
carry through the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks was 
edging up in August, according to reports from bankers. Most said 
that consumer lending was rising while commercial and industrial 
loan volumes were steady or easing. Bankers also said that home 
mortgage refinancing activity was strong, with borrowers preferring 
fixed-rate loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      While most bankers said they did not expect commercial loan demand 
to increase in the immediate future, some said discussions with 
potential business borrowers indicated that commercial loan demand 
could begin to improve as previously postponed capital spending 
projects are reviewed. Bankers generally expect consumer loan demand 
to remain on a modest upward trend. While some noted signs of 
increasing home sales and purchase-mortgage originations, the gains 
are not expected to be strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District contacts in residential real estate and construction 
indicated that the pace of new home construction and sales this 
summer has been about even with last year's rate. For both new and 
existing homes, realtors said there was strong demand for those in 
the price range associated with first-time home-buying. They said 
these homes were selling at a better rate than last year because of 
lower mortgage rates and some easing in price from prior years. 
Several realtors noted slower sales and growing inventories of 
existing homes for sale in higher price ranges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity remained slow, according to realtors 
and property managers contacted for this report. The demand for 
office space in Philadelphia was weak, according to real estate 
contacts, while demand in suburban areas appeared to be somewhat 
firmer. Real estate contacts expect demand for office space to 
remain soft as a result of the slow job growth they anticipate.
