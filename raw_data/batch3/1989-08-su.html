      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Comments received by Reserve Banks from business and other contacts 
suggest that the nation's economy continues to grow slowly. Most 
Districts report slow growth in general merchandise sales, with 
strength in women's apparel Auto sales are weak in a majority of 
Districts, although Dallas reports significantly stronger sales than 
a year ago. Overall manufacturing activity shows slow growth in 
several Districts and declining activity in some areas. Oil drilling 
activity has improved in recent months, although it remains at a low 
level. Demand for paper shows signs of weakening from high levels in 
some areas, while logging restrictions are limiting lumber 
production in several northern states. Farmers in many parts of the 
country expect good harvests, but weather problems are hurting 
production in some regions. Real estate markets and loan demand are 
strong or growing in some Districts, but weak in others.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts report relatively slow growth in general merchandise 
sales. Several report that retailers are cautious and are reducing 
their orders for the remainder of 1989. Most report relatively weak 
sales of home furnishings, electronics, and appliances. Women's wear 
is a leading source of retail sales growth in many parts of the 
country. Texas retailers report "moderate to strong" growth in 
retail sales compared with year-earlier levels, but Philadelphia, 
Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis report that sales for many 
retailers in their Districts were flat or down in real terms. 
Reports of inventories suggest that most stores have satisfactory 
stocks, although some unplanned increases were reported in the St. 
Louis District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are reported to be below year-ago levels in most parts of 
the country. Dealer inventories are accumulating to higher-than-
desired levels in most parts of the country, and several Districts 
report that dealers' profit margins have fallen. However, car sales 
in Texas have increased sharply with sales in Dallas up 13 percent 
from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on manufacturing industries vary considerably from one 
District to another. Boston, New York, and Cleveland report 
declining rates of growth in orders for some manufactured products, 
with no growth in some cases. Manufacturing conditions in the 
Atlanta District vary by product line, with chemical producers in 
Louisiana planning plant expansions. Nearly a third of manufacturers 
contacted by the Philadelphia bank reported declining activity, 
while half reported no change. Dallas and San Francisco report 
softening orders for electronic components. Chicago reports that 
orders for cutting machine tools, particularly from abroad, trail 
last year's levels. Richmond and St. Louis report declines in 
manufacturing activity. Some layoffs and plant closings associated 
with reduced auto production have occurred in the Chicago and St. 
Louis Districts, with further cutbacks anticipated. Reduced auto 
production, seasonal slowing, and reduced export demand have 
curtailed the demand for steel, according to manufacturers in the 
Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Most Districts report 
that manufacturers' inventories are at satisfactory levels, although 
Kansas City notes efforts to trim inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the resource industries are mixed. Increased oil 
drilling activity has boosted demand for oil field equipment 
although activity remains below last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong foreign demand for lumber is buoying the lumber industries in 
the Richmond and Dallas Districts, but logging restrictions are 
hurting lumber producers in the Pacific Northwest and North Central 
regions. Accumulation of paper inventories were noted in Arkansas 
and in the Atlanta District. In contrast, orders to Dallas District 
paper manufacturers remain high and prices for paper products have 
been rising recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farmers in many parts of the country expect good harvests, but 
weather problems are hurting production in some regions. Harvest 
prospects are reported to be good in the Richmond. Chicago, and San 
Francisco Districts, and in most of the Kansas City District. Heavy 
rains have hurt production throughout much of the South. Much of 
North Dakota is suffering from a drought which is expected to hurt 
wheat yields. Kansas and Nebraska wheat production is suffering from 
a plethora of weather and pest problems. Apple and grape producers 
in the West report declining sales which they attribute to concerns 
about food safety.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate market conditions are mixed. Strong 
activity is occurring in upstate New York and in the Chicago and San 
Francisco Districts, with particular strength noted in Seattle. 
Exceptionally strong markets in California appear to have cooled 
off, although prices continue to rise. A slow rate of increase in 
activity is reported in Texas and in the Boston and New York City 
areas. Flat or declining activity is noted in the Richmond, 
Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. The recent decline in 
mortgage rates reportedly had a slight positive effect on markets in 
the Boston, New York, and Richmond Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of lending activity varies considerably by region and by 
type of loan. Overall loan growth is reported to be strong in the 
St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Demand for mortgage loans has 
softened in New York, while Chicago attributes its pronounced upturn 
in residential loan applications to lower rates and refinancing 
activity. Richmond reports mixed mortgage activity, with most 
reports of improvement attributed to refinancing. Demand for home 
equity credit and second mortgages is strong in the New York and 
Atlanta Districts and increasing in the Kansas City District. 
Commercial and industrial lending activity is reported to be up in 
Chicago and Kansas City growing at a slower rate in Philadelphia, 
and flat to down in Richmond.
