      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District developments in recent weeks were mixed, as has 
generally been the case for some time. Department store sales in the 
District were stronger than expected in January and February, with 
most stores reporting no inventory problems. At the same time, 
homebuilders in the District reported a significant increase in 
customer interest, with actual sales improving though still light. 
By contrast, labor market developments continued to be unfavorable 
in the District with state unemployment rates rising and with a 
continued heavy schedule of planned corporate layoffs. Loan officers 
at small and midsized banks report only few changes in their 
willingness to lend as compared with their practices two months ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts at District department stores reported stronger-than-
expected sales in both January and February and positive over-the-
year changes. However, while generally pleased with the results, 
retailers cited the Persian Gulf War as a deterrent last year and 
exceptional promotional activities this year as major factors in the 
recent improvement. Year-to-year gains ranged from 5 to 10 percent 
in January and 5 to 7 percent in February. The major exception was a 
chain with a sizable over-the-year decline in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most categories of merchandise registered year-to-year gains in the 
first two months of the year with the strongest results in women's 
and men's apparel, cosmetics and accessories. In addition, for the 
first time in many months, all respondents noted some improvement in 
furniture sales. With the relatively strong sales performances, most 
retailers reported inventories in good shape and on plan or a little 
below.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retail scene in the District has undergone some churning in 
recent weeks with one major group emerging from two years in Chapter 
11 bankruptcy and several other chains filing for protection under 
that chapter. While some chains are having difficulty, a large 
jewelry and houseware chain announced plans to build a $194 million 
shopping center on Long Island and several national and foreign 
retailers are entering the New York City market now that rents are 
lower and desirable space is available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential Construction and Real Estate
Homebuilders in several parts of the District report a decided 
pickup in buyer interest as evidenced by increased traffic and phone 
inquiries. However, the volume of sales has been light, although 
improved, as consumers remain hesitant due to economic uncertainties 
and the possibility of future tax incentives for homebuyers. In 
general, builders now expect this year to show some modest 
improvement over 1991. Credit conditions reportedly are still tight, 
particularly for acquisition and development loans, though money for 
construction loans has become more available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity increased somewhat in recent weeks but with 
the continued release of excess space resulting from corporate 
restructuring and relocation, vacancy rates in much of the District 
have been rising. Moreover, some areas have also had new office 
construction coming on line, adding further upward pressure on 
vacancy rates. The latest data show office vacancy rates of 20 
percent or more in northern New Jersey, Fairfield County, 
(Connecticut), Long Island and Buffalo. While rates in Westchester 
County, Manhattan and Syracuse remain below the national average of 
about 19 percent, most of them have been rising as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates rose in February to their highest levels 
since the early 1980s. New York's rate climbed to 8.9 percent--the 
second highest among eleven large states--from 8.4 percent in 
January while New Jersey's jumped to 7.6 percent from 6.8 percent in 
January. The District's employment outlook was dimmed further by 
General Motors' announced plan to close its Westchester County 
plant, with almost 3500 jobs, by mid-1995. More immediately, 
thousands of layoffs are scheduled to take place this year and next 
at several large banks, A.T.&amp;T.; and NYNEX, the regional telephone 
company. In addition, I.B.M. will be cutting back substantially 
through early retirement and attrition. On the positive side, G.M. 
will invest $65 million in updating and technological improvement at 
two Buffalo area plants and Continental Airlines plans to add up to 
1000 jobs in northern New Jersey.
     </p>
     <p>
      The February survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed somewhat 
higher percentages of firms reporting reduced new orders and 
production following substantial improvements in these categories in 
January. There was also a sharp increase in the percentage reporting 
higher input prices in February. The January survey of Rochester 
purchasing managers, however, showed a decrease in the percentage 
anticipating a deterioration of business conditions over the next 
three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District indicated no change in their willingness to lend 
as compared with two months ago, although a few respondents did 
report tightening their credit standards. Consumer loan demand 
remained weak. Demand for residential mortgages continued to rise 
sharply due to the surge in mortgage refinancings resulting from the 
drop in interest rates two months ago. Almost all surveyed loan 
officers indicated that they do not expect changes in their lending 
practices or deposit rates when lower reserve requirements become 
effective April 2. A majority of respondents reported no change or a 
decrease in loan delinquency rates during January or February, 
contrary to the usual pattern of increased delinquencies after the 
holidays.
