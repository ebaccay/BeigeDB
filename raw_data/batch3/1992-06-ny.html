      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on recent developments in the Second District continue to be 
basically mixed, but marginally more negative in tone than in recent 
months. On the plus side, office leasing activity in Manhattan 
continued at a moderate pace and a survey of District manufacturing 
firms showed business conditions have improved significantly since 
last November. In contrast, however, District homebuilders noted a 
recent slackening of activity and department store contacts reported 
some slowing in sales growth. Labor market developments were also 
unfavorable, with state unemployment rates rising in May and with 
layoffs of over 7,000 retail employees expected by summer's end. 
Senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized District banks 
indicated no change in their willingness to lend from two months 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in upstate New York and northern New Jersey generally 
report a recent slackening of activity after the rise in sales 
earlier this year, although sales remain above last year's levels. A 
builders association projects new single family homes in western New 
York will total between 2,300 and 2,400 units this year, above last 
year's level of 2,100, but well below the more than 2,800 homes 
built in both 1988 and 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manhattan office leasing activity has continued to rise, but growing 
inventories of available space have led to increases in overall 
vacancy rates. In the market for sublet space in Midtown Manhattan, 
however, declines in asking rental rates have so increased leasing 
activity that the inventory of available space has finally begun to 
decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Second District department stores reported that sales growth was 
slightly stronger in April than in May. Although the range of year-
to-year sales growth was quite similar for both months -- flat to 
+15 percent in April as compared to -3 percent to +15 percent in May 
-- more stores were clustered near the bottom of the range during 
the most recent period. Easter boosted sales of children's clothing 
in April, while unusually cool weather slowed apparel sales the 
following month. All contacts reported inventories on plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifteen New York metropolitan area department stores are scheduled 
to close by summer's end, resulting in the loss of 7,200 jobs. 
Several of the stores are the last remaining retail anchors in older 
downtown areas; the Fordham Road section of the Bronx and downtown 
Newark and New Rochelle are expected to be particularly hard hit. On 
a more positive note, a major New Jersey shopping mall has announced 
plans for expansion and renovation, including three new luxury 
department stores to replace two anchors which had previously 
closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A May survey of 15 Second District manufacturing firms suggests that 
local business conditions are now significantly more positive than 
they were when the same firms were surveyed last November. Ten of 
the firms anticipate sales will increase over the next six months, 
with seven of the ten having recently become more optimistic. Only 
three firms are anticipating layoffs, as compared to six firms in 
November. The most recent purchasing managers reports from Buffalo 
(for May) and Rochester (for April) suggest that general business 
conditions have been basically stable over the latest month 
reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor market developments in the Second District have generally been 
unfavorable. The unemployment rate in New Jersey rose sharply, from 
7.8 percent in April to 9.0 percent in May; New Jersey now has the 
highest unemployment rate of any major industrial state. New York 
State experienced a much smaller increase, from 7.6 to 7.9 percent. 
In addition to the expected loss of 7,200 District retail jobs, 
Bethlehem Steel and MONY announced the elimination of 350 and 267 
positions, respectively. In contrast, Prestolite Electric will 
consolidate its national operations in upstate New York, creating 
320 local jobs over the next three years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Standard and Poor's has placed New Jersey on negative CreditWatch in 
response to the state's burgeoning FY1993 budget gap. A combination 
of factors -- including a one percentage point reduction in the 
sales tax rate, the loss of anticipated federal medicaid 
reimbursements, and lower than expected receipts -- have led to a 
prospective budget shortfall in excess of $1 billion for the fiscal 
year beginning July 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks 
in the Second District indicated that they are as willing to lend as 
they were two months ago. Borrowers who had weathered the recession 
were perceived by some officers as having improved their credit 
worthiness. Most respondents reported either maintaining or lowering 
loan rates. Loan demand was reported to be generally stable or 
somewhat stronger. Part of the strength in demand was attributed to 
the increase in new customers whose former banks had either failed 
or merged. Demand for consumer loans and non-residential mortgages 
remained steady,
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of respondents reported no change in delinquency rates 
for all types of loans during the past two months. Most officers did 
not indicate a marked increase in problem real estate loans. They 
did, however, express a preference for restructuring, rather than 
foreclosing, existing troubled loans.
