      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Southeast's economy continues to show a mixed performance. Auto 
sales and residential construction have slowed but tourism, 
financial services, and most other industries have improved or 
remained stable. Retail sales declined briefly in late October but 
have since rebounded. For the most part, capital spending plans have 
not been altered recently. The prevalent attitude seems to be one of 
cautious optimism. In this report we have concentrated on 
developments since the stock market crash in mid-October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on the market's effects on southeastern industries are 
mixed. Many firms indicate no impact is expected before early next 
year. There have been a few reports of expansion plans put on hold 
and initial stock offerings for some companies have been postponed 
but not cancelled. However, most manufacturers are optimistic and 
are proceeding with expansion projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      The region's appliance and furniture producers are concerned that 
the stock market plunge may result in more conservative spending 
patterns. Spokesmen for the carpet industry are also uneasy about 
possible consumer belt tightening and a construction slowdown.
     </p>
     <p>
      Textile companies are leaner and more competitive than in the past 
as exports have bolstered the industry. The lower value of the 
dollar is also stimulating domestic sales by making imports more 
expensive. There have been no signs of slowing in the paper 
industry. If lower domestic new car sales and output persist, 
district tire and auto part producers expect increased replacement 
goods demand to make up for some of the loss of original equipment 
business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The plunge in stock prices has elicited mixed reactions from 
retailers. Sales across most product lines, particularly durables, 
decreased during the week of the crash but subsequently rebounded.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is some indication that the impact on discount stores was less 
severe than on full service department stores. Sales ended the month 
flat or slightly above last October, and early indications for 
November are moderately favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations for the holiday season were not adjusted significantly 
after the market's fall since retailers throughout the District had 
already been expecting only slight increases over last year's sales. 
Promotional activity will be increased compared to last year, but 
most retailers report they are not at this point giving price 
discounts. They also have not altered their hiring plans for the 
holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in October and early November slowed according to dealers 
but they believe the behavior had more to do with the removal of 
factory incentives than the plunge in stock prices. Despite concern 
over weakened consumer confidence, dealers' plans remain largely 
unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts reported downturns in overall residential construction 
which they attribute to seasonal factors as well as economic 
uncertainty. Birmingham sources noted a small uptick in sales of 
existing homes in late October, but no change occurred in Mobile. 
Florida contacts report mixed trends in the state's housing markets. 
Mississippi and Tennessee sources indicate general slowing in sales 
activity in larger cities. Multi-family markets have been gloomy 
throughout the year in the Sixth District, and there is an inventory 
overhang.
     </p>
     <p>
      Metropolitan office vacancy rates during 1987's third quarter 
remained steady but high ranging from 18 percent to almost 30 
percent. Only Jacksonville showed significant improvement in 
absorption, as vacancy rates decreased by more than eleven percent 
since last quarter. Office and industrial developers in the region 
report a number of projects are on hold, reflecting earlier 
overbuilding. Meanwhile retail construction has sustained its 
strength throughout the region as mall construction flourishes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks and thrift institutions report mixed experiences in recent 
weeks. While small net increases in deposits have occurred, loan 
growth has slowed at large commercial banks. Some banks in Georgia, 
Alabama, and Tennessee note a drop off in loan volume while most 
Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana banks report no changes. The 
rate of growth in consumer loans slipped in October while business 
and real estate loans have remained stable or increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District travel agents report no appreciable changes in advance 
bookings and cancellations in recent weeks. The dollar's decline, 
however, has spurred a shift away from foreign vacations. Officials 
expect slight increases in tourism activity throughout the District 
this winter spurred mainly by convention business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Estimated yields of late-harvested crops such as soybeans are lower 
as a result of dry weather. Damaged pastures are causing farmers to 
purchase feed for their animals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spokesmen in the pulpwood industry report a thriving industry. There 
is some indication of slight capacity expansion but caution 
prevails. The lumber industry is experiencing a seasonal softening 
in markets and slight price declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      District crude oil production fell in October to a level almost 10 
percent lower than the peak in early 1986. Production capacity has 
declined with the cutbacks in exploration since the early 1980s and 
with the closing of numerous inefficient stripper type wells. On the 
other hand, drilling activity increased, reaching its highest point 
since March of 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      District coal production rose modestly in October making the third 
consecutive month of higher output, supplying evidence of a 
beginning recovery in the coal industry.
