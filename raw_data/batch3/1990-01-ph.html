      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 24, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District were mixed as the new year 
began. Manufacturing continued on the slackening trend that began in 
mid-1989. Retailers achieved modest gains in unit sales for the 
Christmas season although price discounting was widespread. Overall 
loan volume at major banks was growing fairly steadily, but 
commercial and personal loan demand appeared to be easing somewhat 
and banks were implementing more conservative credit standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in most sectors of the region's economy is for very 
modest expansion. Among manufacturers, positive views for the first 
half of the year barely exceed negative expectations. Retailers 
generally see unit sales through the winter running little better 
than even with the year-ago pace. Bankers expect loan growth to 
continue in most credit categories, but at a slower rate as economic 
growth slows and more restrictive credit standards are applied.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity in the Third District in early January 
continues to fall. In nearly all of the industries surveyed, firms 
reporting slower business edged out those posting gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some measures of business conditions indicated improvement, but the 
region's goods-producing sector remained soft overall. For example, 
area manufacturers indicated that new orders were rising slightly as 
the new year began, but the order rate was lagging behind shipments, 
leading to a drop in order backlogs. Local firms have been reporting 
shrinking order books since mid-1989. Lagging demand for 
manufactured goods is reflected by shorter delivery times as well, 
according to managers at area plants. The slackness in the 
manufacturing sector also appears to be bringing some stability to 
industrial prices; two-thirds of the firms surveyed said input 
prices were steady from December into January, and three-fourths 
said they were holding prices constant for the goods they make. As 
area firms adjust production to the slow growth in orders, they are 
generally allowing inventories to decline; and, while most are 
holding employment steady, some are trimming payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, area manufacturers have mixed views, although 
slightly more firms expect improvement than anticipate further 
slowing in the first half of the year. On balance, managers at area 
plants expect marginal gains in new orders. They expect to step up 
shipments at least as much, however, which will prevent order 
backlogs from growing. Plant managers also anticipate some further 
trimming of employment and hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally met sales goals for the Christmas 
shopping period, which was characterized by early and widespread 
discounting. Year-to-year sales gains for the season as a whole 
ranged up to 5 percent, in real terms, for area stores. Most 
department stores in the region indicated they achieved the modest 
sales improvement they had expected, but among discount and 
specialty stores results were mixed. In particular, sales at 
clothing stores in the last half of December did not appear to be 
consistent with the stronger performance in earlier fall months, 
after taking seasonal factors into account.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants contacted in early January said sales were running about 
even with or slightly above the year-ago pace. For the rest of the 
winter, most retailers expect sales to just match last year's, in 
real terms. None of the store executives surveyed expressed strong 
optimism for the coming spring season. Several mentioned concern in 
the industry that major national retailers who are facing cash-flow 
difficulties might step up price discounting. After heavy 
discounting this Christmas, retailers are looking to reestablish 
stable pricing policies before the spring selling season begins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at major Third District banks in late December was 
approximately 15 percent above the same period in the prior year, 
although growth appeared to ease during the month. Bankers contacted 
in early January said a slowdown in the rate of growth was 
continuing. Most expect overall loan demand to move up only modestly 
as the national economy enters at least one or two quarters of 
slower growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      As the new year began, commercial and industrial lending was being 
scaled back at several large banks in the district as conditions in 
some sectors prompted credit reviews of companies in those 
industries. Builders and retailers, in particular, were being 
reviewed and some reductions in loan commitments were being made. 
Many bankers in the district expect the cutback in construction 
financing to result in lower total real-estate-based lending. 
However, some foresee a pickup in residential real estate financing, 
in response to recent and anticipated reductions in mortgage rates, 
which would mitigate the extent of the decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer lending has been growing at a steady pace since last 
summer, but bankers generally expect growth to diminish, at least 
through the first half of the year. They cite the decline in auto 
sales as a negative influence on consumer borrowings, and several 
note that, while credit-card sales are growing steadily, paydowns 
are on a rising trend, leaving net outstandings nearly flat.
