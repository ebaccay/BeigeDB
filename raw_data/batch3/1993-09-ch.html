       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic expansion proceeded slowly in July and 
early August, while efforts to clean up after the flooding got 
underway. Reports from a variety of retailing contacts indicated 
modest improvement in consumer spending. Housing markets remained 
relatively active, although bad weather restricted construction and 
the delivery of building materials. Manufacturing activity flattened 
out during a seasonally slow period, but is generally expected to 
build momentum over the rest of the year. Reports from banks 
indicated that commercial, industrial, and consumer lending 
progressed at a somewhat stronger pace. Flood damage and related 
slow crop development reduced anticipated agricultural production 
and left a sizable portion of the remaining corn and soybean crop 
vulnerable to an early frost.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Discussions with retailers, state tourism officials, auto dealers 
and other contacts were largely consistent with a modest pickup in 
consumer spending in July and August. A large discount store chain 
reported that same-store sales gains improved in August, with hard 
lines leading sales, and results an the District slightly stronger 
than the national average. While a major department store chain 
reported solid gains in back-to-school sales during August, some 
other retailers stated that back-to-school sales have proceeded 
somewhat more slowly than anticipated. One retailer speculated that 
a burst of later-than-usual vacations alter an extended period of 
bad weather may have been partly responsible. According to another 
retailer, there has also been a trend toward later back-to-school 
sales, and this contact stated that continuing sales gains in home 
furnishings and nonseasonal merchandise were more indicative of the 
true underlying momentum in retailing activity. Bad weather limited 
tourism spending in Wisconsin in July, but a store official stated 
that with improvement in weather during August, a substantial 
increase in business has occurred in many parts of the state, with 
record-breaking weeks reported for one popular tourist area. An auto 
dealers' exchange stated that volume ran substantially above year-
earlier levels in recent months, and used car prices continued to 
rise. One of the largest auto dealers in the District noted that 
profitability has been improving to a somewhat greater extent than 
volume. Inventories are leaner and consumers "aren't beating us upon 
price so much." A manager of shopping center properties reported 
that sales growth for the stores in its centers in the District 
seemed little changed thus far in the third quarter. This contact 
noted relative strength in department store sales results, and was 
encouraged that consumers seem increasingly focused on value as 
opposed to price alone.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bad weather and hesitancy among producers has impeded residential 
construction activity through much of the year, but discussions with 
housing industry contacts suggested that the underlying tone of the 
home sales market remained firm. An association of realtors stated 
that local bonds have been reporting further improvement in sales 
activity and buyer interest during the third quarter in Illinois. A 
realtors' association reported a significant increase in home 
resales in Wisconsin during July, and year-to-date sales are now 
ahead of a record breaking year-earlier period in spite of 
relatively weak results in early 1993. One of the largest 
residential realtors in the District reported a return to a record 
selling pace in July, after some softening in its markets during the 
second quarter, and early August results remained encouraging. A 
survey of residential mortgage lenders in Western Michigan showed a 
pickup in origination growth in recent months. Two mortgage lenders 
reported significant improvement in the housing market in the 
Detroit area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bad weather and the effects of flooding restricted shipments of 
construction materials through July and early August. A gypsum 
wallboard producer expected industry shipments to rise somewhat less 
than earlier expected this year, but shipments to the Seventh 
District were still expected to post a modestly higher gain than in 
the nation as a whole. A large cement producer reported relative 
strength in shipments for light industrial construction, which 
combined with extensive public works activity to boost overall 
shipments in the absence of improvement in the weak commercial 
market. This contact stated that "we definitely see some better 
times ahead." A cement industry association stated that bad weather 
did not affect production, but shipments were delayed in some parts 
of the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers' survey results and reports from manufacturers 
indicate that industrial output in the District flattened out (on a 
seasonally adjusted basis) during the seasonally slow months of July 
and August. Light vehicle assemblies had been scheduled to surge in 
the third quarter, but underbuilds during August have pared those 
expectations. One large automaker expected output to continue to 
increase on a seasonally adjusted basis in the third quarter, and 
this contact expressed confidence that assemblies would continue to 
climb into the fourth quarter. Light vehicle assembly gains in the 
District have significantly exceeded the national average thus far 
in 1993, and District production should benefit when one large 
facility reopens later in the year. A steel producer selling into 
niche markets reported that their order books were full through 
October and November. Improvement in demand remains widespread by 
customer grouping, according to this contact. A steel industry 
analyst stated than continued relative strength among steel service 
centers is another sign that improvement in demand has been 
generalized, and not confined to auto and appliance manufacturers. A 
large electronics and communications company stated that strong 
bookings growth continued, particularly in orders from Asia. A 
heavy-duty truck industry analyst reported that net orders in July 
climbed to their highest level for that month since 1978. The 
increase was partly driven by promotions, but there was little sign 
of an orders slowdown in preliminary results for August Some small 
manufacturers that were closed due to flooding in July have begun 
the clean-up process.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial, industrial and consumer lending activity generally 
continued to improve in recent months. Several large bank holding 
companies reported increased liquidity in the large corporate loan 
market, with a perceived strengthening in asset quality prompting 
greater willingness among banks to extend credit. Heightened 
competition has reduced the cost of credit lines and the spread of 
loan rates over base rates. A regional bank holding company stated 
that middle-market commercial loan demand is still "pretty good," 
with demand for working capital financing more robust than demand 
for fixed investment financing. Another middle-market lender stated 
that commercial borrowers seem to have increased their tendency to 
shop around for better loan terms, and competition on rates has 
intensified in most borrower classes, with little overall net 
lending growth. "We are continuing to go forward at rates we 
consider acceptable, but the overall market is best characterized as 
sluggish or weak." Auto loans still form an important source of 
strength in consumer lending, according to one regional bank holding 
company. A large retailing firm reported continued expansion in 
outstanding consumer credit while a large bank holding company 
reported that credit card write-offs have been running at their 
lowest pace in almost a decade.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Recent flooding is estimated to have led to an expected total 
production loss of roughly 4 to 7 percent of this year's intended 
crop acreage in the hardest-hit District states (Iowa, Illinois and 
Wisconsin). Ponding and slow crop development have considerably 
reduced the yield prospects on the remaining acreage in Iowa and 
Wisconsin. Production uncertainties continued into late August, with 
ongoing rainfall in much of the District. A sizable portion of the 
corn and soybeans in the northern half of the District remain 
vulnerable to a frost prior to maturity, and even a normal first 
frost would cause some damage to this year's late crop.
