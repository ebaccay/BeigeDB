      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth in the Ninth Federal Reserve District continues to gain 
momentum. Manufacturing firms apparently have expanding orders and 
there is increased spending on capital goods. Metal mining prospects 
are brighter and output is increasing. New residential housing 
starts slowed slightly from earlier in the spring, but construction 
remains very robust. Crop conditions are excellent in most areas. 
Reports on tourist activity are strong from all areas of the Ninth 
District. Outlays on general merchandise continue to expand and 
motor vehicle sales remain strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets show increasing signs of tightness, especially in 
metropolitan areas across the district. Some firms report difficulty 
hiring skilled workers. However, there is little evidence of 
increasing labor costs. And while prices of a few materials, such as 
non-ferrous metals, have increased, some supply bottlenecks have 
apparently eased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and capital goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing is generally robust and orders apparently are 
increasing. Firms producing building supplies or auto components 
report particularly strong sales. Manufacturers of medical supplies, 
electronic devices and commercial cabinets also indicate that 
business is very good. An electronic controls manufacturer reports 
"We are still well above plan in spite of the interest rate 
increases."
     </p>
     <p>
      Increased capital investment is apparently responsible for some of 
the impetus in manufacturing. One manufacturer of industrial 
painting equipment had second-quarter sales 18 percent above a year 
earlier. Moreover, farmers are increasing their capital spending: 
North Dakota reports that first-quarter sales tax revenues on farm 
machinery sales were 28 percent above 1993 and other sources 
indicate that such sales have continued to increase as crop 
prospects become increasingly optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Natural resource-related industries are strong. An iron ore mine 
that has been closed for nearly a year will reportedly open by fall. 
Furthermore, shipments from existing iron mines are running above 
1993 levels and above industry projections made earlier in the year. 
Copper prices remain 30 percent above year-earlier prices and 
production is strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the forest products sector, plants manufacturing plywood 
substitutes in Minnesota and Wisconsin are reportedly running at 
capacity and lumber mills in that region have good business. But in 
South Dakota and Montana, output of lumber is reportedly below 1993 
levels due to cutting restrictions. In the paper industry, which 
continues to suffer from overbuilding in the 1980s, there are some 
glimmers of improvement. A new plant to de-ink and re-pulp used 
paper reports good business, and a spokesman for a firm with two 
mills in Minnesota said, "We expect 1994 to be better than 1993." 
But another Minnesota mill laid off 220 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite interest rate increases earlier in the year, the 
construction sector remains robust in most areas of the district. 
But residential building may have reached a plateau. For 
Minneapolis-St. Paul, June single-family permits dropped slightly 
from May, but remained I percent above the high levels attained a 
year earlier. Residential construction reportedly remains very 
strong in such regional centers as Eau Claire, Wis., Sioux Falls, 
S.D., and Fargo, N.D. Commercial and heavy construction in Minnesota 
and the Dakotas through June was about 2 percent above 1993 and 28 
percent above 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crops in most areas of the Ninth District are in excellent 
condition. Development of corn, soybeans and wheat is substantially 
ahead of normal. While hail damage is somewhat more widespread than 
normal and excess rainfall caused some crop damage in the Dakotas 
and northwestern Minnesota, . overall prospects are for an excellent 
crop. Harvest of winter wheat has begun. There is some concern that 
plant diseases may again cut wheat yields and quality in eastern 
North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, but no hard information is 
yet available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although crop prospects are much better than a year ago, livestock 
numbers and output show little change. While cattle and hogs both 
seem to be moving toward contractionary phases of their respective 
cycles, industry sources and extension economists anticipate current 
high slaughter levels and low prices will continue into 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of all classes of retail merchandise continue strong across 
the district. A representative of a regional department store chain 
indicates that second quarter business was excellent, as do reports 
from a large national chain based in Minneapolis. Mall managers in 
Minneapolis-St Paul and other metropolitan areas also report 
expanding sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Motor vehicle sales continue to add impetus in many areas. The pace 
of automobile sales slowed slightly in Minnesota, with monthly sales 
for June about 2 percentage points below a year earlier. But 1994 
year-to-date sales lead 1993's already strong sales levels by 2 
percentage points. And South Dakota's pace quickened: June sales 
were 13 percent and year-to-date sales 12 percent ahead of the 
corresponding period in 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pleasant weather is keeping tourist attractions busy. Hotel 
occupancy in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is up for July over 
1993, after staying even during June. June crossings at the Mackinac 
Bridge are up 9 percent over year-earlier levels, reportedly due in 
part to nearby casinos. A chamber of commerce official in northern 
Wisconsin reports "the best summer ever." And a Duluth, Minn., 
official estimates about an 8 percent increase in tourism traffic 
for June and July over the same months last year. Campsite occupancy 
in South Dakota in June is up 47 percent over 1993, the highest 
level in five years. Montana reports for June were up slightly from 
last year's record levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets reflect a strengthening district economy. Late spring 
employment numbers continued to climb in all Ninth District states 
and unemployment rates dropped. Employment numbers are running 2 
percent to 3 percent above year earlier levels in Minnesota and both 
Dakotas. In these states unemployment rates are at 3.2 percent or 
less, down a point or more from 1993 The Minneapolis-St Paul 
unemployment rate is down to 2.5 percent while Sioux Falls and 
Aberdeen S. D., Fargo N D., and La Crosse, Wis., are even lower. 
Firms in many sectors report difficulty in securing qualified help. 
A personnel manager for a western North Dakota manufacturer said, 
"It is much more difficult to get help than a year ago." News media 
report shortages of over-the-road truck drivers, mold and die makers 
and electronics technicians.
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither vigorous business conditions nor tightening labor markets 
have yet translated into significant upward pressure on wages or 
prices. Few sources report wage pressures. Hourly earnings in 
manufacturing for Minneapolis-St. Paul are about 1percent above 
year-earlier levels. Shortages of steel and wood particle board 
reported in June have apparently eased. Non-ferrous metals have 
increased in price, and petroleum fuels have risen back to summer 
1993 levels.
