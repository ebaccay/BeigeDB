      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 18, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The southeastern economy continues its somewhat sluggish pace 
overall. Weakening growth in manufacturing, largely reflecting 
downturns in transportation equipment, combines with a slower pace 
in the retail trade sector to hold total employment gains under the 
year-ago level. However, some sectors are performing quite well and 
scarcities of skilled laborers have been reported by textile and 
appliance producers and in oil drilling operations, though wages are 
not reported to be under much upward pressure. A number of 
industrial contacts report rising input prices and the ability to 
pass them on to manufactured products because of strong demand. 
Inventory levels are generally lean and retailers seem especially 
cautious to avoid overstocking problems, similar to those 
experienced in last year's fourth quarter. Export trade is unusually 
brisk across a wide range of products and growth appears to be 
gathering momentum.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates have been edging up in the region lately, despite 
reports of some tightness in labor markets. For example, although 
the region's energy sector remains at a low ebb, offshore producers 
report they could now double their operations if they could find 
enough skilled workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Appliance producers note selected labor shortages and increased 
production costs due to rising raw material costs. However, it is 
difficult to recoup rising costs through price increases because the 
slowdown in residential construction is now weakening appliance 
shipments. The housing slowdown is also dampening lumber markets. In 
contrast to appliance and lumber manufacturers, the district's tire 
and rubber industry is faring well. Although raw material costs are 
rising, tire producers are able to increase prices because demand 
for time is currently outstripping supply. Apparel and textile 
producers expressed a mixed outlook with some firms running overtime 
while others report that orders are short for this time of year. 
Most are keeping tight control over production and inventories are 
being cut back as far as practically possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper mills are doing exceptionally well with both export and 
domestic demand expected to remain at high levels for the remainder 
of the year and into the next. Orders are growing and prices are 
firm. By contrast, local aircraft and several defense related 
equipment manufacturers are cutting back operations because of 
reduced orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      September retail sales were sluggish but up slightly over August's 
soft performance. Most retailers are relieved that there has not 
been a repeat of last year's disastrous fall season and remain 
optimistic that sales will revive in the fourth quarter. 
Southeastern markets are intensely competitive. Heavy promotions and 
discounts accompanied by increased advertising are key ingredients 
of most retailers' sales strategy. In this environment, retailers 
are not ordering very far in advance and are keeping inventories 
well below those prevailing last fall. Car dealers generally were 
satisfied with September's strong sales performance that left them 
with a relatively low inventory of unsold 1988 cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Year-to-date nonresidential construction growth in the District is 
running slightly ahead of the national level, but its strength 
varies widely across the District. Retail construction is strongest 
in the District's most prosperous statesâ€”Florida, Georgia, and 
Tennesseeâ€”and sluggish elsewhere. A significant amount of 
activity involves renovation of older shopping centers rather than 
building new space in a market where overbuilding, especially in 
strip centers, has led to vacancy rates well over 10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The housing industry is bracing for a further slowing of activity. 
The District states are just beginning to feel the impact of rising 
interest rates on home sales. Home prices in Atlanta dropped in 
August to their lowest level in over a year, and contacts report 
that September prices were low as well. In Florida, areas of the 
state such as Miami, Orlando and Tampa reported slowing sales in the 
third quarter as rising interest rates began to impact the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Officers of small and midsized banks in the Sixth District report 
strong demand for consumer loans. The majority of bankers said that 
demand is the same or greater than a year ago. Higher interest rates 
have not dampened installment loan demand at the surveyed banks and 
several bankers expect demand to continue brisk throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bank failures in District states have declined from a year ago. 
Sources in Louisiana, the most troubled state, report a downward 
trend in the number of bank closures there and prospects continue to 
brighten because of recent reductions in loan delinquencies and 
improvement in the local economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      September tourism in the Southeast continues to show slight gains 
over last year in most areas. Central Florida is still undergoing a 
mini boom in hotel construction due to continued high occupancy 
rates. Builders are confident the number of tourists will continue 
to increase to fill these new rooms due to expanding attractions in 
the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Port activity continues to boom, with export gains reaching double 
digits. In Miami, there has been marked improvement in exports of a 
variety of commodities including chemicals, steel, textile and 
carpet products, fruits and vegetables, and electric and electronic 
equipment, to Latin America. Clay products, forest products and 
chemicals are the leading sources of export growth in Savannah. 
Exports were also up in Tampa, largely due to a healthy increase in 
shipments of phosphate chemicals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Thanks to late-season rainfall, yields of most southeastern crops 
will be down only slightly or will show improvement from the 
previous season. However, the drought delayed development of the 
soybean and cotton crops increasing their vulnerability to early 
frosts and freezing weather. The Florida Citrus industry expects 
another good year with increasing output from maturing new groves 
and strong prices thanks to bright prospects for new export markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite continued sluggishness, the oil industry has experienced a 
bunt of new offshore activity in the Gulf waters off the coast of 
Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Oil production, however, 
remains down considerably over last year and the number of motive 
rigs in the District has slipped 7 percent since the previous year.
