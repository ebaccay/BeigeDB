      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity in moat Federal Reserve districts 
appears to reflect the slower first-quarter rate of national 
economic growth. Retail sales generally are showing modest growth 
through early spring, while strength in auto sales is continuing. 
Retail inventories are viewed as generally satisfactory. Residential 
construction activity remains strong and the short-term outlook is 
optimistic. Commercial construction appears to be thriving in most 
areas. Indicators of manufacturing activity, however, are mixed. Due 
partly to international trade effects, the performance of many 
industries is weak, although steel production is increasing as is 
the demand for machine tools. Conditions remain depressed in the 
agricultural sector where downward pressures on prices, a tight cash 
flow situation, and increasing financial stress are pervasive. 
Reports on bank loan demand are mixed, both across the country and 
within individual districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales are generally reported to be showing modest growth 
through early spring. A notable exception is the Dallas district, 
where sales are reported below 1984 levels and are expected to 
remain sluggish in the near future. Some slowing in sales growth is 
reported by Boston, New York, and Cleveland, while Chicago calls 
recent sales gains "disappointing." Greater strength in retail sales 
is evident in the reports from Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta. 
Apparel sales are frequently mentioned as an area of strength, and 
auto sales are reported as continuing strong in most districts. 
Retail inventories are reported to be generally satisfactory. Strong 
growth  in tourism in the Richmond and Atlanta districts has 
contributed importantly to economic activity there.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of manufacturing activity vary considerably from district 
to district. Recent improvement is reported by New York, Cleveland, 
and Richmond. But manufacturing activity has slowed in the Boston 
district, especially in the high-technology sector which was 
formerly a rapid-growth sector. Furthermore, nearly all districts 
report significant variations among industries and among geographic 
areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Foreign trade effects continue to be very important. Atlanta reports 
that import competition is still adversely affecting its district 
industries. While growth of textile and apparel imports has recently 
slackened, increased imports of refined petroleum products are 
hurting Louisiana's petrochemical industries. Minneapolis notes that 
Ninth District pulp producers are being hurt by low foreign pulp 
prices. San Francisco reports that, due partly to vigorous foreign 
competition, forest products industries and primary metals 
industries are still the weakest sectors in the district, with a 
number of plant closings occurring in each industry. On the other 
hand, Richmond notes that coal production is off to a good start in 
1985, partly due to increased exports of metallurgical coal. And 
exports of southern pine to Europe are on the increase, according to 
the Atlanta report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel production is rising, but remains below early-1984 levels. The 
stronger demand is centered in cold-rolled and coated sheets, 
primarily for motor vehicles, appliances, and light construction. 
Cleveland notes that the steel industry remains in difficulty, 
however. Both Chicago and Cleveland report growing demand for 
machine tools, but orders are still below past levels. Cleveland 
also states that "major producers of capital goods believe spending 
on plant and equipment is not likely to be slower in the second half 
than in the first half of 1985, despite the results of the recent 
survey of spending plans."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity remains generally strong and the 
short-term outlook is generally optimistic. Builders remain 
cautious, however, with speculative building reported only by 
Atlanta. House sales seem to be keeping pace with construction in 
most instances. Strength in multifamily unit construction was noted 
particularly by Atlanta and St. Louis. But Kansas City reports 
housing starts off from a year ago, and Dallas indicates a 
continuing slide in all residential construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction appears to be thriving in most areas, 
including both Philadelphia (where vacancy rates are below the 
national average) and Chicago (where the vacancy rate is described 
as "substantial"). Atlanta cautions about potential oversupply, 
however, and Dallas reports a first- quarter decline in 
nonresidential activity as evidence of oversupply there becomes more 
apparent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the agricultural sector continue to deteriorate in 
most areas, Weak export demand and large domestic supplies 
contribute to more downward pressure on prices of farm products. A 
tight cash flow situation leads lenders to foresee increasing 
financial stress for farmers. Kansas City reports that liquidations 
and partial-liquidations of farm businesses are much higher than 
considered normal by lenders. Farmland values are still falling, off 
in Iowa by 40 percent from the previous peak. A decline in pork 
marketings has been accompanied by weaker prices, as poultry 
production increased and more pork was imported from Canada. In 
spite of large declines in corn and soybean prices, surveys show 
farmers intend to increase plantings. Minneapolis suggests that 
overproduction of dairy output is again likely. Atlanta reports 
that, even with a growing imbalance between the demand and supply of 
cotton, Sixth District farmers plan to expand cotton acreage. Kansas 
City notes that the winter wheat crop is in good to excellent 
condition, with the potential for harvesting a large crop. In spite 
of soft prices and weak exports, the condition of the more 
diversified western agriculture appears to have stopped worsening, 
according to San Francisco. And Dallas reports that cropland values 
in Texas have risen, on the average, keeping farm bankruptcy rates 
lower there than elsewhere.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth appears to be mixed across the country and within 
individual districts. Large New York City banks show relatively 
modest growth of assets, but small Second District banks have rapid 
loan growth in all categories. Philadelphia and Richmond report 
strong loan demand growth, while weakness in loans is reported by 
Cleveland and Atlanta. San Francisco cites steady loan demand and an 
improvement in loan quality, particularly among agricultural loans. 
Some districts report softness in consumer lending due to aggressive 
nonbank competition for auto loans. St. Louis notes considerable 
legislative activity on regional interstate banking, among the 
states of its district.
