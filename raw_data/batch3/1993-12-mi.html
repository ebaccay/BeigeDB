      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      While still moderate, the pace of growth in the Ninth Federal 
Reserve District appears to have picked up somewhat in late fall. 
Holiday sales are off to a strong start, following improved fall 
retail sales. Residential construction remains strong throughout the 
district, and other construction is also expanding. District 
manufacturing appears to be improving as well, and recent increases 
in gold prices are boosting metal mining. Moreover, district 
employers are hiring, and wages are stable with district business 
leaders expecting smaller price increases than they did a year ago. 
Crop production is down in the eastern portion of the district and 
up in the western portion; the situation is reversed for forest 
products, production is up in the eastern portion, but down in the 
west due to limited timber supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Holiday sales are off to a strong start, following improved fall 
retail sales. On the Friday after Thanksgiving, major Minneapolis/St 
Paul retailers reported the highest customer traffic in recent 
years, and many district retailers anticipate good holiday business. 
Moreover, sales had been strengthening prior to Thanksgiving 
weekend. At two large Minneapolis/St Paul shopping malls, sales had 
improved this fall, and a large Twin Cities retailer reported strong 
business in October and early November. A Minnesota retailer with 
stores outside the Twin Cities, however, reported weak fall sales. 
Meanwhile, in western South Dakota retail sales lately have been up 
3 percent to 5 percent from a year ago, and at a North Dakota mall 
October sales were up 8 percent from last year. In west central 
Wisconsin large retailers' fall sales were running 4 percent to 6 
percent ahead of a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Motor vehicle sales are also increasing. In North and South Dakota 
year-to-date new automobile and light truck registrations are up 
around 15 percent and 18 percent, respectively, from a year ago. In 
Minnesota they are up slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Besides buying merchandise and autos, consumers are purchasing 
homes, as residential construction remains one of the district's 
strongest sectors. Western Montana builders have enough work to keep 
them busy through the end of 1994, states an advisory council 
member, and directors and other advisory council members have 
similar reports from west-central Wisconsin, eastern North Dakota, 
South Dakota and other areas of Montana. In Minneapolis/St. Paul, 
building permits for housing were up about 15 percent in October 
from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other building is also expanding. In Minnesota and the Dakotas, the 
volume of construction contact awards, excluding residential, 
amounted to approximately $3.2 billion during the first 10 months of 
1993, a 9 percent increase from a year earlier. In Grand Forks, 
M.D., 60 construction projects are under way and Fargo, N.D., has 
even more construction projects. Meanwhile, in Eau Claire, Wis., 
businesses are acquiring spec buildings before they are completed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Across the district, manufacturing appears to be improving as well. 
In west central Wisconsin manufacturing is very strong says an 
advisory council member. In Minneapolis/St. Paul a large national 
manufacturer reports production is above last year and above 
projections for this year. In Duluth, Minn., an electronics firm 
plans expansion. In North Dakota construction equipment, food 
products, wood products and furniture manufacturers all report 
rising sales. In Rapid City, S.D., a denim clothing factory is 
opening.
     </p>
     <p>
      Plant closings, however, persist. In Duluth, Minn., a 75.year-old 
tool and horseshoe factory is closing, and in St. Paul. Minn., a 
snack food plant, employing 288, is also closing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Metal Mining and Forestry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent changes in metal prices are helping some district metal 
producers and hindering others. Increases in gold prices an spurring 
mining in South Dakota and Montana. Low aluminum prices and 
increased electricity prices could curb aluminum production in 
western Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the eastern portion of the district, forest products production 
is expanding, but declining in the west. In Montana and South Dakota 
timber cutting continues substantially below past-year levels. But 
in west central Wisconsin, output in the pulp industry is described 
as stable and hardwood production in these areas is reportedly very 
strong. Production of wood-based plywood and lumber substitutes 
continues strong in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, reflecting 
the healthy construction sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, prices and wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District employers are hiring but having some difficulty getting 
workers. A Minneapolis/St. Paul airline recently rehired 315 flight 
attendants and 240 mechanics. Many west central Wisconsin employers 
are making small additions to their work forces, and in western 
Montana and South Dakota labor markets are tight. "It's virtually 
impossible in Grand Forks to find construction workers," says a 
North Dakota advisory council member, but ample workers are still 
available for minimum wage jobs. Recently, there were 225 applicants 
in eastern North Dakota for 16 jobs paying $4.50 a hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the tightening in labor markets, directors and advisory 
council members report little change in wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consistent with stable wages, district business leaders foresee 
smaller price increases than they did a year ago. In a recent 
Minneapolis Fed poll, 54 percent of respondents expect prices over 
the next year to increase 3 percent or less, compared to 27 percent 
who gave that response a year ago. In the current poll, 41 percent 
expect a 4 percent increase in prices and only 5 percent foresee a 
greater than 4 percent increase; comparable numbers a year ago were 
48 percent and 25 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As the 1993 crop season ended, final yield data for major crops 
varied greatly. In the eastern portion of the district, corn and 
soybean production were sharply down from normal levels and wheat 
was down somewhat. But wheat was up in the west.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock output is essentially stable. Cattle slaughter continues 
slightly above and hog slaughter slightly below year-earlier levels. 
Prices remain favorable for both cattle and hog producers, and 
bankers report that livestock income is helping to stabilize farm 
finances in areas with poor crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      While farm incomes are good in Montana as a result of favorable 
production conditions and prices for wheat and cattle, they are 
generally down throughout much of the rest of the district. 
Reflecting this variation, farm spending on new machinery or 
facilities is reportedly good in Montana and western areas of North 
Dakota, but slack in most other areas, according to reports by 
advisory council members and in newspapers. Montana crop land prices 
rose about 8 percent, while pasture and range land prices reportedly 
rose about 10 percent, reflecting strong feeder cattle prices.
