      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy showed some signs of improvement in April 
although measures of current business conditions indicate just 
slight gains from the first quarter, overall. Manufacturers continue 
to report declining business, but the extent of the slowdown among 
area firms has abated recently. Retailers generally report marginal 
gains in real sales in recent weeks, an improvement from the pace of 
sales earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most sectors of the Third District economy are not experiencing any 
difficulty obtaining credit, and evidence of a "credit crunch" is 
largely confined to commercial real estate. Bankers note steady 
growth in overall loan demand; they were posting business loans at a 
somewhat greater rate in March and April than they had in the first 
two months of the year, although consumer lending was growing only 
slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is generally 
for modest growth, overall, and there is some confidence that the 
downturn in the region's industrial sector may soon be reversed. 
Among manufacturers, more foresee a rebound in the second half 
rather than further slowing. Retailers generally think they will 
continue to post real gains through the rest of the year although 
they do not expect a broad upturn in sales. Bankers expect lending 
to rise steadily, boosted by increased industrial loan demand, but 
they anticipate further constriction of real estate financing and 
only slight gains in personal lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District edged down again in 
April, but the extent or the decline among the firms surveyed 
appeared to be easing. After relatively widespread reports of 
slowing business in February and March, the number of companies that 
reported weaker activity in April only marginally exceeded the 
number noting improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although some specific indicators of industrial activity showed 
improvement in April, most continued to signal weakness. Shipments 
were increasing and new orders were inching up, reversing two months 
of decline. But other measures of business conditions were still 
falling. Managers at area plants said the increase in new orders 
from March to April was not enough to boost order backlogs, which 
continued on a nearly year-long decline. Other signs of the ongoing 
downtrend in the manufacturing sector are delivery times, which 
continued to decrease, and employment; on balance, both personnel 
and working hours were being reduced as area plants in April. Slack 
conditions in manufacturing are also reflected in stable industrial 
prices. Most local companies reported steady prices in April for 
their own products as well as for purchased inputs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, manufacturing contacts expressed some optimism 
despite lackluster current conditions. In their forecasts for the 
six months ahead, two-out-of-five expect business to pick up while 
one-in-five think the current downturn has further to run. In 
general, executives at area firms expect the decline in order 
backlogs to level off, but they do not expect business to improve 
enough in the next two quarters to increase that backlog. They do 
not foresee any improvement in employment, either; although they 
intend to hold payrolls steady, they plan further reductions in 
working hours, on balance. Some indication of a more optimistic 
outlook for business in the longer term is given by capital spending 
plans at area plants. After two months in which more companies 
reduced spending plans than increased them, scheduled expenditures 
for new plant and equipment were being boosted marginally in April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the Third District in March and the first half of 
April were marginally above sales in the same period last year, in 
real terms, according to area merchants, and most of those contacted 
in late April said sales appeared to be continuing on a trend of 
slight but steady real growth. Sales of spring apparel and other 
seasonal items have been meeting most retailers' expectations, and 
without recourse to deep price markdowns. Several merchants also 
mentioned a continuing healthy sales pace for furniture and home 
furnishings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The general tone of the forecasts being made by Third District 
retailers is for very modest real growth during the rest of the 
year. Several described the immediate outlook as unsettled due to 
financial turmoil in the industry and heightened caution among 
consumers. In their own planning, store executives are looking for 
niches of opportunities to expand sales; they do not expect sales to 
grow across a broad range of goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at major Third District banks in late March was 
approximately 17 percent above the level for the same time last 
year, and bankers contacted in late April said overall loan growth 
was continuing at about this pace. Third District bankers generally 
reported increased loan demand from builders and developers, and, 
although they are approving new loans selectively, they are being 
more cautious about real estate lending in light of increased 
regulatory concern and evidence of softening markets both for office 
space and for residential development.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lending officers at commercial banks in the District say business 
loan demand is picking up somewhat from the first quarter, and some 
note an increase in requests for funds to finance capital 
investments in the manufacturing sector. Also mentioned was 
increased loan demand from construction firms engaged in road and 
bridge building in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer loan growth was described as sluggish by most bankers 
surveyed for this report. Some noted what they considered seasonal 
increases in utilization of credit cards and home equity credit 
lines, but most said overall personal lending was not growing 
appreciably.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District bankers generally expect overall loan 
growth to continue as about its current pace. They believe business 
lending may accelerate, with the expansion mainly in loans to 
manufacturers; but they expect loan volume outstanding to builders 
and developers to remain at current levels or decline, and lending 
to wholesalers and retailers to show little growth. Lending to 
individuals, both for consumption expenditures and for home 
mortgages is expected to rise only marginally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers note that, with a few exceptions, they are restricting 
commercial real estate financing to current customers and limiting 
the amount of new money extended to them; but they say a general 
restriction of credit--such as is implied by a "credit crunch"--is 
not being implemented. Creditworthy industrial firms are generally 
finding their requests for funds well-received, according to both 
bankers and businessmen. However, some entrepreneurs with very small 
or start-up businesses say they have been experiencing somewhat 
greater difficulty obtaining funds in recent months, and there are 
some indications that apparel manufacturers' requests for loans are 
receiving greater scrutiny in light of the financial difficulties of
certain retailers to whom they sell.
