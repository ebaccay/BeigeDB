     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy is growing slowly. Manufacturing expansion 
appears to have ebbed. Retail sales are increasing moderately, but 
more slowly than earlier in the year. Auto sales have dipped. 
Construction activity continues to show signs of a modest recovery. 
The oil and gas drilling upturn is still in place. Prices paid to 
District agriculturalists reached their highest August levels since 
1980, but crop yields are down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders to District manufacturers are showing slight growth, but 
there is great variation across industries. Although weakness in 
construction and automobile manufacturing have made stone, clay and 
glass sales sluggish, expansions in chemical plants are stimulating 
some demand increases along the Gulf Coast. Firms in the stone, clay 
and glass industry that supply construction are optimistic about 
rising demand in the coming months. Lumber and wood products firms 
say that sagging homebuilding activity has lately pushed down orders 
and they do not expect a recovery in the near future. Producers of 
primary metals generally cite slowing sales, slipping prices and 
increased foreign competition as recent problems. Nevertheless, 
orders for a variety of cast-metal products are picking up. Sales by 
fabricated metals producers have been expanding moderately. Demand 
for oilfield equipment has risen somewhat during 1989. Further 
increases are anticipated and some firms expect to increase their 
product prices later this year. The very recent patterns of demand 
for electronics varies widely among products but generally, orders 
have softened. Past shortages of D-Ram chips have ended, and demand 
and prices have dipped. In the computer industry, some upper-end 
products remain in strong demand, but lower-end personal computers 
are said to be selling poorly. Chemical firms report some slippage 
in sales and product prices, and they say that inventories are 
somewhat higher than desired. Sales at paper and allied products 
companies are stable but remain a little below a year earlier. For 
apparel firms, demand has remained fairly consistent in 1989, and 
sales remain above a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales growth has slowed somewhat from earlier this year. 
Stores specializing in apparel cite strong year-over-year increases 
in sales, while some stores selling other merchandise had less 
positive reports. Recent expansion in retail sales appears to be 
strong in south Texas and the Houston area. West Texas sales are 
soft. Retailers are generally optimistic about the future, but they 
are cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are generally weak in the District, but moderate year-
over-year expansion is reported for the Houston area. Dealers are 
not optimistic about sales growth for the next few months and some 
mentioned the likelihood of substantial rebates for the 1990 models.
     </p>
     <p>
      The construction industry is maintaining a mild, but persistent 
recovery. Nonresidential construction has generated nearly all of 
the gains, and most nonresidential growth is in plant construction. 
The value of nonbuilding construction, which includes highways and 
water and sewer systems, has been declining. Residential building 
shows little change overall, but some expansion has recently 
occurred in New Mexico, At the same time, declines have taken place 
in Louisiana. Multifamily residential construction activity 
continues to be very weak in much of the District. Multifamily 
permits in New Mexico have been greater than those in Texas and 
Louisiana combined. The rate at which residential building permits 
are issued is essentially unchanged across the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The oil and gas industry continues to recover at a modest rate. 
After dipping in July, the District rig count increased again in 
August. Drilling in Texas posted year-over-year growth for the first 
time since June 1988, but drilling in Louisiana and New Mexico is 
still below year-earlier levels. The seismic crew count, considered 
to be a leading indicator of drilling activity, edged up slightly in 
July after four consecutive months of decline. Also in July, 
District oil and gas extraction employment grew strongly. The spot 
price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased in the first 
half of August and has since remained at nearly $19 per barrel. 
Employment in oil and gas extraction in the District grew strongly
in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      In August, District agricultural product prices rose to their 
highest level for an August since 1980â€”largely as the result of 
rising livestock prices. Overall, farm product prices were up 5 
percent from a year earlier and 2 percent from July. Rising 
livestock prices were dominated by sharp increases in beef cattle 
prices. Hog, sheep, and broiler prices fell. Crop prices were 3 
percent above a year earlier and were unchanged from July. 
Harvesting is well underway throughout the District, but production 
estimates for many crops are below last year's. Estimates for cotton 
and winter wheat are down particularly hard, but production of corn, 
hay, sorghum and soybeans is expected to increase. Moisture 
conditions have generally improved in the District, but central and 
south Texas remain dry.
