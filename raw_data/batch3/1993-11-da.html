      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 3, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace in 
September and October. Wages were reported to have risen at a few 
companies, and several industries indicated that they had begun to 
hire. Some industries reported that they had increased their selling 
prices, but other industries said that competition continued to hold 
down prices. Manufacturing and business service contacts reported 
increased orders and activity. Retail sales continued to increase 
slowly. Homebuilding remained strong, and contacts reported a recent 
pickup in commercial projects. Energy industry activity continued to 
expand at a slow pace. Bankers reported that lending was slow. 
Agricultural production was mixed. Some parts of the District 
sported good crop production, while other areas still suffer from 
too much moisture.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers reported a slow increase in demand and 
employment. Electronics contacts reported that their companies are 
hiring in response to continued increases in demand. Sales remained 
strong for construction-related products such as lumber, cement and 
brick, and prices have begun to rise. Contacts reported strong glass 
sales to both construction and automobile industries. Demand for 
paper products remained strong and some companies reported that they 
are hiring. Primary and fabricated metal producers reported that 
demand remains above last year's pace and some selling prices were 
increasing slightly. Demand for refined products has been better 
than expected and is slightly ahead of last year. Continued 
overcapacity is expected to keep refining margins weak. The chemical 
market continued to see modest volume increases and weak prices. 
Foreign demand was reported to remain a source of weakness for 
chemical producers. Oil machinery and service companies reported 
strong seasonal increases in demand. Sales of food and kindred 
products are reported to have remained strong, leading some 
manufacturers to increase wages and hiring. Prices for some food 
products have risen. Demand has increased for some apparel products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business service contacts reported that sales have increased and 
some companies say they are hiring. Prices, however, remained very 
competitive. Several service respondents said that their customers 
are still downsizing and working to increase productivity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers reported that sales continued to increase slowly in 
September and October. Sales in Houston and along the Mexico border 
are reported to be slower than the rest of the District. Retailers 
say that prices have been unchanged or lower because the industry 
continues to be very competitive. Retailers were generally 
optimistic that sales would continue to increase through the end of 
the year. District auto sales increased in September and were above 
last September's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      A recent pickup in commercial construction projects has excited 
respondents, although activity remained at very low levels. Housing 
construction continued to be strong in most major cities with the 
exception of Houston. San Antonio, Austin and Dallas were still the 
strongest residential markets although contacts reported that home 
building was "booming" in Amarillo and El Paso. Respondents reported 
that resent increases in the price of labor, cement and brick have 
led to higher prices for new homes. Office real estate markets 
remained unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      District energy activity continued to expand slowly. After slipping 
below $17 per barrel in mid-September, oil prices improved steadily 
to $18.50 per barrel in mid-October. Offshore drilling in the Gulf 
of Mexico remains near capacity levels. Most offshore and other 
domestic drilling has been for natural gas. Natural gas prices have 
declined recently but remain relatively strong compared to last 
year, above $2.00 per thousand cubic feet. The U.S. rig count has 
stalled at about 860 working rigs but contacts are confident that 
there will be a normal seasonal increase in drilling through 
December.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers reported that loan demand has been slow. Demand for 
residential mortgages continued to be a bright spot but commercial 
loan demand remained below expectations. Demand for consumer 
installment credit increased but has been very competitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural production has been mixed. Crop production is reported 
to be good in parts of the District while some areas still suffer 
from too much moisture. Excess world supplies have lowered most crop 
prices and the Texas September All Crops Price Index was 8.3 percent 
below a year ago. Contacts report that damaged crops and low prices 
have led many District farmers to carry a heavy debt load. The 
September Livestock and Livestock Products Price Index increased 2.1 
percent above last year's level. Texas cattle and calves on feed for 
the slaughter market increased in September to the largest inventory 
on record.
