      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic developments in the Second District remained mixed in 
recent weeks, but seemed slightly more positive, on balance, than in 
the last report. October sales at most District department stores 
were reported to be on or above targeted levels though results 
varied widely. Homebuilders in most of the District noted some 
recent improvement in the residential construction market, and 
office leasing activity has been relatively strong in midtown 
Manhattan. District unemployment rates improved in October but 
nonfarm employment has continued to decline. Reports from Buffalo 
purchasing managers showed a worsening in both production and new 
orders during November following an improvement in October. Loan 
officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change in their 
willingness to lend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results varied widely at District department stores during 
October but most were reported to be on or above targeted levels. 
Due in part to special attractions such as storewide promotionals 
and the opening of remodeled floors, the majority of the stores had 
over-the-year gains in October, which ranged from 0.5-11.0 percent. 
However, one chain reported a year-to-year decline. Categories of 
merchandise registering the strongest increases were most types of 
women's apparel, cosmetics and men's sportswear. Two respondents 
noted a pickup in furniture sales as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are generally at satisfactory levels and, indeed, a 
little below plan in some areas where sales were stronger than 
anticipated. With regard to the holiday season, most contacts 
anticipate somewhat larger year-to-year gains than occurred last 
year "but nothing spectacular".
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in most of the District reported some recent 
improvement in the residential construction market. Several contacts 
spoke of increased traffic and an upturn in sales, spurred in part 
by the low level of interest rates and the desire to buy before 
mortgage rates rise. Buyers remain cautious, however, in the wake of 
continued layoffs and uncertainty about the economic outlook. Starts 
are expected to top last year's low level in most areas though the 
extent varies from "by quite a bit" in some upstate New York 
communities to "not by a lot" in downstate New York and New Jersey. 
Obtaining loans for acquisition and construction is still reportedly 
difficult in much of the District and one respondent stated that the 
problem is worsening rather than improving in his area.
     </p>
     <p>
      In recent weeks, office leasing activity has been relatively strong 
in midtown Manhattan where for the first nine months of this year 
the footage leased was some 23 percent above the year-earlier level. 
In downtown Manhattan, however, the pace of leasing has been slower 
and for the first nine months totaled little more than in 1991. As a 
result, while the primary vacancy rate in midtown Manhattan has been 
declining, the downtown vacancy rate has risen and by October, 
according to one source, a two percentage point difference existed 
between the two rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates improved somewhat in October as New 
Jersey's rate fell to 8.1 percent from 9.0 percent in September and 
New York's to 8.7 percent, also from 9.0 percent. However, nonfarm 
employment has continued to decline in both states though the pace 
of loss may have moderated. Regarding the outlook, the employment 
impact of Martin Marietta's intended purchase of G.E. Aerospace, 
which has offices and operations in several District locations, 
remains uncertain. Furthermore, Grumman plans to cut 500 more jobs 
on Long Island by the end of March, related to the closing of its 
aircraft factory, and in upstate New York, Miller Brewing will cut 
180 jobs early next year. On the positive side, an automotive 
transmission plant in the Syracuse area just hired new production 
workers for the first time since 1986 and might add more in response 
to increased product demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two other developments which could have a positive impact on the 
District are noteworthy. Farmers in the West reportedly are now 
receiving shipments of some of New York City's treated sludge to 
fertilize crops, restore depleted croplands and curb erosion, which 
helps lessen the City's sizable waste-disposal problem. In addition, 
two new, employee-owned airlines have recently begun offering low-
cost, unrestricted flights from Newark to various Florida 
destinations, adding to the growth of this rapidly developing 
airport.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Buffalo purchasing managers showed a worsening in both 
production and new orders during November following a substantial 
improvement in October. More generally, our District manufacturing 
contacts indicated continuing weak economic activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks 
in the Second District indicated that they are as willing to lend as 
they were two months ago. Although residential mortgage demand 
continued strong during the last two months, consumer loan demand 
weakened and demand for nonresidential mortgages remained soft. A 
slight improvement in commercial and industrial loan demand was 
partly attributed to seasonal factors. In light of continued 
weakness in overall loan demand, several officers reported an 
increase in the use of advertising campaigns.
     </p>
     <p>
      All respondents reported either maintaining or lowering loan rates. 
A majority of officers indicated that delinquency rates for 
mortgages and consumer loans were unchanged or lower during the 
preceding two months.
