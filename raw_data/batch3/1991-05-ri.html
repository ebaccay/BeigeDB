      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 1, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District business and financial conditions apparently improved in 
March and early April. Commercial and industrial loan demand, 
housing starts and sales, and tourist activity all rose. Consumer 
spending and manufacturing activity were steady, after several 
months of decline, and export activity outpaced import activity at 
District ports. The return of military personnel boosted some local 
economies, and agricultural conditions remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to our regular survey of retailers suggested that retail 
activity was steady in recent weeks. Retailers reported little 
change in sales and shopper traffic, although over half believed 
that the end of the Gulf War benefited sales. Employment apparently 
decreased slightly, while wholesale and retail prices evidently 
increased somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers expressed optimism about their prospects in coming months. 
Over three-fourths expected their traffic and sales to rise. On 
balance, survey respondents expected retail employment to increase 
in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our survey of manufacturers indicated that District factory activity 
remained stable in past weeks. Respondents reported little change in 
shipments, orders, and order backlogs but noted increases in export 
orders. One-fourth said the conclusion of the Gulf war had led to 
improved sales, while most of the rest indicated that the war's end 
had had no effect on their businesses. Most manufacturers noted no 
change in the costs of their raw materials or in the prices of their 
finished products. Manufacturers' inventories of raw materials and 
finished goods and manufacturing employment apparently declined over 
the survey period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers' forecasts for the coming months were quite 
optimistic. Nearly three-fourths believed shipments and new orders 
would increase over the next six months; only a few foresaw a 
decline. Similarly, three-fourths of the respondents expected 
conditions in their local areas and in the nation to improve in the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports -- Baltimore, Charleston, Hampton 
Roads (Norfolk) -- indicated that exports are generally unchanged in 
March from February and that imports were generally lower. Compared 
with a year ago, export activity was higher and import activity was 
lower. Port representatives expected exports to increase faster than 
imports throughout the spring and summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of residential home builders and realtors 
suggested that housing activity rose moderately in recent weeks. 
Over two-thirds of the builders reported increased customer 
interest. Most of these builders attributed the heightened interest 
to greater consumer confidence and to the return of U.S. military 
personnel. A few builders said that lower interest rates contributed 
to the rise in shopper interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Half of the builders reported that housing starts increased in the 
last month; only a few said that starts declined. Builders noted 
that almost all homes were built under contract rather than for 
speculative purposes and that most of these homes were in the middle 
price range.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of realtors indicated that home sales in their local 
areas increased in the last month, while the remainder noted no 
change. Realtors commented that sales of owner-occupied homes 
exceeded sales of new homes. Almost half of the realtors said that 
middle-priced homes sold most readily, while slightly fewer said 
that lower-priced homes had been the easiest to sell. Home prices 
appeared to be stable across all price ranges.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of District hotels, motels, and resorts indicated 
that tourist activity improved in March from February and was better 
than in recent springs. Most respondents experienced increased 
bookings and attributed them to the end of the Gulf war, good 
weather, and returning customers. A majority of tourist industry 
representatives expected tourist activity to increase in coming 
months. Other District contacts confirmed this upbeat picture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of District financial institutions suggested no 
change in commercial and industrial loans closed compared with 
recent weeks. Demand for new loans, however, apparently picked up. 
Half of the lenders reported flat loan demand, but most of the rest 
reported an increase. Lenders attributed the increase to "bottled-up 
demand," the resolution of the Gulf war, and prospects for improved 
economic conditions. Respondents reported that borrowers were 
primarily larger, established customers rather than smaller, new 
businesses. Interest rates on loans apparently changed little over 
the survey period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most financial institutions reported that the delinquency rate on 
their loans stayed about the same or decreased in recent weeks. 
Lenders cautioned, however, that the improvement in delinquency 
rates may have reflected stronger collection efforts rather than 
improved economic conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Return of Troops
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The return of military personnel from the Gulf boosted economic 
activity, especially in areas near military bases. Business leaders 
indicated that economic activity -- particularly sales of homes, 
cars, and other big-ticket items -- in military-dependent areas had 
not yet returned to pre-conflict levels, but that retail traffic was 
up sharply. One respondent reported that apartments in his area were 
fully occupied in contrast to the 30 percent vacancy rate in early 
March. Other contacts reported a pickup in hiring activity and a 
drop in unemployment insurance claims.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Generally favorable weather led to active planting in early April 
according to District farm analysts. Corn planting was ahead of a 
year ago in most parts of the District, and vegetable and melon 
crops were on schedule in the Carolinas. Small grains were in good 
condition because of favorable temperatures and moisture, but some 
areas reported powdery mildew in wheat. Peaches and apples were in 
bloom, and no substantial frost damage was reported.
