      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance economic developments seemed slightly more positive in 
recent weeks, although some negative reports continued to be 
received. Most District retailers had sales results that were either 
on or better than plan in November and December. Solid gains were 
posted for apparel of all types, and year-end inventories were 
described as generally in good shape. Unemployment rates in New York 
and New Jersey continued their seesaw pattern but are somewhat lower 
than their October levels. Office leasing activity proceeded at a 
fairly good pace in midtown Manhattan but remained sluggish in 
downtown Manhattan. Meanwhile, downtown Buffalo recorded the first 
decline in its office vacancy rate in four years, and a larger 
percentage of Buffalo purchasing managers reported higher new orders 
and/or production. Homebuilding activity was relatively slow, but 
new home sales were generally above year-earlier levels. Most senior 
loan officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change in 
their willingness to lend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retail contacts reported sales results that were in 
line with or better than projections in November and December. A 
severe storm closed District stores for one or two days in mid-
December due to hurricane-force winds, widespread flooding and heavy 
snows, but apparently sales were recouped, at least in part, during 
the remainder of the month. While the sales environment has remained 
highly competitive, retailers stated that they engaged in less 
promotional activity and price-cutting than during the 1991 holiday 
season with somewhat higher profit margins as a result. Most 
contacts noted more enthusiasm and a less conservative attitude on
the part of consumers, but our contacts were reluctant to assert 
that a turning point has been reached. Over-the-year sales changes 
ranged from -9 percent to +8.5 percent in November and from flat to 
+12.5 percent in December. The Retail Council of New York State's 
annual survey of about 200 stores found sales gains averaging 6 to 8 
percent above the 1991 level for the post-Thanksgiving through post-
Christmas period.
     </p>
     <p>
      A wide variety of merchandise sold well during November and December 
though reportedly the best sellers were practical items such as cold 
weather gear (especially after the December storm), furniture, rugs, 
and accessories. Children's books, video games and remote control 
toys were also popular.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity has been relatively slow in most of the 
District due both to the season and to the unwillingness of 
potential buyers in some areas to commit themselves given their 
continuing uncertainty about jobs and the economy. For 1992 as a 
whole, new home sales were generally above the sluggish, year-
earlier levels with the gains varying widely within the District. 
Most builders anticipate some further improvement in 1993. Renewed 
sales activity was reported at previously stalled projects in 
Westchester County and central New Jersey. Developers intend to 
expand these projects if buyer interest continues. Restoration and 
rebuilding of homes that were damaged or destroyed in a severe 
December storm will provide a further impetus to building activity, 
especially in flood-ravaged coastal areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity continued at a fairly good pace in midtown 
Manhattan, but has remained sluggish downtown. Vacancy rates moved 
up in both parts of Manhattan. Net absorption of space remained 
negative as a result of the completion of a new office building in 
midtown and the continuing additions of existing space in the 
downtown market due to corporate restructurings. An annual survey of 
office space in downtown Buffalo found an almost three percentage 
point decline in the vacancy rate between year-end 1991 and 1992. 
Although the rate remains high, this was the first decrease in four 
years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates continued their seesaw pattern since the 
last report, but on balance declined somewhat. In December, New 
Jersey's unemployment rate was 8.0 percent, down from 8.7 percent in 
November, but New York's was 8.4 percent, up from 8.0 percent one 
month earlier. However, both rates are somewhat below their October 
levels. Although District payroll employment has not shown any real 
improvement, personal income tax receipts in New Jersey and payroll 
income data in New York show good to moderately strong growth, 
suggesting that the District's economy may be somewhat stronger than 
indicated by the employment statistics.
     </p>
     <p>
      The survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed an increase in the 
percentage of firms with improved new orders and/or production 
during December. Fifty-nine percent of the surveyed managers expect 
an improvement in general business conditions during the new year, 
compared to only 18 percent a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two recently announced corporate restructurings will affect District 
employment. In the initial implementation of its plan to cut 
employment by 25,000 in 1993, IBM said 3000-3500 jobs will be 
eliminated at three of its Hudson Valley plants at the end of March. 
While voluntary incentive packages will be offered, layoffs may 
occur as well On the other hand, a Long Island firm plans to close 
an out-of-District plant and consolidate its operations on the 
Island, adding 300 workers this year and several hundred more in the 
future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District indicated that their willingness to lend has not 
changed over the last two months. The majority of respondents 
indicated that overall loan demand remained slow. The demand for 
residential mortgages weakened as refinancing activity softened. 
However, the demand for commercial and industrial loans improved 
slightly. Almost all respondents reported that their loan rates had 
not changed during the preceding two months. Delinquency rues for 
all types of loans were unchanged to slightly lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to recent media reports and editorials urging an easing 
in the "regulatory burden" on banks in order to simulate lending, 
almost all loan officers indicated that capital requirements were 
not constraining their lending. However, several lenders at small 
and midsized banks suggested that reductions in the number of 
regulations and in the amount of time spent complying with them 
would permit them to initiate more loans.
