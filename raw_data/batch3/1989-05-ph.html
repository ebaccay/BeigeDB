      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 3, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from most sectors of the Third District economy in mid-April 
suggest little growth overall in the past two months. Manufacturers 
in general indicate that business has been just steady, although 
nondurable goods producers note a pickup in April. Retailers report 
only slight year-over-year gains in total sales for March and April, 
and an actual decline in sales of big-ticket items in recent weeks. 
Auto dealers say sales slipped in March and continue to run below 
the annual selling rate achieved earlier in the year. Bankers 
generally report that overall loan growth continues at a healthy 
pace, but several major banks note some easing in the rate at which 
they are adding to the volume of commercial and industrial loans 
outstanding. Deposit growth continues to run below targeted rates at 
many banks, but none indicate that they are restricting asset growth 
due to funding constraints. Several banks have gained new funds with 
promotions of 18-to-24-month certificates of deposit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District business contacts see only slight 
improvement, at best. Manufacturers expect only steady business over 
the next six months. Retailers expect dollar sales for the spring 
and summer to run even with or just marginally above the same period 
last year, and auto dealers anticipate unit sales for all of 1989 to 
fall as much as 10 percent below last year. Bankers expect overall 
loan growth to stay close to its current pace, but they anticipate 
some slackening in the expansion of commercial and industrial 
lending in the second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the Third District industrial sector appears to be 
easing to a steady pace. Just over half of the manufacturers 
contacted in late March and early April reported that business was 
stable, and the number noting improvement barely exceeded the number 
indicating that their business was slowing. Reports of improvement 
were common among nondurable goods producers while most makers of 
durables said business has been flat in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, executives at area industrial firms generally noted modest 
increases in new orders and a fractional rise in shipments but no 
change in order backlogs during March. On balance, area firms are 
permitting inventories to run down for the fourth month in a row. 
Employment is holding up as area manufacturing firms added 
marginally to payrolls during March.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices in the region continue to rise. Nearly half of the 
manufacturers contacted in April said input costs moved up from a 
month earlier and one-quarter raised the prices of the products they 
make. The increases do not appear to be accelerating, however, as 
reports of higher prices are not quite as widespread now as they 
were over the winter. Nevertheless, local manufacturers generally 
expect continued upward price pressure.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, local manufacturers see virtually steady conditions 
over the next six months. About a third of those polled in April 
expect improvement while nearly as many anticipate slower business 
between now and October. On balance, managers at area plants foresee 
modest growth in new orders and shipments, but they expect order 
backlogs to remain steady and they plan to work inventories down 
further from current levels. On the employment front, industrial 
firms in the region plan to maintain payrolls at current levels, but 
they may make some reductions in the workweek during the spring and 
summer. On balance, local firms continue to schedule hikes in 
capital spending, although there are increasing reports of projects 
being postponed, especially in heavy industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in mid-April generally indicated 
that sales for March and early April were only slightly above sales 
for the same period last year, on a current dollar basis. While some 
stores, particularly those selling upscale goods, reported 
satisfactory year-over-year growth, many merchants describe the 
current situation as "difficult." Several retailers noted that sales 
of big-ticket items have edged down recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Store officials expect dollar sales for the balance of the spring 
and summer to run about even with or marginally above the year-ago 
pace, but they are concerned that consumers could grow cautious in 
the months immediately ahead if economic news is not good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor costs are still considered a problem by Third District 
merchants as the pool of qualified job applicants, especially in 
suburban areas, remains well below retailers' needs. Several large 
discount chains have announced plans to enter the region, and local 
merchants expect the competition for workers to be as intense as the 
competition for customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers report that sales slipped in March and 
remain below the annual selling rate recorded earlier this year. 
Import dealers have suffered a worse decline than domestic dealers 
have, but the domestic dealers note that sales of light trucks, 
which had been strong for the past few years, have fallen off 
recently. Despite the introduction of rebates and incentive 
financing by the manufacturers, area dealers expect unit sales for 
this year to be as much as 10 percent below last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks at the 
end of March was 13 percent above March 1988, marking a year of 
steady growth. Real estate lending remains the fastest growing major 
loan category. Commercial and industrial lending is growing at a 
healthy rate, according to bankers contacted in mid-April, although 
they note some slowing from the growth rate recorded in the first 
quarter. Consumer lending is expanding but at a slower pace than 
other loan categories, and bankers believe growth may ease further.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total deposits at large Third District banks at the end of March 
were 8 percent above the March 1988 level, with demand deposits 
virtually unchanged from a year ago and other checkable deposits up 
about 5 percent. Bankers report that growth in the volume of money 
market deposit accounts has eased substantially since January while 
time deposits continue to expand at a good pace. Several banks are 
promoting certificates of deposit with maturities up to two years, 
and they are obtaining significant amounts of new funds at less than 
50 basis points above the federal funds rate.
