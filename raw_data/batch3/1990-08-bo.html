      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, second-quarter growth at First District firms was slow 
and slowing. Retailers and wholesalers reported soft sales and 
intense price competition. They emphasized recent efforts to prune 
costs by reducing inventories. A majority of manufacturers continued 
to achieve year-to-year growth in sales, but the gains were often 
entirely attributable to exports. At many firms domestic sales were 
flat to down from year-ago levels, and incoming orders were slowing. 
Realtors interpreted a recent pickup in residential sales as very 
largely seasonal. Most businesses expect weak conditions to continue 
through 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers and wholesalers in the First District continued to report 
soft sales. About half the sample (primarily firms selling clothing, 
sporting goods, and drug-store items) achieved modest sales growth. 
They usually attributed these gains to increased promotional 
activities or to obtaining a larger market share because of weaker 
competitors' difficulties. For the remainder, sales were generally 
down several percent compared to year-ago levels for clothing and 
home items and were sharply lower for some specialty goods. This 
group of merchants also stressed that competitive pressures were 
leading to lower margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts have attempted to prune costs, especially by reducing 
inventories. They reported supply prices rising by 0 to 4 percent 
and modest wage increases. Some other costs, including fringe 
benefits, are rising more rapidly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Half the respondents mentioned reduced availability of bank credit 
as a problem either for their own business or for other area 
businesses. The remainder indicated that they had had no problems 
obtaining required inventory financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      A couple of large retailers are planning for a stronger fall season. 
The majority did not see any good news on the horizon, however, and 
expect continued weak sales for the foreseeable future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Domestic shipments were flat to down from year-ago levels at just 
over half of First District manufacturers contacted. Declines ranged 
from 1 to 10 percent. Exports performed considerably better than 
domestic sales at most respondents. Accordingly, total sales 
including exports were above mid-1989 levels at more than half of 
the firms surveyed. Reported gains varied from 3 to 20 percent. New 
orders were generally described as flat, down, or slowing. Along 
with exports, niche and new products performed reasonably well. By 
contrast, domestic demand for office products, construction- and 
computer-related items, machine tools, instruments and consumer 
goods was relatively weak. Reports on incoming orders from the 
aerospace and auto companies were mixed. Manufacturers continue to 
watch inventories carefully, but few report any excessive buildups.
     </p>
     <p>
      Materials prices were generally stable or down slightly from year-
ago levels. Selling prices are flat to down at two-thirds of the 
firms contacted, with two offering discounts of 8 to 20 percent. At 
the remainder, recent or planned price increases average 2 to 5 
percent, but one firm plans a price rise of 9 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment remains at mid-1989 levels at over half of the 
manufacturers contacted. The remainder have reduced employment by as 
much as 10 to 15 percent through layoffs, attrition and shorter 
hours. Wages are above year-ago levels by 3 1/2 to 7 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two-thirds of First District manufacturing contacts are increasing 
capital spending from 1989 levels, with increases ranging from 7 to 
50 percent. For the rest, capital expenditures are as much as 40 
percent below 1989 levels. Spending plans focus on equipment, 
primarily computer systems, expected to improve productivity or 
needed for new products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixty percent of First District manufacturers describe their outlook 
as very cautious. They generally foresee "tough" conditions lasting 
into 1991, but they are counting on exports, new products, or price 
increases to support their firms over the next 12 months. The 
remaining respondents are modestly optimistic. They too are looking 
for exports and new products to buoy sales. Nevertheless, an 
anticipated pickup in demand from the auto and computer industries 
is crucial to their expectations. Most contacts express more 
confidence about the prospects for their own firms than for the 
economy as a whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District realtors report a recent seasonal upturn. Sales are 
said to be roughly the same as this time last year in a market 
characterized as soft. Prices are falling, and inventories are 
large. Several realtors noted a slight pickup in condominium sales. 
Realtors link the industry outlook to the state of the regional 
economy and the coverage it receives in the press. They report that 
consumer confidence is now low because of uncertainty about interest 
rates and slow economic growth.
