      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Southeast remain healthy on balance, and 
the outlook in several key sectors seems bright. Retail sales in 
August grew faster than nationally and compared to last year. The 
pace of residential building and sales or leasing in many regional 
markets continues to be brisk although multi-family and office 
construction are showing signs of excess supply. Bank lending, 
particularly to consumers, appears to have stabilized after 
decelerating appreciably earlier this year. Tourism business has 
been strong in most localities; however, Hurricane Elena drastically 
reduced tourist spending during the Labor Day weekend. The main 
areas of weakness are locally important industries, such as 
textiles, apparel, petrochemicals, and agriculture. The enervation 
of the region's manufacturing base is being felt in labor markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to weaken in July. Primarily because labor 
force growth exceeded job gains, unemployment rates worsened in 
every District state. Total employment growth more than offset 
continuing job losses in the hard-hit apparel, textile, and 
petrochemical industries. Despite its problems, the textile 
industry's capital spending plans are up slightly from last year. 
Expenditures will be applied primarily to new equipment. As a result 
of reduced demand for phosphate fertilizer and low prices, Florida 
phosphate mine operators have recently furloughed workers and 
shortened the workweek. Imports of low-priced chemicals and reduced 
activity in the domestic metals industry are having an adverse 
effect on Louisiana's petrochemical industry. To meet current 
demand, producers are drawing down inventories rather than 
increasing production. More positively, the drop in natural gas 
prices is benefiting local producers of ammonia, for which natural 
gas is a feedstock. The outlook for the region's forest products 
industry has also improved. Contacts note that prices have 
stabilized and that inventories are not excessive at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in August were up from a year earlier as consumers 
responded favorably to heavy promotional efforts by retailers to 
move back-to-school items and remaining summer merchandise. Sales at 
regional department stores, especially those in Alabama, Florida, 
and Georgia, continue to advance at an above-national average pace. 
Merchants say that inventory levels are acceptable but they are 
closely monitoring their stocks. Although new orders are being 
planned cautiously, most retailers surveyed are optimistic that 
sales growth will be healthy over the remaining months of 1985 and 
generally expect year-over-year increases to be in the 3 to 10 
percent range. After surging dramatically in late August, the 
region's car sales are widely expected to remain on the rise in the 
second half of 1985, either matching or slightly surpassing last 
year's performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential building shows mixed signs across the Southeast. 
Condominium markets generally are depressed as a result of excessive 
supply and low interest rates that enable first-time buyers to 
purchase the more popular single-family dwellings. Recent 
sluggishness in the Florida economy has adversely affected housing 
in the state, and inventories continue to accumulate in the New 
Orleans market. In contrast, cumulative residential permits in 
Atlanta through July were running about even with last year, well 
above the expectations of many industry analysts. The pace of sales 
and construction in Birmingham remains steady, and contacts express 
satisfaction with the inventory of single-family homes. Except in 
New Orleans, southeastern office markets continue to show strength. 
Atlanta, Miami, and Nashville are experiencing an improvement in 
leasing, although there are signs of overbuilding in Atlanta.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional bank loan growth stabilized somewhat during the summer 
after slowing substantially from January to May. This pattern is due 
primarily to a resurgence in consumer credit demand; real estate and 
especially business lending have continued to decelerate. However, 
the strength of business and real estate lending varies widely 
across the District. The market in Atlanta, for example, is healthy, 
whereas those in Miami and New Orleans are weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Summer air travel was up, according to data from major regional 
airlines and many airports, and advance bookings for fall look 
strong. In contrast, auto travel, as measured by visitor center 
registration, fell in July. However, the latter might reflect the 
one-time effects of last year's World's Fair. Hotel occupancies and 
receipts in major cities continue to lag behind year-earlier levels 
because of recent expansions in supply. However, some Florida 
contacts report modest improvement in occupancy despite the surfeit 
of new rooms, and reservations for the remainder of this and next 
year portend improvement in Atlanta's large convention market. Most 
attractions polled have experienced increased attendance compared to 
last year, and the pace accelerated in August. However, Hurricane 
Elena had an adverse impact on Florida and Gulf Coast tourism during 
the important Labor Day weekend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The hurricane and related weather which struck Mississippi 
apparently did little damage to crops in that state. Prospects for 
crops this growing season remain in favorable throughout the 
District as high yields appear likely. Nevertheless, much lower 
prices this year and less production of some crops may cause net 
farm income to fall from 1984. In addition, lower production and/or 
prices may result in a decline in gross income in the animal 
products industry. Financial distress also remains a concern. The 
Federal Land Bank of Jackson, Mississippi, which holds approximately 
$3 billion in real estate loans in Mississippi, Louisiana, and 
Alabama, may experience a year-end loss for the first time since the 
1930s.
