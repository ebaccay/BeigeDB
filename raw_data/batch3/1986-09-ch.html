      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 10, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District's economic performance continues to lag the 
nation, with no evidence of either a drop-off or an acceleration in 
the pace of overall activity. Total employment in the five District 
states has been about flat since early this year, with losses of 
manufacturing jobs about equaled by increases in other sectors. 
Consumer spending and residential building continue relatively 
strong. However, domestic automakers recently pared production plans 
as inventories of some models became excessive. Commercial 
construction continues at a high level, but important new projects 
have been postponed indefinitely. Most lines of mechanical capital 
goods remain weak. Labor disputes have cut output of steel and 
construction equipment. Bumper grain crops are exerting downward 
pressure on prices, and are expected to strain available storage 
capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Negotiations
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor-management negotiations in the District in 1986 have been more 
prolonged and heated than in recent years in steel, construction 
equipment, meat packing, building trades, and local government. 
Workers in distressed industries are strongly resisting pay and 
benefit cuts. Unions are demanding job security guarantees. 
Managements are pushing for changes in restrictive work rules. Work 
stoppages have halted production to a greater extent than in recent 
years. USX, with a major plant in Gary, Indiana, was shut down 
August 1 after labor rejected a management proposal to cut wages and 
benefits substantially. The union called the shutdown a lockout 
after USX rejected a union offer to work under terms of the old 
contract while bargaining continued. Where courts agree with the 
union position, workers are eligible for unemployment compensation. 
Deere, the leading farm equipment producer, closed all its farm 
equipment plants (mainly in Illinois and Iowa) after three 
facilities were struck. Farm equipment inventories are described as 
larger than normal. A strike at a Caterpillar parts plant caused 
layoffs at other facilities. A strike by Detroit municipal workers 
was settled in early August, after 19 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The strike at the USX Gary Works has cut steel output in the 
District sharply, and shifted orders to other producers. One 
District steelmaker is operating at 35 percent of capacity, compared 
with the low 50's for the industry. Cold-rolled sheet orders have 
been extended 6 to 8 weeks beyond normal leadtimes at this producer. 
Encouraged by the USX strike, several large steelmakers announced 
selective price increases. Demand for steel has increased this year 
for appliances, furniture, construction, and grain storage 
facilities. Buying of steel by the auto industry is about 5 percent 
below last year. Steel for oil and gas, and for the railroads, is 
off sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Output of mechanical capital goods is generally weak, even below 
last year's low level. Farm equipment output was extremely low, even 
before the Deere strike, with good used equipment in ample supply. 
Sales of replacement parts, to keep existing agricultural equipment 
operating, are described as good. A leading producer of industrial 
robots is cutting employment due to cancellations of orders by 
automakers. Railroad equipment output continues at a very low level. 
Oil and gas equipment output has fallen near zero. Two manufacturers 
of diesel engines, faced with depressed demand, recently announced 
an agreement to combine those operations. Some types of construction 
equipment have improved, supported by strong residential and highway 
work. The latter consists mainly of repair and upgrading of existing 
routes. Reports indicate that defense equipment orders come in 
spurts, but apparently are increasing overall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of cars and trucks are near last year's high levels, supported 
by cut-rate financing as low as 2.9 percent and rebates from 
domestic producers, with imports accounting for a larger share of 
the market. A credit union trade association is asking the FTC to 
determine whether below-market financing programs of the automakers' 
captive finance companies constitute unfair competition. Domestic 
car and truck makers have scaled back production in the current 
quarter from earlier plans through temporary plant closings and 
slower line speeds. Light truck sales are still strong, particularly 
imports. One industry analyst projects sales of medium trucks in 
1986 slightly ahead of last year, but expects sales of heavies to be 
down 12 percent. Sales of both mediums and heavies in 1967 are 
expected to be near 1986 levels. Competition is fierce for heavies, 
with prices below last year and at unprofitable levels. Further 
consolidations and employment cuts by heavy truck makers are 
expected by analysts. There is an unusually large supply of good 
used truck tractors and trailers, partly reflecting the sharp 
increase in failures of trucking firms under deregulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction activity in major District centers remains 
at a high level. But a large amount of prime office space in the 
Chicago area, downtown and in suburban centers, is vacant with more 
coming on the market. Some major projects have been delayed awaiting 
anchor tenants. Furthermore, proposed tax treatment of "passive 
income" is said to be discouraging equity investors. Demand for 
suburban office space is up from last year. There has been some 
pickup in the Chicago area in construction of strip shopping 
centers, small industrial warehouses, and a variety of smaller 
business projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing construction and resales continue at good levels in many 
parts of the District. Residential building permits for 7 months are 
27 percent above last year in the District states, versus a rise of 
7 percent for the U.S., with particularly large gains in the 
Chicago, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee areas, and in parts of 
Michigan. Average prices of homes in the Chicago area rose 12 
percent in the first 6 months of this year, according to a realtor's 
analysis, with increases of 15-20 percent reported in favored 
suburbs. Similar increases have been reported for portions of the 
Detroit area. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have fallen to 
about 10 percent, according to a survey of Chicago-area lenders, 
down from 10.6 percent in mid-June. Despite improvement, residential 
building in the District as a whole is still well short of the pace 
of the late 1970s. Shortages of skilled tradesmen--including 
bricklayers, carpenters, and drywall installers--are reported in the 
Chicago and Detroit areas. One District lender describes several 
steps taken earlier this year to restrain loan applications 
(including refinancings) which had overwhelmed processing capacity. 
These included higher application fees, elimination of rate lock-
ins, and higher mortgage rates. A newspaper survey points to a 5-10 
percent rise in apartment rents this fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most large general merchandise chains reported seasonally adjusted 
dollar sales records in July. Strongest lines have been appliances 
and home furnishings. Hot weather in July boosted sales of air 
conditioners and apparel. Credit sales continue to account for a 
near-record share of total sales at one large chain. Delinquencies 
have declined since spring, but remain relatively high. With 
inventories described as moderate, the improved pace of sales is 
expected to stimulate orders to suppliers soon. Airline traffic is 
very strong, helped by discount fares.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District crop prospects remain excellent. Record per acre corn 
yields are forecast in each of the five District states. Three of 
the states are likely to reach new highs in soybean yields. Abundant 
harvest prospects and record stocks from previous harvests threaten 
a storage crunch this fall. This has triggered a flurry of activity 
for bin manufacturers. The prospective shortage of storage space has 
pushed grain prices down further as farmers, leery of even lower 
prices when the large crop is harvested, sell existing stocks to 
make room for the new crop. A change in government regulations 
permitting increased use of temporary storage facilities will ease, 
but not eliminate, the distortions that arise from a storage crunch.
