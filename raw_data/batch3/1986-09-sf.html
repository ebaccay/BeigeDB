      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 10, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Twelfth District economy continues to present a mixed picture. 
Consumer spending and residential real estate activity continue to 
buoy most local economies, while the manufacturing, oil, 
agriculture, and commercial real estate sectors remain weak. The 
reduced foreign exchange value of the dollar has yet to produce 
widespread improvements in trade dependent sectors, although 
producers of some forest and seafood products have noted positive 
developments. Weakness in commercial real estate and tax shelter 
activity is attributed partly to pending changes in the tax code. 
These economic conditions are reflected in weak commercial and 
industrial loan demand, but strong demand for residential real 
estate loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, moderate growth in consumer spending continues to provide 
an economic boost to most parts of the Twelfth District. Moreover, a 
paper products manufacturer reports that box shipments, which depend 
primarily on retail sales, were up nearly 8 percent in June over 
their year-earlier level. Despite the overall strength, the volume 
of retail sales in some economically troubled areas continues to 
languish.
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall growth in consumer spending is not reflected in car 
sales. Compared with last year's pace, car sales are down 60 percent 
in Kern County (California), where problems in the agriculture and 
oil industries have combined to weaken the area's economy, and 10 to 
15 percent in San Diego. In Utah, domestic car sales are reported to 
be sluggish, although foreign cars continue to sell well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most parts of the Twelfth District, manufacturing activity 
continues to stagnate. The reduced foreign exchange value of the 
dollar has yet to affect most manufacturers. Indeed, one respondent 
reports that in the Pacific Northwest the dollar volume of imports 
has risen 22 percent during the past year, while the dollar volume 
of exports has risen only 13 percent. One sign of a possible 
improvement in the U.S. trade balance is that Japanese car company 
reportedly has the highest inventory-to-sales ratio in the car 
industry. If this is any indication of future activity, auto imports 
can be expected to decline during the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents throughout the District report that some firms are 
delaying investment plans pending passage and study of the new tax 
law. Exceptions include companies with strong cash positions and 
those with longstanding investment plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices of most agricultural products remain weak, and the reduced 
value of the dollar has done little to stimulate exports of these 
products as yet. Almond growers expect to harvest only about half as 
much product as they did last year due to poor weather during 
pollination, and almond prices have strengthened as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fisheries in Oregon and Alaska are reportedly selling a large volume 
of product at high prices. Moreover, the reduced value of the dollar 
appears to have improved some firms' positions. For example, 
although exports of seafood products from Alaska remain stagnant, 
domestic producers are benefiting from reduced seafood imports. In 
Seattle, one food exporter reports increased volume to Pacific rim 
countries, and renewed Japanese interest in taking on more products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Timber producers in Alaska report that their exports to Japan and 
Korea have risen. Moreover, total lumber exports (measured in board-
feet) for the first half of the year were 22 percent above the same 
period a year earlier, despite falling 9 percent in June. Linerboard 
exports have risen and newsprint imports are down, but paper imports 
from Europe are holding steady because suppliers have cut prices to 
maintain their U.S. market share.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil related industries continue to suffer from low oil prices. For 
example, one major oil company's budget for Kern County has been 
slashed from $100 million to $13 million, just sufficient to 
maintain the company's fields. Moreover, the county's drilling rig 
count has reached a record low, with only 27.5 percent of rigs 
operating, although some local respondents report that rig activity 
appears to have bottomed out.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity continues to be strong in most parts of the 
District. However, in some states, including Alaska and Idaho, weak 
economies have slowed residential construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents throughout the District report that some apartment and 
commercial real estate developers have cancelled projects or put 
them on hold due to questions regarding tax reform. Moreover, some 
banks are reluctant to lend for real estate projects because they 
are concerned about their future profitability. In the Puget Sound 
Area, where vacancy rates reportedly are lower than they are in most 
large cities. tax reform appears to be having a less detrimental 
effect on office construction than it is in most other areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business lending volumes are low in many parts of the District. 
Weakness in agriculture and manufacturing sectors is aggravated by 
widespread caution that is attributed partly to uncertainty about 
tax reform legislation. Loan demand for tax shelter and commercial 
real estate projects has fallen off particularly sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lending continues to provide a source of strength in many 
areas. For example, mortgage lending volume at one Utah bank was 
about 30 percent higher during the first half of 1986 than it was 
during the first half of 1985. Continued strength in mortgage 
lending is also reported in Oregon and California.
