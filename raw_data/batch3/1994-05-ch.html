      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic conditions continued to improve in March 
and April, with retail sales boosted by substantially greater 
improvement in the weather than the norm for this time of year. 
Aside from the weather effects, the underlying upward momentum in 
consumption and housing activity may have slowed somewhat from the 
unusually rapid fourth quarter pace. Reports from manufacturers 
generally remained quite upbeat, although a number of manufacturing 
contacts expressed greater uncertainty about the pace of activity in 
their markets in the latter half of 1994, citing the effects of 
increases in interest rates. Reports of price increases remained 
concentrated in building materials and metals industries. Early 
planting and weaker export prospects are currently weighing on crop 
prices, but District farmland values continued to appreciate in 
early 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales and Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending and housing activity continued to expand in the 
District in recent months, aided by substantial improvement in the 
weather following unusually harsh conditions earlier in the year. A 
large general merchandise retailer stated that underlying sales 
momentum remained positive through early April, with sales of home 
furnishings and other housing-related items still leading overall 
sales growth. This firm's outstanding consumer loans are sill 
rising, while delinquency rates continue to decline. Another large 
national retailer reported that its sales growth slowed in April on 
a holiday-adjusted basis. A large retail chain concentrated in the 
District reported that sales of seasonal items, such as lawn and 
garden and sports equipment, improved in line with plan during March 
and April. A group of retailers in Michigan reported improvement in 
apparel sales growth during March, and a large general merchandise 
firm also reported better apparel sales gains in March. A commercial 
real estate firm expected new shopping center construction in the 
Chicago area to rise nearly 40 percent in 1994, partly due to the 
entry of new chains in the local market, and some financial industry 
contacts expressed concern about the pace of new retail space 
creation in the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large realtor reported that existing home sales transactions were 
about in line with last year, but noted that listings have been 
moving down for the first time in a long time. This contact stated 
that higher mortgage interest rates probably brought more buyers 
into the market in the first quarter, potentially borrowing from 
sales later in the year. A large association of homebuilders in the 
Chicago area reported that traffic increased from strong year-
earlier levels In the first quarter, but then fell off during April. 
While many builders have expressed concern about the impact of 
higher mortgage interest rates, this contact believed buyer 
confidence remains strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to lead the District economy in 
March and early April. Purchasing managers surveys in Chicago, 
Detroit and Milwaukee suggested that manufacturing output growth in 
the District picked up further momentum in the first quarter, 
following significant gains in the fourth quarter of 1993. 
Purchasing managers' surveys conducted in Western Michigan suggested 
that strong growth continued in late March, with gains led by the 
auto industry. A steel industry analyst stated that "integrated 
mills are still going full out," as automakers continue to push for 
order fills. Heavy-duty truck orders surged to an all-time high in 
March, according to an industry analyst, and retail sales bounced 
back following slower, weather-impacted results in January and 
February. Shortages of construction machinery are developing sooner 
in the year than they did last year, according to an industry 
analyst. A large regional bank stated that its mid-sized 
manufacturing customers are still generally enjoying "very healthy" 
orders gains, led by firms in automotive and machine tool-related 
industries. A large manufacturer of communications systems stated 
that growth in systems installations was still running in line with 
the healthy results for the fourth quarter, with especially strong 
results in Northern Illinois. A large diversified manufacturer 
reported a pickup in industrial chemical sales in Europe, although 
its sales of agricultural equipment in Europe remain relatively 
weak. A large electronics manufacturer reported that its worldwide 
bookings continued to grow at a rapid pace in late 1993 and early 
1994, but the growth rate may have slowed slightly in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto industry contacts reported that sales results thus far in April 
pointed to a modest slowing in seasonally adjusted sales rates. 
Discussions with a wide variety of auto dealers were mixed but 
generally positive, although one of the largest dealers in the 
District noted that "it seems like someone just turned off the 
faucet," citing interest rate increases and customer concern with 
their losses in financial markets. Several banking contacts noted 
that residential refinancing has "dried up," and one regional 
analyst expected this to inhibit auto sales in coming months. Auto 
dealers in Michigan reported substantial strengthening in April 
sales, as consumers rush to beat a state sales tax increase slated 
for May. Auto suppliers in the region continued to produce at high 
levels, and one large auto supplier stated that the run-up in long-
term interest rates in early 1994 has not yet affected its 
expectations for significant growth in 1994. Year-over-year growth 
in motor vehicle assemblies in the District continued to post larger 
increases than the nation as a whole in early 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most areas of the District have experienced warm and unusually dry 
weather patterns this spring, although there was some localized 
flooding in mid April. Crop farmers responded with faster-than-
normal progress with field work. The pace picked up dramatically 
during the week ending April 23, when corn planting began in earnest 
in most areas. The early start has buoyed prospects for the 1994 
harvest, which has combined with a weak pace in export shipments to 
weigh on crop prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest survey of District agricultural bankers found the 
farmland market strengthened further this winter. The two percent 
gain reported for the three months ending with March was fairly 
widespread throughout the District, and it was the largest such 
increase in several quarters. The volume of farmland transfers 
picked up during the winter months, fueled both by a stronger demand 
among buyers and a pick up in offerings for sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of price increases remained concentrated in metals and 
building materials markets. A steel industry analyst stated that 
steel prices are "definitely moving higher." Negotiations between 
integrated mills and automakers have taken on a more "commercial" 
tone, as opposed to a dictatorial character in recent years. Steel 
price increases are concentrated in special orders for nonstandard 
sizes that take more time to fill, as production time has become 
more valuable at current levels of capacity utilization. Steel scrap 
prices have stabilized in recent months, however, after exploding 
last year. A large bank stated that its mid-sized manufacturing 
clients are still unwilling to pass on metals price increases, and 
"for the time being, are willing to eat them." A large association 
of homebuilders stated greater lumber shortages are expected during 
the summer, along with new shortages of dry wall. A large 
manufacturer of a variety of chemicals has not experienced 
significant price increases for inputs, while competitive pressures 
continue to dampen its own prices and margins. A large auto supplier 
stated that it has recently received price increase notices from its 
suppliers, but has been successful in resisting those requests, and 
remains unable to implement price increases to its large automaker 
customers. A large electronics manufacturer noted that price 
increases for components sold to the auto industry seem to have 
become more feasible, but they haven't been implemented, noting that 
"we don't want to pay the price when the downside arrives." Two 
large retailers each stated that prices paid by their customers 
continue to decline, on balance. The price component of the Chicago 
purchasing managers' survey indicated modestly faster price 
increases in early 1994, but this index remained below year-earlier 
levels, and considerably below its average level in 1988 and 1989.
