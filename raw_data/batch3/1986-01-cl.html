      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This District's economy is growing slowly despite weakness in 
manufacturing. Unemployment is high but falling. Holiday retail 
sales were up moderately from a year ago, and early January new car 
sales have responded well to sales incentives. Manufacturing remains 
in the doldrums, with new orders, backlogs, and employment falling, 
and manufacturers still see little response to dollar depreciation. 
Housing activity remains strong. Bank loans outstanding rose 
significantly in the last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite fewer than usual shopping days, holiday season retail sales 
in the District were up moderately from year-ago sales. A sample of 
three large general merchandise chains report nominal December sales 
increases at roughly 4 to 6 percent from year-ago levels, slightly 
more than experienced at the national level. Department store sales 
in the District were particularly strong in the apparel and home 
improvement categories. None of the retailers contacted express 
concern over current inventory positions, although many express 
uncertainty over future sales prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area new-car dealers report strong sales following the typical 
holiday sales decline. Most auto dealers report the early January 
sales gains, in some cases as much as 30 percent above year-ago 
levels, are a consequence at the nationally sponsored interest-rate 
incentive programs. However, domestic new-car dealers have also 
noted a moderate improvement in nonqualifying sales categories, such 
as luxury new-car models. Few new-car dealers expect incentive-
induced sales gains to last. Local new-car inventories increased in 
late-December and early-January, but area dealers note that this is 
typical as they prepare for the anticipated Spring sales increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ohio's labor market showed some improvement in the fourth quarter of 
1985 as the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 9.4% in 
September to 8.3% in December. Hiring expectations for the entire 
Midwest show a slight decline for the first quarter of 1986 compared 
to the initial quarters of 1985 and 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in this District remains in the doldrums. 
Most firms report manufacturing output was unchanged and those 
reporting increases are matched by an equal number reporting 
production decreases. Employment is falling at substantially more 
than half of the manufacturing firms surveyed. Manufacturers report 
new orders and order backlogs have fallen for three consecutive 
months. Despite the decline in orders and backlogs, a majority of 
firms report they expect l986:IQ to be better for their companies 
than 1985:IVQ. Raw materials inventories fell sharply at yearend, 
and although some respondents say tax considerations contributed to 
the decline, inventories have been on a downtrend for several 
months. Finished goods inventories also continued to decline, 
falling more sharply at this yearend than at other recent yearends. 
Manufacturers report prices paid for commodities are falling but 
prices paid for equipment and services are rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is still very little indication of response to dollar 
depreciation. Of eight major manufacturing firms that export and/or 
compete against imports, none report having been able to raise their 
own prices in response to dollar depreciation, only two report any 
increase in orders or sales, and the remaining six report having no 
additional inquiries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most steel producers continue to face weak prices and stiff 
competition as imports exceed levels envisioned by the import 
control program. Major producers have pruned their operations but 
more surgery may be needed unless price increases are obtained. 
Nevertheless, some segments of the industry, such as flat rolled 
steel used by the auto industry, and specialty steel, are doing 
well. A steel industry analyst expects domestic steel consumption to 
fall slightly in 1986, offsetting an expected small decline in 
imports and leaving domestic steel shipments unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Realtors, builders, and mortgage lenders in this District report 
continued strength in their businesses. Contacts report record 
profits in 1985, and expect 1986 profits to be equal or better.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lending in the District remains strong, although it has 
softened in recent weeks because secondary market rates have climbed 
65 to 70 basis points. One major mortgage lender's 1985 mortgage 
volume was up 50 percent on a year-to-year basis. Home loan 
refinancing represented 50 percent of their loan activity in 
December. The firm expects a 25 percent increase in its mortgage 
loan applications in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors' transactions volume rose 10 percent above 1984 levels, 
bringing record profits in 1985. One major realtor expects another 
profit record in 1986. Although his new listings are showing signs 
of slowing, he plans to increase staff 10 percent in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major builder in the District reports record 1985 earnings, 
despite a small drop in orders. This builder reports a recent surge 
in traffic, with fewer lookers and more serious buyers. There is 
little speculative house building, and pre-selling of homes has 
become a common practice among builders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major real estate developer reports that speculative construction 
of office space seems to be excessive in some midwestern cities. He 
attributes the excess to the easy availability of construction loans 
and is concerned that in six to twelve months the developers may 
find too few tenants and no long-term financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at District banks is picking up. Total loans outstanding 
at large banks rose significantly over the past month, but much of 
the increase was due to seasonal factors. Gains in business and 
consumer installment loans more than offset declines in real estate 
loans. Although consumer installment lending remains quite strong it 
has been increasing at a decreasing rate. Contacts expect consumer 
lending to continue to expand at a double-digit but slower pace. 
Contacts also expect business loan demand to improve in the first 
quarter, as more firms begin to rebuild inventories.
