      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 27, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District is mixed, with some 
sluggishness in retailing and housing, some improvement in 
agriculture and the energy sector, and see evidence of strength in 
the industrial sector. Retail sales have been flat in recent months, 
and are expected to continue so. Manufacturers' input prices are 
increasing significantly and see inventory accumulation is 
occurring. Limited improvement continues in oil exploration and 
development activity. Housing starts are flat and are expected to 
slow in the near future, developments that are paralleled in the 
demand for mortgage funds. Loan demand at commercial banks continues 
weak. Crop conditions and harvests are generally good, and farm loan 
paydowns are expected to be above normal in the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While district retailers generally report sales above year-ago 
levels, sales over the past three months have been mostly flat. Soft 
goods appear to be selling somewhat better than hard goods. Prices 
are reported as generally stable with this trend expected to 
continue into the near future. Inventories are considered to be at 
satisfactory levels with a few respondents rising their inventories. 
Most retailers expect sales to show little growth in the near 
future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers report that September sales were steady to 
slightly weaker compared with August and a year earlier. Inventories 
are expanding as dealers receive 1988 models. Overall, dealers are 
hopeful that sales will be stable or up slightly during the 
remainder of 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report that prices have generally increased 
significantly over year-earlier levels. Most agents report increases 
in the past three months and all agents surveyed expect general 
price increases for the next three months. Most materials are 
readily available, but some agents report longer lead times. Though 
inventory levels are satisfactory overall, some increases are being 
made in response to seasonal factors and general market conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although a strong rebound in the district's energy industry is not 
likely to occur soon, some significant improvements in exploration 
and development activity has been observed in recent weeks. The 
average weekly number of operating drilling rigs in the Tenth 
District increased from 311 in August to 351 in the first three 
weeks of September, 63 percent above the average weekly level 
recorded in September 1986. Nevertheless, the rig count in the 
district remains less than one-fourth its 1982 peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders report that housing starts are at or below 
last year's levels and are generally down from a month ago. Single-
family home construction remains flat while multifamily unit 
construction has decreased. Looking ahead, homebuilders expect 
housing starts to slow further. Most homebuilders report that new 
home sales are down and inventories are steady. Builders report that 
materials prices remain generally unchanged or lower due to 
competition among suppliers and they expect no problems with 
material availability, delivery, or price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit growth at Tenth District savings institutions is reported 
down from a year ago, although respondents believe that aggressive 
rate increases could attract deposits. Any change in deposit growth 
would depend on different pricing. Demand for mortgage funds has 
fallen sharply and is expected to be sluggish during the remainder 
of 1987. Mortgage rates, which have risen substantially, are 
generally expected to increase slightly during the rest of 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents at Tenth District banks report total loan demand as 
either down slightly or unchanged during the month. Demand weakened 
for consumer, commercial and industrial, and residential real estate 
loans. Respondents reporting reduced demand for commercial real 
estate loans were about balanced by respondents reporting increased 
demand for these loans. Demand for agricultural loans held steady. 
Most respondents report having raised prime rates and expect to 
increase them further in the coming months. Responses concerning 
recent changes in consumer loan rates were split evenly between no 
change and slight increases. Most respondents expect to make no 
change in consumer loan rates in the coming months. Balances in all 
types of deposit accounts except large CD's generally remained 
constant, while a number of respondents report growth in large CD's.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The fall harvest and winter wheat seeding are progressing well 
across most of the Tenth District. The corn and soybean harvests are 
nearing completion in the southern parts of the district with a few 
exceptions. Good conditions have prevailed in the northern areas of 
the district as the harvests reach the half-way mark. Corn and 
soybean yields appear to be close to normal or a little above 
normal. The milo harvest is also under way, and excellent yields are 
expected. Winter wheat seeding is almost complete in district 
states. Good moisture and warm weather have prevailed throughout 
most of the district and good stands of wheat are appearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers expect farm loan paydowns in the fourth quarter to be above 
normal. Strong crop yield prospects contribute to this expectation, 
but the increased paydown levels are primarily attributed to 
livestock producers. Increased profits and fears that livestock 
prices may soon weaken have encouraged ranchers to pay down debt. In 
addition, continued high feeder cattle prices have discouraged 
operators from buying replacement cattle.
