      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity for most of the nation continues to advance, but a 
number of Federal Reserve districts note ebbing rates of expansion. 
Although auto sales have dipped, reports of retail sales are 
generally positive. Manufacturing growth is leveling off. Real 
estate markets are sluggish. In the resources sector, firming oil 
prices have helped the energy-producing districts, while 
environmentally-related legal issues are said to have restricted 
lumber supplies. Recent rains have alleviated drought problems in 
several districts. Loan growth varies considerably across regions. A 
number of districts mention undesirably high inventories,
particularly in autos. With some exceptions, wage and price 
pressures are not accelerating. Some districts said their 
respondents had not been able to pass their input cost increases 
through to their customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales reports are mixed, but the tone is generally positive. 
Cleveland mentions that sales in Ohio rebounded in May, and that 
gains continued into June. Demand has picked up in the Kansas City 
district. Dallas and New York note year-over-year gains, and 
Minneapolis cites strong consumer spending. Boston, Chicago, and 
Philadelphia offer less positive comments, however. Strength in 
sales of women's apparel was noted by several districts, but 
consumers appear to be increasingly cautious about purchases of big-
ticket items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales have weakened. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco all note softening demand, 
while Atlanta mentions undesirably high inventories among dealers. 
Dallas cites moderate sales growth and Minneapolis also refers to 
recent expansion. San Francisco reports that demand is strong in 
some parts of its district, although not in most of them.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in manufacturing activity has slowed. Boston, Philadelphia, 
Richmond, and St. Louis all note evidence of reduced rates of 
expansion, although San Francisco reports robust activity. Boston, 
Dallas, and San Francisco mention negative impacts of reduced 
defense contracting. Several districts also refer to weak demand for 
construction-related products. Nevertheless, a number of sectors 
remain strong and have high rates of capacity utilization. San 
Francisco reports bottlenecks in the commercial aircraft industry 
and tight capacity at most paper mills. Chicago and Cleveland note 
strong capital goods orders and Atlanta cites upward revisions in 
capital spending plans by several manufacturers. Most plants in the 
St. Louis district are said to be operating near full capacity. 
Although Atlanta and Boston say export demand is strong, a number of 
other districts cite concerns over potential or actual softening of 
export markets for some industries. Some districts mention rising 
prices of basic inputs, particularly metals and certain plastics.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction is showing signs of sluggishness. Boston, New York, 
Minneapolis, Kansas City, and St. Louis mention evidence of slipping 
residential real estate markets. Nonresidential activity shows 
greater variance across regions, with high rates of industrial 
construction in the Chicago district and with strong commercial real 
estate markets in the coastal states of the San Francisco district. 
In Arizona, which is also in the San Francisco district, commercial 
and residential real estate markets are languishing. Although 
Manhattan is undergoing a spate of hotel-building activity, loan 
officers in the southern portion of the New York district say their 
commercial real estate markets are generally quite weak. Dallas 
mentions that nonresidential construction is unchanged at a low 
level, while Philadelphia reports that commercial real estate 
markets there are softening.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the resource sector vary among individual industries. 
The recent firming of oil prices is said to have helped the energy 
sectors in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas districts, while St. 
Louis reports some increases in coal output. Minneapolis, however, 
notes that the wood products industry's access to local raw 
materials has been severely limited as a result of environmental 
concerns. San Francisco mentions that legal issues have contributed 
to a reduction of lumber production there, but that exports of logs 
have also contributed to the slowdown.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In agriculture, the most significant news may be the recent rains, 
which have helped to alleviate drought problems in several 
districts. Subsoil moisture levels remain a cause of concern, but 
past difficulties have been reduced by precipitation in the St. 
Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts. The rains came too late to 
avert considerable damage to the winter wheat crops in the Dallas 
and Kansas City districts, where past dry weather has also motivated 
ranchers to reduce their herd sizes. Wheat yields in some other 
districts, including Richmond and Minneapolis are expected to be 
high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial industry activity varies markedly among the districts that 
mention banking conditions. New York notes that loan demand at small 
and medium-size banks is the same or somewhat weaker than a year 
ago. Commercial loan demand in the Richmond district remains 
unchanged, compared with modest growth in the first half of April, 
while consumer credit demand there is up modestly. Loan volume in 
the Philadelphia district is growing, but at a slower rate than 
during the first quarter. In May, loan demand surged in the 
Cleveland land district. Loan demand in the Kansas City district is 
also increasing, while St. Louis notes improved bank profitability 
and asset quality. In the San Francisco district, commercial loan 
demand is increasing and most western banks are posting strong 
profits.
