      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy improved slightly in early fall following 
essentially steady to slower conditions in late summer. Weather 
threats to crops did not materialize and Ninth District directors 
report good cash returns in agriculture. They also report that the 
1992 summer tourist season was strong. Retail chains reported 
stronger sales. Construction is also an area of tentative 
strengthening, particularly in infrastructure such as street and 
sewer improvements. Motor vehicle sales, however, are essentially 
steady and manufacturing and mining are slow. Labor markets appear 
to have stabilized.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise spending in the District shows some signs of 
strength. Some regional retailers report September sales increases 
of 15 to 25 percent compared to the previous year. Such reports are 
more positive than Minnesota and South Dakota sales tax remittances 
for September, which are reported to be "as projected" at levels 
slightly above a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Motor vehicle sales essentially match sales a year ago. Year-to-date 
figures for a major domestic distributor show car sales down 2 
percent from 1991 but pickup trucks up 4 percent. South Dakota new 
vehicle titles issued in September and year to date were essentially 
unchanged from 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      The summer tourist season ended on an upbeat note. Directors, an 
industry association and newspapers report that the season had been 
"good" to "excellent" in all areas. Sources in South Dakota and 
Montana rated the season as excellent, though down slightly from 
records set in 1991. Early news reports from the Upper Peninsula 
note expectations of favorable game populations and weather 
conditions leading to good hunting-related business for the fall 
season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Home Sales and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction shows some signs of reviving. In Minnesota and the 
Dakotas, substantial increases in contact awards for infrastructure 
such as roads, bridges and water/sewer construction more than offset 
slight declines in other building. In Minnesota, construction of 
Native American-owned casinos is a major activity with over $100 
million of projects in progress or completed so far this year. 
Congress recently authorized $19.2 million maintenance and 
renovation projects at Air Force bases in Grand Forks and Minot, 
N.D. The strong tourist season was cited as motivation for 
construction of 300 new motel rooms in Billings, Mont.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home sales are reported strong in most metropolitan areas. Eau 
Claire, Wis., and Rapid City, S.D., reported 1992 housing starts 17 
percent and 35 percent above 1991 respectively. Duluth, Minn., was 
an exception, reporting a construction slump and sluggish sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite these encouraging reports, Minnesota's construction 
employment declined slightly in September as several major projects 
were completed, according to employment service officials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity appears to be slow. Hurricane-induced demand 
for building materials, which continues to support forest-product 
manufacturing, is an exception reported by directors. A computer 
manufacturer announced layoffs and the closing of one plant caused 
by disappointing sales. Manufacturing employment numbers for 
Minnesota in September were slightly above a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mining is lackluster, with low prices for gold and copper limiting 
profitability in South Dakota and Montana and slack demand for iron 
ore affecting northern Minnesota. A major gold mine in western South 
Dakota announced plans to scale back production and offer early 
retirement to 132 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets are largely unchanged. Unemployment rates for August 
were slightly higher than the previous month and in August of 1991. 
Fewer large layoffs were reported in District media since the last 
Beige Book. Layoffs did include 650 employees of a computer 
manufacturer, 480 airline employees, 115 defense workers and 142 
employees of a hospitality company.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weather concerns cited in previous reports did not materialize and 
conditions in agriculture are generally reported to be good. An 
unusually cool, wet growing season delayed crop maturity and 
continues to retard harvest operations, but yields for all major 
cops except soybeans are generally excellent. Crop prices are 
generally stable with wheat and small grain prices generally higher 
than last year but corn and soybeans somewhat lower. Overall, gross 
revenues per acre are reported to be above 1991 for all major crops 
except soybeans. Wheat growers in Minnesota and the Dakotas reported 
above average yields. Montana's 1992 wheat crop was down 11 percent 
from 1991 due to slightly lower yields and fewer acres planted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock profitability was generally unchanged to slightly lower. 
Prices for slaughter livestock were marginally lower compared to the 
same period in 1991. September dairy prices were higher than in 
1991, while poultry and eggs were largely unchanged. Prices for 
feeder livestock in Montana and the western Dakotas were strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of localized areas affected by frost, hail or 
drought, agricultural bankers responding to a quarterly survey of 
agricultural credit conditions reported that farmers generally were 
able to service their operating loans and continue with debt 
retirement. Directors noted that investment in new machinery was 
largely limited to new harvesting machinery needed to cope with the 
late, unfavorable harvest conditions. Some ranching areas of west-
central South Dakota are extremely dry and much of Montana's pasture 
and range continue below normal condition, but soil moisture in 
nearly all crop-producing areas of the region is excellent going 
into the winter.
