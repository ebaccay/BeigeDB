      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District remained sluggish in 
February, but there were some spotty indications of improvement. 
Although manufacturers said the downtrend in that sector continued, 
they indicated that orders and shipments have been steady in recent 
weeks, following a year-long decline, and export business was 
picking up. Realtors reported that sales of both new and existing 
homes had increased in February. On the negative side, retailers 
generally were experiencing weak sales, and bankers said overall 
loan demand remained slack although some noted an increase in 
lending to middle market companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District business contacts generally express 
guarded optimism. Manufacturers expect an increase in activity over 
the next six months and they are planning some increases in capital 
spending. Retailers anticipate sales to pick up with the end of 
hostilities in the Persian Gulf, but they do not expect strong gains 
until overall economic activity rebounds. Realtors believe the 
recent improvement in sales should be sustained as long as mortgage 
rates do not move up and there is no substantial decline in 
employment in the region. Bankers, however, believe that loan demand 
will remain only steady, at best, until there are clear signs of 
resurgent economic growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from manufacturers in late February indicated that although 
industrial activity continued to slow, the downward trend appeared 
to be easing. Around half of the firms contacted said business was 
running at a steady pace and there were some reports of improvement. 
In particular, manufacturing executives indicated that, on balance, 
total orders and shipments had been running at a stable rate in 
recent weeks after a year-long decline, buoyed by a pickup in export 
business. Nevertheless, managers at area plants said they were 
continuing to trim employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers apparently see some signs of 
improvement, and the consensus outlook is optimistic. More than half 
of the plant managers queried in late February expect business to 
pick up over the next six months. Although most do not expect the 
increase in activity to be large enough to require hiring more 
workers, expectations of improving business conditions are prompting 
some area firms to schedule increases in capital spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported that sales were sluggish in January and February. 
Some specialty stores have seen stronger sales recently--notably 
women's and children's clothing stores and stores catering to the 
do-it-yourself home improvement market; however, nearly all broad-
line stores are experiencing softness.
     </p>
     <p>
      Store executives said consumers have been very cautious in their 
spending behavior. While merchants expect some improvement with the 
end of hostilities in the Persian Gulf they believe that consumers 
will continue to exercise restraint until the employment situation 
improves and family incomes pick up. Retailers plan to limit 
expenditures for merchandise and marketing, and they are stepping up 
efforts to control expenses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major banks in the Third District 
has dropped since the beginning of the year. Bank lending officers 
describe loan demand as slack for most categories of credit, and 
they do not foresee a rebound until overall economic conditions 
improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      While some bankers noted an increase in lending to middle market 
businesses, most said total commercial and industrial loan volume 
continued to slip. Consumer loan volume was also down, according to 
Third District bankers. Several noted that outstanding installment 
credit was declining, especially for auto loans and credit cards. 
Although bankers said consumer loans usually are paid down at this 
time of year, some believe the decline in outstandings is greater 
than can be attributed to the seasonal factor alone.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate loan volume outstanding is down only slightly from the 
beginning of the year. Bankers noted a recent pickup in new 
residential mortgages as well as an increase in refinancings. Some 
also indicated that depository institutions and other lenders were 
extending maturities on outstanding loans to commercial property 
owners and developers where the financial condition of the borrower 
remained sound. However, bankers said that little new permanent 
financing was being advanced and that practically no funds were 
being provided for speculative projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of both new and existing homes have increased in recent weeks, 
according to realtors. Most of the improvement came in the low- to 
mid-priced market, but realtors also noted an increase in inquiries 
from potential buyers in the high end of the market. Further 
indications of increasing demand are reports from some builders that 
it was becoming easier to obtain asking prices for the houses they 
build. Realtors expect residential business to show continued 
improvement as long as mortgage rates do not move up and the 
employment situation does not weaken.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial realtors estimated that office vacancy rates were in a 
range from the mid-teens to low-twenties in business areas around 
the Third District, and they expect rates to remain at these levels 
through the rest of the year. Vacancy rates for retail space were 
described as high, and some real estate executives said high 
vacancies at some shopping centers were having a negative impact on 
sales at stores operating at those locations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors and executives involved in real estate financing expect 
construction activity to continue to decline this year. They say 
refurbishing of older buildings, primarily offices and warehouses, 
will provide some demand for construction this year and next, but 
they are concerned that these buildings may be at a competitive 
disadvantage in attracting tenants due to the large amount of 
recently built space available.
