      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 22, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of economic growth appeared to be unchanged in May and 
early June. Demand remained moderately strong in many industries, 
and most contacts did not expect a change in the rate of growth of 
economic activity through the end of the year. Manufacturing orders 
were steady, and demand for business services remained moderate. 
However, retail sales growth was reported to be sluggish and below 
expectations, particularly for apparel. Although construction and 
real estate activity continued at fairly high levels, softness in 
the homebuilding industry has begun to appear. Energy production, 
drilling and services continued to rise at a moderate pace, but did 
not accelerate with higher oil prices. District bankers said that 
loan demand had increased strongly, but competition for loans was 
intense. Planting and crop growth was generally on schedule, but 
weather damage affected some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing orders were steady. Demand for construction-related 
materials remained strong, with brick, cement and glass producers 
reporting higher demand and prices. Brick and cement producers were 
operating at 100 percent capacity, and said that they were having 
trouble filling orders. Several non construction-related 
manufacturers expect demand growth in 1994 to be good but lower than 
in 1993. Demand continued to be strong for electrical and electronic 
machinery, particularly telecommunications products. Selling prices 
of semiconductors stopped declining, and demand decelerated slightly 
as manufacturers had expected. Although orders for primary and 
fabricated metals remained strong, contacts said that steel and 
scrap metal prices had fallen. Sales of lumber and wood products 
were steady to slightly higher but below this time last year. Demand 
for paper products was up, and contacts reported that they had 
increased their prices slightly. Apparel producers said that sales 
were steady or slightly higher. Garment contacts were mixed about 
upcoming changes in the industry resulting from NAFTA. Some contacts 
have found entering the Mexican market to be harder than they 
expected but believe that Mexico will be a source of future sales. 
One contact is concerned that increased demand for labor in Mexico 
will raise the firm's production costs there. Sales of food and 
kindred products were down slightly. Demand for drilling services 
and machinery was steady for natural gas but down slightly for oil. 
Foreign demand for services and equipment remained sluggish, 
especially from the Middle East and Nigeria. However, sales had 
increased to Latin America, particularly Venezuela after 
privatization of its oil industry. The arrival of the summer driving 
season increased demand for gasoline, but higher crude oil prices 
squeezed refinery profits. Demand for chemicals continued to 
increase, and prices rose 10-15 percent for some products. Sales 
were strongest for the styrene chain, especially polystyrene, and 
went up for ethylene and polyethylene as well. Chemical sales to 
Europe increased strongly, but Asian markets generally remained 
weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most business service firms reported steady demand. Activity at 
temporary service firms remained unchanged overall with higher 
demand from electronics and telecommunications firms. Law firms said 
that activity was slightly higher, and they were trying to do more 
work without hiring. Demand for advertising and communications had 
declined. Hotels reported increased bookings but fewer than they had 
expected for the World Cup. Airlines noted slower passenger demand 
than expected, although traffic was above a year ago. Air, rail and 
trucking cargo continued to increase strongly. Competition and lower 
fuel prices kept transportation prices unchanged despite higher 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many contacts reported that May retail sales growth was slower than 
expected. Sales picked up slightly in early June leading retailers 
to be cautiously optimistic that sales growth would continue. Demand 
for apparel products remained weak, while sales of building and home 
improvement products were strong. Some national contacts reported 
that Texas retail sales growth was slower than the rest of the 
nation's with particular weakness along the Texas-Mexico border. 
Competition was keeping selling prices below last year's levels, and 
contacts said that they were purchasing fall merchandise at the same 
price or slightly higher than in 1993. Automobile sales were 
sluggish in May but picked up in early June. Still, dealers reported 
that they would like to increase their inventories of some vehicles. 
Auto prices were stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate markets remained fairly strong, but 
homebuilders reported a slowdown in new home sales and traffic. 
Although contacts were optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 
the year, home prices have generally flattened, and some builders 
reduced their prices. Apartment markets, however, remained tight and 
occupancy rates and rents moved higher. A pickup in demand for 
office and industrial space boosted commercial construction. Prices 
and rents increased for office and industrial property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy production and drilling continued at a moderate pace but did 
not accelerate with higher oil prices. Oil prices rose to $18 per 
barrel in mid-May from a low of $14 in March. Natural gas prices 
fell briefly in May encouraging distribution companies to make major 
injections into storage tanks that had been depleted by winter's 
cold weather. Drilling had not staged its normal seasonal 
turnaround, but the rig count remained well ahead of last year. Most 
drilling continued to be for natural gas and in the Gulf of Mexico.
     </p>
     <p>
      District bankers said that although loan demand continued to 
increase strongly, competition for loans was intense. Contacts said 
that some banks were loosening their credit standards to extend 
business loans. Bankers complained that regulations, such as 
mandatory appraisals, were making it difficult for them to compete 
with mortgage bankers and other lenders. Home mortgage refinancing 
had fallen dramatically, but originations for home purchase had not.
     </p>
     <p>
      Planting and crop growth was on schedule, but unfavorable weather 
weakened some agricultural production. Heavy rain prevented some 
cotton producers from planting their crop, although planted cotton 
was in good condition. Dry conditions had stressed ranges in the 
Trans-Pecos and South Texas, but livestock remained in fair to good 
condition. Texas farmers expect to harvest about 25 percent less 
wheat than last year because the crop was damaged by dry weather and 
a hard freeze earlier in the year. The Texas May All Crops Price 
Index was 7.2 percent above 1993's level, while the Livestock and 
Livestock Products Price Index declined 10.6 percent from last year.
