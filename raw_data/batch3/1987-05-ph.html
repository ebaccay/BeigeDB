      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most sectors of the Third District economy are making only modest 
gains as the second quarter begins. Manufacturing activity picked up 
slightly in April after being flat in March. Retail sales, while 
still growing as April came to a close, have slipped below 
retailers' plans. Bankers report a fall-off in consumer loan growth 
but indicate that business lending continues to grow moderately. 
Although mortgage markets have been upset by the recent run-up in 
interest rates, realtors say the usual spring surge in home sales 
does not appear to have been significantly restrained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasts for the Third District economy vary. Manufacturers expect 
only steady conditions for the next two quarters. Retailers believe 
sales for the spring season will be moderately above the same period 
last year, but they do not have any firm expectations for the second 
half of the year. Bankers look for continued growth in commercial 
and industrial lending, but expect further slackening in consumer 
loan demand. Realtors believe the current pace of home sales will 
continue through spring unless there are further increases in 
mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The April Business Outlook Survey indicates that local industrial 
activity is moving up slightly again after a pause in March, 
continuing the stop-and-go pattern that has marked 1987 thus far. 
Just 20 percent of the manufacturers covered by the April survey are 
stepping up operations, while 12 percent are cutting back; two-
thirds are operating at a steady pace. Conditions are similar in 
both the durable goads and nondurable goods sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although there are some positive signs this month, there is no 
general indication of significant strengthening in the region's 
industrial sector. New orders and shipments are advancing slightly, 
but order backlogs are slipping fractionally. Employment is also off 
a bit; although nearly three-fourths of the firms contacted in April 
are maintaining steady payrolls, 17 percent are cutting back, and 
only 10 percent are adding employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices in the region are mostly stable. Three-fourths of 
the firms polled in April say input costs are unchanged from last 
month, and more than 80 percent report steady prices for their own 
products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, local manufacturers forecast little change in the 
pace of business, although manufacturers of nondurable goods are 
more optimistic than durable goods makers. Overall, survey 
respondents expecting improvement during the next six months just 
edge out those anticipating a slowdown, resulting in the lowest net 
positive forecast since April 1980. On balance, firms participating 
in this month's survey project only marginal gains in new orders and 
shipments in the second and third quarters. They also indicate that 
employment prospects are not good; although half of the survey 
respondents intend to maintain steady payrolls, companies planning 
cutbacks exceed those looking to hire more workers by two to one.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the Third District report that sales in April ran 
modestly above the same month last year, but several store officials 
say the year-to-year increase was slightly below their expectations. 
March sales, however were better than expected; thus, most retail 
contacts say their overall first quarter (February-April) results 
should be good. Sales estimates for this period range from 3 to 10 
percent above the year-ago period. Seasonal items, apparel, and 
jewelry are selling well; and the relatively higher margins on these 
goods are bolstering retailers' profits for the quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Store executives believe the current pace of consumer spending in 
the region will continue for the next several months, which is as 
far ahead as they feel confident to forecast. They say continued 
good performance in the region's retail sector depends on a 
generally healthy local economy and continued job and population 
growth in parts of the Third District, such as central and southern 
New Jersey, where some of the area's major retailers are planning 
new stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank lending in the region, on net, has grown little since the 
beginning of the year. Total loan amounts outstanding at major Third 
District banks in early April were up just over 1 percent from 
December's levels. The slackening growth in total lending is almost 
entirely due to a slowdown in consumer loan growth in recent months. 
Bankers contacted in late April say that credit card and other 
consumer installment loan volume is flat or down compared to 1986 
year-end. Although bank credit officers say some of this slowdown is 
due to consolidation of personal loans under home equity credit 
lines, they believe that total personal lending is growing more 
slowly, however it is classified. They say that the long-predicted 
retrenchment in consumer spending may have begun, and they expect a 
slower rate of retail sales to result in an easing of consumer 
credit demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial loan volume at large Third District banks 
is up around 5 percent from the beginning of the year. Bankers say 
this rate of growth may slip somewhat in the near term, as the 
current economic expansion ages, but they expect lending to 
companies in the region to grow at close to its current pace for the 
rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity is picking up, as is usual in the 
spring, according to realtors. They believe the recent run-up in 
mortgage rates will not significantly reduce home sales, although 
higher rates may restrain rising home prices. Most realtors in the 
region say that sales should continue at a brisk pace as long as 
rates do not go much higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      The average rate on 30-year conventional mortgages in the region has 
increased from approximately 9 percent in March to over 10 percent 
in late April. Mortgage lenders say the general increase in bond 
rates has affected the pricing of mortgage-backed securities, 
causing them to raise mortgage contract rates. In addition, lenders 
say, home buyers are more likely to take down mortgages for which 
they have commitments when rates rise. Consequently, individual 
lenders seek more funds to be certain of covering mortgages to which 
they are committed. The aggregate result of this is upward pressure 
on the cost of funds for the industry as a whole. Nevertheless, 
there is not a widespread feeling in the region that mortgage rates 
will continue to rise; one large mortgage lender in particular 
believes rates will decline to 9-9.5 percent soon and remain in that 
range for the rest of the year.
