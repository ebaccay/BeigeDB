      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economy in the West is expanding at a healthy pace. Twelfth 
District business leaders' expectations of further growth have 
improved during the past month. Annual increases in wages and in the 
prices of most products are running at or below 5 percent. Consumer 
spending growth continues healthy. Apparel sales continue strong and 
a pickup in car sales during August buoyed the generally lackluster 
sales of durable goods. Manufacturing industries report generally 
satisfactory conditions, with little change in exports in recent 
months. Crop yields are good in most parts of the District, and 
exports of many products continue strong. Lumber mills in the 
Pacific Northwest still face limited log supplies. Construction and 
real estate activity are strong in most of the West, although 
Arizona remains weak. Western bankers report increases in loan
volume and earnings, and stiff competition for deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The most recent information on the economic mood of Twelfth District 
business leaders indicates improvement in all categories. Although 
almost three-quarters of respondents still expect weak growth in GNP 
during the next four quarters, expectations for housing starts, 
consumer spending, and the trade balance improved markedly during 
the past month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Annual price increases at or below the 5 percent range are reported 
for automobiles (both foreign and domestic), building materials, and 
natural gas. Respondents note larger price increases for processed 
vegetables (up 20 percent), raw stumpage (up 64 percent), and Idaho 
potatoes (up 30 percent). Grape and silver prices have fallen in 
recent months, and easing capacity constraints for paper 
manufacturers are putting downward pressure on paper prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recently negotiated union settlements generally call for annual wage 
increases of 4 percent or less. Exceptions to this trend are nurses 
and teachers in several western cities who recently negotiated 
annual salary increases in the ten percent range. Businesses report 
difficulty hiring sufficient qualified labor in many parts of the 
District, including Oregon, southern Idaho, and agricultural regions 
of California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales continue to exhibit healthy growth, with particular 
strength in apparel sales. One retailer notes that the primary 
constraint to expanding his operations is the difficulty of finding 
adequate labor in many locations. Sales of durable goods have been 
less robust, although a car dealer notes that 1989 models moved well 
in August as buyers tried to beat the price increases scheduled for 
1990 models. Summer tourist activity is reported to have increased 
over last year's level in Idaho, Utah, and southern California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in manufacturing industries generally are satisfactory, 
with significant variations by product line and company. One 
electronic component manufacturer reports that the order rate is 
flat, while other high tech firms report strong growth and still 
others announce cutbacks and layoffs. A heavy equipment dealer 
reports that construction machinery sales throughout the West 
continue to do "very well." Defense contracting activity continues 
to slide. A cable television company faces delays in receiving 
wiring and materials from manufacturers because strong demand is 
creating bottlenecks in existing facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Twelfth District manufacturers report little change in exports 
following the recent appreciation of the dollar. For example, 
international demand for aircraft is so strong that fluctuations in 
the exchange value of the dollar have little effect on aircraft 
exports. One banker notes that current exports were contracted in 
early August when foreign prices of U.S. products were more 
favorable. Nevertheless, an electronic component manufacturer 
reports that the dollar value of his export sales has fallen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop yields and product quality are reported to be good in most 
parts of the District, although weather conditions have hurt crops 
in eastern Oregon, Utah, and pockets of southeastern Idaho. Exports, 
buoyed by strong demand from Pacific Rim countries, are reported to 
be strong for a wide range of agricultural products, including 
almonds and corn. However, grain exporters report slow sales 
following the recent dollar appreciation. Exports of beef continue 
to increase, with one Asian country currently negotiating a large 
order.
     </p>
     <p>
      The environmental controversy regarding logging of old-growth 
forests, combined with continued strong demand for exported logs, 
has reduced log supplies available to mill owners. One large mill 
reports having a 10-month supply in the pipeline, compared with a 
24-month supply a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity are reported to be strong in 
most parts of the West. The pace of activity in Utah, where activity 
had been weak for several years, appears to be picking up. Sales and 
construction activity continue strong in California, Nevada, 
Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and in much of Idaho. Finding trained 
construction workers is reported to be troublesome in most of the 
region. Bidding wars to purchase single-family homes seen in 
California a few months ago seem to have moved north to the Puget 
Sound area in Washington. However, a southern California developer 
notes that leasing activity is not keeping up with the pace of new 
office building construction. Arizona remains weak, although the 
virtual absence of building activity during the past two years has 
begun to yield net absorption of commercial and industrial space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District bankers report generally good conditions and 
significant earnings growth. Loan volume is up, with particular 
strength reported in real estate and mortgage lending. Deposits 
continue to shift away from savings and demand deposit accounts and 
toward certificates of deposit and money market demand accounts, 
increasing the cost of funds to banks. Several bankers note that 
competition for deposits is stiff, since customers are very 
conscious of yields and account fees.
