      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 16, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity has picked up in recent weeks. Manufacturing in 
the region is showing more life, reflecting better export demand and 
a reduction in import competition. Florida's citrus industry is 
prospering because of slowing imports of orange juice. Most of the 
energy sector remains depressed, but capital spending is rising in a 
few natural gas companies. Retail sales were unexpectedly strong in 
several District states, though auto sales were even weaker than 
they were in the nation in February. The region saw a moderate 
decline in single-family building permits, but builders seem quite 
optimistic that this decline was temporary. Tourism remains a strong 
positive force in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's manufacturing sector appears to be rebounding from 
recent sluggishness. Strong demand for a wide range of textile mill 
products is boosting employment. Prospects look good for further 
recovery as orders for some goods are booked into 1988. The paper 
and chemicals industries have benefited from recent restructuring 
and the decline in the value of the dollar. Prices for pulp and 
linerboard are expected to continue to rise as exports expand. 
Merger and consolidation activity are said to have increased the 
strength of domestic paper firms. The cheaper dollar has improved 
U.S. chemical producers' ability to compete in export markets. 
Spokesmen expect both exports and productivity to increase further 
in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook is not as bright for the metals and machinery 
industries. Aluminum producers anticipate 1987 to be only marginally 
better than 1986. Specialty steel mills and steel fabricators that 
have managed to remain profitable are beginning to feel the effects 
of a sagging construction market. Reduced demand for oil well 
drilling equipment continues to dim prospects for the region's 
machinery industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      February sales for most southeastern retailers were quite favorable, 
although activity in Louisiana and Mississippi remained sluggish. 
Retailers in Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee, in particular, report 
surprisingly strong sales activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regional car sales in February posted improvement from January's 
dismal activity, but they were weaker than the nation's sales, which 
declined 9.1 percent from a year ago. Over the past year market 
shares of imports have risen to about one-third of total sales in at 
least two District states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family building permits in the Sixth District have registered 
a modest downtrend recently, but builders are still optimistic about 
prospects for the single-family home market because of rising 
incomes and comfortable mortgage rates. Birmingham is enjoying some 
of the most active construction in the Southeast, and east Tennessee 
contacts report strong demand and a slight inventory shortage. 
Although there is very little construction of multifamily rental 
units, the condominium market seems to be picking up slightly. Miami 
and Knoxville realtors say current sales of condos are the highest 
in recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction continues to slow as the region adjusts to 
overbuilding. New Orleans reports drastic employment cutbacks in 
both construction and related businesses. While the Miami office 
market is glutted, demand is healthy for smaller owner-occupied 
buildings. Improved occupancy of the overbuilt retail sector in 
Jackson, Mississippi, is renewing the interest of developers who had 
fled the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After a spurt of tax-induced activity in December, January's loans 
at the District's larger commercial bank resumed the gradual decline 
of previous months. However, residential construction lending 
remains strong in Atlanta and in the larger cities of Alabama. Urban 
banks in Louisiana also report slight residential loan growth, but 
some small agricultural banks are not faring well.
     </p>
     <p>
      The region's savings and loans are generally performing well, 
although a few have had some difficulties, particularly in Louisiana 
and Florida. According to District financiers, problems can be 
attributed to several sources, including principally a heavy 
reliance on long-tern lending and weak economic conditions in 
certain areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The tourism industry continues to boost the Southeast economy. 
Contacts in New Orleans term the Mardi Gras celebration a huge 
success as hotel occupancy rates reached their highest level in five 
years. Travel to Miami has been unusually strong as the number of 
foreign visitors has surged. In Birmingham, a brand-new horse-racing 
operation opened its doors in March, welcoming thousands of eager 
racing enthusiasts. Atlanta and New Orleans are beginning to gear up 
to host the 1988 political conventions. Both cities will increase 
hotel/motel tax rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture. Forestry, and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital spending remains weak in much of the energy sector with a 
few exceptions in the natural gas industry. New construction of 
natural gas pipelines is planned for Florida and the Mobile bay 
area. The increased activity reflects deregulation in the gas 
industry and expectations that the excess gas supply will be 
eliminated and prices will improve either in late 1987 or early 
1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      Weather problems have delayed the regional production expansion that 
was expected following the imposition of the Canadian export tax on 
lumber. Very strong prices for southern pine have been 
characteristic this year, but once the weather improves prices are 
expected to fall. Demand has remained strong throughout the winter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orange producers are earning favorable returns as a result of price 
increases and reduced imports of Brazil's orange products. Although 
the domestic grapefruit market is languishing, the export market is 
flourishing thanks to the weak dollar and growing foreign 
consumption.
