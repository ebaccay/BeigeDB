      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 3, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity is reported generally improving across much of the 
Twelfth District, but California's economy remains sluggish. 
Relatively weak conditions also are reported in western Washington, 
affected by retrenchment in aerospace, and Hawaii, undergoing a 
slump in the visitor industry. In contrast, conditions are strong in 
eastern Washington, Utah, Idaho, and Nevada, and favorable 
conditions are reported in Oregon and Arizona. In California, 
weakness continues in aerospace and defense-related manufacturing 
and construction. Some improvement is reported, however, in 
California's electronics and retail trade sectors, and continued 
strength is reported in sectors such as motion pictures and 
agriculture. While contacts in California indicate more positive 
signs than in previous reports, the overall picture remains weak, 
particularly in the south.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders shows some 
improvement from our August report. About two-thirds of the 
respondents expect the real economy to expand during the next four 
quarters at a rate at or above trend growth. This proportion is up 
from one-half in August and July, and returns to the proportion seen 
in early 1993. Most other respondents expect the economy to expand, 
but at a rate below trend. Several contacts report that capital 
spending and hiring plans are being delayed due to uncertainty 
regarding medical costs. Lower interest rates are reported to have 
done little to change capital spending plans in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity is reported generally improving. One large District 
retailer reports that October sales have been stronger than August 
and September, with earnings strong and inventories coming down. The 
same contact reports "no inflation on the horizon" in its cost 
structure. Another major retailer also reports slightly better sales 
in October--especially in California. The retailer reports that 
activity in Utah remains quite strong, but that it is still soft in 
Washington. Demand for autos and consumer durables is reported 
strong by contacts in several areas--in part due to lower interest 
rates. Auto dealers in Idaho report product shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in service-related industries are mixed. Contacts report 
high-end restaurant closings in southern California. A contact in 
telecommunications reports especially weak conditions in southern 
California. The motion picture industry, however, remains strong. 
Outside of California, most service-producing sectors are doing 
well. However, cutbacks in government are reported in several 
states, and visitor industry conditions remain weak in Hawaii.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is mixed in the District, with weakness 
centered is aerospace and defense-related industries. Cutbacks in 
these industries are reported continuing in Arizona, California, 
Utah, and Washington. Some announced aerospace layoffs in 
Washington, however, have been deferred until next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other manufacturing industries show signs of improvement. In 
southern California, demand for transportation equipment is 
expanding due to light rail projects and new bus orders. High-tech 
industries are reported improving in Oregon and Washington. In Idaho 
and Utah, production of computers, semiconductor chips, and software 
is reported strong. A contact in northern California reports strong 
demand for electronics, and double-digit growth in components of 
communications equipment. Medical electronics, however, is reported 
weak due to the uncertainty of health care reform. Furthermore, 
strong final demand in electronics is not being reflected in 
increased hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts report a generally favorable outlook for agriculture. 
Contacts report that the livestock industry is doing well, despite 
some recent lower prices for and feeder cattle. Grain prices are 
reported somewhat higher. In California, acreage is up because the 
end of the drought has increased water supplies. In the Pacific 
Northwest forestry industry, volume is reported down due to public 
harvesting restrictions, but profits are reported up for private 
owners of timber. A contact in Idaho agriculture reports strong 
conditions for vegetables, fruits, and cattle--but some weakening in 
aquaculture, fishing, and seafood.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District construction us real estate markets are mixed. Housing 
starts, housing sales, and commercial real estate activity are 
reported soft in southern California. Prices in high-end residential 
areas are reported down 30 to 40 percent from peak levels, and 
medium-range housing is reported down 15 to 20 percent. Contacts in 
northern and central California also report depressed conditions in 
most real estate sectors. Low interest rates, however, are reported 
to have stimulated some low-end housing construction in California. 
Publicly-funded heavy construction also has fared relatively well 
during the state's downturn. A contact from Tucson reports strong 
sales of existing homes, strong new construction, and low vacancy 
rates for apartments. Contacts expect construction conditions in
Oregon and Alaska to strengthen over the next year. In Oregon, 
construction conditions are tight with shortages reported for labor 
and supplies. Conditions in Utah and Idaho remain strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Varied conditions are reported across District financial markets. In 
California, loan volume is reported flat and additional layoffs were 
announced by financial institutions due to recent consolidation. 
Stronger conditions are reported elsewhere. For example, in Oregon, 
banking conditions remain strong, with deposits and loans reported 
up and loan delinquencies reported down. A contact from Utah reports 
that lower interest rates have led to considerable corporate 
refinancing, but have not stimulated new loan demand and new 
investment spending. Contacts in several areas report that mortgage 
refinancing activity is increasing again.
