      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 23, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest developments in the District remained basically mixed but 
marginally more positive than in other recent months. Most 
department store contacts said sales were better than expected in 
July, and on or better-than plan in August. Office leasing activity 
continued at a moderate pace and the vacancy rate in midtown 
Manhattan declined, though the downtown rate edged higher. While 
still at high levels, District unemployment rates fell in August 
after increasing in July and reports from purchasing managers in 
Buffalo showed substantial improvement in both production and new 
orders. Conditions in the residential construction market remained 
mixed. Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized 
banks noted no change in their willingness to lend but said that 
demand continued lackluster.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most stores said sales were better than expected in July and on or 
better-than plan in August. Year-to-year changes ranged widely--from 
+2 to +14% in July and from -6 to 13.5% in August. While sales gains 
were reported to be somewhat smaller in August than in July, this 
was due, at least in part, to this year's late Labor Day, shifting 
much of the back-to-school buying into September.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for women's and men's apparel was strong in both July and 
August and new fall styles and fabrics were said to have sold 
particularly well. Several contacts stated that the unusually cool 
summer may have been conducive to trying on and buying for the fall 
and winter since outerwear items also sold briskly. Respondents were 
generally satisfied with their inventory levels which, for the most 
part, are on plan or slightly below. Contacts are cautiously 
optimistic about some modest sales improvement in upcoming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the residential construction market continued mixed in 
recent weeks with homebuilders in upstate New York reporting 
stronger buyer interest than those downstate and in New Jersey. Most 
builders anticipate some improvement this year relative to last 
year's dismal performance but nothing approaching a housing boom. An 
encouraging note for the future is that several projects which had 
long been stalled for various reasons are now being revived. In 
Westchester County, for example, the initial foundations have 
recently been poured at a 153-unit townhouse project which was 
mothballed some five years ago, while in Somerset County, work has 
begun on a 125-unit townhouse complex initially proposed 12 years 
earlier. In Monmouth County, new developers have already obtained 
some contracts for a 113-unit single-family project at a site 
reclaimed by the lending bank from the original developer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity continued at a moderate pace since the last 
report and the vacancy rate on commercial buildings in midtown 
Manhattan declined. Downtown, however, the rate on primary buildings 
edged higher as downsizing at financial institutions continued. With 
the City's vacancy rates remaining at high levels, plans to 
construct four new office towers as part of the redevelopment of the 
Times Square area have recently been put on indefinite hold. 
Instead, the area is to be revitalized and renovated with major 
tourist attractions and retail establishments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although still at high levels, District unemployment rates declined 
in August after increasing in July. New York's rate fell to 8.5% in 
August from 9.4% in July and New Jersey's declined to 9.4% from 
9.8%. Despite the August drop in District unemployment rates, 
nonfarm employment has continued to decline though the pace of 
decline appears to be slackening somewhat. With regard to the 
outlook, recent announcements have been for employment changes, up 
and down, that are rather modest in size. Fedders will be closing 
two New Jersey plants, affecting about 150 workers and Spaulding 
Composite will be idling about 300 when it closes its plant in the 
Buffalo area by yearend. On the other hand, an electronics firm near 
Syracuse will add about 100 workers as it expands into two new 
product lines and a Corning Inc. plant that makes converters for 
removing auto exhaust pollution may be expanding to converters for 
emissions from diesel engines and factory smokestacks as well. 
August reports from purchasing managers in Buffalo showed 
substantial improvement in both production and new orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the District indicated that their willingness to lend remained 
steady relative to two months ago. A majority of respondents 
reported that while overall loan demand remained soft, demand for 
residential mortgages increased. Consumer loan demand continued to 
be weak, attributed in part to a decrease in demand for automobile 
loans. One reason cited for this decline was the surveyed banks' 
inability to compete with the lower rates of automobile financing 
companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      All respondents reported either maintaining or lowering loan rates. 
A majority of officers indicated that delinquency rates on mortgages 
and commercial and industrial loans have not changed during the past 
two months. Although deposits continue to shift from maturing 
certificates of deposit into more liquid savings accounts, the trend 
was not as prevalent among surveyed banks as two months ago.
