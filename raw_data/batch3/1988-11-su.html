     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 30, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts report continued economic growth, but at an 
apparently slower pace than in previous months. Only Dallas, St. 
Louis, and Kansas City report generally sluggish business conditions 
and cite persistent weakness in many sectors. Much of the activity 
in the faster-growing Districts appears to be generated from strong 
exports and a steady demand for capital goods. The brisk production 
pace continues to be supported by growing new orders. Wage increases 
are moderate, although labor markets continue to be tight. Capacity 
pressures, and consequently price pressures, have reportedly eased 
slightly in several industries, including paper, chemical, steel, 
and textiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Improvement is noted in the drought-stricken Districts, except 
Dallas, as damage estimates are revised downward and more favorable 
weather improves soil conditions. Residential construction is 
sluggish throughout most of the Districts, but nonresidential 
construction remains brisk in several Districts. Retail sales are 
slow, but some optimism is expressed about prospects for the holiday 
shopping season. The moderate increase in loan demand has been 
driven primarily by strong commercial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report flat to moderate sales as they enter the holiday 
shopping season. Several Districts in the eastern half of the 
nation, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland, 
express optimism about the apparent turnaround in women's apparel, 
which has been particularly weak for several months. However, 
department store managers in Cleveland and Philadelphia expect price 
increases to dampen to some extent the recent rebound in apparel 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories generally remain light, as retailers anticipated the 
recent sluggishness in sales and continue to be cautious in stocking 
shelves for the winter months. Merchants in Kansas City, 
Minneapolis, and Philadelphia report that inventories are at 
acceptable levels. Only Richmond reports that inventories, 
especially in large departments, were higher than desired.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the slim inventories, many retailers are pursuing widespread 
discounting. However, Philadelphia managers report that the price 
discounting is in line with their planned pricing strategies. 
Several Districts, including Kansas City and Cleveland, report some 
pressure on wholesale prices, which may squeeze even further the 
profit margins of these businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers express guarded optimism about sales prospects for the 
holiday season. New York, Minneapolis, and Kansas City merchants 
anticipate good holiday sales, especially compared with the post-
October consumer sentiment of last year. St. Louis and Philadelphia 
managers were less optimistic and expect only slight increases from 
a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales are sluggish in most Districts, except for reports 
of strong sales in Chicago and Minneapolis. Philadelphia, Richmond, 
and Kansas City report expanding inventories, which could prompt 
more dealer incentive and rebate programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All Districts report expanding production, but many report a slower 
rate of growth than in previous months. Traditional durable-goods 
industries show considerable strength, even more so than many "high-
technology" industries. Cleveland reports that strong capital-goods 
demand and rising exports have fueled rapid advances in 
nonelectrical machinery and primary metals. Chicago and Atlanta also 
note strength in durables and steel production. Boston, Dallas, and 
San Francisco, on the other hand, report sluggishness in defense and 
computer-related industries, especially electronic equipment 
manufacturing and semiconductors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The expansion in manufacturing continues to be supported in most 
Districts by rising new orders. However, some of the pressure on 
capacity has been eased, as evidenced by a reduction in the backlog 
of orders and shorter delivery times.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many industries, including paper, chemical, and aerospace, are still 
operating at or near capacity. San Francisco reports that capacity 
constraints are clearly evident in the commercial aircraft industry. 
Atlanta reports that the chemical industry is running close to 
capacity, bidding up wages for skilled labor and creating tight 
supplies of ethylene and propylene. However, these same Districts 
also report some retreat from the high levels of capacity seen 
earlier in the paper, textile, and apparel industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite general tightness in many District labor markets and reports 
of shortages of skilled workers, only moderate wage increases have 
been observed. Cleveland reports that area compensation managers are 
budgeting about the same level of wage and salary hikes for the 
coming year (4.6 percent) as granted in 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices continue to increase in many sectors, but do not appear to be 
as large or as widespread as recorded in previous months. Chicago 
reports that upward pressures on steel prices have eased after sharp 
increases earlier. For the first time in several months, less than 
half the purchasing managers surveyed in Cleveland report general 
commodity price increases. Manufacturers in the Atlanta District say 
they have not increased their prices because domestic competition is 
strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only a few Districts mention plans to increase capital spending. 
Boston mentions plans for several new plants in their District, but 
notes that overall capital spending plans are mixed. Chemical, 
textile, and nonelectrical machinery manufacturers in the 
Philadelphia District have announced planned increases for both 
modernization and capacity expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Forestry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought-ridden areas generally report improving conditions as fall 
rains begin to replenish soil moisture. Some Districts are revising 
downward earlier estimates of crop damage. Chicago reports that crop 
yields are slightly higher than earlier estimates. More current 
estimates show corn production to be 41 percent lower and soybeans 
29 percent lower than last year in the District. St. Louis reports 
that conditions continue to improve as recent rains have benefited 
the winter wheat crop and have improved pastures. Kansas City also 
reports that the severity of the drought has been revised downward. 
Lenders in that District expect strong farm incomes from higher 
prices and anticipate little change in loan repayment rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dallas is the only District reporting worsening drought conditions. 
Many pastures and ranges are bare, and without significant rainfall 
this winter, the cost of supplemental feeding may threaten the 
profitability of cattle operations in some parts of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      San Francisco reports that the demand for lumber and plywood has 
fallen in recent weeks, causing prices to erode slowly. However, log 
and timber prices remain firm due to continued exports. Atlanta 
notes that foreign demand for hardwoods by Japan and the United 
Kingdom has helped support prices of hardwood logs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing construction remains slow in most Districts except for a few 
isolated pockets of strength. Richmond reports fairly strong demand 
for single-family homes, and San Francisco notes relatively brisk 
activity in California, Oregon, and Washington. New York attributes 
the weak demand for new homes and a slow resale market in much of 
their District to persistently high prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several Districts find relatively brisk activity in nonresidential 
construction. St. Louis notes that the expansion of nonresidential 
construction exceeds the national rate. Atlanta attributes the 
increase in warehouse and industrial construction in their District 
to strong exports. Chicago reports vigorous commercial building 
activity in downtown Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan activity among Districts ranges from flat to moderate. 
Philadelphia reports good loan growth, particularly for commercial 
lending, but notes some easing in recent months. St. Louis and 
Kansas City record weak loan demand, on the other hand. San 
Francisco reports continued competition for quality loans and cites 
some reports that credit requirements are being relaxed in order to 
attract additional business. However, despite the relatively low 
loan volume in the San Francisco District, many financial 
institutions show improved net income.
