      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 22, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District appeared to be steady in 
late December and early January, based on reports from major 
business sectors. Manufacturers generally indicated that business 
was steady although some firms were trimming working hours. For most 
retailers, Christmas season sales were even with the prior year in 
current dollars.
      <br/>
      This was below expectations, and many stores were 
holding special January sales to reduce inventories. Bankers 
reported that loan demand remained essentially flat except for a 
surge in mortgage refinancing applications in recent weeks as 
interest rates fell.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District business contacts generally foresee some improvement 
later in the year. Manufacturers expect the pace of orders to pick 
up over the next six months. On balance, they are planning to add to 
payrolls and boost capital spending by midyear. Retailers anticipate 
a somewhat better sales picture, but not before the third quarter. 
Bankers are also looking to the second half for improvement; they 
expect a modest upturn in business and consumer lending to get 
underway then, although some believe residential mortgage activity 
could post healthy gains this spring with an increase in home sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District manufacturers in early January were 
mixed, but on balance suggested that industrial activity was running 
at a steady pace. While shipments were moving up, area firms 
indicated that new orders were being received at just a level rate. 
Manufacturers gave mixed reports on inventories although it appeared 
that, on net, stocks were edging down. While employment was 
practically steady, according to a majority of companies contacted, 
one-fourth noted recent reductions in working hours. Nearly all 
manufacturers said prices for both inputs and the products they make 
were holding steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, about three-fourths of manufacturers contacted for 
this report expect business to improve by midyear, and the rest were 
about evenly divided between those anticipating steady business and 
those expecting a decline. Overall, manufacturers look for an 
increase in orders to boost backlogs and lead to some further 
reduction in inventories over the next six months. In tine with this 
forecast, industrial firms in the Third District are planning to 
extend working hours and increase payrolls slightly. They are also 
scheduling some increases its capital spending for the first half of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Third District retailers contacted for this report indicated 
that sales for the Christmas season were below their expectations. 
On average, sales were approximately even with 1990 in current 
dollar terms. Mass merchandisers and department stores generally saw 
sales slip marginally from 1990 levels while discounters and some 
specialty stores (especially mid-priced jewelry and apparel stores) 
posted gains. Nearly all types of stores were making further price 
cuts on a broad range of goods in January to reduce excessive 
inventories, and most merchants said that the pace of sales in the 
first week of the month was fairly steady. Store officials generally 
expect January sales to exceed the low levels of January 1991, but 
most expect the current November-January fiscal quarter results to 
just match the year-ago period in current dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers expect sales to remain slow at least until midyear. 
They hope that improving overall economic activity by that time will 
boost consumer confidence and lead to healthier sales. Nevertheless, 
many retail contacts do not expect a strong upward trend in 
consumption spending to develop. Expecting little short-term 
improvement in demand, and concerned that competitive pressures due 
to over-capacity will continue, store executives do not anticipate 
significant increases in revenues. Instead, many indicate they will 
be looking to improve operating efficiencies in order to bolster 
profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Third District bankers contacted in early January said loan 
demand remained soft except for a surge in applications for mortgage 
refinancings. Although there were a few reports of slight upturns in 
home purchase mortgages, mainly for lower-priced homes, real estate 
loans outstanding at major banks in the Third District continued to 
trend down. Bankers also described demand for consumer installment 
credit as flat to slightly down in recent weeks. Bankers generally 
reported a similar trend for commercial and industrial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the whole, Third District bankers expect a gradual improvement in 
the economy and a slow pickup in lending to get underway around 
midyear. Bank lending officers said the recent decrease in interest 
rates will make debt service more manageable for business borrowers 
with floating-rate loans, leading to some improvement in credit 
quality for both current and potential borrowers; but bank lending 
officers generally do not expect the lower rates to prompt a 
significant upturn in demand for commercial and industrial credit. 
Some bankers said they expect increased homes sales in the spring to 
boost mortgage demand.
