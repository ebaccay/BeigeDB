      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Moderate growth characterizes most sectors of the Third District 
economy as the summer begins. Manufacturing activity is expanding 
slightly in June, for the third month in a row; and, in a change 
from recent months, durable goods manufacturers are making greater 
gains than nondurable goods producers. Retailers report that May 
sales ran ahead of plans and that strong consumer demand is 
continuing into June. Automobile sales, however, are weak. Bankers 
note that real estate lending remains strong and that commercial and 
industrial lending picked up in May and June. Consumer loan demand, 
however, is growing at the same slow pace that has marked recent 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is generally 
optimistic. A slight majority of the manufacturers polled in June 
expect further expansion in the next two quarters. Area merchants 
are encouraged by the pace of sales this spring and they forecast a 
good summer. They also express confidence that sales will remain 
healthy for the rest of the year. In contrast, automobile dealers do 
not expect any improvement this year. Bankers expect business 
lending to grow modestly, but they do not foresee an acceleration in 
consumer loan demand. Although bankers say pressure on net interest 
margins has eased somewhat recently, slow growth in deposits has 
prompted concern about the cost and availability of funds later in 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing
Industrial activity is up slightly this month, according to the most 
recent Business Outlook Survey. Nearly one-third of the companies 
covered by the June survey report increased business, while one-
fifth say their business is off from May; about half are operating 
at a steady pace. Business is improving for durable goods producers, 
but is mostly stable for makers of nondurables. Although the 
difference is slight, it marks a reversal of the sectoral pattern 
observed in earlier months this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most indicators of manufacturing activity in June reflect the trend 
of moderate growth experienced so far this year. Shipments by local 
manufacturers are rising and new orders are up, but not by a 
comparable amount. Consequently, order backlogs are slipping. 
Employment is steady, with most firms reporting no changes in either 
payrolls or working hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices in the region are generally stable, although there 
is some upward movement in input costs. While most of the companies 
surveyed in June indicate steady prices for the goods they purchase, 
40 percent reported higher charges compared to May. Most firms say 
they are holding the line of the prices of their own products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, just over half of the survey respondents foresee 
continued growth this year. Overall, area manufacturers expect 
further gains in orders and shipments, and they expect declining 
order backlogs to stabilize. On balance, their capital spending 
plans call for higher outlays during the next six months. 
Nonetheless, employment is expected to decline slightly over the 
next two quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all area retailers contacted in early June reported strong 
sales in May continuing into June. Sales at all types of stores are 
running ahead of last year, with increases ranging from 5 to 10 
percent. Department store officials say quality apparel and upscale 
merchandise generally are their best performing product lines. They 
are emphasizing these goods in their product mix because of their 
relatively greater selling margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      The strength of consumer demand this spring, following good first 
quarter results, is leading store officials to raise sales forecasts 
for the summer. Most merchants expect sales: for this period to run 
nearly 10 percent above last summer, and they expect similar results 
for 1987 as a whole. However, some discount store executives are 
concerned that stepped-up promotions and price markdowns may become 
common later in the year as individual competitors attempt to 
maintain and enlarge their market shares.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales in the Third District are running parallel with 
national trends. Unit sales vary from up slightly to down 
substantially at domestic franchises, and inventories exceed desired 
levels for nearly all makes. Nevertheless, dealers selling U.S. -
made cars have not discounted prices yet, and this, combined with 
lower operating expenses, is limiting the current impact of slower 
sales on their profits. However, import dealers' profits are 
declining as gross sales fall. Dealers expect the pace of sales to 
slip a bit further before stabilizing for the balance of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth at major Third District banks picked up somewhat in May 
after slowing in April. Total outstanding loan volume in late May 
was approximately 3 percent above year-end 1986, and 10 percent 
above last May. Most of the growth is attributable to real estate 
and commercial lending. Real estate lending has been strong for the 
past 12 months, and bankers say that active real estate markets and 
profitable land development projects in the region continue to 
provide opportunities to make sound loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial loan growth increased in May. Bankers say 
that their marketing efforts are bringing in good loans from local 
businesses. They are putting relatively more floating-rate loans on 
the books, and they say that net interest margins, which had 
contracted recently, are now improving.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some area banks are promoting consumer loans aggressively, and they 
report gaining substantial amounts of new business. Overall, 
however, the lower growth rate in consumer lending that local banks 
first noted last fall is continuing. Lending officers contacted in 
June said that credit card lending is flat and other installment 
lending is up only slightly. The rapid growth in home equity lending 
that followed the introduction of this product appears to have eased 
also.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly all bankers say deposit growth has not met expectations. This 
is especially the case with long-term (one year or more) 
certificates of deposit. Bankers believe higher rates on 
alternatives to bank accounts have led to disintermediation in 
recent months. Several mentioned the possibility of declining 
liquidity in the banking system toward the end of the year. 
Anticipating this, asset/liability managers are attempting to 
lengthen the maturities of their liabilities, and some banks have 
introduced floating-rate CDs or raised rates to attract longer-term 
money.
