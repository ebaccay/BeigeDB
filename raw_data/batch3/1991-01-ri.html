      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity weakened further in late December and 
early January. Sales activity was slow for District retailers, 
manufacturers, realtors and auto dealers. Manufacturers apparently 
decreased production and home builders started relatively few 
houses. Financial institutions reported weak loan demand, and hotels 
and resorts experienced a downturn in occupancy. On a positive note, 
export volume increased again at District ports, and the region's 
farm sector was healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to our post-Christmas mail survey of retailers indicated 
that Christmas and post-Christmas sales were disappointing. A 
majority of the respondents reported that Christmas sales were below 
year-ago levels, and many stores also reported declines in shopper 
traffic and sales of big ticket items. More than nine out of ten 
retailers indicated that they had employed fewer workers than last 
Christmas, and about two-thirds indicated that they had reduced 
their prices as December progressed. Retail inventories apparently 
changed little over the survey period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity fell in December according to our 
regular mail survey. Weakened demand was apparent as orders and 
shipments declined from November levels, and manufacturers cited 
poor sales as their biggest problem. Responding firms cut back 
production, employment, and their workweeks. The prices they paid 
for raw materials rose.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturers believed that the business climate declined 
nationally and locally in late December and early January. They 
expected little improvement over the next six months, and only a 
third foresaw increased profits for their businesses in 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District ports -- Baltimore, Charleston, and Hampton Roads (Norfolk) 
-- indicated that exports rose while changes in import volume were 
mixed in December compared with November and a year earlier. All 
ports expected export growth to outpace import growth over the next 
six months. Hampton Roads reported that its coal exports were at a 
record pace in late 1990.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing sales were generally weak in December, according to our 
telephone survey of District realtors. Sales of new homes were poor, 
but sales of existing homes remained stable. Also, sales of 
expensive homes slowed more than sales of modestly priced homes. 
Realtors indicated that housing prices had changed little over the 
past month, although they noted some decrease in higher-priced 
homes. Looking ahead, realtors expected home sales to increase, 
especially in the more expensive segment of the market. Realtors 
predicted that lower interest rates and a quick resolution of the 
Mideast crisis would boost buyer interest and sales in 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our telephone survey of home builders indicated that housing starts 
slowed more than usual in December. A majority blamed lower home 
sales for the slowdown. Builders indicated that many homeowners were 
remodeling and adding to their existing homes rather than building 
new ones. Few builders expected conditions to improve over the next 
three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hotels, motels and resorts throughout the District indicated that 
tourist activity had declined considerably compared with previous 
winters. Most respondents experienced declines in bookings, which 
they attributed to the downturn in the economy, bad weather for 
skiing, increases in fuel prices and the Mideast crisis. A majority 
expected tourist activity to worsen in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial institutions contacted by telephone indicated that real 
estate and commercial loan activity weakened in December and early 
January. A majority of institutions suggested that the slowness 
resulted from sluggish loan demand and not from more stringent 
credit criteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lenders indicated that the prime rate and other interest rates would 
have to drop at least one percentage point further to boost loan 
demand. They noted that much of December's borrower traffic 
consisted of loan inquiries and business loan refinancings rather 
than new loan applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other District contacts suggested that consumers may be suffering 
from financial stress. These contacts cited increases in auto 
repossessions and home foreclosures. Also, according to surveys 
conducted by several District newspapers, many pawnshops indicated 
that their loan activity was increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Budgets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our discussions with state government budget forecasters indicated 
that all five District states and the District of Columbia were 
either experiencing or expecting revenue shortfalls. They blamed the 
shortfalls on their deteriorating economies, which they attributed 
to several factors including the Gulf crisis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Serious revenue shortfalls were reported in Virginia, Maryland, 
North Carolina, and the District of Columbia. In these 
jurisdictions, most major categories of tax receipts either were 
declining or growing only sluggish South Carolina noted a modest 
shortfall while West Virginia's revenues were still considered 
adequate. Both of these states, however, expected lower revenues in 
the months ahead. Respondents said lower-than-expected revenues were 
only part of the problem. They also cited overly ambitious spending 
plans, federal and judicial spending mandates and rising health 
insurance costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      State budget analysts were not encouraged by the outlook. A Maryland 
official expected improvement soon; most others were hesitant to 
forecast a turnaround in the near-term future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to farm analysts, conditions in agriculture were generally 
good as of mid-January. The condition of small grain crops planted 
last autumn was reported to be above average due to warmer-than-
normal temperatures and abundant soil moisture. Feed and forage 
stocks appeared adequate and were expected to be more than 
sufficient to last the winter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our contacts suggested that the financial condition of District 
farmers remained strong, but some expressed concern that higher 
production costs may squeeze profit margins in the year ahead.
