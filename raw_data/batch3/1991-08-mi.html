      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District has continued to feel the effects of the national 
recession, but there are signs of recovery. Labor market conditions 
have continued to improve, while retail sales have exhibited 
moderate growth. Conditions in construction and resource-related 
industries have remained mixed, while manufacturing has shown signs 
of rebounding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions generally improved in the District, but 
still remained depressed. Minnesota's unemployment rate fell to 4.8 
percent in June, down from 5.5 percent in the previous month, and 
only slightly higher than the 4.6 percent level of a year ago. May 
unemployment figures, while somewhat lower than in April, were still 
above their year ago levels in Montana, western Wisconsin, and the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The May unemployment rate in Montana 
was 6.4 percent, 1 percent above its year ago level. In the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan the May unemployment rate was 10.4 percent as 
compared to 8.5 percent a year ago. South Dakota's May unemployment 
rate of 3.4 percent was unchanged, both relative to the previous 
month and year-ago levels. In North Dakota, by contrast, the May 
unemployment rate of 4.2 percent was 0.5 percent higher than the 
previous month, but only 0.6 percent higher than a year ago. The 
growth of nonagricultural employment in May relative to its year ago 
level was fairly strong in North and South Dakota, 1.2 and 2.6 
percent respectively, but generally weak in the rest of the 
District, rising by 0.3 percent in Minnesota, and 0.4 percent in 
Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers of general merchandise report slightly higher 
sales figures for June relative to year-ago levels, (figures are for 
the five-week period ending July 6) with sales increases in 
comparable stores ranging from 2.3 to 8 percent relative to a year 
ago. Minnesota sales tax receipts were down 6.2 percent in June, but 
up 2.6 percent in May relative to year-ago levels. Retail sales in 
North and South Dakota, as well as in Montana, continue to benefit 
from the strong influx of Canadian shoppers.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car and truck sales continue to be weak, though used cars show 
some improvement, and dealers report that their service departments 
are running close to capacity. Dealers report new car sales declines 
ranging from 5 to as much as 40 percent at some small dealers for 
the first half of this year relative to a year ago. However, 
recreational vehicle and boat sales are reported to be strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing sales in the District have been mixed lately. The depressed 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area experienced a surge in May, with sales at 
their highest level in three years. However, June sales were down 
9.6 percent relative to a year ago, and 23.2 percent from May, with 
the change being attributed to a recent rising cost of FHA-insured 
mortgages. Home sales are reported to be especially strong in parts 
of South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist activity has been strong in the District. The number of 
crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan relative to year-ago periods were up 3.6 percent in the 
first 22 days of July, and up 3.4 percent in the first half of the 
year. Bookings in Montana's Yellowstone National Park are up 
substantially from their year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's construction industry have been mixed 
with the large overhang of office space in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
area depressing local activity. The office vacancy rate in downtown 
Minneapolis and St. Paul was 13.6 and 20.1 percent respectively in 
the second quarter of this year, and is expected to rise as current 
construction projects are completed. The number of housing permits 
issued in Minnesota rose by 7 percent in May relative to a year ago, 
but was still slightly below its level of two years ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the District's manufacturing industries appear to be 
improving. In Minnesota, the total hours worked in manufacturing 
rose 1.4 percent in April from March, but was still 0.6 percent 
below its year ago level. The level of new business incorporations 
in the state was down 6 percent in April from March's all time high, 
but was still 18 percent above the year ago level. The medical 
industry is reported to be doing well, while the computer and 
electronics industries are holding steady, and the aircraft supply 
industry has slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions have been mixed lately with some parts of 
the District receiving badly needed moisture while others have been 
hurt by excess precipitation. In southern Minnesota, 18 counties 
were declared to be a natural disaster area. In Montana, North and 
South Dakota, small grains and feed crops are in good shape. Prices 
of cereal grains were slightly higher while livestock prices were 
lower in June as compared to May. The Montana and Minnesota farm 
price indexes were respectively 2.0 and 13 percent lower in June as 
compared to a year ago. Ranchers in the District continue to do well 
due to cattle prices which are still high despite recent declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the District's mining and lumber industries have been 
fairly good. Lower inventories of lumber have led to higher prices.
