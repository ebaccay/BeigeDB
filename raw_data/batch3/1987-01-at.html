     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in the Southeast continues at a moderate pace. 
Service employment gains are strong. but manufacturing job gains are 
weak. Holiday spending was checkered because oil patch weakness 
somewhat offset gains in areas benefiting from strong population and 
income growth. Home building's momentum may be slowing, and weakness 
in office building is causing overall commercial construction to 
shrink. Tourism continues to boost the regional economy. In 
agriculture, bountiful crops depressed vegetable prices and grower 
profits but raised revenues for citrus producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor force growth outpaced employment growth in November, 
and the region's unemployment rate edged upward to 8.1 percent. The 
unemployment rate has hovered near 8 percent since April. Job gains 
in services maintained the momentum of previous months as business 
and health services posted especially strong employment gains over 
the past year. Employment in the real estate sector also has 
continued to expand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity has registered little overall change for most 
sectors since September. Although textile and apparel imports were 
at record levels in 1986, mergers, consolidations, and the closing 
of inefficient mills have resulted in a more productive and 
competitive domestic textile industry. Mills are running at 92 
percent of capacity, up 9 percent from last year, and textile 
employment has turned up. Labor-intensive apparel producers are 
bearing the brunt of import competition; apparel employment is down 
by 7,900 workers just in the last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Appliance producers report record levels of shipments due to the 
strong housing market. Printing and publishing companies have been 
adding to job rolls as savings and loans, brokerage houses, and 
banks offer new financial services that require checks and 
documentation. The transportation equipment sector continues to add 
jobs on the strength of auto sales and aircraft parts production. 
Weakness in energy drilling activity continues to batter Louisiana; 
employment in oil and gas extraction fell by about 22,600 workers 
last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Holiday consumer spending was sluggish in Louisiana and Mississippi, 
while retailers elsewhere in the region posted moderate sales gains 
that generally met expectations. Because of limited markdowns, most 
retailers expect their 1986 profit performance to be somewhat better 
than in 1985. Merchants reportedly were very satisfied with 
inventory levels at the end of their fiscal year and were generally 
optimistic about the outlook for 1987 despite fears that some buyers 
may be overextended.
     </p>
     <p>
      District car sales rebounded sharply in December from the sluggish 
pace of October and November, largely in response to the well-
advertised sales tax deduction advantage of purchasing a new vehicle 
before January 1987. Ford Motor Company's sales in the Southeast 
soared 45 percent in December, matching the company's strong car 
sales growth nationally. For all of 1986, Ford sales in the 
Southeast and the nation were off 3.3 and 0.2 percent from 1985 
levels. Because fewer incentives are available to maintain consumer 
interest, the 1987 car sales outlook is uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      November marked the second successive monthly decline in single-
family building permits, perhaps foreshadowing a construction 
slowdown in the region. However, single-family houses in the medium 
price range of $80,000-$120,000 still are selling very well, and 
rising land costs, coupled with improved home affordability, have 
prompted some builders of lower-priced homes to move into the 
medium-priced housing market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although overall commercial construction is slowing, retail 
construction has continued at a healthy pace, spurred by continuing 
population in-migration. Occupancy rates are high at new shopping 
centers in Birmingham and Atlanta, and few lease rate concessions 
are being given. In Tampa, a slowdown in retail construction has 
helped boost occupancy rates and effective lease rates, while new 
store openings have caused a glut in New Orleans. Industrial 
construction over the past year has been strongest region-wide in 
the high-tech office and warehouse space segment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth at large regional commercial banks continued to edge 
downward in November as consumer lending experienced its largest 
drop-off since July. Increased competition from non-bank 
institutions and slow economic growth have contributed to the 
consumer lending performance. Real estate lending has remained firm. 
The market for home equity loans continues to surge at about the 
same fast pace reported for the nation. December automobile loans 
undoubtedly grew sharply with the year-end acceleration of car 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Travel to the Southeast, particularly by auto, remained strong in 
November; hotel/motel tax receipts for most of the southeastern 
states posted double-digit year-over-year increases. Hotels in parts 
of Florida experienced occupancy rates near capacity during the 
holiday season. Moreover, advance room bookings in Florida are up 4 
to 5 percent from last year. To date, the fifteenth anniversary 
celebration at Disney World has been a huge success and is expected 
to continue to boost attendance through next October. Convention 
business also is posting favorable gains throughout the Southeast.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional coal production fell 15 percent in 1986 from 1985's 
depressed level; Alabama's production decline was much greater than 
Tennessee's. Strong competition from cheaper oil and natural gas led 
to lower coal prices, reduced production, and losses for mining 
operations. Oil price stability stimulated well drilling in the 
District even before the current price rise. The number of oil rigs 
operating at year's end was the highest since last May and 23 
percent more than last summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Extremely favorable weather in late 1986 over much of Florida's 
vegetable producing area has resulted in a bountiful winter harvest, 
especially of tomatoes. Unfortunately, vegetable prices reportedly 
are below production cost for many growers. Florida's citrus farmers 
are faring better with a larger crop than last season because prices 
are holding up better.
