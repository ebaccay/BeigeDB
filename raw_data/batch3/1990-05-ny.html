      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy since the last report 
have again been mixed, with no clear signs of overall strengthening 
or weakening. Homebuilders report some increased buyer interest with 
the arrival of spring, and the pace of office leasing has been good 
in many areas. Sales results at District department stores were 
mixed, however, in recent weeks and unemployment rates showed little 
change. Most officers at small and medium-sized banks noted an over-
the-year weakening in commercial loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results at District department sales were mixed in recent 
weeks with some at or above targeted levels and others falling 
below. Year-to-year changes during February range between -3 percent 
and +8 percent while the March range was -9 percent to +15 percent. 
To obtain a clearer picture of their Easter season performance, 
however, most respondents intend to look at the continued March and 
April results since the holiday occurred a month later this year 
than last.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, women's apparel continued to be the strongest selling 
item with some retailers noting a pickup in men's apparel as well. 
Sales of furniture and some furnishings tended to be sluggish, 
however, though one contact reported strong demand for floor 
covering and bedding. Inventories are generally on target, due in 
part to cautious stocking for the spring season. Merchandise is 
reportedly still below desired levels at some Campeau stores, though 
most suppliers have now resumed shipments to them. With the recently 
begun liquidation of yet another District department store chain and 
the closing of many small Financial District stores in the wake of 
the cutbacks in that area, some contacts expressed concern about the 
local retail industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders report some increased buyer interest with the 
arrival or spring, but most expect that regional housing starts will 
decline further in 1990. In the face of a continuing glut of 
existing homes for resale and, in some areas, a number of new houses 
and condos on the market as well, additional price markdowns and 
other concessions are being fostered in much of the New York 
metropolitan area and further reductions are seen as possible. 
However, in upstate and western New York, where demand remains 
relatively strong, home prices increased at double digit rates in 
some areas during 1989 and the uptrend is expected to continue this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of office leasing has recently been good in much of the 
District, with tenants reportedly availing themselves of generous 
landlord concessions. However, as substantial amounts of both new 
and existing space continued to be marketed, Manhattan office 
vacancy rates moved somewhat higher. As a result, reactions have 
been mixed to the announcement that, after a six-year legal battle, 
New York State has finally acquired most of the 13-acre site for the 
redevelopment of the Times square area. While the transformation of 
that badly deteriorated area is generally applauded, many critics 
are apprehensive because the plan includes the addition of four more 
large office towers in the midtown area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates showed little change in March. New 
Jersey's rate rose 0.2 percentage point from February to 4.7% while 
New York's rate was unchanged at 5.0%. While these rates remain 
below the national average, they have deteriorated both absolutely 
and relative to the nation over the past year. A recent U. S. 
Department or Labor report stated that job growth in New York State 
fell to a 7-year low in 1989 due to a faltering downstate economy 
and major manufacturing losses throughout the state. A positive 
development for District employment is General Motor's announced 
plans to spend $140 million retooling its Linden, New Jersey plant 
for the production of light trucks. The plant had been scheduled to 
end auto production next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The March survey or Buffalo purchasing managers showed an increase 
in the percentage or firms reporting improvement or stability in 
production and new orders. Eighty percent of the managers noted 
stable input prices, up from 64 percent in February. The Department 
of Labor study mentioned above cited Buffalo as one of three 
metropolitan areas in which most of New York State's job growth 
occurred in 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from firms in the Second District suggest that in most 
instances operations have not been affected by any shift toward more 
restrictive lending practices. While some manufacturers and 
homebuilders noted a withdrawing of credit lines and increased 
collateral requirements, others, especially in upstate and western 
New York, have seen little or no evidence of credit tightening.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Based on a survey of senior officers at small and medium-sized banks 
in the Second District, demand for commercial loans is weaker than a 
year ago. Most bankers agreed that the general decline in interest 
rates over the last year failed to stimulate much loan activity, and 
cited the weak economy and cautious investing as the main factors 
for falling demand. One banker noted that any interest-rate-induced 
increase "would have teen offset by the current economic climate". 
When asked if any particular sectors showed unusually strong or weak 
demand, two-thirds of the bankers cited a weakness in real estate 
and manufacturing loans, while a couple noted strength among 
retailers. Almost all respondents described their local economies as 
stable or weak. Signs of weakness cited were higher vacancy rates, 
more delinquent loans, contracting real estate markets and layoffs. 
The two bankers who characterized their economies as strong also 
described them as diversified. When asked about expectations of 
future loan demand, the majority of the bankers forecasted stable or 
lower demand. The bankers anticipate weak real estate markets and 
cautious attitudes by both investors and lenders for the remainder 
of 1990.
