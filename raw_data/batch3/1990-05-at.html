      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our contacts continue to report steady growth in the Sixth District 
at a pace that shows, on balance, a little slowing from that of last 
year. They note that prices of most raw materials have been steady 
in the past few months, and there are no signs of added wage 
pressures. Manufacturers of consumer durables continue to report 
weak demand for their products, while producers of chemicals note 
strong business activity. Retailers report modest increases in sales 
from a year ago, with apparel sales being particularly strong. Real 
estate markets are described as being generally soft, and lenders 
are said to have become increasingly cautious in financing new 
building projects. Exports of raw materials and natural resources 
are reported to be strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices of raw materials arc generally reported as stable. A 
manufacturer of chemicals and plastics reports that the prices of 
chemicals used in construction and of some input chemicals like 
benzene are down slightly this year. A producer of heating and 
cooling equipment noted that aluminum prices continue to fall slowly 
but that copper prices are now steady. Several of retailers in the 
District indicate that they see no significant increases in their 
prices. A furniture distributor pointed out that there has been no 
upward pressure on prices from manufacturers because of weak demand 
for furniture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Few employers reported any new wage pressures, and most indicate 
that they are seeing wage increases of about 5 percent at most. The 
cost of employee health benefits, however, remains high and is still 
increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the chemical industry continue to report strong demand 
for most of their products, especially from the paper and pulp 
industry. One manufacturer noted that exports of chemicals to the 
Far East have been down recently, owing to new plants in Korea and 
Taiwan, but that exports to Europe continue to increase. He added 
that because of strong domestic demand, his firm was increasing 
capital spending substantially over 1989's level to modernize 
equipment and expand capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel producers report that they expect their sales to increase as 
consumers spend less on autos and other durable goods. A carpet 
manufacturer expects 1990 to be a good year for the carpet industry 
because replacement demand should continue to support sales. He 
explained that carpet tends to be replaced in roughly ten-year 
cycles. Because 1979 was a very strong year, they are now seeing 
increases in replacement demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the aerospace industry expect an increase in layoffs as 
a result of budget reductions at the Department of Defense. Firms in 
Georgia and Florida reported the largest cutbacks in employment. 
Aerospace firms related to the space program, however, report 
increased hiring as a result of renewed growth. Florida, Alabama, 
and Louisiana are gaining jobs as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retailers indicate that sales in March met or exceeded 
their goals and in real terms were slightly above year-ago levels. 
They also expect the modest real growth to continue for the next few 
months. Contacts point out that apparel sales have been very strong 
in comparison to durable goods like appliances and furniture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers note that sales have been slightly below year-ago 
levels recently. But because they have been able to reduce their 
inventories and, therefore, interest costs, several large dealers 
said that profits are up over last year. A few dealers expect that 
sales will be up slightly this year, and some dealers noted that a 
few popular models are in short supply. Nevertheless, contacts 
continue to report that small dealers, particularly those in 
nonmetropolitan areas, are not doing well and that many have gone 
out of business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several home builders have reported that residential construction 
remains weak after an abnormally strong January. A number of 
contacts indicate that housing sales throughout Florida are down 
substantially compared to a year ago. Commercial developers 
mentioned that the value of nonresidential construction is up over 
last year, but they added that most of the strength has been in 
public building projects in Florida and Georgia. Office construction 
remains subdued in much of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Developers and builders across the District pointed out that it is 
becoming more difficult to obtain financing for new real estate 
projects. Much of the reluctance on the part of lenders has been a 
response to overbuilt markets, but builders are now saying the 
increased surveillance by the Comptroller of the Currency is adding 
to the already cautious lending attitudes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Domestic oil drilling remains steady, and most contacts do not 
expect significant growth in the next few months. Several producers 
in Louisiana felt that increasing environmental concern is 
discouraging new drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      Exports of coal, kaolin, wood pulp, and chemicals are reported to be 
holding steady or increasing. Few contacts indicated that the recent 
strengthening of the dollar had affected their exports 
substantially. They pointed out that the reliability of U.S. 
suppliers and long-term contracts are more important in determining 
the volume of exports than are short-term movements in exchange 
rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent cold weather has delayed planting of some crops and has 
damaged some of the new peach and apple crops. Farmers expect to 
increase substantially the acreage devoted to cotton while reducing 
soybean acreage. On balance, southeastern farmers plan to return a 
large share of idle land to production because of higher prices for 
cotton and some grains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Except for real estate credit, none of our contacts indicated a 
direct experience with tightening credit conditions. Some contacts 
report a reluctance on the part of financial institutions to engage 
in further real estate lending given the overbuilding which has 
occurred in most markets. One indicated that a financial institution 
withdrew support for the second and third phases of an office 
complex and others reported higher collateral requirements and 
interest rates on proposed projects. With regard to business and 
consumer lending, however, credit is said to be available as usual.
