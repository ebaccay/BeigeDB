      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts in the Sixth District, economic activity edged 
higher in September and October, though the pace was more sluggish 
than in August. Manufacturers indicated that industrial production 
slowed somewhat across the District. Apartment development and 
commercial construction remained slow, but home builders and 
realtors again reported healthy activity in single-family markets. 
Retailers reported moderate increases in sales of both durable and 
nondurable goods. Business and consumer loan demand has been flat, 
and contacts reported that the recent wave of mortgage refinancings 
has begun to subside. Wages and prices have remained stable and 
several firms indicated that recent attempts to raise product prices 
have not been successful.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported moderate sales increases in September and early 
October. Consumer expenditures continue to be concentrated on 
purchases of nondurable items, but retailers noted that sales of 
durable goods have also shown some improvement. Although most 
merchants expect upcoming holiday sales to surpass weak year-ago 
levels, they are monitoring inventories closely and are determined 
not to enter the holiday season with excess accumulations. Auto 
dealers continued to report mixed results, but a growing number saw 
sales increases in September compared with month-ago and year-ago 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism remains a bright spot in the Sixth District economy. 
Contacts reported that air passenger traffic, particularly 
international arrivals, is significantly above year-ago levels. 
Convention attendance has exceeded 1991 levels and industry contacts 
indicated that advanced bookings through mid-1993 offer the promise 
of another good year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With some notable exceptions, factory activity in the District has 
slowed somewhat in recent weeks. According to industry contacts, 
economic weakness in Europe has reduced the demand for exports while 
cutbacks in federal contracts from the Department of Defense and 
NASA have also dampened the demand for manufactured goods. Contacts 
also cited the slow pace of the national economic recovery as an 
additional source of the poor demand for industrial products. 
Nevertheless, a majority of manufacturers contacted remain 
optimistic that business conditions will improve over the next 
several months and relatively few firms have reported reductions in 
labor force levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although there has been a general lull in industrial production 
across the District, there are some exceptions. Producers of 
building supplies, carpeting, and other home furnishings have seen 
an increase in new orders as a result of the hurricane rebuilding 
effort. Apparel manufacturers have also reported increases in new 
orders and production for moderately priced goods, particularly 
denim products. However, rather than hiring new workers to meet 
higher production levels, most firms reported that they have simply 
increased the number of hours worked by existing employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After taking into account seasonal variations, realtors reported 
that single-family home sales have been relatively good in most 
parts of the District. Sales are still concentrated in the low-to-
mid price range, and contacts noted that there is persistent 
weakness at the upper end. Abundant inventories of existing homes 
for sale have kept prices relatively stable. Builders reported that 
single-family home construction has continued at a steady pace, and 
some builders have seen an increase in speculative building. 
Builders and realtors are cautiously optimistic for the fourth 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Multifamily construction remains slow in most areas. Even though 
several contacts noted improvement in occupancy rates, effective 
rental rates remain too low to justify new building. Similarly, new 
commercial construction activity remains weak, with speculative 
office building close to zero.
     </p>
     <p>
      In south Florida, realtors reported that the hurricane rebuilding 
effort is underway. According to contacts, a majority of activity is 
concentrated in residential construction, and some expect it to take 
up to three years to rebuild all destroyed homes. Contacts also 
reported that vacancy rates in Miami's central business district 
have fallen temporarily as firms have taken short-term leases while 
damaged facilities are repaired.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers around the region reported that loan demand was flat or up 
slightly in September and early October. The recent wave of mortgage 
refinancings has peaked, but many loans remain in the processing 
pipeline, waiting to be closed. Contacts reported that commercial 
loan activity was flat in most areas of the District but that 
consumer lending activity has increased slightly. Contacts in Miami 
have seen an influx of new deposits from insurance settlements 
related to hurricane damages, but as of yet there has not been much 
change in commercial or consumer loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most firms reported that their materials input prices were unchanged 
in recent weeks. Although some firms have attempted to raise the 
prices of their final products, competitive pressures have made it 
difficult to sustain these increases. And because of the relative 
slackness in District labor markets, there have been no reports of 
increasing wage pressures.
