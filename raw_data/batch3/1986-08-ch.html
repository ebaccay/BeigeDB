      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of activity in the District, overall, continues short of 
the nation. Employment in the five states has been about flat since 
early 1986, compared with growth for the country as a whole. 
Illinois and Iowa are about even with a year ago, in contrast with 
2-3 percent growth in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Hardly anyone 
is expecting a recession and 1987 is expected to see improvement. 
Manufacturing jobs have fallen more sharply since January in the 
District than the nation. Purchasing managers in Chicago report 
continued though slower growth in production through June, but 
Milwaukee buyers say output, orders, and backlogs have slipped 
substantially. Bright spots in the region's economy remain 
residential building and sales, and related spending on appliances 
and furniture. Tourism is up strongly according to reports from 
Michigan and Wisconsin. Auto sales are at a high level, supported by 
manufacturers incentive programs, and company projections indicate 
1986 will be very close to last year's record for car/truck sales 
combined. Heavy trucks are down sharply. Capital goods remain weak. 
Nonresidential building remains robust but is beginning to show 
signs of slipping, particularly renovation work. A diversified 
producer of consumer and industrial goods indicates that the 
improvement in demand expected in most lines has not developed. The 
District has seen excellent crop growing conditions, in contrast 
with the devastating drought in the Southeast. Crop prices have 
declined sharply in recent weeks, in anticipation of a large 
harvest. Livestock prices have risen, and livestock farmers are also 
benefiting from lower feed costs. District farmland values continued 
to fall in the second quarter, but not as fast as in earlier 
quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential building boom continues in many parts or the 
District. sparked by lower mortgage rates, though some areas remain 
depressed. Contracts, in square feet, in the five states were up 31 
percent in the first half from a year ago, but to about two-thirds 
of the 1978 level. In the Chicago area, both single-family and 
apartment construction are sharply higher this year. Apartment 
vacancies are described as low here, in contrast with some other 
parts of the country. Heavy resales and refinancings continue to tax 
facilities. A large backlog of mortgage loan applications slows 
processing and closings. There are few takers for adjustable rate 
loans, quoted rates as low as 7.75 percent in the Chicago area 
versus around 10.5 percent commonly quoted on 30-year fixed-rate 
loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There are signs of emerging weakness in commercial construction. 
Work on new office buildings continues at a very vigorous pace, but 
starts on several large commercial buildings in the Chicago area 
have been delayed recently. Some have been rebid, with new bids 
often lower. Renovation of existing commercial structures has 
slowed. Some observers are increasingly concerned about rising 
vacancies at the many suburban "strip" shopping centers currently 
under construction or built in recent years. Others are optimistic 
that the vigorous rise in residential construction is creating a 
need for this additional retail space. Demand has picked up for 
Chicago-area industrial space, primarily for warehouse and 
distribution use rather than manufacturing. Speculative building has 
increased, from very low levels a few years ago. District-wide 
nonresidential construction contracts in this year's first half were 
17 percent above a year earlier, in square feet, with only Iowa 
lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major general merchandise retailer reports that sales have 
continued at good levels, with appliances and home furnishings 
strong, and apparel relatively weak. The share of goods bought on 
credit has fallen slightly, and credit delinquency rates are down 
moderately. Wisconsin tourism officials say activity and inquiries 
are up 7 to 30 percent, and expect a "banner year". Airline travel 
(revenue passenger miles) is up helped by lower fares.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of autos and light trucks remain near record levels, supported 
by low interest rates offered by captive finance companies of major 
auto makers. These cut-rate financing programs are placing strains 
on various groups. An auto leasing company complains that it can no 
longer sell its used cars profitably because demand has been 
diverted to new cars. A trade group of consumer lenders is seeking 
to have the programs declared illegal on anti-competitive grounds. 
Sales of medium trucks are ahead of a year ago, but heavies are down 
to a rate of around 120,000 units, versus 140,000 last year. 
Deregulation has greatly improved efficiency in trucking. As current 
heavy truck production is far short of industry capacity, shutdowns 
of 2 plants in other parts of the country may do little to ease 
pressures on District producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Order trends suggested a "normal" seasonal decline in mill shipments 
from the second quarter to the third. For the year, an industry 
analyst expects shipments nationally to decline to about 72 million 
tons this year from 73 million in 1985. Raw steel production is 
expected to fall more because of increased use of continuous 
casting, which yields a higher ratio of finished product. The share 
of raw steel produced in the Seventh District this year 
(approximated by AISI's Chicago and Detroit districts, through mid-
July) has slipped to 36.1 percent of the nation from 36.7 percent in 
1985. Steel for autos and construction continues at good levels, 
capital goods remain weak, and the oil/gas market is in a state of 
collapse. Customers have been shifting orders away from steel 
companies that have not settled their labor contracts—currently, 
USS. Industry observers view the bankruptcy filing by LTV Corp as 
ominous for a relatively inefficient large Chicago mill.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of capital goods remain weak. Machine tool orders, which had 
recovered partially from recession lows, have again dropped below 
shipments, eroding backlogs. Recent weakness is attributed partly to 
uncertainties over tax law changes. A major District machine tool 
maker has announced further substantial staffing cuts. Sizable 
layoffs also have recently been announced or are expected at a 
producer of paving equipment and a maker of lift trucks in the 
District. Markets for industrial diesels remain very depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District farmland values declined again in the second quarter, but 
the rate of decline continued to slow. Preliminary results from our 
latest survey of agricultural bankers indicate that District 
farmland values declined nearly 2 percent in the three months ending 
June 30. The latest drop compares to declines of 3 percent in both 
the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 1985, and 4.5 to 6 
percent in the first three quarters of 1985. Credit conditions at 
District agricultural banks reflect weak farm loan demand, ample 
liquidity for lending, a high proportion of problem farm loans, and 
declining interest rates. As of midyear, interest rates charged by 
agricultural banks on farm operating loans averaged just over 11.75 
percent, down 85 basis points from 6 months earlier and 110 basis 
points below a year ago.
