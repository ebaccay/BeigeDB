      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District economic growth slowed somewhat in recent weeks. A majority 
of retailers surveyed reported lower-than-expected sales and 
homebuilders noted a slackening of momentum in the market for both 
new and existing homes. The movement in September unemployment rates 
was mixed, however, and office vacancy rates fell in many parts of 
the District. Senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized 
banks reported that overall loan demand remained mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although year-over-year sales results varied widely at District 
retail stores during September, a majority of contacts reported that 
sales were somewhat below plan. They attributed the shortfalls in 
part to unseasonably warm weather during much of the month which 
deterred buying of outerwear and much of the new fall apparel. 
Several chains noted a decided pickup in apparel sales with the 
return of cool weather in early October. Most respondents stated 
that goods for the home sold well in September and some, with a 
smaller concentration of apparel, reported better-than-expected 
sales results.
     </p>
     <p>
      Year-to-year sales results in September ranged from flat to +9 
percent among surveyed retail chains in the District. Items 
mentioned as selling well in addition to goods for the home were 
women's accessories and cosmetics, and men's suits and sportscoats. 
Early in the month back-to-school merchandise did well. Despite some 
buildup in inventories as a result of slower-than-planned sales, 
respondents were generally comfortable with inventory levels but 
intended to monitor them closely.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders reported a recent slowing of momentum in the 
market for both new and existing homes. One respondent described 
this year's activity as unusually volatile with traffic and sales up 
and down like waves. Most contacts expect that, on balance, District 
housing starts will show little change this year from last year's 
level. The current lackluster activity was attributed by several 
respondents to the continued downsizing by major corporations in the 
region with a resultant negative impact on consumer confidence. 
Higher interest rates were cited as another depressing factor, 
though apparently not a major one since contacts noted that rates 
remain at historically moderate levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity was sufficiently brisk to lower vacancy 
rates in many parts of the District during the third quarter. The 
biggest drop was in the 11-county northern New Jersey area where the 
rate fell by almost a percentage point between June and September. 
Rates were down by smaller amounts in Fairfield County, (where 
vacancies were at their lowest level in five years), in Westchester 
County and on Long Island. However, vacancy rates backed up a bit in 
both midtown and downtown Manhattan from August to September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates were mixed in September as New York's 
rate fell to 6.2 percent from 6.9 percent in August while New 
Jersey's rose from 6.0 percent to 6.7 percent. Several major 
employers announced additional employment cutbacks or reiterated 
their earlier plans to do so. Among those planning payroll 
reductions in the thousands are IBM, Northrop Grumman, Nynex, New 
York City government and the brokerage industry (taken as a whole). 
Despite earlier comparably-sized corporate cutbacks, however, 
District nonfarm employment has been growing fairly steadily for the 
last several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several developments occurred in recent weeks which should impact 
positively on the District economy. Ground was broken for two mixed-
use projects which have joint public and private sponsorship: a $2.3 
billion development in Queens combining residential, commercial and 
retail components, and a $200 million retail and residential project 
in downtown Brooklyn. Additionally, the Port Authority of New York 
and New Jersey announced an $800 million plan to rebuild the largest 
terminal at Kennedy Airport.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the area of entertainment and tourism, MTV will develop a studio 
complex in three adjoining Times Square theatres and Disney has 
expressed interest in another 42nd Street theatre. New York City has 
been the location for several new movies in recent months following 
several years of little moviemaking, and the number of tourists and 
hotel occupancy rates in the City reached their highest levels in 
several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in the 
District reported that overall loan demand remained mixed. The 
largest declines in activity occurred in the residential mortgage 
and refinancing segments. More than half of the banks experienced 
lower demand for residential mortgages and over three-quarters 
reported less or no refinancing activity. The commercial and 
industrial loan segment saw the largest increase in activity, with 
demand higher at almost one-half of the banks. Consumer loan demand 
also showed a slight improvement. Loan rates have generally 
increased, though a few banks lowered rates on residential 
mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      While more than half of the surveyed officers noted no change in 
their willingness to lend, over one-third reported increased 
willingness. Very few banks changed their credit standards, and 
almost all reported stable or lower delinquency rates. About one-
half of the loan officers noted a smaller spread between the average 
lending and deposit rates following recent increases in deposit 
rates.
