      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 3, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic developments in the Second District were generally mixed in 
recent weeks. A majority of retailers reported disappointing sales 
results during August, but some improvement in September. District 
homebuilding activity showed little change, with only a slight 
pickup in traffic and contracts in some areas. Office leasing 
activity has strengthened somewhat and primary vacancy rates 
declined in several parts of the District. The latest surveys of 
purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester presented a mixed 
picture. Unemployment rates remained above the national average in 
September. Most senior loan officers at small and midsized banks 
indicated no change in their willingness to lend over the last 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A majority of retail respondents reported disappointing sales 
results during August but said that sales improved in September with 
the return of more seasonable weather. Retailers noted that the 
weather remained quit warm during August and consumers were not 
particularly responsive to the new fall merchandise. With the onset 
of cooler weather during September, there was a pickup in apparel 
sales as well as strength in items for the home. September sales 
results at most stores were generally on or better than plan and 
early October data indicated a continuation of this pattern. 
However, a few chains reported that sales of women's apparel 
remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales results ranged from .5.5 percent to +10 percent 
in August and from -2.7	percent to + 12 percent in September. Most 
stores reported satisfactory inventory positions, with only one 
stating that stocks were a little high. Regarding the outlook for 
the holiday season, all respondents spoke of strong gains last year 
and the likelihood of much smaller year-to-year increases this 
Christmas. Citing consumer concern about continuing employment 
cutbacks and a consequent unwillingness to spend freely, most 
District retailers are planning for increases of 3 to 5 percent over 
last year's holiday sales, with one respondent noting that no change 
over last year was a definite possibility.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilding activity showed little change in recent weeks, 
though a slight pickup in traffic and contracts was reported in some 
areas. Larger builders reportedly are doing well, but some smaller 
builders are still finding it difficult even to obtain construction 
loans without a signed contract from a buyer. Acquisition and 
development loans remain virtually impossible to obtain. Low 
mortgage rates and relatively attractive home prices are stimulating 
demand, although less than some builders had anticipated earlier in 
the year. With continuing layoffs in some local areas and additional 
ones still being announced for the future, many would-be buyers 
remain cautious about committing themselves to the purchase of a new 
home. Observers were almost evenly split between those anticipating 
higher and lower housing starts this year compared with last.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity picked up momentum in recent weeks, and 
primary vacancy rates declined in several parts of the District, 
including midtown and downtown Manhattan and northern New Jersey. 
The largest decline--reportedly more than one percentage point over 
the June to September period--occurred in Fairfield County. 
Connecticut where much larger blocks of office space have been 
renting recently in place of the smaller 2000-20,000 square foot 
leases that had been the norm over the preceding three years. Office 
vacancy rates on Long Island rose, however, as downsizing firms 
marketed a large amount of space. Moreover, throughout the District 
vacancy rates remain at high levels even with the recent 
improvements.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates in the District continued to exhibit a good deal 
of volatility but remained above the national avenge. New York's 
rate fell in September so 7.1 percent from 7 9 percent in August 
while New Jersey's rose to 7.7 percent from 7.1 percent in August. 
Both rates are well below their year-ago levels of around 9 percent. 
Almost all of the decline, however, reflects a reduction in the 
labor force rather than an increase in total employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
presented a somewhat mixed picture. Buffalo reported higher 
percentages of firms with increases in both output and new orders 
while there was a drop in the percentage of Rochester firms stating 
that general business conditions had improved. The percentage of 
Rochester firms anticipating gains over the next three months rose 
substantially, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of the relatively few recent announcements concerning employment in 
the District, Martin Marietta will retain a Syracuse area complex 
and move some 300 jobs from Maryland to that facility, and two other 
firms are also expanding in Syracuse. In addition, Kodak announced 
that it will open a national service center in Rochester, bringing 
together its customer service operations from various parts of the 
country. On the negative side, three drug companies with 
headquarters and/or manufacturing operations in the District 
announced that they plan to eliminate a total of 7000 additional 
jobs over the next three years. No details were given as to the 
specific locations of the cutbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District indicated that their willingness to lend was 
unchanged from three months ago. One-quarter of respondents 
expressed an increased willingness to make loans, although a much 
smaller percentage of them reported easing credit standards. Overall 
loan demand was firm to slightly improved. Demand for residential 
mortgages, especially for refinancings, exhibited particular 
strength. Many officers mentioned that they were increasing 
advertising or lowering loan rates to help stimulate demand. 
Interest rates on loans were steady or lower, following market 
trends for the most part. In addition, almost all respondents 
reported either a stabilization or a moderate decline in loan 
delinquency rates during the preceding three months.
