      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts continue to report generally slow growth throughout the 
Southeast, with little change reported in comparison to the last 
report. They report weakness in some raw materials prices and wage 
increases similar to the current inflation rate. Manufacturers 
indicate no further weakening except in the auto related industries. 
Retailers report some gains in sales relative to last year, although 
demand for durables remains weak. Contacts in the construction 
sector continue to cite overbuilding in most markets. Exploration 
for natural gas in the Gulf is reported to be increasing. District 
lenders and borrowers are reporting a tightening of credit standards 
for real state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of industrial contacts have indicated that the prices of 
some raw materials have been falling recently. One said that 
aluminum and copper prices have been dropping, in contrast to the 
tight markets seen last year. Several pulp and paper producers have 
commented that the prices of input chemicals have remained unchanged 
or have been weakening. A producer of polyester fibers notes that 
slowing carpet demand has recently resulted in falling prices for 
synthetic fiber.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most employers reported that wages have been rising at roughly the 
rate of inflation. A few shortages of skilled workers were 
mentioned. A builder in the Jacksonville area said that skilled 
construction workers were in short supply. Several contractors and 
oil-rig operators in Louisiana also continue to report shortages of 
skilled workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers said they were having no trouble with deliveries from 
their suppliers. Several added that their suppliers had been giving 
them a better selection of products at lower prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several automobile plants in the Southeast are laying off workers or 
closing completely. A number of contacts noted that the slowdown in 
auto production is also hurting suppliers. Several producers of 
parts and tires have closed or are laying off workers in Alabama and 
Tennessee. A fabricator of aluminum auto parts says that the demand 
from domestic auto producers has softened recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Textile and apparel producers report no further weakening from last 
month, while paper producers report that business is up somewhat 
compared to a year ago. One contact revealed that his backlog of 
orders currently is up 30 percent over the same period last year. 
Another reports continued strong shipments of boxes and linerboard. 
Two producers in Mississippi noted that their firms have recently 
modernized and increased efficiency. One felt that the improvements 
would help their competitiveness overseas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the District are generally reporting small increases in 
the inflation-adjusted value of sales in February compared to a year 
ago. Although they felt that sales in January and February were 
encouraging, they remain uncertain about the rest of the year. 
Several contacts noted that women's apparel and electronic products 
were selling well. A few retailers said, however, that sales of 
consumer durables, particularly furniture, continue to be below 
year-ago levels, and they do not expect much improvement soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several auto dealers explained that the uptick in sales in January 
was unexpected and that sales in February were again weak. Most 
dealers said they do not expect much improvement for the rest of 
1990. Almost all dealers indicated that excess inventories have been 
successfully worked down and now stand at levels lower than last 
year at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts continue to report a slow commercial construction market. 
They cite previous overbuilding and slower employment growth as 
reasons for weakness. Several developers have noted that while the 
demand for speculative buildings is down, the demand for owner-
occupied or signature type buildings and public buildings is still 
quite strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction was strong in January, but several builders 
said that this was due to unseasonably warm weather and are 
expecting declines in new starts and building permits. Many contacts 
are reporting that desired reductions in inventories of residential 
units are just beginning, particularly in Tennessee and Louisiana. 
They do not expect construction to pick up much until 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      The disposition of the RTC's residential assets was frequently 
mentioned as adding to uncertainty in real estate markets. Several 
developers stated that it is now more difficult to get bank 
financing, and they expect that new capital requirements and limits 
on how much a particular savings and loan can lend to a developer 
will keep the supply of loans tight. They added, however, that most 
of the tightness in lending has so far been the result of overbuilt 
markets rather than of the savings and loan problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several bankers noted that overall growth in consumer loans has 
weakened in the past several months, although home equity loans are 
still increasing. A few bankers asserted that consumers appear to be 
paying off some of their outstanding debt. Other bankers added that 
problem real estate loans have caused a tightening of real estate 
credit standards. Problems associated with real estate loans are 
expected to persist in 1990 but at a level somewhat lower than in 
1989. Several contacts in Louisiana expect a pickup in commercial 
and residential lending, although they will be starting from a very 
low level of activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural contacts are reporting that the post-freeze vegetable 
crops in Florida are doing well and that prices may be back to 
normal by mid-March or early April. They expect prices of citrus 
products to remain high throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil drilling continues to expand slowly. Domestic producers are 
reporting that they are shifting their exploration budgets more 
towards natural gas.
