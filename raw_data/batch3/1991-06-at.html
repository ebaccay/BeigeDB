      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business contacts in the Southeast indicate a slight improvement in 
economic activity in May compared with both year-ago and recently-
increasing monthly levels. Home sales are said to be remaining on an 
upward trend. Reports on retail sales and manufacturing suggested 
scattered improvements, though the majority of contacts indicated 
softness. The export sector, which is comparatively small in the 
District, displayed continued strength. Heavy rains in the Southeast 
have cut into the sales of several agribusinesses and limited crop 
plantings of cotton, soybeans and peanuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from most retailers indicate that the consumer spending 
increases posted in recent months have stalled, not meeting their 
previous expectations. Contacts report that they have seen no real 
improvement in May sales from recent months and posted only 
marginally higher sales from weak year-ago levels. About three out 
of four retailers reported that May durable goods sales were at best 
even with last year's levels, with the exception of slight increases 
in appliance and automobile sales. Overall, they still anticipate 
increases in activity, although they have become less confident 
about these expectations. As a result, most merchants continue to 
keep inventories lean.
     </p>
     <p>
      The travel and convention industry is providing some boost to retail 
and service sales. Industry contacts in Atlanta, New Orleans, and 
Orlando all report continued increases in bookings and visitors from 
recent months and year-over-year. Increases in the number of 
tourists from foreign countries were also noted. A Georgia contact 
said that restaurant sales and other travel-related services account 
for most of a recent slight pickup in retail sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Over half of District producers contacted in early June indicated 
continued flat or declining sales and persistently soft orders. 
Auto- and auto-related producers, business supplies manufacturers, 
poultry processors, and producers of bed and bath fabrics report 
particular weakness. All have responded with further reductions in 
inventories, although less than half report additional layoffs. 
Excessive rains in the Southeast have exacerbated conditions for 
agribusinesses providing farming equipment and supplies, 
fertilizers, and lawn care. Contacts do not expect to make up these 
lost sales later in the season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other producers indicate that orders in May picked up from the 
depressed levels of recent months. Orders for home-related 
merchandise remain firm, and according to industry contacts, apparel 
and apparel-related textile production and employment levels turned 
up slightly in May in response to recently increased orders. Over 
half the container producers contacted reported increases in orders 
for paper and some types of plastic packaging. Several other 
manufacturers have reportedly expanded hiring in response to the 
improvement in business volume over recent months. A trailer 
manufacturer has recently hired additional people in a move to 
expand Georgia operations, while a refrigeration unit producer 
called back laid off workers during the past two weeks. In addition, 
lumber contacts said that exports have recently picked up from their 
previously depressed levels. Export tonnage of pulp, paper and 
citrus products continue to increase in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of bankers report that consumer and business loan 
demand remains anemic overall, with the exception of strong 
residential mortgage lending. Despite generally weak business loan 
demand, bankers did note that some service industries such as health 
care and telecommunications have shown increased borrowing needs. 
One also said that recent gains in tourism in New Orleans are 
leading to expansion in related service industries. Bankers report 
that loan quality is stabilizing or improving slightly. Although no 
bankers indicated changes in credit standards, several business 
contacts said that their borrowing terms have become more favorable 
recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to most realtors, new and existing home sales continued to 
rebound in April and May, although about half noted that home sales 
have fallen back slightly in recent weeks. Builders reported that 
improved home sales have led to increased construction activity, and 
a few Alabama builders are now even starting to talk about building 
speculative homes. However, three out of four homebuilders report 
that tight lending conditions are still restricting a rebound. 
Nonresidential construction remains weak although the pace of 
decline has slowed. Contacts attribute this easing to rising public 
construction and the start of several large commercial construction 
projects that had been able to bypass tight lending conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts say that they are not having any trouble hiring workers or 
recalling laid off employees. Wage demands have subsided 
considerably in Louisiana's oil industry. An expected abundant beet 
crop has depressed sugar prices while high cotton prices are 
adversely affecting textile industry profits. Waterlogged fields 
have limited planting of cotton, soybeans and peanuts this spring. 
Some contacts expect reduced crops and higher prices to result. 
Linerboard, pulp and corrugated packaging prices are all currently 
depressed as a result of short-term oversupply conditions in the 
industry.
