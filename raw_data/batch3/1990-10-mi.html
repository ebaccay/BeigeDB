     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 31, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District economic conditions have been showing signs of 
weakness recently. Labor market conditions have been mixed. Growth 
in spending on general merchandise has slowed down lately, 
automobile sales have been sharply lower, and housing activity has 
declined. Conditions in the construction industry and in 
manufacturing have been mixed. Resource-related industries have been 
doing well. Wage and price increases have remained generally 
moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions have been mixed in the district. Minnesota's 
unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in August, down from July's 4.6 
percent level but up from 4.0 percent in August 1989. Unemployment 
rates in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota were lower in 
August than in July and also lower than in August 1989. 
Manufacturing employment in the district has been flat for over a 
year. Production, construction, and electrical workers are reported 
to be in oversupply, but shortages are reported for medical and 
hospital workers. The nationwide slowdown in residential 
construction has resulted in layoffs among housing construction 
suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases have remained moderate except for technically skilled 
specialists whose wages have been rising sharply. The main source of 
pressure on labor costs has continued to be from benefits, mainly 
health insurance and workers compensation premiums. However, some 
directors report that they are expecting sharply higher wage 
increases beginning next year. Price increases, except for fuel 
costs, have generally been moderate. Trucking companies have begun 
to impose surcharges to recoup their sharply higher fuel costs. An 
index of prices received by farmers has declined substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers of general merchandise report a slight slowdown 
in sales growth lately. One major retailer reports that, compared to 
a year ago, September sales were up 2 percent and sales in the first 
9 months of the year were up 4 percent. An appliance retailer 
reports that September sales were 4 percent higher this year than 
last. Retailers report that they are less optimistic about sales in 
the fall season than they were before the Gulf Crisis. Throughout 
the district, inventories are reported to be at acceptable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales have been sluggish. Dealers for one manufacturer 
report that September new car sales were 20 percent lower than a 
year ago. However, last September's sales were artificially boosted 
by incentive programs. These dealers expect October sales to be much 
better when compared with last year. Automobile sales, however, have 
generally been lower this year than last. Through the first 7 months 
of the year, Minnesota's new car and truck registrations were down 
13.3 percent from last year. This decline has been concentrated in 
the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Sales in the rest of the 
state have held up fairly well compared to last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing starts have declined sharply in Minnesota. The number of new 
housing permits issued in that state was 25 percent lower this 
August than last. The decline was primarily concentrated in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area where the number of new 
housing permits declined by 37.7 percent over the same period. In 
the first eight months of this year in this area, the number of 
permits issued has been the lowest since 1982. However, housing 
sales have been robust in the metropolitan area. Housing activity 
elsewhere in the district has been moderately good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the district's construction industry have been mixed, 
with particular weakness in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan 
area. In that area, the dollar value of contracts for future 
construction in August was 16 percent lower than in August 1989. 
There is a substantial oversupply of office and commercial space, 
and very few projects are expected to be started for at least a 
couple of years. Elsewhere in the district, construction activity 
has been moderately good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the district's manufacturing industries have been 
mixed lately. The computer and electronics industries in the 
district are reported to be in a recession. Sales of recreational 
vehicles are reported to be 25 percent lower this year than in 1989 
and 40 percent lower than in 1988. However, aircraft industry 
suppliers report that their sales are 30 percent higher this year 
than last, and the medical instruments industry is reported to be 
growing strongly. This industry expects a 10 to 15 percent growth in 
sales next year from this year's strong levels. Defense industry and 
ordnance suppliers have recently seen a sharp pickup in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's resource-related industries appear to be fairly 
healthy. Crop yields throughout the district have been above 
expectations and close to record setting levels. Recent declines in 
agricultural product prices have prompted farmers to store crops 
rather than sell them. Ranchers in the district report that this 
year has been the best in their experience. Livestock prices have 
been holding fairly steady and feeding costs have been relatively 
low. The mining industry has also been doing well. However, the 
lumber and wood products industries have begun to feel the. effect 
of the slowdown in home construction.
