      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments have varied among sectors of the Second District 
economy since the last report with no clear sign of overall 
deterioration or improvement. Department store sales were generally 
on plan and the pace of office leasing was good. Demand for new 
homes remained mixed, however, and purchasing managers in Buffalo 
and Rochester noted some flattening of new orders and overall 
business conditions. Senior officers at small and midsized banks 
reported demand for home mortgages slowed over the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported over-the-year sales gains during October 
which ranged from 1.4 percent to 11.6 percent. These results were on 
or slightly above plan though a couple of respondents described 
their sales as somewhat disappointing. Sales during the first half 
of November were generally on target and retailers are cautiously 
optimistic about the month as a whole. Women's apparel and junior 
sportswear continued to be the strongest selling items though 
unseasonably warm weather was blamed for slower-than-usual sales of 
winter apparel. Jewelry and cosmetics also sold well but sales of 
furniture and home furnishings remained sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      The current level of inventories was characterized as manageable by 
most department store contacts though one retailer reported stocks 
above desired levels. In addition, some District stores that are 
subsidiaries of financially-strapped companies are reportedly 
somewhat understocked because of suppliers' concerns about being 
paid. Regarding the near-tern outlook, liquidation of the 124-year 
old B. Altman's chain is producing uncertainty among some District 
retailers because of the possibility of substantial price-cutting 
during the current holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for new homes in the District remains mixed. In some upstate 
New York areas where activity was already strong, further recent 
gains are attributed to lower mortgage rates and more realistic 
pricing of homes for resale. Much of the New York metropolitan area 
continues to report little or no improvement in buyer interest, 
however; despite the general slack, a few developers have undertaken 
projects they consider sufficiently attractive to elicit a favorable 
response. For example, a 24-story condominium apartment house it, 
going up on New York City's Central Park West where sites for new 
buildings are virtually nonexistent. Offering many highly sought 
after features of pre-war structures and unobstructed views of the 
park and the city's skyline, 21 of 38 units have been sold for 
September 1990 occupancy in the last three months although prices 
reportedly range from $900,000 to $6 million.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of office leasing has been good in much of the District but 
with the recent completion of substantial amounts of new space, 
vacancy rates have generally held steady or edged higher. Moreover, 
some New York City brokerage firms recently announced further staff 
reductions in their continuing cost-cutting efforts. These moves 
could throw additional office space on the downtown Manhattan 
market, where vacancy rates have already risen due to earlier 
restructuring by financial firms, even though no new buildings are 
currently planned there.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Reports on Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      October surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
indicate some flattening out in general business conditions, orders 
and production with an increased number of firms noting "no change" 
in these categories. In addition, in both surveys, deteriorating 
conditions were reported by at least as many firms as reported an 
improvement. Substantially fewer purchasing managers reported higher 
input prices in October. Concerning the outlook, the Rochester 
survey showed a large increase in the percentage of respondents 
expecting a deterioration in business conditions over the next three 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      October unemployment rates of 4.7 percent and 5.1 percent in New 
York and New Jersey, respectively, were again below the national 
average. However, October was the first month in three years that 
New Jersey's rate was above 5 percent and the unemployment outlook 
for the District is uncertain. In the wake of relatively weak 
investor volume and a slowdown in new issues and merger and 
acquisition activity, several brokerage firms recently announced 
plans for additional cutbacks totaling some 1200 employees. Some 
observers expect this number to climb even higher as more 
restructuring occurs in the securities industry. Further layoffs are 
also occurring at some auto parts manufacturers as a result of 
sluggish demand for cars. On the other hand, while demand for autos 
is slow, interest in new minivans is reportedly strong enough to be
boosting employment at minivan parts and assembly plants in the 
District. Moreover, the House of Representatives voted for the 
production of 18 more F-14 fighter planes, which could maintain 
employment levels on Long Island.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in the 
Second District report that demand for home mortgages has declined 
somewhat over the past year. The reported depth of the decline 
varied considerably, however, ranging from virtually no change to 
decidedly lower. All respondents stated that their mortgage activity 
is heavily concentrated in either fixed or adjustable rate loans; a 
few banks offer only one or the other type of financing. A majority 
of the banks reported greater demand for fixed rather than 
adjustable rate mortgages which may be due to declines on average in 
fixed rates while adjustable rates have increased. Responses were 
mixed regarding the current strength of the bankers' local 
residential real estate market. One officer noted that while overall 
demand was slow, certain pockets in highly desirable areas were 
still doing well. Several respondents cited a seasonal slowdown and 
recessionary fears as causes of the current downturn. Most bankers 
stated that they are aggressively marketing mortgages at the present 
time but only one-quarter are currently offering concessionary 
first-year rates on adjustable rate mortgages. Despite a slight 
increase in national delinquency rates, fewer than half of the 
respondents expressed any concern about delinquencies.
