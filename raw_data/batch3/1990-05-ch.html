      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the Seventh District continue to report generally 
improving business conditions, although areas of weakness were also 
cited. Purchasing agents' surveys indicate a rise in production, but 
orders are slowing in some areas of the District. Contacts in the 
manufacturing sector report slow but steady gains over a wide range 
of products. Construction activity remains stronger in the District 
than nationwide, but the housing market is showing signs of 
softening. Consumer spending has been holding up well in recent 
months, but sales for one large retailer were unexpectedly weak in 
early April.
     </p>
     <p>
      Surveys of purchasing managers in the District showed improvements 
in production, but a mixed pattern in orders. Chicago's survey 
indicated a steady increase in the number of firms expanding 
production since the beginning of the year. Firms receiving more new 
orders also outnumbered firms receiving fewer new orders. Both 
Milwaukee's and Indianapolis' survey showed expanding production 
last quarter. However, in the March survey Milwaukee had the number 
of firms with lower production equaling the number with higher 
production. Similarly, after indicating increasing orders in January 
and February, Milwaukee's March survey indicated that the number of 
firms receiving fewer new orders outnumbered the firms receiving 
more new orders. Indianapolis' and Detroit's survey also showed 
declining orders in the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of contacts indicated that manufacturing activity continues 
to make modest gains. Improvements among consumer goods producers 
are being led by the auto industry. Although domestic car production 
in the second quarter is expected to be about 10 percent below its 
year-ago level, a recent survey of auto makers indicated that car 
production this quarter is expected to be 20 percent above the first 
quarter. One auto maker extended the temporary shutdown of an 
assembly plant in the District by one week in early April because of 
slow car sales. However, all auto facilities are scheduled to be 
operating by the last week of April, with some working overtime. An 
economist for the steel industry reported that orders have been 
"flooding in" from the auto industry, although the orders have had 
longer lead times. Steel shipments in the second quarter are 
expected to be about equal to a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers generally reported improving orders and 
sales. A producer of a wide range of capital goods noted that sales 
began to improve in February and orders have been strengthening 
since the beginning of the year, led by petroleum equipment and food 
machinery. Other special industry machinery orders were up slightly, 
with the exception of automotive service equipment which has been 
weak for over six months. An economist in the communications 
equipment industry cited an increase in orders across a variety of 
products and expects double-digit growth in the near future. An 
uptick in orders for electronic components, however, may be due to 
fears of shortages, which have led to double ordering, according to 
an industry analyst. Sales of farm and construction equipment 
continue to be extremely good, according to a industry economist. 
Farm equipment sales are very strong, particularly combines and 
large tractors. Construction equipment sales have also been holding 
up, despite sluggish housing and shopping center construction 
nationally. The economist noted that sales in that company's Midwest 
market have been showing solid gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity in the District continues to outpace the 
nation, as unseasonably warm weather boosted residential and 
nonresidential building. A supplier of building materials reported 
that year-to-date shipments to District states are up, compared to a 
drop for the nation as a whole. Similarly, an analyst in the cement 
industry noted that cement shipments to the District have grown 
substantially faster than nationally, with the exception of flatness 
in sales to Michigan, which was attributed to the weakness in the 
state's auto industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several contacts cited special factors that may be hampering 
construction. A financial analyst stated that builders are in need 
of new sources of loans, because savings and loan institutions are 
"out of the market." A steel producer noted some slowing in orders 
from the construction industry that may reflect delays in projects 
due to financing problems. And, an equipment supplier also noted 
that some plant construction, particularly in the chemical industry, 
is being held back until environmental regulations are finalized.
     </p>
     <p>
      The housing market is showing some signs of weakening. A bank 
economist cited a softening in Chicago's real estate loan market, 
especially for mid-to-high priced homes. Mortgage rates have moved 
above 10 percent at most lending institutions in the area and some 
banks have started tightening credit terms. Available funds for new 
construction are being absorbed mostly by single-family housing 
units, with few funds going to multi-family units, according to one 
financial analyst. A supplier to the mobile home industry reported 
sharp sales declines in most regions of the country, including the 
District. However, one bank economist noted that housing prices in 
the District have risen more closely in line with personal income 
than in other regions, which has contributed to a stronger housing 
market here than in the nation on average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent patterns in general merchandise sales are difficult to 
interpret because of atypical weather and a late Easter, but several 
contacts indicated year-over-year sales gains in recent months. An 
economist for a major department store chain reported steady 
improvements through early April in their seasonally adjusted weekly 
sales figures, led by electronic goods and appliances. These sales 
gains occurred without special promotions. Sales declined, however, 
for women's accessories, men's clothing, and lawn and garden 
supplies. Sales have been strongest in Wisconsin and Illinois, and 
declined in Michigan. An analyst for a major discount chain reported 
that sales in February and March were the best for that period since 
1983, with double-digit gains in all types of electronics. However, 
overall sales in the first full week of April unexpectedly declined 
from a year ago, even after adjusting for differences in the Easter 
selling season and despite the fact that store traffic remained 
relatively high. Domestic car and truck sales in the early part of 
April were down from a year ago. An industry economist, who had 
expected that first quarter sales would be strong enough to end the 
need for sales incentives, now sees promotional activity continuing 
through the second quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Isolated reports of tighter credit standards were obtained from 
several lending officers in the District. With respect to commercial 
and industrial loans, the only report of credit tightening related 
to loan requests involving borrowing institutions that are highly 
leveraged. Demand from leveraged borrowers has fluctuated widely in 
recent weeks. No lending officer stated, however, that their 
institution had directly altered credit standards. Other business 
traffic was reported by a major Chicago lending institution to be 
"routine." One respondent indicated that, in response to his bank's 
apparent concern over loan quality, the borrower was being asked for 
more loan documentation. This respondent indicated that the bank was 
now asking the borrower for what purpose were the funds to be used. 
Another respondent said that troubled loans were not being carried 
as long by banks. This respondent also noted that there was an 
increasing array of new sources of credit available to the small 
business borrowers. The general impression conveyed by several 
respondents was that funds were adequately available to good 
borrowers.
