     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 27, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment continues to expand in the District. The oil and chemical 
industries are increasing output and adding workers. Retail sales 
are mixed, with consumer durables and autos showing some weakness. 
Housing construction has slowed, although commercial construction 
shows some strength. Exports are increasing; the weaker dollar is in 
part responsible.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most labor market indicators suggest continuing healthy employment 
growth. The region's unemployment rate has ranged between 6.5 and 
6.9 percent since April. Employment continues to improve in the 
energy-producing regions, with Louisiana's unemployment rate having 
fallen 4 percentage points since the first of the year to 10.4 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for drilling machinery has strengthened, expanding employment 
rolls. The chemical industry is posting rapid productivity growth 
and high capacity utilization rates as a result of efficiency 
measures and strong product demand. The pulp and kraft components of 
the paper industry also continue to benefit from the drop in the 
value of the dollar. The weakening of the dollar has helped to curb 
tire imports to the point where some domestic producers have been 
able to raise prices. Prospects are bright for the region's aluminum 
producers, and prices are strengthening as a result of strong 
demand. Recent government contracts are helping aerospace firms in 
the region. Electronic components continues to benefit from defense 
spending and a resurgence in computer sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers throughout the District report strong sales during the 
month of September. However, sales of appliances remain lackluster 
in spite of heavy promotions. Prices on foreign apparel are 
increasing, but foreign electronics producers are holding the line 
on them. Domestic car sales in the District have been disappointing 
in the last month of the model year. New vehicle registrations 
through July continued to reflect the sluggish car market, 
particularly for domestic autos.
     </p>
     <p>
      Registrations in the Southeast rose 2 percent, with the rise 
accounted for by light trucks and vans. By July, imported cars 
accounted for 38 percent of sales, up from 31.7 percent a year 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      August home prices increased 8 percent over the same period last 
year. Experts say the uptick has been the biggest leap in home 
prices in the past decade. New starts, however, continue to decline 
throughout the District. Housing starts seem to have bottomed out in 
Louisiana, and sales of existing homes had the best second quarter 
performance since 1981. Apartment, condominium, and retirement 
construction remains firm in Florida, the only state in the District 
to show no decline in multifamily permits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction markets are mixed. The value, square 
footage, and number of commercial projects in the Southeast 
increased in August over year ago figures and are now expanding at 
rates similar to the nation's. Office construction is strong in 
Nashville, central Florida, and metro Atlanta. Commercial 
construction slowed in Mississippi from year-ago levels, and 
commercial property values declined. After weakness in 
nonresidential construction earlier in the year, new highways, 
streets, and bridges helped boost each state's August total 
nonresidential construction figures over those of August 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans at large commercial banks have turned up following a 
first- and second-quarter decline. A large jump in real estate loans 
seems to be fueling the growth while consumer loans are close 
behind. Consumer loans have grown more slowly at large commercial 
banks because of competition from nonbank sources. Business loans 
have slowed as corporations turn to increased issuance of commercial 
paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      Atlanta, Birmingham, Miami, and Nashville report improvements in 
mortgage collections. Consumer foreclosures are decreasing, although 
commercial foreclosures are increasing. Mobile, New Orleans, 
Jackson, and most of south Georgia report increases in delinquency 
rates. Mississippi thrifts note that an increased number of 
bankruptcies are being filed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism ranged from relatively flat moderately increasing over last 
year. In Miami and Jacksonville, two festival malls that opened 
during the summer are exceeding expectations. Orlando is projecting 
a 17 percent increase in convention activity over last year, and its 
civic center expansion is expected to be completed late in 1988. 
Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama have had moderate increases in 
tourist activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Except for New Orleans, total shipments from all District ports 
exceeded the nation's 6.8 percent gain for the 12 months ending in 
July 1987 over the previous 12 months. Georgia's exports of forest 
products, kaolin and manufactured goods are growing rapidly, and the 
state is becoming a major entry point for imported cars. In Miami, 
exports are growing faster than imports for the first time since 
early 1987 because of growing shipments to Latin America.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District coal production for the first three quarters of 1987 was 
approximately 8 percent less than during the same period in 1986. 
The cost of coal to electric utilities in the region has also fallen 
about 8 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are one-third more exploratory drilling rigs in operation in 
the District than a year ago, but this is still only 40 percent of 
the number operating in 1985. Crude oil production in the District 
continues a slow decline begun in early summer, reaching a level 6 
percent below 1986 average daily production. There is considerable 
interest in the natural gas reserves at Mobile Bay because Florida's 
gas consumption is expected to increase 42 percent over the next 
decade.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although drier weather has lowered crop yields, they remain above 
1986 levels. Except for feed grains and rice, total crop output is 
up from last year. Reductions in acreage, higher yields, and stable 
or higher prices, are expected to improve net revenue substantially.
