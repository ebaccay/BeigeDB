       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of the recovery in the Seventh District slowed in August 
and early September, with some sectors, notably autos, actually 
weakening. District manufacturing activity generally continued to 
move higher, albeit slowly and less evenly than in recent months. 
Car production did not meet earlier expectations, and several auto 
parts manufacturers expressed concern about the possibility of a 
further slowdown in the fourth quarter. Retail sales and housing 
activity in the region have held up relatively well in the face of 
sluggish employment data. However, several contacts shared the 
perception that hiring, capital spending, and consumer durable goods 
purchases may have entered another "wait-and-see" phase. The 
prospects for bumper corn and soybean harvests have risen in recent 
weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity edged higher in August, but at a 
slower pace than earlier in the summer. Purchasing managers' surveys 
indicated that expansion continued for a slim majority of District 
manufacturers. The index for the Chicago survey slipped slightly in 
August on a seasonally adjusted basis, but only after a relatively 
large increase in July, and the level of the index remained higher 
than in the nation as a whole. The overall results of the Detroit 
survey have been generally consistent with those in Chicago, 
although the Detroit index has been more closely linked to trends in 
auto production, which weakened in July and August. The Milwaukee 
survey had been providing the strongest results in the District 
earlier in 1992, but this survey's overall index also indicated a 
loss of momentum in recent months, reaching a level consistent with 
slow growth in production. Separately, an August survey of small 
manufacturers in Wisconsin indicated little change in expectations 
for business activity over the next 6 to 12 months, with a majority 
expecting moderate growth over this period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from individual manufacturers indicated that several sectors 
remained soft, although appliance production moved higher and the 
relatively improved heavy-duty truck market showed few signs of a 
slowdown. A large manufacturer of construction machinery reported 
that dealer orders for heavy equipment weakened further in August, 
although orders for light machinery have held up relatively well. A 
construction industry analyst reported that retail sales of 
construction machinery in the District were somewhat better than the 
national average. Retail sales of farm machinery continued to 
decline from year-earlier levels, and one District farm equipment 
manufacturer cut production plans for the third time this year. A 
large appliance producer reported a record July shipments month, and
expected continued improvement in the overall market in 1993. 
Positive signals continued to emanate from the heavy-duty truck 
market. A manufacturer of parts used in heavy-duty trucks reported 
that the market has been continuing to strengthen, citing pent-up 
demand, confidence in the future growth of the freight hauling 
industry, and sales incentives. Net orders slipped in August, but 
only after a sharp jump in July. and this producer expected 
continued gains in its own sales and production in 1993. A 
manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks reported that the improvement in 
District demand has exceeded the national average. A manufacturer of 
fluid power equipment used in a variety of heavy industrial 
machinery stated that the recovery in its markets had accelerated 
since the spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major automakers in the District characterized recent sales trends 
as disappointing, and car production failed to meet earlier 
expectations. Increases in sales and production of light trucks 
continued to outperform those for cars during the month of August, 
but one large automaker stated that dealer orders for light trucks 
began to lag sales in recent weeks. Another domestic automaker said 
that erosion in consumer willingness to purchase cars has played a 
more important role than income trends in restraining car sales 
recently, and noted that showroom traffic continued to improve while 
sales closure rates weakened. Auto producers agreed that inventories 
generally remained lean, and production would respond quickly to any 
future sales pickup that might occur. An auto industry analyst 
stated that some, but not all, of the production lost due to a 
recent labor dispute would be made up in the fourth quarter. This 
dispute was resolved at modest short-term cost to District activity, 
but it reflected a deeper long-term problem facing the District 
economy. One auto parts manufacturer stated that inventory building 
prior to next year's renegotiation of the national labor contract 
could boost production in the first half of 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending/Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales and housing activity held up relatively well in recent 
weeks. One large retailer stated that year-over-year sales 
comparisons in District markets showed a positive trend in recent 
months. This contact noted that sales gains were being led by big-
ticket items. Inventories at this firm were reported to be again in 
line with plan, after reaching undesirably high levels earlier In 
the summer, and the firm has stepped up its purchasing. Another 
large retailer reported that, after accounting for the late Labor 
Day holiday, underlying sales growth rose in August and early 
September. Durable goods sales showed above-average gains, led by 
appliances and home improvement products. The late Labor Day holiday 
was often cited as a factor constraining August sales comparisons. 
However, a large retailer and a bank each noted that a renewed wave 
of mortgage refinancing also played a role, because upfront fees 
postponed improvement in borrower cash flow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Renewed declines in mortgage interest rates have been accompanied by 
scattered signs of strengthening in housing activity, although the 
increase does not appear to be as robust as in the first quarter. A 
realtors association reported that sales activity among its 
membership had strengthened in recent months, but was uncertain 
about the importance of lower mortgage interest rates in the 
improvement. One of the largest realtors in the District reported 
that transaction volume slipped in August on a seasonally adjusted 
basis, but only after significant gains in June and July. Recent 
declines in mortgage interest rates were followed by a modest 
revival in housing activity in Western Michigan, according to banks 
and realtors in that area. A large producer of construction 
materials used in homebuilding reported that production increases 
prompted the use of second shifts at several plants. This contact 
noted that shipments gains in the District roughly matched the 
national pattern in recent months, after relative strength was noted 
in the District earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent employment reports have been subject to a variety of special 
factors, but still suggested a slowing recovery in District labor 
markets. Both establishment survey and household survey data 
indicate that the recovery in total District employment lost some 
momentum in recent months, although the underlying trend in 
household survey data has signaled a more robust rebound than the 
establishment survey. Employment changes in Illinois and Michigan 
have been weak relative to those in other District states, largely 
due to a continuing downturn in the two largest metropolitan areas 
in the District. Excluding these areas, employment has reached pre-
recession levels, although the upward momentum slowed during recent 
months. Private surveys suggested that hiring plans have weakened 
since the second quarter, but not significantly, and hiring in the 
Midwest remained stronger than the national average. Temporary help 
firms reported rising sales gains, and placements in the District 
continued to run ahead of the national average, but one firm 
expressed concern about recent economic trends. This contact also 
stated that demand in smaller metropolitan areas has significantly 
exceeded demand in large cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agriculture 
The fall harvest will be delayed this year due to slower maturing 
crops, but the prospects for a bumper harvest continue to improve as 
concerns for an early frost ease. The latest weather forecasts 
discount the likelihood of an early, crop-damaging frost. If that is 
the case, the fall corn and soybean harvest in District states is 
likely to be the second largest on record and up a sixth from last 
year.
