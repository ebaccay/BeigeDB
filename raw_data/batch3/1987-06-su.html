      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Federal Reserve Districts report moderate economic growth. 
Manufacturing orders and shipments continue to grow, with few 
reports of price increases or inventory buildup. Lumber production 
is operating near capacity due in part to an expansion of exports. 
Housing construction continues at a steady pace despite the recent 
increase in mortgage rates. High vacancy rates and the new tax laws 
have reduced commercial construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most agricultural sectors remain depressed. Although recent 
increases in beef and hog prices have generated short-term earnings 
gains for cattle and hog producers, crop farmers still face problems 
of oversupply and low prices. The energy sector also remains 
depressed. Oil and coal producers report that drilling and mining 
operations are below last year's levels. However, oil drilling has 
increased in some areas as domestic oil prices rise. Growth in 
retail and automobile sales appears to be slowing. Higher prices, 
increased consumer indebtedness, and higher interest rates are the 
major reasons cited, Loan activity is also weak, Strong demand for 
commercial and real estate loans has not been enough to offset the 
reduction in the volume of consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in retail sales appears to be slowing in many districts. 
Dallas and San Francisco continue to report generally sluggish 
sales, while Boston and Cleveland indicate wide variations in sales 
activities among various retail chains. Most Districts report 
increases in apparel prices, especially among imported goods. 
Boston's inquiries about the reasons for price increases reveal two 
primary sources: import quotas and the decline in the dollar. Strong 
demand for apparel is leading to increases in the prices at which 
quotas are bought and sold among overseas manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also, quotas provide the incentive for foreign producers to import 
more expensive lines of clothing. The decline in the value of the 
dollar has been felt most strongly on prices of imports from Japan 
and European countries, whose currencies have appreciated most 
against the dollar. Prices of domestically produced apparel have 
also risen but not as much as prices of imported apparel. Much of 
the domestic price increase is due to domestic textile mills running 
near capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales are sluggish in most Districts. Dealers in the 
Minneapolis District report that automobile sales were 20 percent 
lower in May than a year ago. Weak auto sales raise the prospect for 
more aggressive sales incentives and further production cutbacks by 
domestic auto producers. As yet, domestic auto dealers have not 
discounted prices, and current production schedules have stabilized 
inventories. The declining value of the dollar has significantly 
reduced import auto sales by raising prices. Import dealers report 
declining profits, and inventories increased considerably in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing continues to show signs of growth. Many Districts 
report increases in orders and shipments and moderate reductions in 
inventories. Boston reports that both high-technology and 
traditional industries are experiencing increases. Philadelphia 
indicates improvement in the durable-goods sectors, and Richmond 
finds increased activity in nondurables. Employment, however, has 
shown little gain. In many areas, employment is limited to 
replacement hiring. Other areas, such as Minneapolis and St. Louis, 
report employment losses over the past month or two.
     </p>
     <p>
      The effect of the depreciation of the dollar on manufacturing is 
still mixed. Boston reports that none of its respondents attribute 
the gain in domestic orders to an easing of import competition. San 
Francisco, on the other hand, finds that manufacturers of some 
products that compete against low-cost imports report strengthening 
in sales and orders. In general, strong domestic demand appears to 
be the major force behind improvement in manufacturing. The increase 
in steel production, for example, appears to be attributable to 
increases in construction and in oil drilling operations, despite 
cutbacks in automobile production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts report that input prices are stable. There is some 
upward price pressure as certain products, especially steel 
products, continue to be in short supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital spending is reported to be moderately high by some 
Districts. Chicago reports sizable investments in upgrading 
facilities in the traditional, heavy-manufacturing industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The energy sector remains depressed, despite the increase in 
domestic crude oil prices. Atlanta and Kansas City report that 
exploration and development are below levels of a year ago. Dallas, 
however, reports that drilling continues to increase. In May, the 
rig count was only 4 percent below a year ago, and it was above the 
levels of earlier months in 1987. The recent increase in domestic 
oil prices is expected to sustain this trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal production has increased slightly in recent weeks, but both 
Atlanta and Richmond report that output is below last year's level. 
Some coal producers anticipate that the increase in oil prices nay 
help to shore up demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Forestry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although a few agricultural sectors have shown signs of improvement 
in recent months, conditions are still generally depressed. 
Increases in cattle and hog prices and lower feed costs have raised 
short-term earnings of cattle and hog producers. However, prospects 
for the future are mixed. Atlanta and Chicago report that hog and 
cattle herds are being rebuilt and that feedlots are presently full. 
Kansas City, on the other hand, indicates that while feedlots are 
near capacity, few feeders are expanding capacity and cow-calf and 
stocker-cattle operators do not appear to be adding to their herds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts report favorable crop conditions. A relatively dry 
spring has allowed crop planting to be finished ahead of schedule. 
Crop development appears good. although St. Louis reports that its 
dry spring may reduce wheat yields by as much as 20 percent. Crop 
prices, although slightly higher in the past few months, are 
anticipated to fall back to around the government subsidy levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumber production in the Pacific Northwest is running near peak 
capacity, primarily due to strong demand from China, Japan, and 
Europe. Recent interest-rate hikes temporarily reduced the volume of 
orders in April, but orders have picked up as mortgage rates have 
stabilized.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction remains strong in all Districts except for 
Dallas and St. Louis. The jump in mortgage rates during April and 
May has had little effect on housing activity. Housing starts in 
many Districts continue to run ahead of last year's numbers. New 
York reports that anticipation of further rate increases generated 
additional demand. High vacancy rates, higher interest rates, and 
the new tax laws have caused a slowdown in commercial construction 
in many Districts. However, the New York City area continues to 
experience brisk commercial construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in loans and deposits is generally weak. Commercial and real 
estate loans remain strong, but the volume of consumer loans has 
fallen off substantially. Some bank contacts attribute the decline 
in consumer loan demand to the attractiveness of home equity loans, 
high consumer indebtedness, and competition from auto finance 
companies. To attract additional borrowers, several banks have 
pursued aggressive marketing strategies, which include increased 
advertising and proposals to offer loans with variable rates, 
similar to financing arrangements available from home equity loans. 
Some banks have lowered (or plan to lower) rates on their fixed-rate 
loans in order to be more competitive.
