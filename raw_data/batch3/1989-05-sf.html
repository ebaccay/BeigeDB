      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 3, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Twelfth District economy continues healthy, although there are 
signs of slowing in some sectors. Manufacturing activity overall 
continues strong, and agricultural conditions have improved in the 
West. Retail sales are reported to be sluggish. Most District 
business contacts expect slower economic growth during the next 
year. Conditions in the forest products and financial industries are 
reported to be mixed. Oil prices have risen sharply on the West 
Coast since the Alaska oil spill. Real estate activity continues 
strong in most parts of the District. although some signs of slowing 
are emerging.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Twelfth District business leaders contacted in early April 
expect slower economic growth during the next year with fifty-six 
percent expecting GNP growth during the next four quarters to be 
slower than it was in 1988. Responses indicate weaker growth 
prospects for business investment, consumer spending, housing 
starts, and the trade balance. Housing starts are the weakest 
sector, with 92 percent of District business contacts predicting 
slower activity during the next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several respondents report sluggish retail sales in recent weeks. 
One notes that the weakness could be related to the early Easter or 
to unseasonable weather. Several note that sales of soft goods, 
including housewares and women's apparel, are relatively stronger 
than are sales of big-ticket durable items such as furniture and 
electronics.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are reported to be slow throughout the District, a 
condition many attribute to higher interest rates. One auto dealer 
reports that, although sales were up sharply in early April, the 
increase was no more than seasonally expected, despite sales 
incentives. Moreover, he notes that the recent jump was not enough 
to take the pressure off dealers. Prices are still soft, and dealers 
are ordering very cautiously to avoid excessive inventory buildup.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity overall continues strong. The aerospace 
industry continues to experience strong commercial aircraft demand 
in the face of limited production capacity. Boeing, for example, 
currently has an order backlog in excess of $55 billion and is late 
with deliveries of its 747-400. To boost production, the company has 
arranged to borrow more than 603 skilled mechanics from Lockheed for 
periods ranging up to six months, in addition to continued heavy 
hiring of permanent employees. Local firms complain that Boeing is 
hiring workers away at wages they are unable to match. Despite 
Boeing's efforts at increased production, the backlog of orders 
continues to rise due to the large volume of new orders received.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most other manufacturing sectors report more moderate growth, 
although activity appears to be weakening in product lines tied to 
construction activity. For example, demand for paints and coatings 
is flat compared with a year ago, and a large floor covering 
distributor reports a 12 percent decline in carpeting sales from 
last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions have improved in the West. Heavy March rains 
eased the drought in most of California's agricultural regions, 
although water supplies remain low for some areas of Southern 
California, Arizona, and parts of Idaho. Unusually hot weather in 
early April damaged the strawberry crop in California and threatens 
to limit grazing in Arizona. Low inventories of grain seeds have 
caused seed prices to rise by as much as 50 percent over last year's 
level. Consumption of apples and grapes is returning to normal, 
following sharp declines triggered by the Alar and Chilean grape 
scares, respectively. Seafood prices are stable despite the oil
spill in Alaska.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the forest products industries are mixed. Consumption 
of linerboard and boxes is rising at a 2 percent rate, while 
newsprint consumption has fallen with a decline in classified 
advertising. Shortages of logs have boosted prices despite slowing 
consumption by the construction industry. Lack of available logs has 
caused some lumber mills to reduce capital expenditure plans, and 
one lumber industry contact reports reducing his firm's capital 
expenditure budget to a third of its originally planned level. 
Further expansion is anticipated at paper mills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil prices have risen sharply on the West Coast in the aftermath of 
the Alaska oil spill. Sources in Alaska report that the spill is 
helping the Alaskan economy at the moment, with fishermen being paid 
$2,500 per day for use of their boats in the clean-up operation. 
Exxon has told area residents that the company will compensate them 
for all reasonable claims of lost income resulting from the spill.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate activity continues strong in most parts of the Twelfth 
District, although some signs of slowing are emerging. Home prices 
in California and Washington continue to escalate, with multiple 
offers above asking price now occurring frequently in Seattle. 
However, construction activity is limited by a lack of available 
urban land and, more recently, by a more cautious attitude 
engendered by higher interest rates. Moreover, one respondent notes 
that his company has postponed some construction projects due to the 
recent interest rate hikes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many banks and thrifts report that demand and savings deposit 
balances have fallen in recent weeks, as consumers shift funds 
toward money market funds, certificates of deposit, or treasury 
bills in response to higher interest rates. Most report weak demand 
for consumer loans. The relatively healthier demand for mortgage and 
home equity loans is attributed by many to federal income tax 
considerations. One banker notes that although his institution is 
generating few new loans, most of those issued are going to well-
qualified borrowers. Financial institutions are fairly evenly 
divided between those reporting narrower and wider interest spreads 
as rates have risen.
