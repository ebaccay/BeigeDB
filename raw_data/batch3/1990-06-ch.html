      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       June 20, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the Seventh District report weakening in construction 
activity and retail sales, while manufacturing activity remains 
mixed but generally improving from weakness early in the year. 
Residential and nonresidential construction has slowed in recent 
months, although the District is still outperforming the nation on 
average. General merchandise sales are weakening in market segments 
linked to housing activity, particularly furniture and appliances. 
However, trends in most other products are unchanged, with apparel 
sales soft and entertainment-based electronics sales providing most 
of the growth. In manufacturing, auto-related industries have 
improved from the first quarter's weak performance, but several 
capital-goods producers report that expanding segments are being 
offset by slowing segments of their markets. Weather conditions from 
late May to early June slowed plantings and damaged crops in the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonresidential construction in the District as a whole continues to 
outperform the nation, but construction activity in some District 
states has declined in recent months. A producer of building 
materials reports that nonresidential construction awards (in floor 
area) in the first four months of 1990 were up 7 percent from a year 
ago for the District states, compared to a 10 percent decline 
nationally. However, Michigan and Wisconsin both registered declines 
in April. Illinois declined in March, but was positive in April. A 
large Chicago-area building materials supplier noted that shipments 
in April were below year-ago levels, although year-to-date shipments 
were up. Some projects in the planning stage are reportedly being 
pushed back, but so far few have been cancelled. Chicago's office 
vacancy rate is below the nation's, according to one contact, but 
vacancy rates in its suburbs are now slightly above the national 
average. Commercial sales of existing office space are unchanged 
from a year ago, but a commercial realtor notes that institutions 
providing financing are paying increasing attention to "quality."
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction in the District is following a pattern 
similar to the nonresidential sector. Contracts for housing 
construction were up 10 percent an the District, compared to an 8 
percent decline nationally for the first four months of 1990. 
However, the District dropped 3 percent in April from year-ago 
levels, with Illinois accounting for the bulk of the decline. A 
Chicago-area realtor reports that local residential sales were up in 
April, May, and early June over a year ago, after being flat for 
several months. Housing prices are edging up, but have slowed 
sharply from the year-ago pace as houses take longer to sell. Some 
large banks in early June have dropped their mortgage rates on 
average about a half a point to slightly below 10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise sales in the District have been weakening since 
April, according to several retail analysts, reflecting in part the 
housing slowdown and special factors. An analyst for a major 
retailing chain reports that sales of major appliances fell sharply 
in April and May, led by household improvement goods and household 
furnishings. Overall, sales growth in the District has been about 
equal to overall sales growth for the chain, after outperforming the 
nation earlier in the year. An analyst for a nationwide discount 
chain reports that the Midwest was their only market region to 
experience declining sales in May. Store sales were hurt in part by 
the expansion of new discount chains into the region and by 
liquidation sales at stores in bankruptcy. An appliance producer 
reports that shipments, down 6 percent in the year-to-date through 
May, are weaker than expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of apparel goods continued to be weak in early June. Apparel 
sales, according to one analyst, have been hurt by unseasonably cold 
weather and consumer resistance to higher prices. Higher prices were 
attributed in part to a slackening of competitive pressures after 
several retail chains filed for bankruptcy. Most of the sales 
decline in apparel is concentrated in women's apparel, with men's 
and children's apparel showing modest strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District continues to be mixed, with 
strength in auto-related industries more than offsetting weakness in 
construction-related industries. An auto analyst reports that the 
expected rebound from last quarter's weak auto production includes 
some seasonal inventory building, as auto makers prepare for the 
changeover to 1991 model production. Inventory levels are viewed as 
being in good shape, running 20 percent below a year ago despite 
sales being down 10 percent. Steel production this quarter is 
expected to nearly equal last year's second quarter high, according 
to a steel analyst, who has revised estimated output for 1990 upward 
by 5 million tons to 82 million tons (compared to 84 million tons in 
1989).
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital-goods producers generally report mixed activity, following 
the overall pattern of manufacturing. A producer of heavy equipment 
states that District plants that make highway construction and 
mining equipment are doing very well, but plants that produce heavy 
equipment tied to building construction are slowing down. A producer 
of agricultural equipment reports continued sales strength 
especially for combines and four-wheel drive tractors. However, 
agricultural equipment sales are expected to begin slowing by the 
end of the year, as replacement demand softens. Sales of light 
industrial equipment, which follows the housing industry closely, 
are down 10 percent from a year ago. A producer of food processing 
and material handling equipment notes some softening in orders from 
very high levels. A materials supplier cites strength in the demand 
for pumps and compressors, coming in part from new chemical plants, 
and for plastics-making equipment, coming in part from overseas. An 
economist for a large electronics producer reports that orders for 
communications equipment have returned to double-digit growth rates 
and shipments are expected to reach double-digit rates by the end of 
the year. Orders for electronic components used in computers are 
still relatively weak, but are beginning to show some improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cool temperatures and frequent rainstorms from mid-May through early 
June slowed crop plantings, caused ponding and plant-emergence 
problems in some planted fields, disrupted haying operations in many 
areas, and resulted in pollination and frost damage problems for 
some fruit powers in Michigan and Wisconsin. Some 13 percent of the 
corn acreage and 47 percent of the soybean acreage in District 
states had not yet been planted as of June 2, a date when plantings 
are normally winding down. The planting delays were most apparent in 
Southern Illinois and Indiana. Faced with a June 8 to 15 planting 
deadline, some of this year's intended corn acreage will likely be 
shifted to soybeans.
