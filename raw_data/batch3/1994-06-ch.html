      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 22, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic growth slowed during the second quarter, 
as both consumer spending growth and manufacturing activity 
moderated. Light vehicle production declined on a seasonally 
adjusted basis in recent months, and preliminary schedules show flat 
to slightly declining output in the third quarter. District payroll 
employment has grown more closely in line with the national overage 
during 1994, but household survey data and help-wanted advertising 
indicate that labor markets in the region remain tighter than for 
the nation as a whole. The consensus forecast of 30 Midwest 
economists prepared for an auto industry outlook conference called 
for moderate GDP growth to continue during 1994 and 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity generally remained quite vigorous in 
recent months, with purchasing managers' surveys depicting slower 
but still-strong growth through May. The composite index of 
production components of purchasing managers' surveys in Chicago, 
Detroit and Milwaukee declined from 75.0 percent in April to 70.6 
percent in May. The May level was still consistent with moderate-to-
robust expansion in manufacturing activity, however, and this 
indicator remained well above the national average. The Chicago 
production index climbed to 76.5 percent in April -- nearly its 
highest level since 1970 -- but then fell back slightly during May. 
A larger drop was registered in the Detroit index during May, 
however, consistent with the slower momentum seen in auto industry 
output. A large utility reported that growth in power sales to 
industrial customers in Michigan eased during early June, after 
outpacing total sales through most of 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among key industries, District steel production rose on a seasonally 
adjusted basis in April and May, climbing to its highest level for 
May since 1989. Output is expected to slow somewhat in coming 
months, however, partly because some large integrated mills an 
bringing production facilities down for necessary maintenance and 
repair. Third quarter production is still "sold out," with continued 
strength in orders from the motor vehicle, appliance, farm 
machinery, and construction equipment industries. Reports from 
manufacturers of farm machinery and construction equipment remained 
upbeat. Production and retail sales of heavy-duty trucks continued 
to climb in recent months, although current schedules imply a small 
decline in output in the third quarter. An industry analyst stated 
that any output gain in the latter half of the year is not likely to 
be significant, given current capacity levels, but order backlogs 
are still believed to be of high quality, and the order cancellation 
rate remains below year-earlier levels and well within historical 
norms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys and reports from large retail chains suggest that retail 
sales growth moderated (on a year-over-year basis) during April and 
May. An index of same-store sales growth constructed by a check 
authorization firm showed a declining rate of growth in retail sales 
in the Midwest during April and May. A survey of a large number of 
retail locations in Illinois and Indiana showed sales growth 
moderating in April, except for hardware and other housing-related 
outlets, where sales growth remained relatively strong. A survey of 
shopping centers also pointed to a slower sales growth during April. 
While the April slowing has been partly attributed to the early 
Easter holiday this year. reports from a number of retail chains as 
well as a group of single store owners suggested sales growth 
remained sluggish during May. One large retail chain reported that 
modest growth was little changed during May and early June. and this 
contact stressed that competitive pressures on price and margins 
continue to intensify in most of its market areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District light vehicle output has increased slightly more than the 
national average during 1994, but assemblies declined on a 
seasonally adjusted basis in recent months, and preliminary 
schedules show little sign of any substantial rebound during the 
third quarter. Reports from large automakers and a small sample of 
large auto dealerships suggested that vehicle sales have also slowed 
in recent months, partly due to capacity constraints in production 
of some popular models. One large automaker stated that "we can no 
longer confirm that the market is red-hot." Higher interest rates 
have increased vehicle financing costs and dealer floor planning 
expenses, curtailing some sales gains. Another large automaker 
reported that dealer showroom traffic flattened out in March and 
April, while sales closures rates declined slightly. Reports from a 
small sample of large auto dealers were mixed but still suggestive 
of slower sales, with most of them indicating that increased 
interest rates have cut into sales gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent slowdown in auto industry momentum is coming from high 
sales levels, however, and most industry contacts expressed optimism 
about renewed growth in the latter half of the year. Some industry 
analysts have expressed concern that a surge in cars coming off 
lease could curb new car sales during 1994 and into 1995, much like 
the bubble of "nearly new" cars that arose after the acceleration in 
deliveries to captive rental car fleets in the early 1990s. A large 
automaker emphasized that it has planned its leasing promotions to 
avoid a serious problem in this area. No car dealers expressed 
concern about the phenomenon, with one noting that "the average 
person holds on to a new car for three years, if they buy it or if 
they lease it. We don't see this being a very big deal." Another 
dealer expected the increased share of leasing to promote new car 
sales by encouraging people to buy new cars more often. Asked what 
happened when 2-3 year old cars started coming back into the 
dealership, this contact stated "we can't buy enough 2-3 year old 
cars as it is." An automobile dealers' association reported that its 
measure of dealer optimism rose to an all-time high in April. A 
large automaker stated that pent-up demand for motor vehicles 
remains substantial and should provide a strong base for growth over 
the balance of 1994 and into 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continued to strengthen in April and May. A 
survey of employer hiring plans conducted by a large personnel 
services firm showed a slight decline (to still-high levels) in the 
majority of Midwest employers planning to add to their workforce 
next quarter. Hiring plans among durable goods manufacturers 
continued to top the list of 10 industrial categories within the 
region, and remained significantly stronger than their national 
counterparts. Purchasing managers surveys generally confirmed the 
upward momentum in District manufacturing employment during May. 
Reports from a number of retailers and manufacturers pointed to 
shortages of workers in lower-wage level positions, adding to wage 
pressures in this area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth in total payroll employment in the District has fallen in 
line with the national average during 1994, but help-wanted 
advertising and unemployment rate estimates point to relatively 
tight labor markets in the region. For example, among the 11 large 
states for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics computes direct 
unemployment rate estimates, Michigan and Illinois had the second 
and third lowest unemployment rates, respectively, during May, while 
the unemployment rate in Michigan has fallen to a 20-year low during 
1994. The unemployment rates for Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin are 
below those for Illinois and Michigan, and the gap between the 
District unemployment rate and the national average continued to 
widen in the District's favor this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook Conference
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's annual Auto Outlook Conference 
was held in early June. The consensus GDP forecast of 30 economists 
from around the District that was prepared for the meeting called 
for a 3.6 percent increase in real GDP in 1994. While a significant 
improvement from the forecast prepared in December 1993, the growth 
rate implied by the latest forecast over the balance of 1994 was 
unchanged from the pace expected last December for 1994 as a whole. 
The consensus called for car and light tuck sales in 1994 to total 
15.4 million units, up from 13.9 million units in 1993, while a 
smaller gain was anticipated for 1995. Presentations by auto 
industry representatives were largely upbeat about the underlying 
upward momentum in the marketplace, although several expressed a 
note of caution about recent sales trends. Competitive price and 
market pressures continue to concern many industry suppliers.
