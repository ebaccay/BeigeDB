      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Seventh District are mixed, with 
manufacturing contributing the most consistent but slow improvement. 
District employment rebounded in May, after two months of modest 
decline, and general economic indicators for metropolitan areas in 
the District expanded in June. Respondents report that manufacturing 
continues to post modest gains in sales and orders, except among 
defense-related markets. Retail spending in the District is mixed, 
with sales growth linked to price cutting, and the housing market in 
the Chicago area is softening. Several banks report a slowdown in 
lending activity related to regulatory changes and a slower economy, 
but overall credit standards are little changed from the beginning 
of the year. Crop prices have been volatile in recent weeks, but 
weather conditions have been near ideal.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Economic Indicators
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the District improved slightly in May, 
but unemployment rates were noticeably higher than a year ago. Total 
payroll employment in most District states rose in May, but remained 
below the high for this year reached in February. Virtually all the 
employment gains in recent months have come from the 
nonmanufacturing sector, including increases in the Chicago area 
despite sizable layoffs among several major retailers and financial 
institutions. The average unemployment rate for the District dropped 
a tenth of a percentage point to 5.6 percent in May from the 
previous month. Michigan's unemployment rate was highest in May at 
7.7 percent, but dropped to 7.3 percent in June. However, the 
unemployment rate for the District a year ago averaged 5.0 percent, 
with Michigan's rate near 6.0 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing managers' surveys in the District generally showed 
activity expanding in June. The Detroit survey in June rose 2 points 
from the previous month to 50.9, marking the first time in fifteen 
months that the index registered an expansion in activity. Much of 
the improvement was centered in auto-related production and orders. 
The Chicago purchasing managers' survey for June continued to show 
expanding activity, but at a slower pace than in May. According to 
the survey, production edged down from the previous month, which was 
its highest level this year. Although orders slowed markedly in June 
and backlogs declined, the Chicago survey indicated that most 
purchasing agents expect business activity to improve over the rest 
of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several respondents in the District reported that orders and 
production were continuing to make modest improvements. Orders for 
truck engines had an uptick in May, according to an industry source, 
after being weak since late 1989. Orders and backlogs of nondefense 
machinery were up in May, according to a capital-goods producer, but 
defense-related orders were down significantly. An electronic 
equipment producer reported good orders' growth in recent months, 
despite some softness in key markets, including autos. While 
shipments are not expected to "boom" this year, sales of electronic 
components are expected to continue to improve. A producer of liner 
board reported that an expected weakness in shipments this summer 
has not materialized. After two months of flat sales, June and early 
July sales turned around and were running slightly above trend. A 
major supplier of construction materials stated that plants in the 
District were operating on average at about 95 percent of capacity, 
compared to 80 percent in the eastern parts of the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel shipments for the second quarter were about the same as in the 
second quarter of 1989, according to a major steel producer in the 
District. Summer bookings have been strong, in part because of 
increases in auto production. Appliances appear to be booking 
normally for the summer. Total steel shipments in the third quarter 
are expected to be ahead of seasonal gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales activity in the District was mixed in June. An 
economist for a major department store chain reported an overall 
lackluster sales performance in June, despite good sales in auto 
parts and appliances. Home improvement sales were particularly poor, 
as were lawn and garden sales. Sales growth in Iowa and Wisconsin 
was about average for the nation, but growth in Michigan and Indiana 
was below average. While inventories were down in June, weak sales 
pushed the retailer's inventory-to-sales ratio up. A major discount 
chain in the District reported above average gains, led by strength 
in apparel sales. Sales growth, however, was aided by increased 
price cutting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing sales in the Chicago area dropped in June from year-ago 
levels, according to an area realtor. Some of the decline was 
attributed to exceptionally high sales last year. However, June 
sales were also slightly below the six year average for that month, 
indicating some softness in the market. High priced homes are having 
the most difficulty selling, according to an industry analyst. The 
rate of pricing increases in the Chicago area has slowed 
significantly since last fall. Price increases since October were 
reportedly running slightly below the inflation rate, compared to 
double-digit rates earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several financial institutions in the District reported a slowdown 
in the growth of lending activity in recent months. Commercial and 
industrial loans were expanding below expectations at some banks, 
which was attributed to softness in the economy. However, other 
banks noted that loan growth was continuing at the trend rate. 
Mortgage lending continued to be relatively strong in June, 
according to several bank officials, although lending volume was 
below a year ago. As a result of higher lending restrictions on S&amp;Ls; 
that limit the share of total equity capital devoted to a single 
loan customer, construction lending has been hard hit. Small 
builders are particularly being affected, according to a financial 
analyst.
     </p>
     <p>
      Credit standards have changed little since early in the year, 
according to several respondents, but bank examiners have become 
increasingly thorough in evaluating loan risk. Highly leveraged 
borrowing is down sharply and, in many cases, banks have shortened 
the maturity of loans to limit risk exposure. However, most bankers 
stated that "quality" loans are having no problems with funding. One 
District bank reported picking up business from other banks that had 
backed out of projects in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop prices have been quite volatile in recent weeks, with much of 
the volatility tied to weather conditions and the implications for 
potential yields. Near ideal weather conditions over the last couple 
of weeks have offset some of the earlier concerns about rain-delayed 
planting and the heat wave in early July. Corn and soybean crop 
conditions throughout much of the District are rated "good," despite 
smaller-than-normal plant growth for this time of year. However, 
yield prospects still hinge to a large extent on weather patterns 
through mid-August and the timing of the first killing frost this 
fall.
