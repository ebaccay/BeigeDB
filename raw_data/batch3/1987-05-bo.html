      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The First District economy continues to perform well. Retail sales 
continue to rise; manufacturers report some signs of a pickup; and 
with a few exceptions, the market for commercial real estate remains 
strong. Most First District retailers report good sales results in 
March and early April in spite of rainy spring weather. Inventories 
are not seen as posing serious problems even for those stores with 
sales below plan. Some merchants are being adversely affected by 
rising prices for imported goods. Reports from manufacturers were 
also fairly encouraging. In most cases, business was described as 
"not bad"—an improvement over the past. Increases in orders were 
reported for a number of products. Inventories were said to be 
consistent with sales. In the commercial real estate market, rapid 
absorption rates are holding vacancy rates to acceptable levels 
despite substantial space additions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the retail sector report recent sales increases ranging 
from 3 percent and "barely" ahead of last year to 25 percent ahead. 
The stores with disappointing sales attributed the weakness to 
unusual circumstances. Seasonal merchandise sold poorly because 
spring hasn't "sprung" in most of New England; two chains said the 
only product line with outstanding sales in recent months was sump 
pumps. One contact reported very strong March sales of VCRs and 
other consumer electronics, which he attributed to consumer worries 
about price and availability if the trade sanctions against Japan 
are maintained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts selling mostly American-made products report fairly stable 
prices, with increases of 3 percent or less. Those selling imported 
goods. in contrast, have experienced substantial price hikes. One 
respondent has been "massacred" by increases in the prices of high-
quality European furniture. While trying to shift purchasing back to 
the United States and Canada as fast as possible, the store is 
having difficulty finding the necessary quality and volume. A 
discount department store contact has seen prices rise for both hard 
and soft goods from Japan; the store has raised prices but not 
fully, so both profits and sales volume have suffered. This store 
plans to cut hard goods imports by about 50 percent if comparable
domestic producers can be located.
     </p>
     <p>
      New England merchants continue to be optimistic about the remainder 
of the year. Those with disappointing sales have taken actions they 
believe will put them on an uptrend. Those with very strong sales 
expect to move closer to plan in the coming months, but their plans 
call for respectable sales growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from First District manufacturers were moderately positive. 
The most notable exceptions were, on the one hand, a manufacturer of 
fabricated metal products, primarily for consumer and housing 
markets, who is "euphoric" at the strength of incoming orders and, 
on the other, a representative of the machine tool industries who 
has suffered a broad-based slowing in orders. For most other 
respondents business is "not bad". Pickups of varying strengths were 
reported by producers of data processing equipment, various 
fabricated metal products, electronics and production equipment for 
the electronics industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Appliances and packaging were said to be doing well; and, for the 
firms contacted, the defense business remains strong. Demand for 
garden equipment was apparently hurt by the long, snowy winter. 
Respondents enjoying the strongest results generally saw this 
strength as attributable to their firms' actions rather than to an 
industry-wide situation. Several contacts reported strong European 
sales; volumes are good and when subsidiaries' earnings are 
converted to dollars the impact on the bottom line is significant. 
One contact commented that many companies may enjoy relatively 
strong earnings in the coming year because of the combination of 
currency translation gains and the effects of stringent cost 
controls introduced in the past couple of years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are being watched carefully. None of the individuals 
contacted regarded inventories as out of line to a significant 
degree. Capital spending at these firms will be the same or higher 
in 1987 as in 1986. The emphasis is still on automation and 
productivity enhancements.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to prices, a couple of contacts reported that they are 
still reducing or discounting prices in order to make sales. Detroit 
is putting a lot of pressure on its suppliers to reduce costs. 
However, one fabricated metals producer that cut prices 
substantially last year in response to Korean and Taiwanese 
competition has recently been successful in introducing an increase. 
Most contacts have not seen any major changes in input prices, but 
increases were reported for steel, castings and pulp.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The commercial real estate market in New England remains strong for 
the most part. Although new office space continues to open up in 
Boston, the city's vacancy rate ties that in Manhattan as the lowest 
in the nation. The city of Cambridge, however, is having some 
difficulty absorbing a large increase in space. In Hartford there 
has recently been a 25 percent increase in office space, but growth 
in the financial services industries has kept occupancy rates 
healthy. In Providence two large class A-buildings have become 
available for occupancy, but two-thirds of the space absorbed 
recently has been rehabbed space. In Burlington, VT rents in the 
suburbs are rising and vacancy rates are dropping; the area appears 
to be successfully attracting out-of-state tenants. A building boom 
in southern New Hampshire has caused a glut of office space but some 
analysts say that if the economy continues to grow at the current 
rate, demand for class A space will soon exceed the supply. Many of 
the projects in the region that are scheduled to open in the coming 
year are pre-leased. It would appear that developers are waiting for 
tenant commitment before beginning new projects.
