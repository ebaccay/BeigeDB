      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Modest growth continues to be evident in the Tenth District economy. 
Retail sales are up slightly and prices remain generally stable. 
Inventories are generally viewed as satisfactory, both at retail and 
for production materials. Housing starts continue to be off slightly 
from a year ago. Mortgage rates are constant to slightly lower, and 
are expected to remain stable or decline slightly. The winter wheat 
crop is reported in good to excellent condition. Liquidations of 
farm businesses continue to be greater than normal in number. Bank 
loan demand is mixed while deposits are growing slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers report that sales are up slightly over year-ago 
levels. Sportswear and women's apparel are selling well, but sales 
of home furnishings, appliances, and electronics items are 
relatively weak. Retail prices have remained stable during the past 
three months. Retailers are generally satisfied with current 
inventory levels and expect little adjustment in the months ahead. 
Prices are expected to remain stable over the remainder of the year, 
while sales are expected to increase slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile dealers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers report that sales are unchanged to slightly 
improved from a year ago. Recent declines in interest rates have had 
some positive impact on sales. Inventories of foreign cars are in 
short supply, while overall inventories of domestic cars are at 
satisfactory levels. Most dealers are moderately optimistic that 
1985 sales will be slightly improved over the strong 1984 
performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report that input prices have remained fairly 
constant during the past three months. The changes in input prices 
for the past 12 months have varied in the range of plus-or-minus 5 
percent. Input prices are expected to remain stable for the rest of 
the year. No difficulties in obtaining materials have been 
experienced and none are expected. Inventory levels are generally 
satisfactory although some modest rising is occurring, partly in 
response to seasonal factors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders report that housing starts are off slightly to off 
sharply from a year ago. Housing starts are tracking the sale of new 
homes as the amount of speculative building has declined. Prices of 
new homes remain about constant, reflecting the ready availability 
and relatively stable price of building materials. Savings and loan 
institutions report that mortgage demand and commitments are 
generally down, with Colorado and New Mexico notable exceptions. 
Expectations for future mortgage dead vary widely. Mortgage rates 
remain constant to slightly lower, with a slight decline or no 
change expected in the months ahead. The inflow of new savings is as 
good as, or slightly better than, a year ago. Lover minimum deposit 
requirements on MMDA's and Super NOW's have proved effective in 
attracting funds for institutions aggressively seeking them.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The condition of the winter wheat crop is reported mostly good in 
Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wyoming, although suffering somewhat 
from lack of moisture. In Oklahoma and eastern Colorado, the 
condition of the winter wheat crop is described as excellent, with 
potentially the best crop in years in prospect. Participation by 
farmers in government acreage set-aside programs for wheat, corn, 
and sorghum varies widely among Tenth District states. Little 
participation is reported in Wyoming, New Mexico, and parts of 
Colorado, partly because producers are anticipating strong grain 
prices locally. But agricultural lenders in Kansas, Missouri, and 
Nebraska report that individual farmers are signing up 75 to 100 
percent of wheat acres, and 60 to 85 percent of corn acres, for set-
aside.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spring calving results are reported as good to excellent in 
Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming, but only average in 
Kansas and Oklahoma. In Nebraska and parts of Wyoming, stocker 
cattle have mowed into feedlots. However, in other Tenth District 
states stocker cattle are still being held in anticipation of higher 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rates of farm liquidation vary among Tenth District states, but are 
generally lower than recent publicity night indicate. Liquidations 
of farm businesses are three to five tines as high as bankers 
consider normal, however, with partial liquidations five to six 
times as high. District agricultural lenders expect these 
liquidation rates to remain high for at least several months. 
Despite current farm financial difficulties, few farm borrowers did 
not receive credit for spring planting. Banks in New Mexico and 
Wyoming report less than 2 percent of their borrowers did not 
receive credit. Percentages are somewhat higher in other district 
states, ranging from 3 percent in Kansas and parts of Nebraska to 12 
percent in Missouri.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at Tenth District banks is mixed, with about equal 
numbers of banks reporting slightly increased, unchanged, and 
slightly decreased loan demand. Consumer and residential real estate 
loans are tending to rise, while agricultural loans are tending to 
decline. Deposits are rising slightly, although they, too, display 
mixed behavior. Super NOW accounts, MMDA's, IRA and Keogh accounts, 
and small time deposits are rising more rapidly than large CD's and 
passbook savings accounts; demand deposits and conventional NOW 
accounts are declining. None of the respondents changed their prime 
rate in the last month, but about half expect the prime to decrease 
slightly in the near future. Over three-quarters of the respondents 
have not changed consumer lending rates in the last month and do not 
expect changes in the near term. Most of the surveyed banks have 
reduced the minimum deposit on MMDA's and Super NOW's to $1,000, 
generally with no effect on deposits.
