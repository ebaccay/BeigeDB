      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District developments remained mixed. October sales 
results at department stores were fairly evenly divided between 
those with sales above and below year-ago levels. District 
unemployment rates rose in October reversing September declines. The 
October purchasing managers' surveys indicated that business 
conditions stabilized in Rochester while deteriorating somewhat in 
Buffalo. Although residential construction continues sluggish, there 
has been some increased demand for existing homes and office space 
in several areas. Senior loan officers at small and midsized banks 
said their willingness to lend was unchanged from three months 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      October sales results at District department stores were divided 
fairly evenly between those with higher and lower sales compared to 
a year earlier. Over-the-year changes ranged from -2.5 percent to 
+4.6 percent and for the most part fell short of plans. Responses 
varied concerning best selling items with some citing women's and 
men's apparel and others noting a pickup in hone furnishings. 
Contacts stated that they have not had any extra promotional 
activity compared with last year but that this could change if 
competitive pressures increase during the holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are reported to be in good shape and intentionally below 
year-earlier levels in some cases. District retailers do not 
anticipate large year-to-year gains for the rest of the fourth 
quarter in light of the sluggish economy and surveys showing 
continued reluctance to spend on the part of consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While residential construction remains sluggish in the District, 
some increase in demand for existing homes has been noted. In the 
New York metropolitan area, for example, homeownership is reportedly 
the most affordable it has been in years as a result of reductions 
in existing home prices and lower mortgage rates. First-time 
homebuyers in particular are said to be taking advantage of the 
improved situation. In the Buffalo area, the volume of resales 
increased 9.5 percent in October from a year earlier despite a 
recent rise in the median price of such houses. More generally, a 
recent study found that resales in both New York and New Jersey have 
been increasing this year after declining steadily from 1998-1990.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity improved in parts of the District but 
vacancy rates moved in varying directions. Vacancy rates moved up in 
midtown Manhattan and Westchester County, largely as a result of 
corporate relocations and restructuring, while northern New Jersey's 
rate increased due to the completion of several new office 
buildings. By contrast, Fairfield County, Connecticut recently 
experienced a decline of almost a percentage point in its vacancy 
rate as a result of strong leasing activity and rates in downtown 
Manhattan and on Long Island showed virtually no change. Overall, 
office vacancy rates remain at high levels in much of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates rose in October after declining in 
September. New York's rate increased to 7.2 percent from 6.8 percent 
in September while New Jersey's rate rose to 6.8 percent from 6.2 
percent. The District's employment outlook is dimmed by several 
recent developments. New York and Connecticut are now confronting 
sizable current fiscal year budget gaps only months after struggling 
to bring those budgets into balance. New York City is attempting to 
close a large budget gap as well. These shortfalls could mean the 
elimination of many additional government jobs. In preparation for 
their planned merger, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover have 
reportedly eliminated close to 1000 positions since last summer and 
are expected to eliminate several thousand more over time. In 
addition, a recently announced restructuring at Warner-Lambert will 
result in the loss of 340 jobs at its New Jersey headquarters. In 
upstate New York Crucible Materials plans to close a major part of 
its steel plant, eliminating 250 jobs in early 1992 and Niagara 
Mohawk Power will cut 400 jobs from its nuclear operations. On a 
positive note, a consortium of Lufthansa, JAL and Air France has 
proposed the first new terminal in 30 years to be built at Kennedy 
International Airport.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Rochester and Buffalo surveys of purchasing managers showed 
differing results in October. General business conditions stabilized 
in Rochester where surveyed firms reported business conditions 
similar to those in September. The 32 percent of firms reporting an 
improvement was double the number reporting a worsening. In Buffalo, 
however, some deterioration occurred as the percentages with lower 
production and fewer new orders more than doubled. Nonetheless, by 
far the majority of firms in both areas reported stable to improved 
conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District reported that their willingness to lend remains 
unchanged from three months ago. However, while they are "actively 
and aggressively seeking high quality loans", demand remains weak. 
Those respondents noting an actual decrease in overall loan demand 
are using advertising campaigns as part of a marketing approach for 
new loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly all loan officers are now charging lower loan rates than they 
were three months ago, reflecting decreases in the prime rate. With 
the decline in interest rates has come an increase in mortgage 
refinancing. Credit standards at all banks surveyed have not changed 
over the past three months. Although delinquency rates in general 
have increased over recent months, delinquencies on commercial and 
industrial loans and on nonresidential mortgages have remained 
stable. Slightly less than half of surveyed officers reported a rise 
in consumer loan delinquencies.
