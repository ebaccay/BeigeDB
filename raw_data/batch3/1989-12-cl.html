      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District respondents are guardedly optimistic that aggressive sales 
promotions during this holiday season will boost sales about 5 
percent to 6 percent from a year ago. Manufacturing output in Ohio 
has begun to ease recently, following stronger than national growth 
in production through most of this year. Some financial market 
participants believe the run-up in the federal funds rate to 8 1/2 
percent will delay a prime rate reduction, and that relatively small 
interest rate reductions would not do much to stimulate demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Both producers and retailers of consumer goods believe that the 
slowdown in consumer spending is largely in new car sales. They 
believe that weak auto sales are not a symptom of a contraction in 
consumer spending, and that consumers will respond to price 
incentives that should boost sales of both automotive and 
nonautomotive goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Post-Thanksgiving Day sales were generally reported as "good" as 
last year, although a national chain reported their sales rose less 
than last year. A retailer reported that promotions so far have been 
larger than usual. Retailers expect about a 5 percent to 6 percent 
increase in sales this holiday season from last. Generally good 
sales have cut inventories to levels still higher than last year. 
Excess dealer inventories of major household appliances were 
apparently corrected during the summer months, and orders from 
dealers improved in both September and October, although at levels 
below last spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists with the auto industry report somewhat weaker-than-
expected new car sales, and that the "payback" period following high 
incentives of recent months may be longer than they expected. Price 
increases of 1990 domestic models, partly reflecting added safety 
features, have made some imports less expensive than domestic 
models, and incentives on 1990 models are considerably smaller than 
recent incentives for 1989 models. Another large buildup of new car 
inventories in November has led most analysts to expect a wave of 
price incentives beginning in the next few weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car dealers report that overall sales have slowed especially in 
November, but foreign makes have fared better than Big Three lines. 
Toyota dealers have experienced shortages of their more popular 
models, primarily the Toyota Camry this fall. Sales of 1990 models 
have been comparatively slow also, and buyers still exhibit a 
preference for foreign cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dealers report that consumers continue to perceive foreign models as 
superior in quality to Big Three cars, although that perception may 
be waning. They report fewer trade-ins of domestic cars for their 
dealerships' foreign models, and an increase in the number of 
foreign-to-domestic trade-ins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most dealers do not expect sales for 1990 models to improve until 
broader and/or more generous buyer incentives are offered by the 
manufacturers. They report that, to date, incentives on 1990 models 
have trended more toward dealers' incentives, which apparently lack 
the advertising value of buyer incentives and are usually less 
generous.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of industrial activity in Ohio held up stronger than for 
the nation through the first three quarters of this year, but has 
apparently receded in recent months, according to this Bank's 
estimates of production. The decline has centered in the automotive 
industry and its key suppliers, especially primary metals and rubber 
and plastics industries. In contrast, output in both electrical and 
industrial machinery industries has continued to expand through the 
fall months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing employment in Ohio has also been receding slightly 
from its latest high last January, but employment in the machinery 
industries has remained steady over the past three quarters. 
Employment declines have centered in the automotive, primary metals, 
and fabricated metals industries. Two auto producers recently 
announced plans for plant shutdowns of one to two weeks involving a 
total of 7600 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The summer slump in orders and production of heavy-duty trucks 
appears to have run its course, according to some suppliers. One 
supplier had a temporary lay-off of a few hundred workers and 
another plans a 5 percent reduction in its work force through 
attrition. The revival in truck orders in October leads one analyst 
to believe that a recovery is now under way. He also expects a 
slightly stronger increase in overall manufacturing output next 
quarter compared with this quarter, especially if the auto industry 
steps up an incentive program over the next few weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cutting tool orders have fallen between 20 percent to 40 percent 
from a year earlier practically each month since last spring, mostly 
because of declines in orders from the automotive and defense 
industries. A major tool builder expects the order decline to 
continue into 1990. Shipments have been sustained by reducing the 
order backlog.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Market participants were apparently prepared for a 1/2 point 
reduction in the prime rate, but some now believe prospects for an 
imminent reduction have lessened if the federal funds rate holds at 
8 1/2 percent. They also believe that it will take more than a 1/2 
point cut in interest rates to stimulate demand for credit, which 
has generally softened since mid-year. Fixed rate mortgages at about 
10 percent are commonly available from banks and thrift 
institutions, but demand is reported to be less than expected.
