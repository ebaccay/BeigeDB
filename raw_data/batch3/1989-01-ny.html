      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 25, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy in recent weeks have 
varied among sectors, in part reflecting seasonal influences. Most 
retailers described Christmas holiday sales as on or above plan and 
a pickup in office leasing has occurred. Homebuilding is seasonally 
slow and in some overbuilt areas, developers are offering 
concessions. While the percentage of purchasing managers reporting 
improved business conditions showed about a normal seasonal decline, 
the proportion indicating worsening conditions was somewhat higher 
than usual. Small- and medium-sized banks have recently increased 
interest rates charged on their loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers contacted in the District described sales during the 
1988 Christmas season as on or above plan. A major exception was a 
chain whose sales had been below year-earlier levels for several 
consecutive months. While sales results generally were as targeted, 
most stores reported relatively moderate over-the-year gains, given 
the extra shopping days this year. Increases mainly ranged from 2-10 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Items in strong demand among holiday shoppers were electronic games, 
video cameras and recorders, appliances and men's clothing. Interest 
in women s apparel also improved, though the extent of the 
improvement varied. Inventory levels at the end of December also 
were mixed. One chain with lower than targeted inventories reported 
lost sales because of its having understocked several popular items. 
At the other extreme were two retailers with inventories well above 
plan, who expect to discount heavily throughout January in order to 
clear the remaining seasonal goods from their shelves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The percentage of purchasing managers in western New York reporting 
improved business conditions showed roughly its usual decline for 
this time of year, but the proportion with worsened conditions was 
somewhat higher than usual. Among recent developments in the 
District, Grumman announced that it will eliminate 2500 jobs 
beginning in January as a result of the Pentagon's cancellation of a 
bomber project. Elsewhere, a recent groundbreaking gives further 
evidence of a turnaround in the South Bronx. A $100 million retail
and office project is now underway on a long-vacant tract; it is to 
include a full service supermarket, the first new movie theater in 
the area in 15 years, a shopping mall, and a new office building. 
Some 1500 permanent jobs are expected to be created.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to the impact on the District of certain national 
developments, the newly proposed changes and closings at U. S. 
military bases are not expected to have an adverse effect on the 
District. Personnel from the Brooklyn Naval Station, which is slated 
for closing, will be moved to a new Staten Island facility. In 
addition, a New York State official recently stated that the newly 
signed U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement should be of benefit to much 
of western and northern New York. Finally, governors in each of the 
three District states reported substantial shortfalls in revenues 
and New York and New Jersey have imposed hiring freezes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity in the District is seasonally slow, and in 
those parts of the New York metropolitan area where a buyer's market 
exists, developers are offering concessions. In Manhattan, however, 
where a rush of new apartment construction had begun prior to a 
November 1985 deadline to receive certain subsidies, most units have 
reportedly been sold without a glut developing as many had feared. 
Moderate-priced housing remains in demand in much of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pickup in office leasing has occurred in recent weeks. In downtown 
Manhattan a major brokerage firm leased 1.1 million square feet of 
space in a building at the World Trade Center which had been mostly 
vacant for a long time. Buildings going up on the west side of 
midtown Manhattan continue eliciting interest with the result that 
leasing there in 1988 was second only to 1987's record amount. 
Marine Midland Bank unveiled plans for a new office building in 
downtown Buffalo to house its backoffice operations, and work is 
also to begin soon on the second phase of New York City's conversion 
of the Brooklyn Army Terminal into industrial space for small 
manufacturers. The first phase, opened in late 1987, is 80 percent 
leased and negotiations for the remainder are underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In response to the rise in the prime and other market rates, small- 
and medium-sized banks in the Second District survey have recently 
increased interest rates charged on their loans. Some increases were 
automatic as most commercial loans and many mortgage and consumer 
installment loans have floating rates tied to the prime. However, 
rates on fixed-rate loans have been raised as well. Most officers 
said their banks had not felt competitive pressures to resist the 
recent round of interest rate hikes because other local banks also 
raised their rates. Bankers reported that competition to offer 
depositors the most attractive rates on 3- and 6-month CDs has been 
keen. However, none of the surveyed banks have increased rates 
offered on savings accounts. Regarding the outlook, nearly all 
respondents expected additional modest increases in interest rates 
for the first half of 1989, though several thought rates nay ease 
slightly by mid-year. When asked to judge the strength of their 
local economy, bankers' responses were mixed. About half described 
their local economy as moderately strong but with some weak sectors, 
such as real estate. The rest characterized their local economy as 
quite healthy.
