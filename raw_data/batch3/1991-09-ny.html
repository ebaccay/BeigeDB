      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 18, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District developments remained mixed in recent weeks. 
Relatively little new construction together with improved leasing 
activity resulted in a decline in office vacancy rates, and several 
areas reported a pickup in home sales, particularly to first time 
homebuyers. The August survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed 
more firms reporting higher output and a substantial drop in those 
reporting lower output. District department store sales results for 
July and August were mixed, however. Moreover, unemployment rates in 
New York and New Jersey rose in August after declining in July. 
Senior loan officers at small and mid-sized banks reported reduced 
loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results varied among District department stores during July 
and August though all respondents reported an improvement from June. 
Over-the-year changes in July ranged from -5.0 percent to +9.6 
percent with several stores posting better-than-targeted sales. 
Over-the-year changes in August ranged from -3. 0 percent to 6.0 
percent as most contacts met their modest sales plans. The strongest 
selling items in July and August were women's apparel and 
accessories followed by men's and children's wear. However, most 
contacts reported that back-to-school sales were slower than 
anticipated. Some pickup in home furnishings occurred but 
respondents noted continued consumer reluctance to purchasing big 
ticket items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Due to tight monitoring and, in some cases, to better-than-expected 
sales, inventories are generally at quite satisfactory levels though 
one chain reported them above plan. Contacts remain cautious about 
the outlook for consumer spending, especially those who experienced 
disappointing back-to-school results.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several areas in the District report a pickup in home sales in 
recent weeks, particularly to first-time homebuyers who have watched 
prices decline over the past two or three years and are now finding 
homes at affordable levels. Lower mortgage rates have also 
contributed to the recent improvement. In addition, brokers in 
Manhattan report increased investment demand for condominium 
apartments from foreigners whose currency has appreciated relative 
to the dollar. Much of the recent buying has been in the existing 
home market, however, and thus far, homebuilders have not 
experienced much impetus for new construction. As a result, they
anticipate that sales of new homes this year will be little changed 
from last year's low levels. A shortage of credit for acquisition 
and construction loans continues in much of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Relatively little new construction of office buildings and a 
continuing improvement in office leasing activity have caused 
vacancy rates to decline in several parts of the District. The 
declines have been modest, however, and rates remain high in many 
areas. Leasing in midtown Manhattan during July was the strongest 
this year and the primary vacancy rate edged down for the second 
consecutive month. In downtown Manhattan the July decline in the 
primary vacancy rate was the third in the last four months. The 
planned merger between Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover is 
expected to result in a sizable addition of excess space in both 
downtown and midtown Manhattan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Staginess Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continuing the volatile pattern of the last several months, 
unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey rose 0.4 percentage 
point in August after declines of 0.6 and 0.3 percentage point, 
respectively, in July. New York' s unemployment rate in August was 
7.5 percent and New Jersey's was 6.7 percent. Both states have been 
reporting nonfarm employment at below year-earlier levels for a 
number of months, a pattern which continued in July. With the impact 
of recently announced mergers and cutbacks yet to be felt, few 
observers anticipate a near-term improvement in the District's 
employment picture.
     </p>
     <p>
      The August survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed an increase 
in firms with greater output and a substantial drop-from 41 percent 
in July to 18 percent in August-in those with smaller output. The 
percentage with the same or increased new orders also rose slightly. 
The July survey of purchasing managers in Rochester showed a sizable 
rise in the percentage anticipating improved business conditions 
over the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District reported that while their willingness to extend 
loans remains unchanged from three months ago, they are facing 
reduced loan demand. In particular, consumer demand for installment 
credit and automobile loans has slowed, while demand for home equity 
loans has not shown a trend in either direction. The majority of 
senior officers also indicated lower delinquency rates on all 
consumer loans compared with three months earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most loan officers reported that their interest rates have remained 
stable and their credit standards unchanged over the last three 
months. However, a few respondents are conducting more rigorous 
background and employment verifications of potential borrowers. The 
credit quality of borrowers at the majority of surveyed banks has 
not changed in recent months.
