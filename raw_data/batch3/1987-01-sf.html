      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The end of 1986 saw continued moderate growth in most parts of the 
Twelfth District, although some areas failed to share in the overall 
growth. The Christmas season was a good one for retailers in most 
parts of the District. Manufacturing industries continued to present 
a mixed picture, with strong aerospace activity but weakness in 
other areas including electronics. Oil and copper mining activity 
appear to be inching ahead, a marked improvement from the sharp 
downslides seen until recently in both sectors. Construction and 
real estate activity were affected by tax reform considerations at 
the end of the year, and activity in single-family home markets 
currently is much stronger than is multi-family or commercial 
activity. Financial developments reflect those in the real estate 
sector, with tax-related activity at the end of the year, weak 
multifamily and commercial lending, and continued strong mortgage 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Christmas season got off to a slow start in many parts of the 
District, but a pickup later in the season led to satisfactory sales 
growth in the 5 percent range in most areas. Washington retailers 
reported sales growth of about 10 percent, which they attribute in 
part to the year-end bonuses averaging $3000 that over 115,000 
Seattle-area Boeing employees received. The gains in Washington were 
particularly welcome because they were achieved with few price 
markdowns. In sharp contrast, respondents from some communities with 
weak economies, such as Idaho and some agricultural areas in eastern 
Oregon and central California, reported flat or even declining sales 
and aggressive promotional activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports indicate that end-of-year auto sales were strong in most 
parts of the West, largely due to the elimination of sales tax 
deductions. Some respondents reported particularly dramatic year-end 
sales surges for luxury automobiles. In Oregon, which has no sales 
tax, little change in activity at the end of the year was reported. 
Most observers agree that the year-end sales spurt borrowed from 
next year so sales during the first few months of 1987 are expected 
to be slow. Evidence regarding the impact of tax reform on the 
purchase of other consumer durables is more mixed, as some 
respondents reported significant effects but most reported little 
discernable year-end activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little has changed for the West's major manufacturing sectors. 
Western defense contractors continue to pull in large projects, 
while orders for commercial aircraft also continue to roll in. These 
developments represent good news for Seattle and Los Angeles, as 
well as the many other western cities for which aerospace activity 
contributes to the local economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The electronics and semiconductor industries continue to suffer the 
consequences of weak demand, fierce competition, and resulting low 
prices. For example, one Utah company recently announced a layoff of 
just over 10 percent of its employees. Many companies throughout the 
District lost money in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      At the end of 1986 some glimmers of hope began to appear for various 
beleaguered sectors of the mining industry. In Utah, copper 
companies were hiring rather than laying off workers, while in Kern 
County (California) sore laid-off oil workers have been called back 
to their jobs. Moreover, some previously shut down oil wells in Kern 
County now are pumping again.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction of multifamily and nonresidential building has slowed 
considerably in most parts of the District, and respondents agreed 
that overbuilding has reduced substantially the incentive to build. 
Some areas saw further slowing just prior to the January 1 
imposition of the new tax bill, but this was not true in areas where 
economic conditions caused a slowdown in activity during the second 
half of 1986. Some observers also report that because changes in the 
tax law have reduced the attractiveness of real estate as an 
investment, real estate prices have fallen or are expected to fall 
in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Single-family construction activity continues to fare much better 
because the reductions in interest rates already seen have made 
housing more affordable. No tax related changes have been seen or 
are expected in single family home building.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reflecting changes in construction activity, the demand for 
construction loans dropped off sharply during the last months of 
1986. However, there was a surge in tax-related deals at the end of 
the year as sellers raced to collect capital gains under the old tax 
law, which generated additional loan demand among buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lending volume fell towards the end of 1986 in some areas, 
but remained very strong in California. Through the first ten months 
of 1986, California savings and loans had closed 50 percent more 
mortgage loans than they had during the same period of 1985, and 
loan commitments for October suggested that the trend was likely to 
continue through the end of the year. Thus, resale activity remained 
strong even though housing starts declined over the same period. In 
addition, some lenders report that home equity loans are becoming 
more popular as borrowers seek to deduct their interest payments.
