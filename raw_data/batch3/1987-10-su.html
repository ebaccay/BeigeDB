      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 27, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions continue to improve in most districts, with 
particular strength in the manufacturing sector. Reports from 
Boston, New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco are particularly 
upbeat, whereas growth in the Kansas City and Dallas districts has 
been less robust. St. Louis continues to report generally less 
satisfactory economic performance. Even the three relatively weaker 
districts have enjoyed recent strength in manufacturing, however. 
Retail sales are showing modest gains in many regions, with 
particular strength in the Boston and Atlanta areas, but 
sluggishness in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas areas. Auto 
sales are flat, or even down a bit, according to most district 
reports. Construction activity is mixed, as it was last month, with 
commercial building a bit better than residential in many parts of 
the country. Mining is strong, and all districts commenting on oil 
drilling report some increases in rig counts. Crops and harvest 
conditions have been favorable almost everywhere. Only the Richmond 
district reports reduced corn yields, due primarily to adverse 
weather. Two districts report improvement in the financial condition 
of farmers and ranchers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports indicate demand/supply imbalances in some markets. There is 
continued mention of tightness in certain labor markets, 
particularly in retail and service industries. And many districts 
report rising prices for some raw materials and imported inputs. 
Several note price hikes and even spot shortages for certain types 
of steel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Almost all districts report strength in manufacturing, continuing 
the trend noted last month. Even St. Louis, with weaker overall 
economic activity, reports a recent upturn in the manufacturing 
sector. Richmond's survey of manufacturers shows increases in 
shipments, new orders, unfilled orders, employment, and the 
workweek. Results of a Philadelphia survey are much the same. The 
San Francisco district emphasizes strength in manufactured exports, 
due to the dollar's decline and "buy American" campaigns in some 
Asian countries. As San Francisco says, "Manufacturers of 
commodities such as chemicals and paper were affected first, but 
gains now are spreading to a whole range of light manufactured 
products, including medical equipment and industrial valves." Of 
course, weakness in auto sales does not bode well for manufacturing 
activity in that important industry. Chicago reports an indefinite 
layoff of 2,000 workers at a truck assembly plant in September and 
planned closings of two more motor vehicle plants by year-end. Heavy 
truck sales have been quite good, reflecting in part the strength of 
manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales are mixed. Boston, New York, and Atlanta report 
considerable strength, with sales generally above plan for the month 
of September. More modest results are noted in the Philadelphia, 
Chicago, and Minneapolis districts. But retail sales in the 
Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas districts are sluggish or flat. 
In general, retailers appear guardedly optimistic about the coming 
fall and Christmas seasons. Auto sales were weak in almost all 
districts in September and early October, and most industry 
representatives are pessimistic about a quick turnaround. 
Minneapolis seems to buck the trend, reporting fairly good auto 
sales in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity is mixed with some evidence that commercial 
building is stronger than residential. Richmond reports "firm demand 
for new nonresidential construction but weakening demand for 
residential construction." The situation is similar in the Atlanta 
district. St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas note some 
weakness in construction generally. But there are numerous bright 
spots. The demand for New York City office space has been good in 
recent weeks, and upstate New York builders are busy. Homebuilders 
in the Philadelphia district have a backlog of sales commitments. 
And residential construction is still quite healthy in several 
western states, including California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, and 
Washington. Also, southern California has an abundance of real 
estate buyers from foreign countries, especially Japan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Strength is apparent in the mining sector. Mining operations in the 
Minneapolis district are generally active, particularly the four 
gold mines which are running at capacity. U. S. copper has become 
more competitive in world markets, stimulating output in Montana. 
Increases in rig counts are noted by all districts reporting on 
petroleum drilling, including Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. 
Analysts in Texas, however, believe that drilling activity has 
nearly completed its shift upward, as long as oil prices stay in 
their present range.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from the agricultural sector are generally quite strong. 
Crops and harvest conditions have been good in most parts of the 
nation, with only the Richmond district reporting weakness. There 
"corn yields are running 20 to 40 percent below normal and even less 
in areas severely affected by drought." Nationally, livestock farms 
are generally profitable due to favorable price structures. Both 
Minneapolis and Kansas City note that farm financial problems have 
eased somewhat and that ranchers are using recent profits to pay 
down loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tightening Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand is outstripping supply in some markets. There is continued 
and even increasing mention of tightness in specific labor markets, 
including reports from Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San 
Francisco. Retail and service industries are generally the most 
affected, and several districts note recent wage increases in those 
sectors. Rising prices are noted for some raw materials and imported 
inputs, and several districts mention higher prices for imported 
apparel. Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas note price hikes and even 
spot shortages for certain types of steel. Both the Boston and 
Philadelphia districts observe that most manufacturers are, so far, 
holding the line on their own prices. However, nearly half the 
manufacturers queried in a Philadelphia district survey indicate 
that they plan to raise prices during the next six months.
