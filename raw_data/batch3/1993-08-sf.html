      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 4, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakness in California continues to offset economic growth in other 
District states. In California, economic activity remains sluggish 
across a broad range of sectors--including manufacturing, 
construction, retail, finance, and government--and new layoffs were 
announced in the computer industry. Cutbacks in aerospace also are 
restraining growth in western Washington. Outside of these regions, 
growth is reported in several areas, with overall conditions 
strongest in eastern Washington, Utah, and Idaho. Overall business 
sentiment remains flat after declining from early 1993, with most 
contacts expecting continued slow growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders is little changed 
from our June report. About half of the respondents expect the real 
economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate at or 
above trend growth. This proportion is about the same as in June, 
but is down from two-thirds in April and three-quarters in March. 
Most other respondents expect the economy to expand, but at a rate 
below trend. In general, contacts from Idaho, Oregon, and Utah 
expect their regions to perform better than the national average. 
Most contacts in California and Washington, however, expect their 
regions to underperform the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity varies widely across the District. In California, 
sluggish retail sales are reported by several contacts. Soft-good 
sales are reported flat and sales of cars and light trucks are 
reported down 2 percent from a year earlier. Contacts in western 
Washington also report weakness in retail trade. In Arizona, durable 
goods sales are reported strong, especially for autos, but 
nondurable goods sales are lackluster. Strong sales are reported in 
Idaho and Utah.
     </p>
     <p>
      Condition in service-related industries are mixed. Tourism is 
reported strong in Idaho and Utah, especially in national parks. In 
California, the motion picture and amusement park industries are 
reported to have seen rapid job growth over the past year. A contact 
in the legal industry reports flat or declining revenues, with 
downward pressure on prices. The state of California reached a 
budget agreement that extends temporary sales taxes and shifts 
property tax revenues from local governments to the state. Contacts 
in local government, however, report that the shift in revenues 
threatens to cause deep cuts in government services, employment, and 
wages. State budget shortfalls also are reported in Oregon and 
Washington. A contact with a California non-profit agency reports 
reduced funding from both public and private sources at a time of 
increased need.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is mixed in the District, with weakness 
centered in aerospace and defense-related industries. In Washington, 
contacts report that declines in defense and aerospace continue to 
impede economic growth. Contacts in California and Arizona also 
report that high-tech manufacturing is contracting due to cutbacks 
and restructuring in defense and aerospace. Southern Arizona, 
however, is benefiting from a shift of aerospace production activity 
from California. Computer manufacturing is reported strong in 
Oregon. In northern California, however, layoffs due to 
restructuring were announced at a major computer producer, with the 
job losses concentrated in Silicon Valley.
     </p>
     <p>
      A few manufacturing industries are showing signs of improvement. A 
contact from Arizona reports strength in the advanced technology 
sector, particularly semiconductors, customized integrated circuits, 
and embedded microchips. High-tech manufacturing is reported strong 
in Idaho. Construction equipment sales are reported up in Utah. In 
California, contacts report strength in textiles, apparel, and other 
nondurable industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts report a generally favorable outlook for agriculture. 
Rain damage to crops is reported in parts of Oregon and Arizona, but 
improved water availability has boosted production in California and 
eastern Oregon. A contact in the railroad industry reports very 
strong exports of fruits and vegetables. In Utah and Idaho, 
depressed conditions are reported in timber and mining. In Alaska, a 
contact reports weakness in logging, mining, and seafood. Recent oil 
discoveries, however, have improved prospects for increased economic 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District real estate and construction markets show widely disparate 
conditions, with the weakest performance reported in southern 
California. A contact in southern California reports that sales 
activity and prices continue to decline for homes valued over 
$300,000. Some activity, however, is reported in starter home 
construction, as disposal sales of foreclosed vacant land are 
providing additional and better locations for low-end projects. 
Mixed conditions also are reported in western Washington, in part 
due to layoffs in aerospace. In contrast, southern Arizona is 
reported to be having its largest volume of home sales in years. A 
surge in new residential construction is reported, and commercial 
real estate also is reported to be moving well. Housing markets in 
eastern Washington, Utah, and Idaho are reported to be very strong. 
Higher prices for building materials are reported to he pushing up 
home prices and construction costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mixed conditions are reported across District financial markets. In 
California, contacts report conditions as generally improving, with 
modest growth expected for consumer lending. Business borrowing 
remains lackluster, however, and foreclosure rates are expected to 
rise in areas hit by aerospace cutbacks. A contact from Oregon 
reports high profits and a strong demand for credit. Conditions in 
Idaho and Utah are reported as excellent, in part due to strong 
construction lending.
