      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy varied among sectors 
during recent weeks. Consumer spending was stronger than many 
retailers had anticipated and the turmoil in the financial markets 
had little effect on office leasing outside the New York 
metropolitan area. Business activity was somewhat mixed, however, 
and residential construction was seasonally slack. Small and medium-
sized banks reported no appreciab1e decline in the demand for 
consumer loans since the stock market crash.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that, on the whole, consumer spending in 
recent weeks was more spirited than many had anticipated, given the 
stock market crash and its retrenching effects. While sales in the 
District were somewhat weak during the first half of November, they 
strengthened as the month progressed, and during December were 
either on or slightly below plan. Because of exceptionally heavy 
discounting during the Christmas season, however, several retailers 
stated that they anticipate a substantial drain on profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents reported over-the-year sales changes ranging from -2.5 
percent to +9 percent in November and from +6 percent to +12 percent 
in December. An annual survey by the Retail Council of New York 
State, which primarily covers stores outside New York City, found an 
average increase of 5 to 6 percent during the Thanksgiving Friday to 
Christmas Sunday period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Items in good demand were certain types of women's apparel, 
perfumes, jewelry, and other accessories while sportswear and 
electronics sold poorly. An unusually large number of foreign buyers 
was noted at several New York stores, attributed to the relative 
strength of most foreign currencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Second District have been somewhat mixed 
since the last report. While purchasing agents in the Rochester area 
noted only a seasonal slowdown in manufacturing activity, responses 
from firms in Buffalo indicate that some slackening of business 
activity may have occurred there. In New York City additional  
cutbacks are taking place in the brokerage and banking sectors as a 
result of the stock market crash as well as some basic 
restructuring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the recent and continuing layoffs in New York City, District 
unemployment rates remain lower than the national average. New 
Jersey posted a rate of 3.9 percent in December while New York's was 
a slightly higher 4.5 percent. New York City's rate of 5.0 percent 
also was relatively low. With more layoffs scheduled in the City 
during the weeks ahead, many observers anticipate a negative impact 
on District unemployment rates in the near future. Since 
announcements of new and expanding industries have been made in 
other areas, however, the net effect on District employment remains 
to be seen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity has been seasonally slack in much of the 
District, but ground was broken in December for an 1107-unit 
multifamily development on Roosevelt Island, a part of New York 
City. This is the first residential construction on that island in 
more than ten years and, in contrast to the luxury condominiums 
which characterize most new apartment buildings in the City, will be 
primarily middle-income rental housing. Another large development 
which is slated to start in February is the construction of 1000 
units of townhouses and condominium apartments as part of a $225 
million mixed-use project in central New Jersey. In another attempt 
to deal with the shortage of affordable housing, more than 24 
employers on Long Island recently formed a partnership to foster 
additional middle-income housing citing the increasing difficulty in 
attracting and keeping employees there due to the high price of 
homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The turmoil in the financial markets has apparently had little or no 
effect on office leasing outside the New York metropolitan area. 
However, activity has slowed in downtown and midtown Manhattan and 
on Long Island, and many observers expect vacancy rates to rise in 
the wake of continuing employment cutbacks at brokerage and banking 
firms. Citing this softening real estate market, five commodity 
exchanges recently abandoned plans to build a 65-story skyscraper in 
downtown Manhattan, and considerable uncertainty surrounds the 
proposal for a large midtown project which originally was to have 
housed a major brokerage firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Senior officers of small and medium-sized banks in the Second 
District reported that they have not noticed an appreciable decline 
in the demand for consumer loans since the stock market crash. Most 
did state that demand is not as strong as it was a year ago, but 
several linked this to the Tax Reform Act provision reducing 
interest expense deductions rather than to the crash. Many officers 
noted delinquencies on their consumer loans have risen recently, 
though not to alarming levels. Those surveyed expressed uncertainty 
as to whether the rise should be attributed to the crash or to the 
normal seasonal increase in delinquencies following the holiday 
season. In spite of the rising delinquency rates, only one bank in 
the survey has tightened credit standards for loan applicants in 
recent months. Consumer demand for mortgages and home equity loans 
is generally weak, especially in the suburbs surrounding New York 
City. Though the residential real estate market is typically slow 
during the winter months, some bankers thought that the crash may 
have made some individuals more reluctant to purchase homes. In 
contrast, demand for bank credit cards remains steady.
