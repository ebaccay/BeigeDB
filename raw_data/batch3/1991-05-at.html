      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 1, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although the positive signs observed last month have been 
reinforced, reports from businesses contacted in April continue to 
give a mixed picture of the southeastern economy. Retailers and 
realtors report that the post-war sales pickup has been maintained, 
but most are concerned that recent improvements are linked more to 
"catch up" spending and good spring weather rather than to any 
sustainable improvement in the economy. Sales of homes continued to 
improve, but builders are skeptical about whether the recovery is 
sustainable. While manufacturing levels were, on balance, below or 
barely equal to those seen a year ago, most producers of home 
furnishings have seen a recent pickup in orders. Freight haulers say 
that April shipments are up across-the-board, suggesting evidence of 
a possible turnaround. Meanwhile, reports from bankers mirror those 
of businesses, indicating a slight increase in credit demand and 
some easing of credit conditions in recent weeks. Reports on prices 
indicated declines in several categories of materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported a significant improvement in March and early 
April sales from earlier this year, although volume remained below 
or only equaled year-ago levels. However, they attributed much of 
the improvement to normal seasonal patterns. Several contacts also 
expressed fear that the sales improvement during recent weeks may be 
only "catch up" spending without any permanence. Most merchants 
continue to keep inventories lean, waiting until there are further 
signs that recent improvements will be sustained. However, bankers 
indicate that some retailers, acting on sales expectations, are 
requesting a temporary increase in their lines of credit for planned 
additions to inventory. Auto dealers reported that the sharp postwar 
sales pickup has been maintained through March and early April, 
although units sold were still below year-ago levels. On a brighter 
note, the tourism and convention businesses have shown signs of a 
rebound with foreign visitors returning after a war-related 
reduction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although construction materials manufacturing has continued to slip, 
home furnishings producers have seen significant improvements from 
their depressed orders of recent months. The household fabrics 
segment of the textile industry has reportedly posted increased 
orders that have resulted in extended mill operating schedules over 
the past few weeks. A manufacturer of replacement air conditioners 
and parts has received several sizable orders as distributors 
rebuild inventories depleted in recent days. Indicative of a more 
general turnaround, a packaging manufacturer reports a slight 
increase in orders recently and has responded by rebuilding 
inventory levels. Reports from truck and rail transporters give 
further evidence of an upturn, showing a recent pickup in total 
shipment volume and noting that industrial chemicals are especially 
strong. However, this increase was, in part, attributed to stock 
building because of railroad strike worries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other producers, however, report continued declining or flat sales 
and persistent soft orders for March and early April. A 
telecommunications company reports no letup in its overall business 
decline and anticipates additional layoffs of a work force already 
reduced by 20 percent over the past nine months. Steel producers, 
auto-related manufacturers, apparel, and some apparel fabric 
producers have also responded to continuing bleak sales with further 
layoffs and have indicated there are no plans to step up output at 
this time. Paper, pulp, and linerboard producers also report 
continuing slow sales and are delaying capital expansions until 
economic conditions improve. A slowdown is reported in exports of 
poultry, grain, and coal, although phosphate exports show strength. 
District banks verify that current production levels in several 
industries are flat to down. However, bankers report that most 
manufacturers have dropped their "doomsday" scenarios, and, as a 
result, have stabilized or slightly increased inventory levels in 
recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business and consumer loan demand is reported by bankers to remain 
weak, although some observed improvements recently. One banker 
reported a slight pickup in overall loan demand while another 
reports that retail business loan demand has improved as a result of 
retailers' increased sales expectations. Some contacts report easing 
of credit standards, particularly for small business with good track 
records, but most feel that tight lending conditions continue to 
restrict loan growth. Business contacts confirm this result, 
reporting that a number of large suppliers continue to serve as a 
'credit line" for customers by extending accounts receivables 
maturities and cosigning bank loans for clients.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Realtors indicate that the rise in both existing and new home sales 
reported earlier this year has continued through March and early 
April. Although builders that were contacted have responded with 
modest increases in residential building, they remain skeptical 
about the strength and sustainability of the housing recovery. This 
skepticism is reflected in reports from building materials suppliers 
and manufacturers whose sales continue to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts reported subdued wage increases. However, shortages 
and wage increases in markets for certain types of workers in oil 
producing areas and health services are said to continue. Businesses 
report lower input prices for linerboard, boxes, and newsprint, 
while steel prices have dropped dramatically in response to the 
reduced demand from building and auto industries. Natural gas prices 
have plummeted to a five-year low causing some producers to scale 
back production and to review exploration plans.
