      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sixth District contacts reported that the Southeast economy resumed 
a moderate pace of expansion after experiencing sluggish growth in 
the early fall. Retailers said that shoppers began so return to the 
stores in large numbers in late October, after a lull in sales 
activity. Auto dealers continued to report year-over-year gains in 
new car sales. The number of manufacturers reporting current 
production increases rose as did those expecting improvements in 
future activity. According to builders and realtors, the single-
family housing market remains one of the strongest sectors in the 
regional economy, while commercial real estate activity finally has 
begun to show signs of slow improvement. Bank contacts reported that 
consumer loan demand continued to grow modestly. They noted that, 
for the first time in several years, commercial lending is 
increasing. Wage increases and prices of finished goods generally 
were said so be stable, but several contacts noted that they 
continued to see increases in the prices of lumber and other 
building materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After recording disappointing early fall sales, Sixth District 
retailers reported that cooler weather and an early start to the 
holiday shopping season resulted in a surge of sales beginning in 
late October. Although sales of durable goods such as furniture, 
appliances, and home electronics remained strong throughout the 
summer and early fall, sales of nondurables, particularly women's 
apparel, were weak during this same period. In late October, 
however, sales of nondurables picked up considerably, and this 
improvement was sustained through the end of November. Prior to the 
Thanksgiving holiday, most retailers reported that they were only 
cautiously optimistic about the prospects for this year's holiday 
sales. However, several reported that Thanksgiving weekend sales 
exceeded plans and increased their confidence that December sales 
will surpass last year's levels by a good margin. Although auto 
sales have slowed somewhat from their mid-summer peak, most dealers 
continued to see year-over-year sales gains through November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to factory contacts, current manufacturing activity 
improved moderately in October and early November, as did the 
outlook for future activity. Producers of lumber and other building 
materials, carpet, and home furnishings have continued to benefit 
from demand generated by relatively strong regional and national 
housing markets, and, more recently, from an improvement an 
commercial construction. The transportation equipment sector is 
receiving a boost from increased production of commercial trucks, 
while shipbuilding has improved recently as a result of new orders 
for floating casinos. On a less positive note, regional apparel 
producers continued to pare jobs; new Defense Department cutbacks 
also have resulted in additional layoffs. Although most industry 
contacts reported that they had not hired new workers in recent 
weeks, the share of firms contacted that plan to begin hiring new 
employees within the next six months has been increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Southeastern realtors continued to report strong single-family home 
sales; most agents said that they recorded year-over-year sales 
gains in both October and November. Trade-ups and luxury homes are 
reportedly selling more rapidly in recent weeks, although demand 
remains strongest for both starter and mid-priced homes purchased by 
first-time buyers. Low inventories of both new and resale homes have 
decreased the length of time that homes remain on the market, which 
in turn has stimulated new building activity in many market areas. 
Most builders and real estate agents expect next year's home sales 
to remain at least at this year's levels. However, builders in some
areas noted that a shortage of developed lots and qualified sub-
contractors was beginning to slow home construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      While still slow when compared to the 1980s, multifamily and 
commercial real estate markets have continued to show signs of 
steady improvement. Vacancy rates for both office and industrial 
space have continued to edge downward while effective rental rates 
have climbed. In the last few months a relatively large number of 
new retail, commercial, and public building projects were announced 
across the District, along with several new multifamily residential 
developments. Nevertheless, most contacts do not expect to see an 
increase in speculative building for at least another year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers around the region reported that loan demand was up 
moderately in November. Residential mortgage lending for new homes 
has continued at a strong pace, despite the recent uptick in long-
term interest rates, while other forms of consumer lending also were 
reported to have increased during the last month. Improvement in 
commercial loan demand, which had been flat during much of this 
year, also was noted by several bankers. In particular, they noted 
an increase in loans for business expansion, as well as increased 
demand for loans to finance construction of new retail outlets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wages and prices of finished goods generally were reported to be 
stable through November. However, several contacts continued to note 
that prices of lumber and other building materials have risen since 
August.
