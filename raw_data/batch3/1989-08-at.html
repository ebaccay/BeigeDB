      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of contacts at businesses headquartered in the Southeast 
have revised their expectations of business activity downward in 
light of either reports of a general economic slowdown or an actual 
slowdown in their sales. Few have indicated that they were going to 
change their capital investment plans as a result. Businesses 
related to the housing and construction industries have reported 
significant slowing, and the trucking industry also reports that 
business is down. Recently, oil and gas exploration has been showing 
some strength, and this has in turn been helping suppliers to this 
industry. There are a few reports of localized pressure on wages, 
particularly for unskilled workers. Input prices are being reported 
as stable, and in a few eases, failing slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Reports of Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although economic activity continues to expand in the Southeast, 
several areas of softness have become apparent. The slowdown in 
residential, office, and retail construction continues, and the 
effects are now being felt in several related industries. A 
furniture retailer notes that sales have slowed recently and that he 
expects some further slowing. A supplier of building materials 
reports that sales in Florida are down and that his firm is 
introducing lower-priced materials for cost-conscious contractors. 
Some slowing in the paper and pulp industry is also apparent. 
Several contacts report that order backlogs have decreased recently. 
A warehouse operator reports that most goods continue to move 
through normally but certain items, especially paper goods, are said 
to be accumulating. The transportation and freight industry is 
reporting a general slowdown in business. Several large trucking 
firms report that their volume of shipments has decreased, in some 
instances dramatically. Two operators, one in Florida and the other 
in New Orleans, note that shipments of building materials have been 
off substantially. Although rail sources have not revised their 
business expectations downward any further, truck operators report 
that in general their outlooks have been revised down recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several industries, however, have stated that their business is 
starting to improve. Oil and gas drilling is up. The increase has 
been strongest in natural gas exploration in the Gulf, but one 
contact says that the recent stability in oil prices has begun to 
restore some confidence among oil drillers. This is showing up in 
increases in orders for drilling equipment from Louisiana suppliers. 
A manufacturer of air conditioning equipment reported that his firm 
has been running close to capacity recently with no sign of slowdown 
anticipated. He attributed the strength in orders to remodeling and
replacement rather than to new building construction. Producers of 
communications and electronic equipment in Georgia state that 
business is still strong and that they do not expect much, if any, 
slowing in their industry. The one weak spot in communication and 
electronic equipment sales has been in federal government orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several financial institutions pointed out that because of growth in 
home equity lines of credit, consumer loans have increased recently. 
Two lenders noted that there has been some increase in ARM mortgage 
lending, although they remain somewhat cautious in their outlook. A 
few other bankers noted, however, that borrowers seem to have become 
more hesitant to take out new loans in light of general reports of a 
slowing economy. Auto loans are widely reported being down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of tight labor supplies and greater than expected wage 
pressures are rare in the Southeast. Five percent seems to be the 
upper limit to reported wage increases, although the cost of 
benefits, particularly medical care, is still increasing more 
rapidly than wages. A hotel chain operator reports that it is still 
difficult to get workers at or slightly above minimum wage and sees 
few signs of slowing business activity. A spokesman for a ship 
repair yard in Louisiana said that pressures on crew wages and 
charges for repair work have been building with the increased demand 
for offshore drilling. Several manufacturers said that materials 
prices have been essentially steady. Rolled steel and copper prices 
have remained constant for the past few months, and prices for some 
grades of paper have actually come down recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Feed costs have remained stable owing to recent rains in the 
Midwest, although District fertilizer demand and costs have fallen 
because heavy rains in the Southeast have reduced planting 
substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories and Investments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Even though several businesses reported that they had revised their 
economic outlook down, few have reported any changes in planned 
inventories or investment plans. A furniture distributor intends to 
reduce already low inventories because of expectations of further 
slowdowns in sales. On the other hand, several chemical producers in 
Louisiana announced plant expansions recently. A number of 
automobile parts producers in Tennessee have recently announced 
large expansions or plans to construct new plants altogether. The 
firms produce parts for domestic auto-makers. A paper and lumber 
producer noted that several new plants currently under construction 
will bring substantial capacity on line in the next two years during 
a period in which he is now expecting slowing sales. An assembler of 
offshore drilling equipment and rigs has opened a previously idle 
factory.
