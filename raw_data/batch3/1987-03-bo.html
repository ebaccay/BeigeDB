      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 16, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      This month's reports from First District retailers and manufacturers 
were the most positive in some time. Retailers were both pleased and 
surprised by the strength of February sales. For the most part, auto 
dealerships were exceptions to the generally favorable sales 
picture, but within this group too there were reports of 
surprisingly good sales volumes. Reports from the manufacturing 
sector still indicate little vitality; nevertheless, there is some 
evidence of a gradual pickup in orders and respondents seem more 
optimistic about the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories have increased, but respondents express no 
concern about this development. Manufacturing inventories are low by 
historic standards and respondents intend to keep them this way. No 
significant price changes have been observed by either retailing or 
manufacturing respondents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers contacted were very pleasantly surprised in February. 
Reports on February sales included such phrases as "astoundingly 
good" and "unbelievable;" year-over-year increases ranged from 9 to 
30 percent on a comparable stores basis. February is usually a slow 
month even with considerable price reductions, but stores did well 
with spring merchandise as well as with discounted older items. One 
merchant commented that if consumers are really going to pull back 
in response to high debt levels, they have postponed it. For the 
fiscal year as a whole, which ended in January, results were 6 to 10 
percent ahead of 1985. This was above plan for all contacts but one.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories were reported to be somewhat high. Some increases were 
by design. Others were not, but contacts did not regard these 
unplanned increases with much concern.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices are said to be stable, except for pharmacy items. However, 
one department store owner reported "reliable rumors" that prices 
will be up noticeably for fall merchandise because of the decline in 
the value of the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      First District retailers are expecting a good first half of the year 
although they do not expect February's surprisingly high rates of 
increase to be sustained. The representative of a chain concentrated 
in the more rural areas of the East and Midwest said its stores in 
the Northeast are doing better than those elsewhere - a pattern he 
expects to continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicle Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The high level of automobile sales in December appears to have 
dipped into January's and early February's sales volumes for most of 
the dealerships surveyed. While the end-of-the-year rush to take 
advantage of the sales tax break is seen as a major factor in the 
slowdown, some claim that cold weather has also played an important 
role. (January and February are typically slower months.) Signs of 
improvement are reported, however, by both domestic and foreign 
dealerships. A few contacts are experiencing surprisingly good sales 
activity, which they attribute to product quality and reputation. 
Used cars continue to do well as their sale pattern is less 
seasonal. Trucks typically sell well during the winter months; light 
trucks are said to be especially popular because of their 
affordability.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of manufacturing activity in the First District seems to 
have inched up in the past couple of months, and there is a slightly 
more optimistic tone to respondents' reports. Orders are continuing 
to increase for such products as appliances and housing products, 
some communications and computer equipment, medical equipment, and 
plastics. Semiconductors have started to pick up, according to one 
contact. While demand in most other areas remains flat, there were 
no reports of deteriorating orders or shipments. For high tech 
respondents, sales to Europe are said to be quite good; some 
progress is also being made in selling in the Far East (from plants 
located in the Far East), although one contact reported that 
Japanese customers have cut back their orders because of declining 
export sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cost containment continues to be a high priority. Inventory-to-sales 
ratios are generally low by historic standards. One contact 
commented that large purchases to take advantage of volume discounts 
are a thing of the past; his firm now bays precisely what it needs. 
Another observed that his firm's customers are doing the same thing: 
formerly they bought in lots of 5,000; now they order exactly 
"2,112" items. In a similar vein, employment levels are stable to 
slightly down, even for companies experiencing volume growth. One 
high tech firm noted that, because of automation, his firm must 
increase volume 15 percent just to maintain its manufacturing work 
force; the firm is currently growing at a 5 to 10 percent rate. Most 
respondents expect capital spending in 1987 to be fairly similar to 
that in 1986. No significant increases in vendor prices were 
observed. One contact had successfully increased its own prices at 
year-end, while another reported that its prices have been falling 
on average.
