      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District business and financial activity apparently weakened 
somewhat in recent weeks, although there was a noticeable shift 
toward optimism about near-term prospects. Retail sales, 
manufacturing, real estate, tourism, and bank lending evidently 
declined in January and February. Exports were generally unchanged 
and imports rose at District seaports. Mild weather conditions 
likely benefited agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Survey respondents--even those surveyed before the ceasefire in the 
Gulf War--were decidedly more optimistic about the economic outlook 
than they had been a few weeks ago. Further, some who remained 
pessimistic believed that the economy would begin to recover when 
the conflict ended--a condition now apparently met.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular survey of retailers suggested that retail activity 
softened in late January and early February. Most of those surveyed 
reported decreases in shopper traffic and in total sales, including 
sales of big ticket items. Nearly four in five reported that sales 
had declined since the Allied air campaign began. Employment at 
retail stores decreased, while wholesale and retail prices 
increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of the retailers expected their sales to rise in coming 
months. This optimism contrasted with retailers' pessimistic survey 
responses a few weeks ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey of manufacturers indicated that District 
manufacturing activity declined slightly in January and early 
February. Far more respondents reported decreases than increases in 
shipments, orders, and employment. Over two-thirds said poor sales 
were their biggest problem. Nearly half said that sales had declined 
since the Gulf War began, while only one in eight said sales had 
picked up. Most manufacturers indicated that the prices and 
inventories of their raw materials and finished products had 
remained stable in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the textile and furniture industries remained depressed. 
Several producers have gone out of business in recent months. Most 
manufacturers were operating on reduced workweeks. One producer 
expressed concern over the deteriorating quality of manufacturers' 
accounts receivable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking forward, however, manufacturers were optimistic for the 
first time in several months. One-half believed that orders would 
increase over the next six months, while only a few foresaw a 
decline. Similarly, one-half expected conditions in their local 
areas and in the nation to improve in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District ports--Baltimore, Charleston, and Hampton Roads (Norfolk)--
indicated that exports were generally unchanged while imports were 
generally higher in January than in December. Compared with a year 
ago, export shipments were higher at all three ports and imports 
were higher at two. Authorities at all ports expected exports to 
rise faster than imports over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial and residential real estate activity apparently remained 
weak across most of the District during late January and early 
February. Contractors and real estate analysts reported very little 
commercial construction in their areas. One analyst said that 
absorption of existing office space was slowed by the consolidations 
of many service-producing firms--primary users of office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      Buyer interest in houses apparently rose, but home sales remained 
sluggish in most urban areas and home prices were reportedly down 
slightly. Sales activity was reported weakest in the most expensive 
segment of the market and generally stable in the lower-priced 
segments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts indicated that 
tourist activity was below average this winter. Over half the 
respondents experienced declines in room occupancy while one-third 
noted little change. The slow tourist business was attributed to the 
Gulf War, the general economic slowdown, and the lack of snow for 
skiing. The respondents expected business to improve, however, in 
the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone reported that 
loan volume and interest rates were lower in recent weeks. Loan 
demand was also down compared with a year earlier. Almost all of 
those contacted reported extremely slow commercial real estate loan 
activity, with little borrower or banker appetite for loans. Bankers 
cited uncertainties related to the Gulf War and sluggish economic 
conditions as reasons for the slowdown in consumer loans. Several 
bankers said that the recent economic downturn had dampened 
consumers' willingness to borrow. One Northern Virginia banker, 
however, reported a large increase in residential mortgage 
applications in the days leading up to the ceasefire, and several 
thought demand would pick up somewhat in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost all of the bankers expressed a belief that current lending 
standards were prudent and, for the most part, not causing 
creditworthy borrowers to be refused credit. Several said, though, 
that appraisal costs and the lengthy approval period for mortgage 
loans may have caused some potential borrowers to withdraw 
applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farm analysts reported that mild winter weather had generally 
benefited small grains and lessened the drawdown of winter hay 
stocks. Mild weather apparently helped many District farmers begin 
spring planting preparations earlier than usual and also may have 
boosted survival rates of winter calves.
