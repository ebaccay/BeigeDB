      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 2, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Twelfth District economy continues to expand at a healthy pace. 
The Business Sentiment survey reveals that expectations are somewhat 
more modest than in the last report, although most respondents 
continue to anticipate healthy economic growth. Auto sales are 
satisfactory, but retail sales growth remains sluggish. 
Manufacturing activity continues strong, with most respondents 
reporting inventories close to desired levels. The drought has not 
affected most western farmers, although profit margins on cattle are 
being squeezed by higher feed costs and lower beef prices. Demand 
for most forest products continues strong, but strikes at several 
Northwest mills are restricting supply. Construction and real estate 
activity continues mixed, with the coastal states reporting 
particularly strong demand for single-family homes. Respondents are 
about evenly divided between those who anticipate steady wage gains 
during the next year and those who expect wage increases to 
accelerate. Banks and thrifts report generally healthy activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to the Twelfth District Business Sentiment survey 
continue to expect GNP growth during the next year to be a little 
lower than 3 percent, with none anticipating a recession during that 
period. Compared with the previous survey, respondents are slightly 
less optimistic about economic growth, and somewhat more optimistic 
about inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales continue at a satisfactory pace in most part of the 
Twelfth District. Inventories of most domestic models are at or 
below desired levels, but some respondents report that slow sales 
have increased inventories of imported cars to unsustainably high 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth of retail sales remains sluggish. One retail executive 
asserts that the sector is improving very slowly from its poor 
Spring. Another notes continued slow growth, but points out that 
retailers have been managing expenses and inventories very 
conservatively, and earnings therefore have held up reasonably well. 
Most respondents indicate that retail inventories are close to 
desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, manufacturing activity in the West is strong. Commercial 
aircraft and heavy equipment manufacturers note especially robust 
activity. Most information about the electronics industry suggests 
that it is benefiting from a surge in orders and sales, although one 
manufacturer of electronic components notes some weakening in recent 
weeks, and at least two sizable plants are slated to close.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents indicate that overall inventory levels are either close 
to or somewhat below their desired levels. Lean inventories are 
reported for sectors that are experiencing strong demand, including 
some electronic components and exported products, as well as 
minerals, valves, and castings that are in short supply. A few 
respondents note high inventory levels, but these respondents also 
point out that some of the inventory accumulation is an attempt to 
ensure the availability of products for which demand is expected to 
be strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The drought is not expected to cause problems for most western 
farmers, since most acreage in the West is irrigated and reservoirs 
hold sufficient supplies for this summer. Cattle ranchers, however, 
have range land that is providing insufficient nourishment, and feed 
costs have escalated substantially due to the drought. As a result, 
many are selling earlier than they otherwise would, to avoid paying 
the high feed costs. In the glutted marketplace, they are getting 
lower prices, and most anticipate significantly higher prices in 
several months as the glut is worked off.
     </p>
     <p>
      The forest products industries continue to experience strong demand, 
from both overseas and domestic markets. Pulp and paper activity is 
particularly strong, and production is running at capacity. 
Nevertheless, inventories reportedly are low at both the user and 
manufacturer levels, so several firms plan to expand their 
production capacity. However, lumber production has been curtailed 
because of recent strikes at several mills.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity continue mixed in the Twelfth 
District. In the coastal states, the pace of residential building is 
healthy, particularly for single-family homes. In the Los Angeles 
and San Francisco regions, some areas with limited available space 
are seeing such frenzied home buying activity that home values have 
increased by as much as 25 percent during the past year. Activity in 
Idaho has improved modestly during the past few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, construction activity in Utah was so weak during the 
first five months of 1988 that it will take a remarkable rebound 
even to reach 1987's poor showing. Arizona is in somewhat better 
shape than Utah, but activity continues to languish there as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Salaries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents anticipate wage increases in the 4 to 5 percent 
range during the next year. Respondents are divided about evenly 
between those who expect wage and salary increases during the next 
twelve months to be unchanged from those of the past year, and those 
who anticipate some acceleration of wage hikes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of those who anticipate steady wage gains argue that increases 
will be low due to pressures for keeping costs under control, 
expectations of weakening activity (as for defense contractors), or 
a trend toward tying individual compensation more closely to 
performance. Those who anticipate higher wages cite the pressures 
for wage increases that have resulted from recent high profits (as 
in timber), general improvements in economic activity (as in Boise), 
and difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      While California is not experiencing labor shortages associated with 
immigration reform, some farmers in Idaho reportedly are paying day 
laborers substantially more than they did last year. Few respondents 
note wage increases associated with California's new $4.25 minimum 
wage, which went into effect on July 1. These increases occurred in 
such low-wage sectors as agriculture, restaurants, and hotels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most western banks and thrifts report healthy conditions, reflecting 
the healthy regional economies in which they operate. Several 
bankers note particular strength in consumer lending, while a few 
cite commercial lending as the leading sector. Bankers in Oregon, 
Washington, and California report stiff competition for quality 
mortgage applications.
