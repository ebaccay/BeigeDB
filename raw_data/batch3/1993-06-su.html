      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity was increasing at a slow to moderate pace in most 
Federal Reserve Districts in May and early June. Manufacturing was 
steady or improving in most Districts, with only scattered reports 
or upward pressure on prices in this sector. Retail sales were 
generally higher. Energy industries reported slight gains. 
Residential real estate sales and construction were on upward 
trends, mainly in the South and West (except California). There were 
also some reports or declines, albeit slight, in office vacancy 
rates in some markets. Reports on bank lending were about evenly 
divided among increases, decreases, and no change. Crop planting was 
hampered earlier by wet weather, but has been completed recently or 
is nearing completion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations generally are for continued slow growth. Manufacturers 
anticipate moderate expansion. Energy markets are forecast to 
improve slightly. Retailers expect improved sales for the balance of 
the year, and home builders anticipate a good summer. The 
agricultural outlook depends on a summer sufficiently warm to boost 
crop growth, which has been lagging due to poor weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses commented that investment and hiring were being delayed 
because or uncertainties about federal tax increases and national 
health care reform. Retailers also said that such concerns might be 
preventing a more vigorous increase in consumer spending. Possible 
changes in U.S. international trade policy were also prompting 
caution among importers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and Minneapolis 
generally reported improving business, while activity was generally 
steady in Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond. In the San 
Francisco District, manufacturing in California was reported to be 
slipping further. Sales gains were reported by makers of electrical 
and electronic equipment, building materials, transportation 
equipment, and textiles. Demand for construction equipment was good 
in Chicago and Dallas, but weakening in Atlanta. Demand for aircraft 
engines and parts was also softening.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing employment was reported up in the Minneapolis District 
but down in Boston and Philadelphia. In addition, the outlook for 
employment was negative in Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. 
Louis look for continued improvement, but are not forecasting 
significant increases in capital spending plans. In fact, Boston and 
New York reported that some manufacturers were trimming planned 
outlays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing contacts in Atlanta, Boston, Kansas City, and New York 
reported little or no upward movement in sales or input prices. 
Information from industrial firms in Chicago's region indicated that 
price pressures have moderated in recent months. Some Districts, 
however, reported that firms have been able to sustain increases in 
their prices recently. Firms in the Richmond region reported 
increases in finished goods prices. In the Cleveland and Dallas 
Districts, higher prices were noted for some industrial materials, 
including steel, several chemicals, glass, and truck parts, although 
Dallas noted that prices of some other products were declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dallas and Kansas City reported slightly higher oil-drilling 
activity, compared with the beginning of the year, and also reported 
expectations of an increase from current low levels for gas 
drilling. Minneapolis reported that coal shipments on the Great 
Lakes were off to a good start for the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the Districts filing agricultural reports indicated that 
planting had been delayed by wet weather. Where seeding had been 
done, plant growth was said to be behind the normal schedule in the 
Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. The 
outlook for grains, fruits, and vegetables now depends on whether 
the summer is sufficiently warm to boost plant growth. Soil moisture 
levels were generally termed adequate. Kansas City and St. Louis 
said the winter wheat harvest was getting under way and there were 
indications that it would be a good harvest. St. Louis said concern 
was growing that cotton crops are at risk from serious boll weevil 
infestation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock conditions were reported to be good by Kansas City, 
Minneapolis, Richmond, and San Francisco. Feedlots were at capacity, 
according to contacts in the Kansas City District, and some 
softening of fed cattle prices was expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all Districts reported increased retail sales for May and 
early June. The exceptions were Boston and New York, where retailers 
had mixed results, and California, where sales were flat. Atlanta 
and Chicago said appliances, home furnishings, and consumer durables 
were selling well. Auto sales were up year-over-year in Atlanta, 
Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis, and the San Francisco District 
outside California. Domestic car sales were up in St. Louis, but 
foreign car sales were down. Philadelphia District dealers said 
truck sales were strong, but car sales, while still showing year-
over-year gains, had eased recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers expect moderate gains for the balance of the year in 
Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis, but 
some Atlanta merchants believe the upward momentum may be waning.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist officials and contacts in the lodging and transportation 
industries reported modest year-over-year improvement in the 
Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Richmond Districts. They expect further 
gains during the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on bank lending were mixed. Overall loan volumes were 
increasing at slow to moderate rates in St. Louis, Dallas, 
Cleveland. Kansas City, and some parts of the San Francisco 
District. Loan volumes were described as flat by bankers in the New 
York and Philadelphia Districts and down in California and Richmond. 
Cleveland and Kansas City reported recent gains in commercial and 
industrial loans. Atlanta said business loans were flat, while 
Richmond and St. Louis reported declines. Consumer borrowing was up 
in Atlanta, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis. 
Residential mortgage refinancing was generally said to be waning, 
except in Cleveland, where it was rebounding. Atlanta, Richmond, and 
St. Louis indicated that purchase mortgage activity was up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales and construction of single-family homes were reported to be on 
an upswing in southern and western parts of the nation, except for 
California. Kansas City and St. Louis noted that improvements in 
housing activity in some areas were still delayed by wet weather. 
Nonresidential real estate activity was mixed, although Minneapolis 
and parts of the San Francisco District outside of California have 
experienced some improvements. In addition, slight improvements in 
office vacancy rates were noted in Boston, Minneapolis, New York, 
and Richmond.
