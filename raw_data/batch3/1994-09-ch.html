      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic activity advanced at a modest pace in 
recent months, as capacity constraints in manufacturing joined 
slower retail sales growth and housing activity to restrain the pace 
of expansion. Survey data and reports from large retailers were 
mixed, with little evidence of a change in trend following the 
slower growth witnessed during the second quarter. Manufacturing 
activity generally remained vigorous, except where hampered by 
production difficulties. Labor markets continued to strengthen; 
worker shortages grew increasingly frequent, and temporary help 
companies reported rising wages and higher recruitment costs. Prices 
of industrial commodities and building materials continued to trend 
upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District retailers suggest that sales continued to grow 
at a slow pace in July and August. A regular survey of retailers in 
Illinois and Indiana showed continued modest year-over-year sales 
gains during May and June, on the heels of stronger increases during 
the first quarter. In July, this survey showed a somewhat more 
clear-cut loss of momentum, particularly in the hardware and 
homebuilding category. A survey of sales paid by check also showed 
modestly slower growth in the Midwest during July. However, a 
significant majority of small retailers surveyed in Michigan 
anticipated sales gains over the next few months (after adjusting 
for normal seasonal trends), with expectations running well ahead of 
assessments of current sales activity. This survey also showed a 
greater majority anticipated near-term inventory expansion than 
those reporting that stocks rose over the past month. One large 
discount retailer noted that sales in its District stores continued 
to grow at a modest pace during recent months. A large apparel 
retailer reported a positive consumer response to new apparel styles 
in the early stages of the fall season, which was believed to be a 
good sign for sales over the next few months. Automakers indicated 
that limited supplies accounted for much of the recent slowdown in 
light vehicle sales. One of the largest auto dealers in the District 
reported that sales and buyer traffic have flattened out at mediocre 
levels, after weakening during the second quarter. Limited supplies 
have constrained new vehicle sales, and used cars have accounted for 
an increased share of the overall sales mix. This contact stated 
that weaker demand has also dampened new car sales since March, 
however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District industrial output generally remained vigorous, although 
production difficulties and capacity constraints have hampered 
growth in a number of industries. A composite index of the 
production components of purchasing managers' surveys around the 
District has been in a modest downtrend since April, but remains at 
a level consistent with relatively strong gains in output. An 
industry trade association reported that appliance shipments ran at 
a record level for the month of July, although the report implied a 
small decline in shipments of core products from June to July on a 
seasonally adjusted basis. Net orders for heavy-duty trucks declined 
slightly from June to July, and remained at very high levels. 
Current build plans suggest heavy-duty truck output will flatten out 
during the balance of 1994, with one industry analyst noting that 
the industry is "at capacity, with supplier limitations basically 
setting the limits." A number of manufacturers of heavy equipment 
and building materials announced new capacity expansion projects. 
One of these firms continued to forecast stronger sales growth than 
anticipated in early 1994, and expected interest rate increases thus 
far in 1994 to have little impact on demand over the balance of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing sales and residential construction activity remained at 
relatively high levels, but growth has clearly slowed from the 
strong pace set last year. New and existing single-family home sales 
have been trending downward in the Midwest during 1994, and a number 
of bankers noted that mortgage loan applications for home purchases 
have weakened during the year. Likewise, homebuilders have been 
reporting significant declines (from high levels) in prospective 
buyer traffic. One of the largest realtors in the District reported 
that sales were trending lower during the second quarter, but held 
up relatively well in July. This contact stated that sales force 
optimism has been tempered in recent months, but remains positive.
Construction contract awards showed weakening year-over-year 
comparisons in the District during the second quarter, both in 
residential and nonresidential building. Building remained active, 
however, and a study by a local development firm showed continued 
high rates of absorption of industrial space in the Chicago area. 
Gypsum wallboard shipments ran at a slightly slower pace than 
anticipated in June and July, according to one large manufacturer, 
with stronger nonresidential building activity bolstering overall 
demand in the face of slower growth in residential construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys and reports from staffing services firms indicated further 
strengthening in District labor markets, with reports of worker 
shortages growing somewhat more frequent. A quarterly survey 
indicated that employer hiring plans held at high levels during the 
third quarter. Nationally, this survey showed that durable goods 
manufacturers planned some of their strongest hiring in the past 16 
years, and hiring plans among Midwestern durable goods manufacturers 
remained significantly above their national counterparts. The 
employment component of purchasing managers' surveys around the 
District generally continued to rise during recent months, with a 
small but growing number of respondents commenting about a short 
supply of skilled labor. The employment component of the Chicago 
survey has recently been hovering near its highest levels in the 
last 16 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Staffing services firms reported further strengthening in demand for 
temporary and permanent employees, with a continuing trend towards 
conversion of temporary employees to permanent status. August is a 
normally a busy month in the temporary help industry, and it was 
especially busy this year. These companies generally expect their 
business to continue to strengthen over the balance of 1994 on a 
seasonally adjusted basis. Most of these firms reported that the 
supply of better-qualified labor has grown increasingly scarce, and 
wages offered temporary workers are rising. One firm has noted 
higher wages offered in its competitors' help-wanted advertising. A 
number of staffing firms reported higher recruiting costs (as did a 
large distribution services company). Some temporary help firms 
noted that increased competition has restricted (but not eliminated) 
the ability to pass on higher wages in the prices charged to their 
client companies. Wages paid in permanent positions at their client 
companies do not yet seem to be under the same upward pressure for a 
similar temporary position, according to one temporary help firm, 
but "we think we see it before they do." Two firms separately 
reported that the wages paid to their temporary employees have 
increased roughly 5 to 10 percent, on average, during 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A bumper fall harvest still appears to be in store for much of the 
District. Crop condition ratings edged lower in recent weeks, 
however, as cool temperatures and dry conditions over portions of 
the District slowed the final stages of crop development. Along with 
reports of problems with the wheat harvest in several foreign 
countries, these conditions have halted--at least temporarily--the 
recent sharp decline in crop prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers surveys and trade information generally pointed 
to continuing price increases for industrial commodities and 
building materials. The price component of the Chicago purchasing 
managers survey climbed especially sharply during August. Scrap 
steel prices hinted and rose anew in the Chicago area in recent 
months, after dropping off significantly in March and April, and an 
industry analyst expects further gains in the latter half of the 
year. Gypsum wallboard prices rose in August, the second such wave 
of moderate increases this year, and there was little sign of any 
weakening in orders following the latest increases. Corrugated paper 
prices have fallen somewhat in recent weeks, after substantial 
increases during 1993 and early 1994. Retailers continued to 
emphasize that competitive pressures significantly constrain their 
own price increases, however, and a recent survey showed a 
substantially higher share of retailers expecting increased 
promotional activity than rising prices.
