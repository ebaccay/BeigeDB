      Beige Book Report: San Francisco

      <strong>
       June 20, 1990
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the West continues at a healthy level. Western 
business leaders continue to anticipate relatively slow growth 
during the next twelve months, although they are slightly more 
optimistic than they were six weeks ago. Overall wage and price 
trends have changed little during recent weeks, with increases 
averaging around 4 or 5 percent. Conditions in the trade and service 
sectors continue healthy with little change reported. The pace of 
manufacturing activity varies widely within the District, with 
strength in aluminum, food products and commercial aircraft offset 
by weakness in defense industries and in some technology firms. 
Agricultural conditions in the West are satisfactory overall. The 
forest products industries face thinner margins. Most western real 
estate markets continue healthy. Recent reports confirm that lending 
standards have become more stringent in recent months, although the 
effect on creditworthy borrowers is not clear.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Western business leaders continue to anticipate relatively slow 
growth during the next twelve months, although they have become 
slightly more optimistic during the last six weeks. Three-quarters 
of respondents continue to expect that GNP growth will be positive 
but slower than 2 1/2 percent, while the proportion anticipating 
growth in excess of 3 percent rose from zero to four percent. 
Expectations regarding business investment, consumer spending, and 
the trade balance improved somewhat, while deterioration was noted 
in expectations regarding housing starts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall wage and price trends have changed little during recent 
weeks, with increases in the 4 to 5 percent range remaining the 
"central tendency." Health care costs continue to rise at double-
digit rates. One respondent who runs a machinery repair shop reports 
that, although his wage rates have not changed, he recently raised 
his shop rates by more than 5 percent to cover increased medical 
costs. Substantial upward price pressure also is reported for some 
drought-affected agricultural products, including alfalfa and 
cattle. A recent labor settlement in Hawaii calls for wage hikes 
averaging 7 percent per year for the next 5 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, some other products are seeing flat or lower prices. 
Prices for lumber and wood chips have fallen sharply in recent 
months, squeezing profits as log prices remain high. A car dealer 
reports that there is downward pressure on the prices of new cars. 
Many clothing retailers reportedly believe that the recent CPI 
increase in women's apparel prices is spurious, since competition in 
the industry makes it unlikely that higher prices can be maintained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the trade and service sectors are generally unchanged. 
Retail sales continue healthy overall. Department stores, as well as 
food and drug retailers, report good conditions. The number of 
visitors to Hawaii has recovered following a hotel strike earlier in 
the spring. However, District auto sales continue weak, with no sign 
yet of the usual spring sales pickup.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of manufacturing activity varies widely within the 
District. Aluminum smelters are operating at capacity, while 
production of food products and plastics is reported to be strong in 
the Northwest. Commercial aircraft production is limited by capacity 
constraints, although production and delivery rates continue to rise 
as labor productivity improves further. Reports from the Northwest 
indicate that products associated with high-end construction such as 
wood-frame windows and specialty finishes are in strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of flattening or declining activity continue to he 
concentrated in the defense and technology sectors. Several defense 
firms in the West have announced layoffs in recent weeks, and one 
large firm also has announced plans to move some of its operations 
from southern California to Georgia. The strength of commercial 
aviation, as well as possible increases in NASA funding, are the 
main bright spots for these firms. Overall conditions in technology-
related sectors are relatively flat at present, but with wide 
variations by company and product line. One company supplying the 
computer industry reports very slow sales, but some firms in various 
segments of the electronics, computer, and software industries are 
doing very well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions in the West are satisfactory overall. Most 
farmers and ranchers have generated healthy profits in recent years, 
so their financial positions are relatively strong. Oregon 
vegetables are in strong demand by food processors, so plantings are 
up this year. Recent unseasonal rain storms in California provided 
enough water to increase allotments from their low drought levels. 
However, the storms also caused significant damage to some farmers' 
tree fruit crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the forest products industries continue to 
deteriorate. More stringent restrictions on logging federal land 
have reduced the supply of logs and increased their price. At the 
same time, reduced home-building activity nationwide has weakened 
the price for finished lumber. The resulting profit squeeze has led 
several mills to lay off workers or close down entirely.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions remain healthy in most western real estate markets. In 
California, the pace of home sales and the average amount of time on 
the market have returned to more "normal" levels. Average time on 
the market has risen in recent weeks in Washington. In both 
California and Washington. sales activity is stronger in the lower 
price ranges. Construction activity and the number of homes sold 
have risen by double-digit rates in Oregon, Idaho, and Utah. The 
average amount of time on the market has fallen significantly in 
these three states. Despite the widely publicized problems in 
Arizona's real estate markets, home prices have remained relatively 
stable, with small declines in some categories offset by small 
increases in others.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from inside and outside the financial industries confirm 
that lending standards have become more stringent in recent months. 
However, the effect on credit-worthy borrowers is not clear. Some 
lenders report that they are no longer financing "marginal" deals, 
suggesting that credit-worthy borrowers are still able to obtain 
funds. In Arizona, however, it is reported that only builders with 
excellent records and significant equity can borrow. Car dealers 
express growing concern about tightened lending criteria and 
withdrawals by some lenders from the "dealer indirect" business. A 
developer notes that the impact of more stringent lending criteria 
will likely be seen in a year or two, when less new space comes on 
the market.
