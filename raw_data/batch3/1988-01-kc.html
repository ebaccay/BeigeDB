      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little improvement is apparent in the Tenth District economy in 
spite of relatively high farm income in 1987. Christmas retail sales 
were generally higher than a year earlier but lower than expected, 
and new car sales are slow. Manufacturers' input prices continue to 
rise moderately. If recent world oil market conditions continue, 
some of the 1987 improvement in the district energy industry may be 
eroded. Home mortgage demand and residential construction activity 
both remain weak. Loan demand and deposits at commercial banks are 
both up slightly. Agricultural banks report an improvement in 
yearend loan repayment rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District retailers report sales equal to or above, year-ago 
levels, and unchanged or slightly improved over the past three 
months. Christmas sales were generally higher than a year ago but 
lower than expected. Sales of apparel, cosmetics, and other soft 
goods are strong while durable sales are weak. Nearly all 
respondents plan to trim inventories or hold them at present levels. 
Expectations for future sales are cautiously optimistic and only 
small price increases are anticipated in the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers generally report that sales were slow in 
December. Although dealers desire leaner inventories, slow sales are 
keeping inventories steady. Adequate financing is available for both 
dealer inventories and customer purchases. Overall, dealers are 
hopeful that 1988 sales will be near 1987 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report that their input prices are moderately 
higher than a year ago. The steepest price increases in the last 
several months have been for steel-related inputs and further 
increases are expected for these inputs in the near term. Most 
materials are readily available, although quality steel materials 
are reported to be in short supply. Respondents are generally 
satisfied with current inventory levels and most report no unusual 
bottlenecks in labor or plant capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The inability of OPEC to agree on production quotas in December 1987 
has caused world oil prices to weaken and become more volatile. If 
these market conditions continue, some of the stability established 
in the district's energy industry during 1987 could begin to erode. 
The average weekly number of operating drilling rigs in the Tenth 
District increased only slightly from 360 in November to 363 in 
December, about 23 percent above the average weekly level a year 
earlier but less than one-fourth its 1982 peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area homebuilders report that housing starts are below both last 
year's and last month's levels. Multi-family construction is 
expected to weaken further but single-family construction is 
expected to stabilize. Most homebuilders report steady sales of new 
homes. Respondents express no immediate or future problems regarding 
materials prices, availability, or delivery times.
     </p>
     <p>
      District savings institutions generally report that savings deposit 
inflows are somewhat above year-ago levels. Deposit inflows have 
changed little since November and are expected to improve slightly 
during the first quarter. Mortgage demand remains weak, although 
some respondents foresee a pickup in activity in the spring. 
Mortgage rates have been stable, with little change expected in the 
near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents at district banks report slightly higher total loan 
demand for the month. Demand for commercial and industrial loans and 
consumer loans is up slightly, while demand for residential and 
commercial real estate loans and agricultural loans is unchanged on 
average. The prime rate remains unchanged among all respondents, 
with only one respondent expecting a slight decline in the future. 
Consumer loan rates are unchanged and expected to remain at current 
levels. Total deposits rose slightly because of small increases in 
the demand for conventional and super NOW accounts, demand deposits, 
MMDAs, and small time deposits. Large CDs were down slightly, while 
IRAs and passbook savings accounts were about unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Strong livestock prices, a good fall harvest and substantial 
government payments produced relatively high farm incomes for 1987. 
As a result, 1987 year-end loan repayment rates at agricultural 
banks were generally high, showing some improvement over a year ago. 
Some bankers also report that they expect borrowings for 1988 to be 
down, as cautious farm borrowers are putting more cash earnings into 
operations. Most agricultural lenders continue to look for sound 
borrowers as loanable funds remain readily available and demand for 
loans weakens.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm machinery sales are also beginning to reflect an improved farm 
income situation in the district. After two relatively stable years 
for farm incomes, some operators are now upgrading worn equipment. 
The used machinery market has shown more activity, but high prices 
and a cautious outlook are still keeping many farmers out of the new 
equipment market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although livestock prices have contributed significantly to the 
strength in farm income, there has not been much expansion in 
district livestock operations. Feedlots in the region remain full, 
but cow/calf operators are reluctant to hold back high priced 
heifers to increase breeding herds. High cattle prices have also 
forced the price of replacement animals up, causing some stocker 
cattle operations to actually reduce herds. Most district hog 
growers have been running at capacity, but there has been little 
facilities expansion. The recent downturn in hog prices has not yet 
had a visible effect on district hog operations.
