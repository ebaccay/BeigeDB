      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District has continued mixed. Retail 
sales were relatively strong in January, but a decided slowing 
occurred during February. While overall business conditions were 
generally satisfactory, demand for new homes and office space varied 
among areas. Business borrowing at small and medium-sized banks was 
somewhat spotty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of retail sales in the District has been mixed since the 
last report. Respondents stated that consumer spending was 
relatively strong in January, due in part to continued heavy 
promotionals. During the first half of February, however, sales 
activity showed a decided slowing, which they viewed with some 
concern. Nonetheless, District retailers were hopeful that, given 
the early occurrence of Easter this year, activity would soon 
improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year gains during January ranged from 9 percent to 15 
percent and were reported to be on or above plan. Demand was strong 
for a number of categories including adult and children's apparel, 
accessories and home furnishings. Buying by foreign consumers 
continued somewhat heavier than usual according to New York City 
retailers. As a result of the strong sales activity, inventories 
were generally pared in January. Respondents described their 
inventory situation as ranging from on plan to 3 percent above. Some 
unwanted accumulation occurred over the first half of February, 
however, when consumer demand weakened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's market for new homes are varied. In 
some areas of speculative building and high prices, developers are 
offering a variety of  incentives in order to try to sell new houses 
and condominiums. In many other areas, however, overall demand 
remains strong, and the need for affordable housing in unabated. 
Several large-scale residential projects have recently begun or will 
soon be undertaken. In downtown White Plains the foundation was 
poured for a 316-unit apartment building—the largest in Westchester 
County—which will provide medium-priced housing for some of the 
workers in the many new office buildings there. Elsewhere, a 
residential community is developing in what has been an industrial 
area of Queens, a desirable site located on the water and facing the 
Manhattan skyline. One apartment building has already been 
constructed, another is underway, and a third will probably be 
started there this spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of commercial leasing activity has also varied during 
recent weeks. Demand for office space is strong on much of Long 
Island, due in part to last year's moratoriums on construction in 
some areas. Moreover, despite the fact that their vacancy rates 
remain well above 20 percent, Fairfield County and northern New 
Jersey have seen some improvement in leasing activity. In 
Westchester County, however, net absorption of office space has been 
minimal due to lackluster demand and corporate relocations and 
downsizing. Leasing has also slowed in New York City where a 
substantial amount of office space was recently added as the result 
of a merger of two financial services firms. Midtown and downtown 
Manhattan vacancy rates have risen and are expected to move higher 
in the months ahead. Six years ago the City offered zoning 
incentives to stimulate the commercial development of Midtown west. 
Since developers wanted to meet the May 1988 deadline for laying 
foundations, an additional 12 million square feet of office space is 
now under construction in midtown.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Second District have generally been 
satisfactory with the major exception being the widespread layoffs 
which are taking place in the financial services sector. Despite 
these layoffs however, February unemployment rates in New York and 
New Jersey fell further to 3.9 percent and 3.4 percent, 
respectively—the lowest in 18 years. The New York City rate also 
remains some two and a half percentage points below its year-earlier 
level. While further cutbacks by the City's financial services firms 
are in the offing, several other areas report that their economy 
continues to expand. In Rochester, for example, where 84 percent of 
surveyed purchasing managers found current business conditions to be 
the same or improved in January, 60 percent anticipated further 
gains over the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for commercial loans in the Second District has been somewhat 
spotty in recent months based on a survey of senior officers of 
small and medium-sized banks. Though most stated that the level of 
borrowing activity was about average, some reported strong demand 
while others noted sluggishness. Reductions in lending rates at 
these banks during early February have not triggered a significant 
increase in loan applications. Several bankers commented that 
businesses tend to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than 
individuals. Among the different sectors, demand for commercial 
mortgages for office construction is particularly weak. Some of the 
bankers believe that suburban office space surrounding New York City 
is overbuilt, a troublesome situation given the weakness of the 
securities industry. One bank reported a dramatic drop in demand for 
import loans, particularly those for Taiwanese products. Most 
respondents anticipate that 1988 will eventually prove to be a year 
of healthy growth for their banks. Though they were generally less 
optimistic about the U.S. economy at large, most were confident that 
a recession would be avoided and the second half of 1988 would show 
stronger growth.
