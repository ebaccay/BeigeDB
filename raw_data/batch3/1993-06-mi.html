      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of the Ninth District economy appears to have picked up 
somewhat from the moderate growth reported in mid-April. 
Construction and real estate continue to improve and lead the 
economy. New automobile sales remain good, while consumer outlays on 
general merchandise may be rebounding after sagging this spring. 
Moreover, tourism officials are optimistic about the summer season. 
Developments in manufacturing and mining signal improvement, while 
labor markets are strengthening. Meanwhile, livestock prices are 
strong and production is above year-earlier levels. While cold, wet 
weather has severely delayed grain planting, it has helped ensure 
that soil moisture levels are adequate across virtually all of the 
Ninth District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate lead in adding strength to the economy. 
Minneapolis-St. Paul real estate brokers had their busiest May in 
recent history as the area's single-family home sales leaped 34.4 
percent to 4,224, compared with the same month last year. Brisk 
sales are boosting prices as the median sales price rose to $96,600 
in May, a 5.5 percent increase from a year earlier. Minneapolis/St. 
Paul home builders are responding, and in April 1,631 new-home 
building permits were issued, the highest month in at least a 
decade. Sioux Falls and Rapid City, S.D., Helena, Mont., and Eau 
Claire, Wis., also report strong home sales and construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Non-residential building is also strengthening. In April, publicly 
awarded construction contracts in Minnesota and the Dakotas were 18 
percent above April 1992. Year-to-date figures were 25 percent 
higher. Moreover, recently released figures indicate the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul office vacancy rates fell to 16.4 percent by 
the end of 1992 from a high of 20.2 percent in 1991, leading 
analysts to speculate that the commercial real estate glut has 
bottomed out. A report from Billings, Mont., described its 
commercial real estate market as the best since 1978.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise sales may be reviving. "In June, sales are 
springing back," says a spokesperson for a regional retailer with 
stores across the Upper Midwest. Its May sales were "soft" with 
same-store sales 2.5 percent above a year earlier. A Minneapolis-
based national retailer reports that its comparable-store sales were 
up 1.1 percent in May after declining 2.1 percent in April.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moreover, prospects are bright for summer tourism. A tourism 
official in South Dakota reports inquiries are running about 10 
percent above last year, and states, "We're anticipating a strong 
year this year." In a north central Wisconsin community tourist 
inquiries are up 70 percent from a year ago in response to its 
advertising initiatives.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales continue to outpace general merchandise sales. An 
industry spokesperson in Minnesota says, "Sales are increasing and 
we anticipate a good year." A counterpart in South Dakota reports 
that "sales are good to very good." A North Dakota dealers' 
representative recounts "sales continue to be good."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing shows signs of growth. Year-to-date weather-adjusted 
industrial use of electricity is about 4 percent above a year ago, 
double its five-year average growth, reports an electrical utility 
serving most of the Ninth District manufacturing in Minnesota, South 
Dakota and Wisconsin. Moreover, in all district states manufacturing 
employment this spring is up from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mining also shows some signs of growth. After posting eight quarters 
of losses, a large South Dakota gold mine was "back in the black" in 
the first quarter, due to vigorous cost reduction efforts. Duluth 
port officials report that the Great Lakes shipping season is off to 
a good start for iron ore, coal and grain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      These signs of strength in the district's non-farm economy are 
manifesting themselves in improving labor markets. In May, Minnesota 
initial claims for unemployment compensation were down 21 percent 
from a year ago. Moreover, 51 percent of district business leaders 
responding to a May survey said employment in their communities 
would be up from a year ago during the next six months. Only 9 
percent were looking for employment to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy, however, was not immune to layoffs. The recently 
announced closing of a Sioux Falls credit card center will cost 181 
South Dakota residents their jobs. Because of state budget problems, 
62 North Dakota residents recently lost their jobs at the State 
Developmental Center in Grafton.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Livestock continues to be the brightest component in the agriculture 
sector, according to comments received in a quarterly survey of 
agricultural credit conditions. Although cattle and hog prices have 
dropped slightly from April peaks, they are still substantially 
above year-ago levels and are very favorable in relation to feed 
costs. Slaughter levels are largely unchanged from 1992, but the 
numbers of cattle and hogs on farms are up 3 to 9 percent. One 
negative note in the meat animal sector is that the spring calf and 
lamb crop is at best average because of high mortality resulting 
from prolonged cold, wet weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prospects for the 1993 crop are shadowed by weather-induced delays 
in planting virtually all spring-seeded crops. The Agricultural 
Statistics Service reports that crop progress as well as planting is 
behind normal for all crops, though delays are less severe for small 
grains such as oats, wheat and barley than for row crops such as 
corn and soybeans. Delays thus far have not irrevocably damaged 
expected yields but have used up most of the season's margin for 
error. The weather throughout the rest of the growing season must be 
very favorable to allow crops to make up for lost time and achieve 
potential yields. Since soil moisture levels are adequate to 
surplus, concern now centers on receiving sufficient warmth and 
sunlight for optimal corn and soybean production.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of 212 agricultural banks showed that interest rates 
continue to drop, down 25 to 50 basis points from the end of 1992 
for all classes and terms of loans and more than one percentage 
point from the previous year. Bankers also report increased spending 
on new machinery or facilities in wheat growing areas with favorable 
1992 yields and prices, but little change in capital spending in 
corn-soybean regions, which had a less favorable 1992 outcome.
