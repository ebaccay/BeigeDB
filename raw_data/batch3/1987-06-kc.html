      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little change is apparent in overall Tenth District economic 
activity. Retail sales generally are increasing slightly, but auto 
sales are sluggish. Retailers report little change in prices while 
manufacturers' purchasing agents report stable to moderately higher 
input prices. Inventory levels are satisfactory. Housing starts 
remain near last year's levels, and mortgage loan demand at savings 
institutions has declined. The district's energy industry remains 
generally depressed. Loan demand and deposits at district banks are 
essentially unchanged. Winter wheat harvest is under way and yields 
are expected to be about average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District retailers generally report that sales are about the 
same as or above year-ago levels and have been improving during the 
last three months. Most retailers report little change in prices 
during the past three months, although one retailer reports dramatic 
increases in the prices of imported goods. Inventory levels are 
satisfactory. Retailers are generally optimistic that sales will be 
solid during the rest of 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers report that sales in May were below a year 
earlier and a month earlier. Because of sluggish sales, inventories 
are larger than desired. Financing is generally available for both 
dealer inventories and consumer purchases. Dealers hope that sales 
have bottomed out, and most are cautiously optimistic in their 
outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report that major input prices are stable to 
moderately higher relative to a year earlier and that they expect 
input prices to increase only moderately during the remainder of 
1987. Some problems with materials availability were reported. The 
Canadian lumber strike was blamed for a shortage of lumber, for 
example. Few problems with material availability are expected for 
the remainder of the year, however. Inventory levels are viewed as 
generally satisfactory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders report that housing starts remain at or slightly below 
last year's levels. Single-family home construction remains stronger 
than multifamily construction. Builders expect overall 1987 housing 
starts to be near 1986 levels. Sales of new homes are up slightly, 
with prices moderately higher than a year ago. New homes inventories 
are not causing undue concern, No problems are reported with either 
the availability or delivery of housing materials. Materials prices 
are relatively stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many savings institutions in the Tenth District have experienced 
weak deposit growth during the last year. Negative publicity about 
the FSLIC has dampened deposit inflows. Loan demand has fallen off 
since the April run-up in mortgage rates. Mortgage rates leveled off 
after their April increase, and most respondents believe that rates 
will remain near current levels in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's energy industry remains generally depressed despite 
the fact that prices of domestic crude oil have remained near $20 
for several weeks. Although OPEC is committed to keeping prices 
stable, recent events in the Persian Gulf have made the outlook for 
oil prices more uncertain. Exploration and development activity in 
the district remains flat. The average weekly number of operating 
drilling rigs in the Tenth District fell from 248 in April to 238 in 
May, still about two-thirds of the number recorded a year earlier 
and on]y 16 percent of the peak number reached in 1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wheat harvest in the Tenth District is under way in Oklahoma and 
parts of southern Missouri and Kansas. Although wheat acreage is 
down in areas where a wet fall prevented some winter wheat planting, 
yields across most of the district have not been adversely affected 
by the weather. Wheat yields appear average in most parts of the 
district. Grain storage capacity in the district should be adequate 
for this year's wheat crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spring crop planting was generally finished ahead of schedule due to 
favorable weather across most of the district. Most areas report 
that 80 to 100 percent of the corn, milo and soybean crops are 
planted, and many fields are showing good early growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Feedlots in the Tenth District are generally full, reflecting strong 
returns to cattle production over the last year and the renewed rise 
in beef prices since the first of the year. Few feeders are 
expanding their feeding capacity, however, and cow-calf and stocker-
cattle operations do not appear to be adding to their herds. Growers 
appear reluctant to expand herds at the current high cattle prices 
and some bankers, fearing a drop in the market, are loaning less on 
the collateral value of the cattle purchased. District hog producers 
have reacted to strong market conditions much the same as cattle 
producers. Hog prices have been favorable over the past year and 
particularly strong in 1987, but there is little evidence of 
expansion in hog operations. Though some bankers report a moderate 
increase in hog inventories in their areas, there has been no sign 
of investment in new facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand and total deposits at Tenth District banks were 
essentially unchanged during the past month. Demand weakened 
slightly for consumer loans, but was constant for other types of 
loans. About two-thirds of the respondents reported raising their 
prime rates slightly while the rest expect their prime rates to 
increase slightly in the near term. Half the respondents report 
raising consumer loan rates slightly, and about a third expect their 
consumer rates to rise slightly in the near term. Half the 
respondents report no change in large CDs, while the other half 
report an increase. Balances in other accounts remained constant.
