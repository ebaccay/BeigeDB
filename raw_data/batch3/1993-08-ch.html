      Beige Book Report: Chicago

      </strong>

       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expansion generally continued in the District in June and 
early July, although flooding significantly disrupted activity in 
affected areas. Reports from retailers suggest that sales growth in 
the District picked up further upward momentum in June and early 
July. Housing industry contacts indicated that sales of new and 
existing homes continued to increase, although residential 
construction growth may have slowed somewhat. Purchasing managers' 
surveys and reports from individual firms depicted a modest slowdown 
in the rate of expansion in overall industrial output, while the 
pace of the recovery in motor vehicle production was little changed. 
Flooding has inflicted considerable damage and hardship, but it is 
not expected to threaten expansion in the overall District economy. 
Agriculture has been the sector hardest hit by the flooding, and 
crop prospects are under considerable uncertainty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers were generally encouraged about sales activity in 
June and July. A major chain reported solid growth in same-store 
sales, led by continuing strength in appliances and improvement in 
apparel. Sales gains in this company's stores in the Midwest 
generally continued to outpace the national average, with little 
impact from recent flooding evident in the company's regional sales 
aggregations. Another large mailer reported that sales in recent 
weeks have been "quite good," primarily due to the arrival of hot 
summer weather. This arrival was tardy, however, and while apparel 
sales strengthened, they did so at lower clearance-type margins, at 
a time when margins have been under pressure more generally. This 
firm characterized same-store sales gains in recent months as "kind 
of soft", and revised its forecast for sales in 1993 downward 
slightly. Another large chain reported increased sales gains during 
late June and into July, with results in the Midwest outpacing the 
national average (particularly in Michigan). This firm noted that 
sales strengthening was evident in household products as well as 
apparel. Several retailers reported improvement in sales in the 
Detroit area, where new store opening programs have been announced 
by a number of retail chains. A chain of warehouse stores stated 
that demand from wholesale cash-and-carry customers (primarily small 
businesses) is "a lot more robust now than it was two months ago."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of new and existing homes held up well or continued to 
increase in recent months, according to contact reports, but a 
modest slowing in new home construction was also noted. One of the 
largest realtors in the District reported a record month for unit 
sales volume in June, and stated that appraisals of market 
conditions among the firm's salespeople continue to improve during 
the month of July. This contact noted that the prospect of higher 
personal income tax rates was one potential factor promoting sales, 
due to the increased value of the tax benefits of home ownership. An 
association of home builders in the District characterized recent 
trends as "good;" the quality and interest of buyer traffic has 
remained relatively strong and sales have strengthened somewhat 
further, particularly in the lower end of the market. At the same 
time, however starts have slowed modestly, and this contact stated 
that builders' comfort level with the overall economy may have 
fallen off from earlier in the year. However, a major producer of 
window and door hardware stated that its own production has been 
"going bananas" in the last three months, following an increase in 
orders that was largely unanticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers' surveys and reports from individual firms were 
consistent with slowing but continued growth in District production 
in recent months. Patterns in the production component of purchasing 
managers' surveys in Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee and Western 
Michigan generally suggested a modest slowing in growth from earlier 
in the year, but continued expansion was indicated for a majority of 
respondents in each of these surveys through the month of June. A 
July survey of metalworking firms indicated renewed strengthening in 
momentum, following a slowdown in growth earlier in the year. The 
association conducting this survey reported that member firms have 
stepped up their apprenticeship training, after this activity "had 
remained dormant for some time."
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing contacts generally reported little change or moderate 
improvement in their own sales growth, but political and economic 
uncertainties were often identified as a weight on business activity 
more generally. An automaker confirmed its announced production 
schedules for the third quarter, which call for a significant 
increase over the same period last year. Another automaker 
anticipated a brisk increase in domestic sales in the 1994 model 
year. A large producer of auto pins reported increased aftermarket 
sales, with higher unit volume as well as modestly higher prices. 
Two electric utilities in Michigan reported further strengthening in 
industrial sales. A manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks reported a 
substantial increase in sales growth in June, and noted that 
industry sales reached their highest level for June since 1979. 
However, one heavy-duty truck producer expected industry output to 
flatten out (at relatively high levels) over the remainder of the 
year. An industry survey indicated that heavy-duty truck order 
backlogs remain firm, with buyers still requesting deliveries on 
time or ahead of schedule. A large manufacturer of business 
furniture systems expected a modest real gain in industry sales in 
1993, but not so strong an increase as the recovery during 1992. 
This firm stated that the potential for sales to the financial 
services industry is relatively strong, following the improvement in 
profitability in the industry in recent years. A large chemical 
producer gave a mixed assessment of the prospects for earnings gains 
in the latter half of 1993, partly due to continued pricing 
weakness. Several firms noted significant. continuing weakness in 
European markets, with one stating that this weakness was leading it 
to hold domestic capital spending "a little closer to the vest."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Effects of Flooding
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Flooding has inflicted considerable hardship, damage and disruption 
to the affected areas of the District, particularly Iowa and 
portions of Illinois along the Mississippi. Insurance, disaster 
relief, voluntary assistance and other offsetting effects are 
anticipated to soften some of the losses. However, the full impact 
on the overall District economy will not be known for several 
months. Much retail activity has been shut down in flooded areas, 
but stores also reported a run-up in sales in anticipation of the 
floods, and retailers in neighboring areas have seen a pickup in 
recent weeks. One major discount retailer revised its estimate of 
sales in the region for 1993 substantially upward, because of the 
sales expected to be generated in response to the flood damage. Most 
manufacturers continue to operate outside of the flooded areas, 
although some plants in Des Moines closed with resulting layoffs due 
to power or water shortages after flooding of the Des Moines and 
Raccoon rivers. Automakers reported some delays in shipments for 
plants near the affected areas, but there were no significant 
production disruptions. Distribution in the area has shifted to more 
costly alternative routes where they are available. Hundreds of 
small businesses were flooded out, although many flooded warehouses 
were cleared before the water arrived. Agriculture has been the 
hardest hit sector, with water damage not restricted to areas close 
to the flooded rivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Extensive flooding and slow-to-develop crops add to the 
uncertainties regarding this year's harvest prospects. Across the 
District, crop conditions as of July 25th ranged from mostly "good" 
in Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan to mostly fair-to-poor in Iowa 
and Wisconsin. Assessments of the crop acreage covered by flooding 
continue to be adjusted as repeated heavy rainfalls through last 
weekend added to the expected river cresting levels and triggered 
still more levee failures. Aside from extensive crop losses on the 
flooded acreage, yields elsewhere in the water-logged areas remain 
vulnerable to ponding, inadequate fertilization and weed control, 
and the possibility of being hit by frost before reaching maturity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Flooding continues to cause bottlenecks in the transportation 
network. Fortunately, water levels on the upper Mississippi have 
recently retreated, even falling below flood stage for most areas 
north of Davenport, Iowa. Several locks on this portion of the River 
have reopened, permitting local barge movements of grain, coal, and 
fertilizer. However, the long-haul barge shipments needed to help 
replenish grain stocks at the critical Gulf Port terminals still 
await the reopening of locks around the St. Louis area. Some 
observers believe it will take 10 days of no rain before commercial 
barge traffic in that area can resume.
