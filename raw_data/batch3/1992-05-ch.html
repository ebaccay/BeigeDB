      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand in 
recent weeks, with some sectors appearing to gain momentum. Retail 
sales moved higher, and several industry contacts offered more 
optimistic interpretations of sales trends than they did earlier in 
the year. The recent flood in downtown Chicago resulted in lost 
sales and substantial property damage for area businesses. Reports 
from auto dealers were mixed but generally positive, and auto 
suppliers expect little revision in auto production schedules for 
the second quarter. Purchasing managers' surveys and reports from 
manufacturers indicated a continued upward trend in industrial 
activity. Commercial lending activity in the District was mixed; 
previous reports had been more uniformly indicative of sluggish 
credit markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales activity in the District continued to improve in recent 
weeks, with several retailers indicating that sales in the Midwest 
outperformed the national average. A large national retailer 
reported a year-over-year sales gain in March despite the lack of 
the Easter holiday in this year's results, and noted that sales of 
durable goods (which are less sensitive to Easter spending patterns) 
posted a double-digit increase. A retailer specializing in women's 
apparel stated that sales exceeded plan in March, and business was 
especially brisk (and above plan) in the first half of April. 
Another large retailer stated that apparel sales strengthened in 
early April, joining continued solid gains in sales of home
furnishings that developed beginning in the first quarter. A large 
discount retailer reported sales of small appliances and home 
furnishings have been particularly robust in most Midwest markets in 
recent months. Reports from other businesses related to the 
retailing industry reinforced a picture of improving conditions in 
this sector of the District economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the recent flood in downtown Chicago resulted in 
significant property damage and lost output for area businesses. 
Retailers reported significant losses from damaged inventory and 
curtailed store hours, although much of the retail sales lost in the 
downtown area were shifted to other local and suburban stores. A 
regional analyst noted that other offsetting effects are expected to 
include higher levels of construction employment in the downtown 
area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto industry contacts indicated some improvement in the motor 
vehicle market in March and early April, especially in the light 
truck segment. Using its own seasonal adjustment factors, a large 
automaker reported that industrywide sales of light vehicles 
increased in February and March, and expected a solid gain in the 
second quarter. An owner of several rental car franchises noted that 
rental frequency started to improve in March, then increased 
dramatically in April. An auto dealer in downstate Illinois reported 
that sales increased sharply in early April, after a normal seasonal 
pickup in sales failed to materialize in March. This contact noted 
that the April gains came in spite of increasing tension during the 
Caterpillar-UAW negotiations, and that the recent progress in 
resolving the dispute has begun to relieve tension among area 
consumers. However, a large auto dealer based in Southeast Michigan 
stated that a sales upturn started in March but dissipated in April, 
noting that consumer uncertainty had risen following new auto 
industry restructuring announcements.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the production side, a large supplier to the auto industry stated 
that "automakers are acting as if second quarter is sacred," and 
noted that schedules for at least one large automaker are more 
likely to be revised upward than downward. A supplier linked to 
light truck production reported that shipments in March and April 
were sharply higher than a year ago. In March, heavy-duty truck 
order backlogs reached their highest level since early 1990, 
according to an industry analyst, although build rates have not yet 
shown similar improvement Still, the orders received by a truck 
engine manufacturer indicated that a heightened level of activity 
held through April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys and contact reports suggested continued upward movement in 
industrial activity in the Seventh District. The Chicago purchasing 
managers' survey (seasonally adjusted) indicated expansion at a 
somewhat faster pace in April, and the employment component of the 
survey reached a level above 50 percent for the first time since 
June 1990. Reflecting the slow improvement indicated by reports from 
the auto industry, the Detroit purchasing managers' survey (also 
seasonally adjusted) indicated expansion in manufacturing activity 
in both February and March. Surveys conducted in Western Michigan 
and Southwest Wisconsin continued to post solid results in March. A 
steel producer reported that it has become more optimistic about 
industry conditions than it has been over the past 18 months, citing 
a noticeable improvement in orders. Machinery orders received by a 
large manufacturer of heavy equipment continued to post solid year-
over-year gains through March, although much of the strength came 
from large individual orders from overseas. New strengthening in 
expected shipments was reported by a boiler manufacturer, as 
customer orders were again being released after postponements in 
1991. This firm views the Midwest as its strongest market A 
manufacturer of office furniture delayed a planned layoff after some 
strengthening in orders. An appliance manufacturer stated that 
retailers' orders have improved in recent weeks, "but they don't 
seem to be ordering for the back room yet." A machine tool 
manufacturer expecting a solid sales gain in 1992 reported that 
orders haven't accelerated in recent weeks, noting that customers' 
capital spending on its products showed little sensitivity to the 
business downturn experienced in 1990 and 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continued strength in housing activity was joined by scattered signs 
of increased commercial construction. A large realtor reported that 
residential transactions (primarily for home resales) continued to 
run at record levels through March and early April, while commercial 
sales and leasing activity remain slow. At the same time, this 
contact stated that on the commercial side "we are seeing some light 
at the end of the tunnel for the first time in 6 to 8 months," as 
institutional investors have begun to indicate some willingness to 
consider financing new projects. A large contractor who had been 
expecting no new commercial construction in his market area reported 
some unexpected activity had arisen in recent months. Several 
financial institutions reported higher levels of activity in the 
residential real estate market m the Detroit area. An association of 
construction contractors specializing in homebuilding and small 
commercial projects throughout Wisconsin reported that the recent 
recession had little impact on construction activity among its 
membership, and activity is now improving along a normal seasonal 
pattern. The association itself recently broke ground on a new 
headquarters facility in order to accommodate the need for new 
space. A large cement producer reported that higher levels of 
bidding for small industrial construction projects joined increased 
public works activity in March and April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from borrowers and lenders on commercial lending in recent 
weeks were mixed, after more uniform indications of sluggish credit 
markets in previous reports. A large commercial bank reported that 
its lending department has been marketing more aggressively in 
recent weeks. Much of the new lending that has arisen has been in 
the residential mortgage area, although the bank has also emphasized 
lending to manufacturers. A middle market lender reported sluggish 
demand for commercial loans financing plant or equipment expansion. 
On the other hand, a law firm reported that its commercial loan 
documentation business quickened in recent months, and the nature of 
the work indicated that banks were making more -- and bigger -- new 
loans to businesses. Separately, a large bank reported that its 
commercial lending (outside of real estate) has increased over the 
past few months. A large construction contractor stated that its 
banking contacts have indicated a greater willingness to lend in 
recent weeks.
