      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 1, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District economic conditions have been uneven. Labor market 
conditions have declined in much of the District with the only 
bright spots being North and South Dakota. Automobile sales continue 
to be depressed relative to a year ago, though there are signs of 
improvement. Housing sales have rebounded, but housing remains below 
its 1980's levels. Conditions in manufacturing and resource-related 
industries have been mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions were mixed in the District, with North and 
South Dakota continuing to buck the national trend, while the rest 
of the District generally deteriorated. Unemployment rates in North 
Dakota fell to 4.6 percent in February from 5.0 percent a year ago, 
while in South Dakota they went to 3.9 from 4.1 percent over the 
same period. North and South Dakota's strength was mirrored in job 
creation, with February's number of employed rising 2.4 and 3.3 
percent, respectively, relative to a year ago. This job growth in 
North Dakota occurred primarily in manufacturing and trade, with 
employment growing 7.3 and 2.5 percent, respectively, in February 
over their year ago levels. South Dakota also showed growth in the 
trade sector, but additionally construction employment was up by 
13.5 percent in February relative to the same time last year. The 
unemployment rate in Minnesota rose to 6.6 percent in February, up 
from 5.3 percent a year ago, while employment was essentially 
unchanged in March from its level of a year ago. Additionally, the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul help-wanted advertising index was also down 
30.1 percent in February relative to a year ago. Unemployment rates 
were also up in Montana and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 
February relative to their year ago levels--7.5 percent from 5.9, 
and 12.3 percent from 9.9, respectively. This is somewhat surprising 
in tile case of Montana since employment rose 2.4 percent over this 
period. Labor market conditions were mixed in western Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers of general merchandise report sharply higher 
sales figures in March as opposed to a year ago, but this was caused 
in large part by the fact that Easter fell in March this year and 
April last year. In February retailers had reported lower sales 
relative to a year ago in comparable stores, though Minnesota state 
sales tax receipts were almost 2 percent higher relative to a year 
ago. The situation will not become clear until April figures become 
available, though some retailers have expressed optimism about the 
summer and fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car and truck sales generally have been weak so far this year, 
in some cases year-to-date sales were down as much as 25 to 30 
percent relative to a year ago. As a result, several dealerships in 
the District have gone out of business. There have been some 
positive reports for the first 10 days of April, with one dealer 
reporting new car sales 10 percent higher than a year ago, and there 
is guarded optimism about the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing has been depressed in the District due in large part to the 
depressed market in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, with permits down 
14 per cent in February relative to a year ago. (A recent HUD study 
foresees demand for new housing in the Twin Cities area failing by 2 
or 3 percent over the next two years.) However, housing sales in the 
District were higher in March, with sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul 12 
percent higher in March relative to a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity has generally been moderate to good. The number of 
crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan set a new record in January, up 1.2 per cent from a year 
ago. Tourism has been strong in South Dakota, especially in the 
Black Hills and Badlands areas. The popularity of the movie, "Dances 
with Wolves," which was filmed in South Dakota, and the fiftieth 
anniversary of Mount Rushmore in July are expected to have a 
positive impact. The outlook for the summer season is positive, 
especially with gas prices staying low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's construction industry have been mixed. 
The continuing overhang of office space in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
area has depressed local construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall conditions in the District's manufacturing industries have 
been poor of late. An index of Minnesota economic indicators 
declined only slightly from its year ago level in January, however 
manufacturing employment in the state was down almost 3 percent in 
March from its year ago level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ninth District conditions of resource-related industries have been 
mixed. The Minnesota index of prices received by farmers rose by 
almost 2 percent during the first 15 days of March, but was still 
5.6 percent below its year ago level, due in large part to the fall 
in dairy and crop prices. However, cattle and hog prices are at 
record levels. Precipitation has been below normal in most of the 
District. South Dakota, in particular, has had between 40 and 60 per 
cent of normal rainfall thus far this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's mining industry conditions have been fairly good. 
However, the oil business continues to decline with employment the 
lowest in years and drilling only in proven fields.
