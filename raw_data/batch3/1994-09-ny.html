      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District economic developments were by and large more 
favorable in recent weeks. Most retail contacts posted July sales 
results that were on or above plan and homebuilders noted a pickup 
in activity after some earlier slowing. Office leasing activity 
showed some recent improvement and unemployment rates declined in 
the District during August. Senior loan officers surveyed at small 
and midsized banks reported strength in business loan demand but 
weakness in the mortgage and consumer sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Year-over-year sales results were generally positive among District 
retailers in July and partial data indicate that the pattern 
continued into August. A majority of respondents reported that sales 
were on or above plan with gains ranging between 0.5 percent and 6.0 
percent. The one chain with a small year-to-year decline in sales 
attributed this in large part to having much less clearance 
merchandise on hand this July compared with last year. Items 
mentioned as strong sellers were men's wear, junior apparel, women's 
jewelry and accessories and merchandise for the home such as 
appliances and electronics. Several retailers noted some softness in 
sales of women's apparel but expressed hope about the new fall 
fashions.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of one chain which has been attempting to pare 
inventories for the past several months, retailers described 
inventories as both current and on plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in the District noted a pickup in activity during 
recent weeks after slowing earlier this summer. Most stated that 
higher interest rates have not been a major deterrent thus far both 
because rates remain historically low and are spurring buyers to act 
before rates go even higher. Some noted that higher new home prices 
resulting from increased costs for materials such as lumber, gypsum 
and drywall, could have a more pronounced effect on the market than 
higher interest rates. For the most part, respondents expect the 
overall volume of housing activity to show little change from last 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity has shown some improvement in parts of the 
metropolitan area. During July the primary office vacancy rate in 
midtown Manhattan fell by half a percentage point and in the second 
quarter, Westchester County posted its largest decrease in available 
office space since the end of 1991. On Long Island, a 20-year lease 
was recently signed for two of the Grumman Corporation buildings 
being vacated--the largest commercial real estate transaction on the 
island thus far this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates declined in the District during August. New 
York's rate moved down to 6.9 percent from 7.1 percent in July while 
New Jersey's rate fell to 6.0 percent from 6.4 percent in July. This 
was the second consecutive decrease for New Jersey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demolition of the unused Eastern Airlines terminal at Kennedy 
Airport began in August in preparation for construction of the first 
new terminal to be built there in over 20 years. An international 
consortium will build and operate the terminal which will have 11 
gates, each able to accommodate the largest jets in use. The new 
activity is particularly welcome at Kennedy, which had been severely 
impacted by the demise or downsizing of some of its major tenants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several department store chains have reportedly expressed interest 
in acquiring some of the stores that will likely be divested in the 
metropolitan area as a result of the Macy-Federated merger. These 
acquisitions would mitigate any adverse employment effect of the 
merger. On the other hand, Mayor Giuliani recently ordered New York 
City agencies to make additional cuts totaling $250 million and to 
prepare for the possibility of cutting yet another $200 million in 
the months ahead. Further employment cutbacks are likely to result. 
In addition, G.E. announced plans to reduce its manufacturing work 
force in Schenectady by 1200 over the next several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized 
banks in the District, overall loan demand has been mixed. The 
largest declines in activity occurred in the residential mortgage 
and refinancing segments. About three-fifths of the banks 
experienced lower levels of residential mortgage demand, and almost 
all reported less or no refinancing activity. The demand for 
consumer loans was also somewhat weak. Business loans, however, 
remained healthy with close to one-half of respondents reporting 
higher demand and only one-quarter reporting lower demand. Loan 
rates have generally increased with the prime rate; only a few banks 
left their rates unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      While nearly three-quarters of the surveyed banks noted no change in 
their willingness to lend, one-quarter reported an increase. The 
banks have not altered their credit standards, and more than four-
fifths reported stable or lower delinquency rates. Despite the 
latest increase in the prime rate, the spread between the average 
lending and deposit rate has generally held steady, with fewer than 
two-fifths of the banks reporting a wider spread.
