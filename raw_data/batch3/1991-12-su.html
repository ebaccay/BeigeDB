      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports compiled by the Federal Reserve Banks generally suggested 
flagging momentum in the economic recovery in October and early 
November with most Districts in the middle of the country indicating 
continued but slower growth and most other Districts reporting 
stable to slightly weaker conditions. Retail sales generally 
remained sluggish, with several Districts noting that gains were 
concentrated in nondurable goods. After improving in September, 
manufacturing activity leveled out in most Districts in October and 
early November. Housing activity expanded, albeit slowly, in most 
regions, while commercial construction remained weak. Demand for 
commercial and industrial loans remained soft, according to most 
bankers, while credit standards were generally unchanged. Most 
agricultural sources reported higher crop yields and lower prices 
for both crops and livestock. Reports on price trends suggested 
steady to diminished inflation, and discounting was widely reported 
in the retail sector. Several Districts stated that contacts remain 
optimistic about business conditions in 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales generally remained sluggish in October and early 
November. Sources in Atlanta and Cleveland noted that sales gains 
were concentrated in nondurable goods, while Dallas, Boston and 
Kansas City each reported weakness in sales of big-ticket items. 
Minneapolis indicated that retail sales have generally been stagnant 
except for areas close to the Canadian border, which have benefited 
from a surge in cross-border shopping. Minneapolis also reported a 
strong tourism season. Richmond noted continued softening in sales. 
Inventories were said to be above plan by sources in Chicago. 
Cleveland, and San Francisco, while contacts in New York, Atlanta, 
and Kansas City expressed satisfaction with recent levels. Active 
discounting was widely noted, and several reports indicated that 
discounting was necessary to achieve sales gains. Reports on new car 
sales were uniformly weak, with several sources indicating slower 
showroom traffic and lower buying interest expressed by customers 
who do enter the showroom.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity was mixed, with some loss of momentum noted 
in regions that reported strengthening in the summer and early fall. 
After rising modestly in the past several months, manufacturing 
activity in Philadelphia edged down slightly in recent weeks. About 
half of the manufacturing contacts in Boston reported that orders 
have softened recently, after some improvement in the summer or 
early fall. Conditions in the auto industry contributed to some 
slowing in the growth expected in the Cleveland and Chicago 
Districts. Reports received in Atlanta, Kansas City, and San 
Francisco generally indicated continued sluggishness. Manufacturing 
activity continued to slip in Richmond, according to the bank's 
survey of local firms, and excess capacity was most frequently cited 
as the most important current problem. Reports on conditions in 
capital goods industries were mixed in Cleveland and Chicago. Recent 
layoffs and plant closings in the defense, computer and consumer 
electronics industries were noted in St. Louis, although solid 
demand was reported for motor vehicles produced in that region 
(which include minivans). New orders received by a commercial 
aircraft producer have softened, according to San Francisco. 
Continued sluggishness was noted in industries linked to 
construction activity by Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and 
St. Louis, while firms producing goods for housing construction in 
Dallas reported some improvement. Purchasing managers' surveys in 
Buffalo and Rochester revealed mixed but generally stable conditions 
in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity continued to expand at a slow pace. Demand for 
existing homes picked up in the New York metropolitan area, 
particularly among first time home buyers attracted by lower 
mortgage interest rates and lower home prices. Reports received by 
Kansas City indicate that home sales remain well above year-earlier 
levels. Several banks noted that improved sales activity is 
concentrated in the lower end of the market. Modest improvement in 
residential construction was noted in St Louis and Kansas City, 
although St. Louis also noted that weak demand from the housing 
sector has depressed prices received by a metals producer. Housing
starts remained weak in several markets covered by San Francisco and 
New York, while Atlanta noted small increases in activity among 
homebuilders. Sales of existing homes softened in parts of the 
Chicago District and home remodeling in the Chicago metropolitan 
area reported sluggish demand. Sources generally noted little change 
in commercial construction among Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from bankers generally indicated that lending standards for 
approving commercial and industrial loan applications remained 
unchanged in recent months. Demand for commercial and industrial 
loans was generally reported to be stable but weak in Richmond, 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. Bankers 
contacted by Kansas City stated that lending demand was steady to 
slightly higher, improved demand was concentrated in construction, 
agriculture, and home mortgage loans, while demand for commercial 
and industrial loans decreased. A small pickup in demand for 
commercial and industrial loans was reported in Atlanta, although 
demand still remained well below year-earlier levels. Bankers in 
Atlanta, New York, and Dallas stated that high quality loan 
applications remain difficult to obtain. Chicago noted that when 
good loan prospects do appear, competition between lenders has been 
intense, with the borrower benefiting from lower rates. Some reports 
cited instances of borrower difficulty in obtaining credit. Kansas 
City stated that some car buyers are finding it difficult to qualify 
for loans. Several of San Francisco's respondents cited tight credit 
as one reason for slow construction activity. Atlanta noted that 
auto dealers and construction contractors report continued 
difficulty obtaining credit. St. Louis noted that first-time home 
buyers in one market have found it difficult to qualify for mortgage 
loans, in part because of a lack of savings for a downpayment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reports indicated larger-than-expected harvests and high levels 
of livestock production, coincident with weaker commodity prices. 
Chicago reported upward revisions in estimates for corn and soybean 
production, and noted that the improved harvest and weakness in 
exports have weighed on crop prices. Both Chicago and Kansas City 
noted weaker livestock prices and farm bankers in the Kansas City 
District expect an increase in the number of problem loans over the 
coming year. Weaker livestock and cotton prices led sources in 
Dallas to revise farm income projections downward. San Francisco 
reported that agricultural conditions were generally satisfactory, 
although an infestation by the poinsettia whitefly has harmed the 
winter vegetable crop. Heavy snowstorms hurt the corn harvest in 
Minnesota. Above-average yields were reported by St. Louis and 
Richmond, although Richmond stated that dry weather has affected 
recent plantings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several District reports on business expectations revealed continued 
optimism for economic conditions in 1992. Most manufacturing sources 
in Philadelphia continue to anticipate growth over the urn ax moats, 
despite some recent softening. Philadelphia also reported that 
bankers' forecasts of commercial and industrial lending growth have 
increased since earlier in the fall. Richmond noted that retailers 
anticipate sales and their own capital expenditures to rise over the 
next six months, although some softening was indicated in 
expectations for holiday season sales. Most manufacturers contacted 
by Dallas expect stronger growth in orders next year. However, 
weaker sales expectations were indicated by auto industry suppliers 
in both Cleveland and Chicago, and a survey conducted by San 
Francisco showed a moderate increase in the percentage of business 
leaders expecting a renewed recession. Sources in Boston expect some 
pickup in economic activity around mid-year, but still anticipate a 
"long, slow haul." A large group of economists who attended a recent 
roundtable in Cleveland uniformly expected the recovery to continue 
through 1992.
