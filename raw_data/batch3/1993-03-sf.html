      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions remain mixed in the Twelfth District, with 
weakness reported in California and Washington, but generally 
favorable conditions reported in most other District states. In 
California, weak conditions continue in areas dependent on aerospace 
and defense-related manufacturing; and in Washington, significant 
layoffs in 1993 were announced at Boeing. Outside of these areas, 
growth is reported in several sectors, with the strongest conditions 
reported in eastern Washington, Utah, and Idaho. Overall business 
sentiment continues to improve, and recent rains have improved 
District agricultural prospects. Little upward pressure on prices is 
reported and wage increases are reported to be modest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders continues to 
improve. Almost three quarters of our respondents now expect the 
real economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate of at 
least 2.5 percent. This proportion is up from one-half in January 
and one-third in November. In general, contacts from Idaho, Oregon, 
and Utah expect their regions to perform slightly better than the 
national average. Most contacts in California and Washington, 
however, expect their regions to underperform the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little upward pressure on prices is reported by contacts in most 
District markets. An exception is timber prices, which are reported 
to have risen 20 percent since December. Pulp prices, however, have 
declined due in part to weak export demand. Aluminum prices are 
reported as very soft due to declining demand. Most contacts are 
projecting wage increases near 3 percent, although some decreases 
are reported for public employees in fiscally strapped regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts report generally good retail sales in most District 
markets. One national retailer reports that sales continue 
moderately better than last year, that inventories are slightly 
leaner, and that conditions have improved somewhat in both northern 
and southern California. Another national retailer reports stronger 
than expected sales in January and February, and also that 
inventories are lean, but that California remains a weak spot. 
Robust new truck and used car sales are reported in Idaho, although 
consumers remain cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      In California, weakness is reported in a broad range of service 
sector activities. In legal services, a contact from northern 
California reports that a number of firms have announced layoffs in 
the last month and that more firms are expected to contract in size. 
In telecommunications, demand is reported as very weak with a large 
number of disconnections occurring in southern California, The 
state's public universities face further cutbacks, and overall 
tourism is flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continues to contract as layoffs in 
aerospace and defense-related industries continue in southern 
California and Washington. In mid-February, Boeing confirmed it 
would eliminate 23,000 jobs this year and another 5,000 during the 
first half of 1994. Of the total this year, 15,000 jobs will be cut 
in Washington state. Contacts report that these job reductions were 
widely expected following Boeing's announcement in late January that 
it would reduce production. The Boeing cutbacks are expected to have 
a negative impact on its suppliers, with layoffs already announced 
by smaller firms in Washington, Oregon, and southern California.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of aerospace, District manufacturing activity shows signs of 
increased activity. Orders for computer equipment and software are 
reported strong, the heavy equipment industry is reported as doing 
well, and bio-tech firms continue to expand. A contact from southern 
California reports that exports of high-tech high value-added goods 
are one of the region's few bright spots.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rains and the large snowpack have improved agricultural 
prospects in much of the District. Acreage for several crops will be 
expanded due to improved water supplies. Conditions are reported to 
be favorable in the livestock industry, and spring grass should be 
exceptional for grazing. Flooding in Arizona, however, threatens the 
winter lettuce crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonresidential real estate and construction activity remains weak in 
several District markets. A contact in southern California reports 
that effective commercial rents continue to decline, and that 
concessions to tenants are up. A contact from northern California 
reports a four year supply of office space in San Francisco, and 
that available construction funds are being used to bring buildings 
up to code. In Oregon, a contact reports excess capacity in the 
construction sector, and in Utah, a contact reports that permanent 
financing for commercial properties is unavailable in most cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The residential sector is showing more strength. A contact in 
Arizona reports that housing starts are the highest in 10 years, and 
that good residential lots are in short supply. Housing prices 
remain soft throughout California, although sales activity has 
increased. Real estate conditions remain strong in Idaho, Utah, and 
eastern Washington. Residential lending in Hawaii is reported to be 
hampered by a lack of homeowner insurance due to Hurricane Iniki.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mixed conditions are reported across District financial markets. In 
California, a contact at a large bank reports that construction, 
commercial, and industrial lending continues at levels below a year 
ago. Another contact in California expects continued weak demand for 
business and consumer loans through 1993, but expects some 
improvement in mortgage activity. Overall balance sheets are cleaner 
and stronger. Slow to moderate loan demand and good credit quality 
is reported by contacts in Utah and Oregon, and at community banks. 
Financing for small businesses remains tight.
