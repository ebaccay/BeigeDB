      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the First District remains sluggish. This 
sluggishness is particularly apparent in the manufacturing sector, 
where high technology companies continue to announce layoffs and 
furloughs. Firms in more traditional manufacturing industries report 
that employment is trending downward in response to fairly flat 
order rates; but, for most, layoffs are not required. Inventory-to-sales ratios are said to be higher than desired but coming down. The 
experience of the retail sector is more mixed, with some contacts 
enjoying strong sales increases and others seeing a slowing in 
growth. Retailers remain optimistic about the rest of the year and 
are currently ordering winter merchandise based on this optimism. 
Increases in both industrial and retail prices remain very moderate. 
In contrast to the sluggishness of the manufacturing sector and the 
confusing signals from retailing, the real estate market is booming.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail results continue to be mixed in the First District. Several 
retailers enjoyed a strong performance in May; others reported some 
softening in sales growth. On both sides of the performance scale, 
however, retailers with national affiliations felt First District 
results were at least as strong as those of their affiliates 
elsewhere.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants with "upscale" customers appear to be faring somewhat 
better than discount stores, although the difference is not great. 
Several contacts mentioned especially strong sales of video-related 
merchandise, computers, and VCRs. Toys and women's apparel are also 
performing well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are higher than last year in several cases, but are not 
a source of concern among the merchants contacted. In one case, 
inventories are high because sales did not meet expectations; 
another supplier, however, has intentionally increased inventories 
faster than sales so as to improve customer service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms are currently ordering merchandise for next winter's holiday 
season and are building into those orders expectations for a good 
sales season—as good or better than year-over-year growth to date. 
A contributing factor, according to one contact, is that interest 
rate declines have reduced the costs of carrying this merchandise. 
Prices are steady. Fall prices for one merchant, for example, will 
be only 2 1/2 percent higher than last fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of First District high technology companies have announced 
layoffs and furloughs in the past two months. Layoffs have been 
especially prevalent among manufacturers of semiconductor test and 
production equipment; most of these layoffs have been fairly small, 
affecting a couple of hundred people each. The largest individual 
layoffs have been at computer companies; in one case, 1,000 workers 
in the First District have been dismissed. However, the employment 
situation in the computer industry appears to be more varied than 
for firms selling to the semiconductor industry: some computer 
companies have avoided layoffs but are shrinking staff through 
attrition; others are still hiring, A slaving in domestic orders is 
said to be the primary reason for the high tech companies' 
difficulties. The effect of the slowdown has been magnified by the 
rapid expansion that preceded it; during this expansion firms added 
to capacity and built up staff in anticipation of continued rapid 
growth. Despite current difficulties, however, the high tech firms 
contacted are not curtailing their capital spending plans; these 
expenditures are seen as necessary to bring out new products and 
remain cost competitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms in more traditional manufacturing industries report only small 
changes in aggregate order rates. Although one contact reported that 
overall business was down and would require layoffs, most 
manufacturing respondents have seen order decreases in some 
divisions offset by gains in others. Sales to the auto industry are 
good. Sales of housing related products are mixed. Sales of capital 
goods depend very much on the condition of the customer's industry, 
but appear to be holding steady overall. As in the case of high tech 
companies, traditional manufacturers have not changed their capital 
spending plans. For the firms contacted, planned expenditures are 
about the same as or less than expenditures in 1984; however, 
spending in 1984 is said to have been unusually high. The emphasis 
in capital spending is on increasing productivity rather than adding 
to capacity. In particular, there seems to be little need for 
additional floor space; according to one respondent, today's 
machinery is much more compact for the same power and value.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory-to-sales ratios are a little higher than desired but 
coming down. Industrial prices remain very well behaved. All 
respondents report that price increases for materials and supplies 
continue to be very modest; several commented that they are 
encountering greater resistance to increases in their own prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The real estate market is booming, especially in the Boston area. 
Realtors report a low number of listings while demand, said to be 
fueled by declining mortgage interest rates, is running very high. 
Many realtors report that it is a "sellers" market. They expect this 
situation to continue in the near future and intensify if mortgage 
interest rates decline further.
     </p>
     <p>
      New residential construction centers on condominium developments and 
higher-priced homes. Realtors report that very few moderately priced 
housing units are being constructed. Also, condominium conversions 
are continuing at a rapid pace.
