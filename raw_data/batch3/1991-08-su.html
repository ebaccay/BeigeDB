      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      According to contacts across the country, national economic 
conditions continue to improve, but at a slow, uneven pace. Retail 
sales are said to be flat or edging up on average. Nevertheless, 
respondents from all areas expect a modest recovery in retail sales 
during the second half of 1991. Manufacturers report some increase 
in activity, on balance, but recovery is not uniform; demand for 
consumer goods is said to be stronger than demand for capital 
equipment; demand for manufacturing labor shows signs of 
stabilizing. By contrast, several districts report that state and 
local governments and some service industries are cutting 
employment. The pickup in home sales in the spring has lost some 
momentum, and commercial real estate markets and nonresidential 
construction remain weak. In most districts, business loan demand 
shows little strength. Hot, dry weather threatens crops in several 
regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales during June and early July are described as flat or 
edging up in one-half of the Federal Reserve districts. In the 
remaining districts, New York, Cleveland, and Richmond respondents 
report declines, while those in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas 
report moderate increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers east of the Mississippi note month-to-month variability. 
Unseasonably warm weather in May caused an acceleration in purchases 
of summer items, thereby weakening June results. Hot weather in July 
boosted demand for some seasonal products, but discouraged other 
purchases, especially automobiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      In recent weeks, apparel sales were strong in the New York, 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas regions. Major home 
furnishings were more often a source of weakness than of strength. 
Sales figures at automobile dealerships differed widely both across 
and within districts as a result of economic and credit conditions, 
weather, consumer preferences, and the timing of fleet purchases. 
Retail inventories are generally described as satisfactory, and many 
retailers remain conservative in placing new orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus outlook calls for a modest recovery in retail sales 
during the latter half of 1991. However, some contacts believe that 
a noticeable pickup will not occur until the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In a majority of Federal Reserve districts, manufacturing contacts 
report that, on balance, demand is strengthening very gradually. 
However, respondents in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco 
regions describe conditions as mixed, while those in Dallas and 
Boston note a recent softening in incoming orders. Although 
manufacturing inventories generally appear satisfactory, contacts in 
the Atlanta, Boston and Dallas districts note cases of unwelcome 
buildups.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of consumer goods and auto supplies are said to enjoy the 
greatest improvement in demand. Contacts in a number of districts 
report stronger orders for appliances, furniture, carpets, textiles 
and apparel, and for plastics, steel and parts for the auto makers. 
By contrast, the capital equipment industries remain relatively 
weak, according to the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and 
Philadelphia regions. Demand for oil field and agricultural 
machinery and products for aerospace was also described as soft. 
Exports are a source of strength in several coastal districts, but 
contacts in Dallas and Chicago mentioned slowdowns in exports of 
steel and agricultural equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The demand for labor in the manufacturing sector is stabilizing. 
Contacts in the Minneapolis and Atlanta districts report longer 
hours, while respondents in Chicago and St. Louis speak of smaller 
cutbacks and shutdowns averted (in steel and heavy-duty trucks).
     </p>
     <p>
      Input prices are generally said to be flat to down. According to 
Dallas district contacts, metals prices are down, chemicals prices 
are falling but at a slower rate, and lumber prices have stabilized 
after surging earlier in the year. Competition is forcing most 
manufacturers to maintain or reduce their selling prices. Retail 
respondents report few wage or wholesale cost pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturers expect to see a gradual improvement in orders and 
production over the next three to six months. Producers of consumer 
durables generally believe the trough is behind them, while 
producers of capital goods and construction machinery say they are 
close to the bottom and expect a revival in the second half. 
Respondents from the steel and auto industries and the Boston 
district remain very cautious, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services and Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in several districts report cost cutting efforts by 
service industries and state and local governments. In the New York 
district, mergers in the banking and airline industries are expected 
to cause sizable employment losses. In St. Louis, the trucking 
industry is retrenching, while weak economic growth in both Europe 
and North America is hurting express shipping. Contacts in the San 
Francisco region note employment losses in the professional services 
sector. In Dallas, however, engineering firms, business services, 
and temporary employment agencies report weak growth. The tourist 
business is improving in many parts of the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The spring pickup in home sales appears to have moderated, with 
respondents in half the districts reporting a loss of momentum. In 
Minneapolis the slowing was attributed to increases in the cost of 
FHA mortgages; in contrast, the prospect of higher FHA costs was 
seen as a spur to sales in the Dallas district. Residential 
construction was said to be edging up in the Atlanta, St. Louis, and 
Minneapolis districts, steady in Richmond and mixed in Kansas City.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although contacts in the New York and Philadelphia districts have 
seen recent increases in commercial leasing activity, commercial 
real estate markets are weak across the country. Nonresidential 
construction is depressed by high vacancy rates and, according to 
contacts in New York and San Francisco, difficulties securing 
construction financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand from creditworthy businesses is generally said to be 
weak. In New York, banking contacts say they remain willing to lend 
to qualified business borrowers, but credit standards have tightened 
in recent months and borrowers' credit quality has declined. 
Philadelphia district banks are actively promoting business loans 
but are meeting slack demand from creditworthy borrowers. Moreover, 
Chicago respondents say that businesses are issuing long-term debt 
and are using improved cash flow to reduce their bank debt. However, 
Atlanta banking contacts report that improvements in customers' 
financial condition are resulting in slightly higher loan approval 
rates; in the Cleveland district lenders' interest in development 
loans has revived a bit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although Dallas and San Francisco report good conditions for most 
crops, hot, dry weather has reduced expected yields of corn, 
soybeans, and cotton in parts of the Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis 
and Kansas City districts. Contacts note that increased expenses, 
weak demand, and declining production prospects are clouding the 
outlook for farm incomes in some areas. Nevertheless, the cattle 
industry remains strong in all reporting regions, despite a recent 
drop in prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Kansas City and Dallas contacts describe oil and gas activity as 
fairly stable. Rig counts remain low, and natural gas prices are at 
their lowest level in 12 years. In the San Francisco region, lumber 
industry conditions are said to have weakened in recent weeks. By 
contrast, St. Louis and Minneapolis lumber producers see better 
prospects.
