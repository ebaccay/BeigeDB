      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The tone of District comments is mixed, but a little more optimistic 
than in recent months. Retailers are buoyed by better-than-expected 
sales in recent weeks, and automotive sales are expected to rise 
next quarter from this. Several District respondents expect an 
impending recovery in manufacturing production, in part because 
inventory liquidation appears to have about ended. A recent flurry 
of consumer traffic and new mortgage loans suggest better home sales 
and starts this year than last, according to both builders and 
lenders. Loan demand, except for mortgages, remains relatively flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers are a little more sanguine about second-quarter sales 
prospects than they were a few weeks ago because of better-than-
expected sales in both January and February. A national chain 
described its performance in this District as being somewhat 
stronger than in the nation. Retail sales in an upscale shopping 
center, and a large discount chain excelled February 1991 levels, 
and a large retailer described its sales as being better than 
consumer confidence surveys would suggest. Some large retailers were 
able to reduce their excess stocks, substantially, although one 
indicated that inventories are still higher than desired.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automotive
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto producers and dealers continue to be cautious about new car 
sales and production over the next few quarters. Motor vehicle sales 
in February rose a few percent from January, but still fell short of 
the pace last December. Big Three auto makers apparently plan to 
trim production from earlier projections again in March, with some 
weeklong furloughs likely, according to a producer. Motor vehicle 
sales in the first quarter are estimated at just below the level of 
last quarter, but economists in the industry still expect a second 
quarter increase of 5% to 8%. These sources believe that consumer 
confidence is no longer declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the District are also cautious about near-term sales 
prospects, and apparently do not plan much change in factory orders 
from recent months. The present 60-day supply of new cars is 
considered satisfactory in view of an uncertain outlook. Despite the 
"Buy American" campaign, dealers of Japanese cars and Japanese and 
domestic cars report higher sales than dealers of only Big Three 
models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An impending rebound in output is expected by some manufacturers, 
who are encouraged by recent improvements in orders and profits. 
They point out that manufacturers are no longer liquidating stocks, 
and that rising numbers of inquiries and requests for prompt 
delivery of small orders suggest that inventories may be low 
relative to sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major appliance producer, however, sees little prospect for an 
early comeback in appliance production even though shipments are 
expected to climb slowly over the next few months. In this view, 
inventories will be trimmed further in order to reduce costs and 
improve profits. In contrast, a producer of small appliances posted 
record sales and earnings last quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods production is recovering slowly and unevenly. 
Industrial controls used in machine tools are strengthening, but 
orders for the construction and farm machinery industries remain 
weak, according to some producers. An industrial instrument 
manufacturer reported an unexpected decline in January and February 
orders, following a bubble late last year. Orders for heavy-duty 
trucks soared in February, which sharply boosted the January-
February average from the second half of 1991. A small computer 
producer experienced a surge in sales and profits last quarter, and 
expects an even better year in 1992. Orders for forgings rose 
sharply in January from December levels, and shipments were 
relatively unchanged, which some producers believe will add to
production and shipments in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel output has held up better than some producers had anticipated 
for this quarter. Steel service centers have been ordering more than 
expected because of growing optimism about the capital goods 
outlook, according to a producer. Operating rates of some steel 
producers are between 80% and 83% of capacity, but steel prices are 
still declining, and the outlook for profits remains depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home builders and lenders are encouraged by the step-up in consumer 
traffic and sales in January and February, and several expect that 
home sales this spring will top that of a year ago. Home buying and 
starts have been especially strong in Cleveland and Cincinnati, 
according to builders and realtors. Some officials believe that the 
recent runup in mortgage interest rates has not deterred buying, and 
may indeed be an incentive for consumers to buy before rates advance 
further.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large builder of single-family homes and condominiums reports good 
demand for units priced between $100,000 and $125,000. Credit is 
available, according to those contacted. Some builders complain that 
environmental and other regulations are increasingly a constraint on 
new housing starts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most large commercial banks contacted report little change in 
commercial and industrial loans, although one noted its first signs 
of a pickup since early 1991. A banker also states that a 
combination of developments improved its capital position, and that 
the bank is now more aggressively seeking loans. Both banks and 
thrifts report a slowed pace in mortgage refinancing. Until the 
latest runup in mortgage rates, several lenders temporarily 
suspended accepting refinancing applications. New mortgage loan 
demand, however, has been rising even since recent hikes in the 
mortgage rates, according to several banks and thrifts. Depositories 
contacted reported that they have ample funds available for what 
they expect to be better spring sales this year than last. 
Commercial real estate loans, however, are still difficult to get, 
but are available to qualified borrowers.
