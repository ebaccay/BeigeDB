      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District vary among sectors, with 
overall activity apparently flattening out from growth earlier this 
year. Manufacturers indicate continued declines in business, with 
new orders and backlogs edging down, leading area firms to trim 
employment. Retailers report just steady sales in recent weeks, 
overall, with gains in apparel sales being offset by weakness in 
hard goods. Automobile dealers are experiencing a drop-off in sales 
following strong results during the model-year closeout period. 
Bankers report that lending has advanced in all categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations in the Third District business community, on balance, 
are that activity will be relatively flat well into next year. 
Manufacturers generally anticipate a bottoming out of the industrial 
downturn during the next six months, but they do not foresee a 
significant rebound. Retailers express some optimism that sales will 
be good during the holiday shopping season but they expect dollar 
sales in 1990 to run just even with this year's pace, at least 
through spring. Automobile dealers expect a lower sales rate for the 
rest of this year and all of next year. Bankers expect personal 
lending to slow as consumption spending, especially for automobiles 
and other durables, flattens out. They also anticipate a significant 
slowdown in real estate lending as they reduce commitments to 
commercial developers and as long-term, nonbank financing becomes 
more difficult to obtain, as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District continues to decline, 
according to local firms contacted in late September and early 
October. This marks the fourth consecutive month in which 
manufacturing contacts report slowing business, on balance. The 
slowdown is predominantly affecting durable goods producers while 
nondurable goods makers generally indicate they are operating at a 
steady rate. Overall, half of the local manufacturers contacted 
recently said business was stable while nearly 3 in 10 said business 
was falling off and only 2 in 10 noted improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the region's manufacturing sector as a whole, shipments were 
running at a steady rate; however, new orders were falling slightly, 
leading to a drop in order backlogs. In line with the slackening 
order situation, delivery times were being reduced, continuing a 
trend that began in January. On the employment front, two-thirds of 
the firms polled for this report were holding payrolls steady. On 
balance, however, both workers and hours were being cut in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices in the region are moving up but at a slackening 
pace, according to local manufacturers. While increases are still 
noted, three-fourths of the firms responding to recent inquiries 
said prices of both the goods they purchase and the products they 
make were stable. In general, indications of price increases in the 
region's goods-producing sector have been fading since January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, managers at plants in the region say the current 
business downturn could end within the next six months. Nearly 4 in 
to of those contacted for this report said business should stabilize 
over the winter, and the rest were about evenly divided between 
those expecting activity to turn up and those anticipating further 
deterioration. On balance, Third District manufacturing executives 
foresee a level rate of new orders and marginal gains in shipments. 
Nevertheless, area firms plan further cuts both in employment and in 
working hours and they foresee no changes in the rate of capital 
spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the Third District were running at just a steady 
pace overall in early October, according to local merchants, with 
results varying among types of stores and goods. Discount stores 
were making better year-over-year gains than department stores and 
apparel sales were described as good, but other specialty merchants 
said sales results were falling below expectations. In particular, 
electronics and consumer durables were weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District merchants have generally positive expectations for 
sales during the holiday season. They anticipate a fairly healthy 
improvement in sales for the period, compared to last year, despite 
lackluster current performance. For next year, however, they are not 
so optimistic. Most expect little or no gain over 1988 sales, in 
dollar terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers in the Third District report that sales in 
September and October slumped after a strong summer. Both domestic 
and import dealers indicate that buyers took advantage of model-
year-end incentives and that 1990 models have not been selling well. 
The consensus among area dealers is that sales in the last quarter 
of this year and all of 1990 will run below the rate of the last two 
years. Dealers, whose profit margins have been squeezed all year, 
are stepping up cost-cutting efforts, and some have started laying 
off employees. Inventories are described as under control as a 
result of the clearing out of 1989 models and restrained ordering of
1990 models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in 
September stood around 14 percent above the year-ago level as a 
result of strong growth in most types of lending. According to 
lending officers at commercial banks, business lending gained in 
September from loans to management buyouts of units of large 
corporations and from mergers and acquisitions among middle market 
companies. Bankers said this type of financing was still active in 
October, despite the uncertainties in financial markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lending to consumers has advanced strongly at area banks since July, 
fueled by indirect auto lending and home equity loans, according to 
bankers. Other kinds of personal lending, such as credit card and 
installment loans, have not been gaining as vigorously. 
Consequently, bankers expect growth in personal loans to ease if the 
recent drop in auto sales becomes a trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate lending continued on a strong upward trend in September 
but bankers contacted in October said they do not expect this growth 
to continue. Some said they have cut down sharply on commitments for 
construction loans recently and others noted that real estate 
developers are starting to experience difficulty in obtaining the 
nonbank financing that is usually required to complete the funding 
for development projects.
