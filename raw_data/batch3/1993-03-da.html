      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy has grown moderately since the last survey. 
Manufacturing activity has accelerated and business services 
continue to expand at a moderate pace. Many manufacturers report 
employment gains although several say that the increasing cost of 
employee benefits continue to restrict their hiring. Accounting and 
legal firms report a slight rise in activity. Retailers say that 
sales have held steady after a strong increase in the fourth 
quarter. Mortgage activity is increasing at District financial 
institutions although business loan demand remains weak. The 
drilling rig count has declined due to the expiration of tax 
credits, weak oil prices and normal seasonal factors. Agricultural 
conditions have improved slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity continues to accelerate. Average weekly hours 
worked in manufacturing in Texas hit a historical high of 43.4 hours 
in December. Several respondents say that, in response to continued 
growth in orders, they have recently begun to increase employment 
and reduce overtime. Many respondents, however, note that continued 
increases in non-wage benefit costs have caused them to resist 
hiring. Most manufacturing industries report gains in orders with 
the exception of oil field equipment, refining and petrochemicals. 
Petrochemical producers report that margins have shrunk due to 
declining international demand and growing production capacity. The 
expiration of drilling tax credits at the end of 1992 has reduced 
the demand for drilling equipment. Construction-related 
manufacturing industries continue to report robust sales. Sales of 
lumber and wood products are reported to be particularly strong and 
prices have increased sharply. Orders for primary metals have risen 
and respondents report recent gains in employment. Fabricated metals 
producers report a continued gradual increase in both orders and 
employment. Producers of electric and electronic machinery, and food 
and kindred products report strong orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      The construction sector continues to be dominated by strength in 
residential building. Home inventories are generally lean and prices 
are edging up. Home prices are expected to get a further boost due 
to a strong increase in the price of lumber. Despite the likely 
increase in building costs, home builders remain optimistic about 
the industry in 1993. The office market remains overbuilt in most 
areas of the District. Respondents report that there is unlikely to 
be a significant increase in office construction this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil and gas drilling has dropped sharply since the end of December. 
Respondents say the decline is due to the end of Section 29 tax 
credits, weak oil prices, and normal seasonal factors. Following 
OPEC's movement of their target range for oil prices, oil prices 
rose in February for the first monthly increase since last 
September. Respondents note, however, that futures prices for oil, 
which during the latter part of February were flat for second 
quarter delivery, suggest that OPEC will not cut production enough 
to balance the market. Natural gas prices have been edging up and 
remain significantly above the levels of a year ago. Respondents say 
that the recent Increase was due to cold weather in February and low 
storage levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The service sector continues to grow slowly. Most sectors report 
flat to moderate employment gains. Temporary employment agencies say 
that demand from the manufacturing sector has increased and several 
respondents report an increase in fees. After adjusting for a 
seasonal rise, accounting firms report only a slight increase in 
demand and employment. One consulting firm noted that a slowdown in 
RTC activity has reduced his business. Law firms report little 
change in activity although employment has risen slightly. 
Respondents in the hotel industry note a recent rise in occupancy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home financing and refinancing has been a source of strength to 
District financial institutions. Business lending remains sluggish 
and several respondents report either slowing or declining loan 
demand over the past few months. Regulatory burden and slow loan 
demand were cited as the most onerous constraints on loan growth. 
Most respondents were optimistic that conditions would improve 
during the next several quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales respondents say that sales have been steady since the 
last survey. Sales in Houston are reported to be weaker than in most 
areas of the District. Sales of furniture and other home goods are 
reported to be particularly strong. Auto sales are sluggish, 
although respondents say that the outlook for sales has improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural conditions have improved slightly since the last 
survey. Respondents say that favorable weather in many parts of the 
District has improved field conditions. Prices for the majority of 
livestock commodities increased slightly in January and were 5 
percent higher than last year. Prices for crops remained relatively 
stable in January but were 14 percent lower than last year's levels.
