      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the Fourth District continues to improve gradually. 
Consumer spending for automotive and nonautomotive goods slowed in 
July, but retailers and producers of consumer goods remain 
cautiously optimistic for a continued, mild recovery in spending. 
Most manufacturers, except for some producers of construction 
machinery and machine tools, believe that they are in the early 
stages of a recovery. Builders of high-priced new homes report that 
demand is weak but note that lenders recently have been more 
actively seeking loans, including construction loans. Loan activity 
remains generally soft, with scattered signs of increases in 
business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Regional Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economy in the Fourth District continues to improve gradually. 
In Ohio, employment has risen in three of the last four months, and 
in June was nearly back to its latest peak in December 1990. The 
unemployment rates in Ohio and in the District's top four 
metropolitan centers were all below the national average in May and 
June. While respondents believe that the recession in the District 
is over, they continue to expect that recovery will be mild.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report a slowdown in consumer spending in the past month, 
which some attribute to the unusually hot weather, but which others 
blame on tight inventories of summer-related goods, especially 
apparel, fans, and air conditioners. They are cautious about near-term sales prospects because they believe that revival in consumer 
spending in spring and early summer was partly weather-related and 
because they anticipate only moderate gains in employment and income 
in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers report that car sales have eased since early July, 
which some believe was due to the heat wave of recent weeks. They 
nevertheless are encouraged about sales prospects for the 1992 model 
year, because initial orders for the new models are said to be at or 
above levels at comparable periods in the past. Dealers report about 
a 60-day inventory of new cars, with higher consumer and dealer 
incentives likely to slash the stocks of models in excess supply. 
"Nearly new" cars are still selling well and may be a substitute for 
new cars, according to some dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto producers believe that fleet sales in June were higher than 
usual, and consequently are cautious about the strength of new car 
sales. One producer expects a sales pickup of about 10 percent in 
the second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recovery in production has been mixed, and respondents anticipate 
continued but slow growth. Major producers of consumer durable goods 
believe the trough in their orders and output was in late 1990 and 
early 1991, but capital goods industries are marked by mixed 
patterns.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto producers acknowledge that new car production will not be a 
drag on GNP and industrial production as it was earlier this year, 
but are cautious about whether auto production will contribute as 
much to total output in the second half of 1991 as it did last 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production of major home appliances is on a rising trend, according 
to a producer, because sales to dealers have strengthened and 
inventories are being rebuilt following a liquidation in late 1990 
and early 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers uniformly expect a revival in output in the 
second half of this year, but some still believe that their business 
is in a declining phase. One forecaster will trim his second-half 
outlook for producers' durable equipment because industrial and 
transportation equipment production last quarter was less than he 
expected. Heavy-duty truck orders revived moderately last quarter 
from a 1991:IQ trough, and by year-end are expected to be about 
twice the level of the weak first quarter, according to a supplier. 
A producer of electric motors and industrial equipment reports signs 
of revival in that industry late last quarter. The worst of the 
decline in the construction machinery industry is over, according to 
a producer, but recovery has not yet begun because construction 
activity, except for housing and highways, remains in recession. 
Finally, a machine tool producer believes that the decline in orders 
is close to bottom and expects a revival in the second half of this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel analysts see little change from the current 70 percent 
operating rate over the next few months. Orders from the auto 
industry have picked up, but not so from the capital goods and 
construction industries. Steel inventory liquidation by customers is 
said to have run its course last quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some builders of new homes priced at $250,000 and higher complain 
that demand has weakened since early June, and that second-half 
construction appears to be limited to replacing homes that were sold 
earlier this year. One builder reports that banks are now- 
interested in making development loans that were not accepted just a 
few months ago. A major lender agreed that demand and new 
construction for the high end of the housing market is weak, and 
that his firm is now looking at custom home builders that previously 
were not its customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, loan activity remains soft. There are only scattered 
signs of a pickup in business loans, despite the revival in economic 
activity. Some lenders note that commercial and industrial loans in 
recent business recoveries declined for several quarters before 
strengthening. Lenders insist that loan standards have not tightened 
in recent months, but neither have they been relaxed. Some bankers 
note a small pickup in consumer loans, especially for cars. One 
banker reports that business, consumer, and mortgage loans were off 
slightly in June, but that loan officials continue to search for 
creditworthy borrowers because loan growth so far this year has been 
disappointing.
