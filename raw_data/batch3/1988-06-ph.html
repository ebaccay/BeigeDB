      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy is continuing to grow in June, although 
some softness has developed in the consumer sector. Manufacturing 
activity remained on an upward trend as the month began, with 
continuing gains in employment noted. Retail sales, however, have 
been only steady in recent weeks, and retailers say the year-to-year 
comparison is also flat. Bankers report real estate lending growing 
at a strong pace, an acceleration in business lending, and slow but 
steady growth in consumer lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus forecast in the Third District business community is 
for a continuation of current trends. Manufacturers predict more 
growth over the next six months, at around the current pace, but 
they say cost and wage pressures will mount. Retailers expect summer 
doldrums that might extend into fall. Bankers forecast growth in 
commercial and industrial loans in line with overall economic 
growth, but they say real estate lending may slacken as commercial 
development in the region tapers off.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Third District industrial sector continues to advance, according 
to preliminary results of the June Business Outlook Survey. Among 
local manufacturers contacted early in the month, 26 percent said 
overall business was moving up while only 7 percent said it was 
slower. Makers of durable goods reported stronger business than did 
nondurable goods  manufacturers, with the latter operating at a 
steady pace. On balance, among all surveyed firms, most measures of 
business conditions showed improvement: new orders and shipments 
were rising and order backlogs were moving up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Factory employment is continuing on its year-long upward trend this 
month. Manufacturers say the labor market for basic production 
workers is tight, but there is no shortage of skilled labor; thus, 
while they have been able to hire new skilled workers without 
boosting wages, they have been raising wages at the lower end of the 
pay scales. Large firms said that while labor market conditions in 
general have not been pressuring their wage bills, contract COLAs 
are being triggered by inflation and are likely to increase later 
this year and next, unless month-to-month increases in the CPI 
subside.
     </p>
     <p>
      A negative note in the most recent survey is the continuing increase 
in reports of higher input costs. With 65 percent of surveyed firms 
reporting increases in the prices of purchased goods, this index is 
registering its highest reading since May 1981. Survey respondents 
expect further increases in costs: 83 percent of the companies 
polled in early June predict input costs will rise during the second 
half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasting general business conditions for the next six months, 
local firms generally foresee further growth at around the current 
pace, with gains in both shipments and orders. Overall, area 
industrial companies are planning moderate increases in employment 
and capital spending between now and year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in early June said sales in May 
were only even with May of last year, in real terms, and the trend 
in recent weeks remains flat. Generally lackluster sales have backed 
up inventories to excessive levels, particularly at specialty 
stores, according to local merchants, and some describe stocks as 
significantly higher than they should be. Sales of home furnishings 
are healthy, but women's apparel sales remain weak, and sales of 
seasonal items have been poorer than expected, which merchants 
attribute to cool, rainy weather. Discounting and promotional 
efforts to move both lines are widespread. Most retailers expect 
sales in general to remain flat over the summer and they are less 
than optimistic for the balance of the year. Many stores have cut 
back on orders for fall merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the slackening trend in sales, store officials say they are 
having difficulty maintaining adequate staffing levels. With a 
shortage of qualified applicants for store jobs, wage and training 
costs are rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to maintain profit margins in the face of rising dollar 
costs of imported merchandise, many stores are turning to domestic 
suppliers, especially for apparel. In other efforts to reduce costs, 
several retailers plan to close marginal and money-losing stores in 
the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth at major Third District banks has been running at a 
fairly steady pace of about 10 percent (annual rate) in the last few 
months, and bankers contacted in June say growth will probably 
accelerate in response to an increase in business loan demand 
lately. According to bank lending officers, some of this demand 
represents an attempt by borrowers to lock in fixed-rate funds in 
anticipation of further hikes in the prime rate; but bankers believe 
most of the recent spurt in business loan demand stems from healthy 
growth in the regional and national economies. Lending to consumers 
is growing steadily, according to area bankers but at a slower rate 
than other credit categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate lending continues to advance strongly, but bankers say 
this growth may taper off soon. With growing softness in commercial 
real estate markets, permanent financing for projects is becoming 
more difficult to obtain, and area banks generally do not extend 
loans to developers unless such financing has already been arranged.
