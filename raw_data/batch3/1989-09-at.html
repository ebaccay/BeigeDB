      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts throughout the Southeast report that business activity in 
general is no longer weakening and their expectations for the 
remainder of the year are somewhat brighter than before. Several 
contacts in manufacturing have recently revised upward their 
expectations of business activity for the near term and report their 
capital spending plans will remain unchanged or increased as a 
result. These manufacturers are primarily in chemicals, textiles, 
and primary metals industries. The few manufacturers reporting a 
downward revision in their expectations tended to be associated with 
residential and office construction. The railway and trucking 
industries continue to report a decreasing volume of shipments. 
Contacts indicate that consumer spending is stronger than they 
expected last month. Oil and gas exploration is still showing some 
renewed strength, although expectations are for only a slow 
improvement in activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most manufacturers report generally good business activity and their 
expectations for the next few months remain unchanged or have been 
revised upward in August. A producer of plastic containers noted 
that to begin a new product line, capital spending plans had been 
recently increased. He added that most of the additional investment 
would be in their southeastern plants, where wage pressure and labor 
shortages were lower than in the rest of the nation. He also 
reported that the price of plastic resins has been falling, which he 
thought would eventually lead to a decline in the prices of their 
final products. Another producer of thermoplastics reported that 
prices of raw materials like ethylene have been coming down all 
year, and he expects them to fall further by year's end. He 
anticipates business will remain good for the remainder of the year 
with the only weakness occurring in construction related plastic 
goods such as plastic pipe.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of aluminum expect continuing good business after record 
business last year. The sources of strength are large orders from 
aircraft producers and strong export demand. From a year ago, 
exports of aluminum have been up by 50 percent. Weaker auto and 
appliance sales have not affected aluminum production so far, but 
producers expect some inventory buildup by the end of the year. A 
manufacturer of kitchen appliances reports that although 1989 
started out strong, production over the past few months has been 
below last year's level by about 15 percent; he expects production 
to remain weak for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the textile and apparel industry have reported concern 
about competition from imports, although strong domestic demand has 
been able to absorb both imported goods and domestic production. One 
producer notes that there has been a slight easing in the costs of 
raw materials like cotton and chemicals recently. Another, 
describing his outlook as "guardedly optimistic," reports that 
capital spending will continue at the same level for the next three 
years, a level he considers substantial.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on residential construction vary considerably. Reporters 
indicate that building permits in Orlando are up over 50 percent 
compared to year-ago levels, while contacts in Miami describe their 
market as depressed. Some Miami lenders note that they do not expect 
to encourage new borrowing until the real estate picture clears up. 
Uncertainty related to the potential impact of the new S&amp;L; 
legislation on the real estate market was mentioned a number of 
times. A major supplier of building materials in Florida says that 
business is down substantially because of declining residential 
construction, and while he sees signs or activity leveling off, he 
does not expect any recovery this year. On the other hand, a 
spokesman from the lumber and wood industry reports that home 
remodeling has been steadily increasing in importance and has taken 
up the slack from weak residential construction demand. His 
expectations of future business activity have not changed recently. 
Nonresidential construction is reported to be holding up well in 
most areas of the Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts continue to indicate that spending for home appliances and 
furniture is soft. A furniture retailer pointed out that sales so 
far in September have been about the same as last year and that they 
are expecting only slow growth for the rest of the year. They have 
begun postponing capital expenditures in case business weakens 
further. Purchases of nondurables like apparel and textiles are 
generally described as strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in August are reported to be up substantially over 
previous months as a result of manufacturer rebates, although sales 
in the Sixth District were somewhat weaker than the rest of the 
nation. It is feared, however, that the recent gains may be at the 
expense of reduced sales in 1990.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reporters indicate that interest in drilling for oil and natural gas 
in the Gulf of Mexico has picked up recently. Contacts thought that 
increased interest in exploration to replenish domestic reserves 
combined with some consolidation in the industry might result in 
improved drilling activity later this year. A couple of our contacts 
indicated that the increased interest in oil and gas exploration in 
the Gulf is a consequence of the Alaskan oil spill and uncertainties 
concerning future regulation of production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The trucking industry has been reporting declining volume of 
shipments for the past several months. Reduced shipments of building 
materials and lumber products have been sources of weakness. 
Representatives of several trucking firms said that they have 
recently decided not to increase capacity, any capital spending 
would be to maintain existing equipment. Railway representatives 
report that carloadings have been down for all products, including 
autos and other manufactured goods. One contact noted that the 
Southeast is faring about the same as the rest of the nation. Most 
have attributed the reduced volume to overall economic conditions 
rather than seasonal factors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The health care industry has reported that the shortage of nurses 
has eased recently. Efforts to increase enrollments in nursing 
programs seem to be paying off.
