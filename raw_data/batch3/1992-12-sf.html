      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions are mixed in the Twelfth District, as weakness 
in California is offsetting moderate growth in most other District 
states. In California, cutbacks continue in aerospace and defense-
related manufacturing, retail sales are sluggish, and the state's 
fiscal condition has worsened. Outside of California, moderate 
improvement is reported in retail trade and residential 
construction, with the strongest conditions reported in Utah and 
Idaho. However, Washington faces further cutbacks in aerospace, and 
tourist activity is down in Hawaii. Overall business sentiment 
improved slightly and District agricultural conditions are generally 
good. Little upward pressure on prices is reported, and several 
contacts expect wage increases of around 3 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders has improved 
moderately since our last report. One-third of our respondents now 
expect the real economy to expand during the next four quarters at a 
rate of at least 2.5 percent. This proportion is up from one-fifth 
in October and September and has returned to the level seen this 
past summer. An additional sixty percent of our respondents expect 
real output to expand, but at a rate below 2.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several contacts are projecting wage increases of around 3 percent 
for the coming year, down from an average of 3.5 to 4 percent for 
the past twelve months. The same contacts are reporting that 
benefits increases during the coming year will be at least double 
that--over 6 percent The increase is attributed largely to the cost 
of medical benefits, projected by some contacts to rise 10 or 11 
percent. Several respondents noted that their organizations either 
had cut back or were planning cutbacks in medical benefits in order 
to hold down costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of medical costs, few upward pressures on prices are 
reported in District markets. One exception is wholesale electricity 
prices in the Pacific Northwest, which have risen with demand and a 
decreasing power surplus.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakness in California is holding down District consumer spending. 
Contacts report that sales are barely above year-ago levels for 
California as a whole, before adjusting for inflation, and are 
declining in certain regions, mostly in southern California. Retail 
sales are showing a slight pickup in recent weeks, however, 
particularly in northern California. Consumer confidence in the 
southern part of the state is reported as still poor. Outside of 
California, contacts report increasing sales and expectations for a 
good Christmas season. With respect to retail employment, one 
contact from a major retail chain reports that the trend is 
definitely toward improving productivity, even if it means laying 
off more workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      A telecommunications firm in California reports that orders for new 
business hookups are weak, and that uncollectible bills remain high. 
In Hawaii, tourist-related businesses are still in the process of 
cutting their staffs due to a decline in visitors from the mainland. 
Tourism in California is reported to have increased slightly in 
dollar volume over a year ago, but market share is down. The 
sluggish California economy has led analysts to project a 
significant state budget shortfall through the end of the 1993-94 
fiscal year. Official estimates of the shortfall range from $4.1 
billion to $7.5 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District aerospace activity continues to contract as layoffs 
continue in southern California and Washington. In Washington, 
Boeing has completed its slowdown of 737 production, but has 
announced plans to reduce production of the 757 and 767 models by 
one-third in 1993 with a layoff of 2,500 workers (2,000 in the 
Seattle area). Observers in Seattle are forecasting that the local 
aerospace industry will drop a total of 10,000 jobs by the end of 
1994, with an additional 26,000 "spinoff" jobs lost as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other District manufacturing activity is mixed. Contacts in Utah 
still report some reduction in defense-related industries, but new 
hiring by computer software companies. A contact from northern 
California reports that conditions for small personal computer and 
defense-related electronic companies continue to soften. Computer 
software sales by Washington companies are reported strong. 
Construction machinery sales are reported up 5 percent over a year 
earlier. A contact in the paint and coatings industry reports that 
national sales continue at a level slightly more than 5 percent 
above a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural conditions are generally good in most markets. 
Contacts in Idaho and Utah report agricultural conditions as 
favorable, and contacts in eastern Washington report a strong crop 
year. Concern remains, however, about continued drought.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for wood products is holding steady, and western lumber 
production is running slightly above the level of a year earlier. 
The operating environment for western lumber producers, however, is 
described as "tough" due to restricted public timber supplies. 
Contacts report several recent mill closures due to the shortage of 
logs, with one contact expecting attrition of one-third of existing 
Northwest lumber and plywood mills. Demand for western newsprint 
continues to be very strong, however, and several companies are 
running at capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonresidential real estate and construction markets are reported to 
be weak in several District markets. In southern California, one 
contact reports that tenants renewing leases are negotiating rent 
discounts of 25 to 40 percent. The same contact expects foreclosures 
for major projects in 1993 to exceed those in 1992. Another contact 
in northern California reports that rents and the purchase price of 
space will probably decline another 10 to 15 percent. Commercial 
real estate is reported flat in Utah, and a contact in the Oregon 
construction industry reports fierce competition among contractors 
due to excess capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stronger conditions are reported in the residential sector. In 
California, existing home sales climbed sharply during October, and 
posted the first concurrent monthly and annual sales increases since 
February. Contacts in eastern Washington report a continued boom in 
residential real estate and construction, and housing starts in Utah 
are reported strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions at District financial institutions are reported as 
sluggish. In California, contacts report that loan demand remains 
weak for most types of commercial and consumer credit. The number of 
applications for small business loans continues to decline, while 
the volume of larger commercial loans also is falling. The 
residential mortgage market in California is reported to be mixed. 
Moderate demand for first mortgages is largely offset by weak demand 
for second mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Outside of 
California, contacts report some growth in loans in Arizona and 
Nevada and light to moderate business loan demand in Utah. Weak loan 
demand, however, is reported in Alaska and Hawaii.
