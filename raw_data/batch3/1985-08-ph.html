      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District appear to have improved 
slightly in July. Manufacturing activity has picked up marginally 
after a flat three months and retail sales have rebounded from an 
unexpected dip in June. Both commercial and consumer loan volume 
continue to grow at area banks, although somewhat more slowly than 
in the first half. Early indications are that tourism business in 
the Third District this summer is better than it was in the 
disappointing 1984 season.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the Third District economy is positive. 
Manufacturers generally expect business conditions to remain stable 
or to improve over the next six months and anticipate increased 
capital spending. Area retailers are pleased with the recently 
regained strength of sales and expect a good third quarter. Bankers 
predict renewed economic growth and foresee demand for commercial 
credit increasing near the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District is moving up marginally 
alter a 3-month lull, according to the July Business Outlook Survey. 
Twenty-eight percent of the local companies answering this month's 
survey report a pickup in business since June, versus 18 percent 
reporting a slowdown. Slightly less than half indicate no change. 
The rate of both new orders and shipments in July increased 
fractionally over June and inventories continued to be worked down. 
Negative indicators in July were manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled 
orders and employment, both of which edged lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      In their outlook for the next six months, most area manufacturers 
are optimistic. Over 85 percent of the July survey respondents 
believe business conditions during the next six months will be the 
same or better than they are now, and more than 40 percent forecast 
gains in both new orders and shipments. Prospects for greater 
capital expenditures have improved slightly. Twenty-?? percent of 
the companies contacted in July plan increased outlays for plant and 
equipment over the next six months, up from 20 percent in June. The 
employment situation is not likely to improve, however; more than 
half of the industrial establishments surveyed this month plan no 
changes in either employment levels or working hours, and more than 
one-fourth expect to make workforce reductions between now and 
January 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail trade in July appears to be picking up a bit after a 
lackluster June. Major department stores in the Third District had 
flat or slightly lower sales in June, on both a month-to-month and 
year-to-year basis; but increased sales in July should put them back 
on the path to 1985 sales at least 5 percent above 1984. Apparel and 
seasonal items remain popular with shoppers while sales of hard 
goods lag. Exceptions are electronic equipment, which has been 
strongly promoted by some stores, and air conditioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers are optimistic about the third quarter, anticipating an 
increase in sales of approximately 6 percent over the same period 
last year on a same-store basis. New stores opened in the Third 
District by major chains in recent months are doing well, and, 
despite a slower than expected spring, inventories have been kept 
under control.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan volume continues to grow at Third District banks, but the pace 
is moderating. Consumer loan volume is increasing at an annual rate 
of approximately 15 percent in July, substantially slower than the 
25 percent year-to-year increase reported last month by major banks 
in the Third District. Tighter credit qualifications and stepped-up 
collection efforts in response to a rising delinquency rate are 
mentioned as factors in the slackening pace of consumer loan growth. 
Commercial and industrial loan volume in July is approximately 14 
percent higher than it was in July 1984, a slight easing from the 
June year-to-year increase of 17 percent. According to local 
bankers, business borrowing has been limited by retrenchment in 
long-term foreign lending and by large corporations' reliance on 
bond and money markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers expect loan growth in most categories to 
continue at the present pace for the next several months, then pick 
up at the end of the year. Some believe that commercial lending, 
especially to middle market companies, may move up sharply as 
economic growth accelerates into 1986. Agreeing with this outlook, 
local bank economists expect credit conditions to become tighter 
near the end of the year. They say that interest rates may be driven 
up by federal government borrowing requirements and increased 
private sector credit demand, coupled with greater restraint by the 
Fed. They place the prime rate at 10 percent or more by year-end, 
the federal funds rate near 9 percent, and long-term Treasury bond 
rates at 11 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist-related business has improved over last year at mountain and 
seashore resorts in the Third District, although the vacation home 
rental market is soft in some locations. Chamber of Commerce and 
local government officials report more visitors to recreational 
attractions this year. They attribute the increase primarily to 
better weather than in the 1984 season, but also cite improved 
economic conditions and greater promotional efforts. Delaware 
officials say the Memorial Day weekend broke records for attendance 
at the beaches. By mid-July, tourism-related revenues at 
Pennsylvania mountain resorts were estimated to be 4 percent above 
1984. In New Jersey, tourism revenues are up about 10 percent from 
1984, although shorter vacation stays and an increased supply of 
summer homes have resulted in lower rental income this year at some 
of the state's resort communities.
