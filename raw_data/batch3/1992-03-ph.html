      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions varied across major sectors in the Third District in late 
February and early March; overall, economic activity appeared to be 
steady or slightly improved. Most manufacturers reported that 
business has been stable to somewhat better in recent weeks, and new 
orders were on the rise. Retailers generally indicated that sales 
were running a few percent above the levels of last February in 
dollar terms. Many auto dealers said unit sales picked up in 
January, and although results were mixed for February, customer 
traffic continued to be good. Most major banks in the Third District 
reported continuing declines in loan volume outstanding although 
residential mortgage activity was generally up. Realtors and home 
builders said sales were rising, especially for moderately priced 
houses. Commercial and industrial real estate was characterized as 
soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District business contacts express some 
optimism. Most manufacturers expect orders and shipments to increase 
over the next six months. Retailers and auto dealers look for 
gradual improvement. Bankers said they were receiving more inquiries 
from potential business borrowers although loan applications had not 
yet picked up. Realtors foresee further increases in residential 
activity although the recent upturn in mortgage interest rates has 
caused some concern that recent gains could be short-lived. Demand 
for commercial office and retail space is not expected to strengthen 
soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity has been running at a steady pace according 
to a majority of the industrial firms contacted for this report, and 
a good percentage reported some recent improvement. Although 
shipments remained stable at about half of the manufacturers polled, 
they were up at almost one-third of the firms. Both durable and 
nondurable goods producers reported increases in new orders. 
Manufacturing employment remained weak, however. While a large 
majority of firms reported steady payrolls, a considerable number 
are still making reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Third District manufacturers expect business to improve over 
the next six months. A majority of managers at area plants look for 
an increase in orders and shipments during the spring and summer, 
and order backlogs are expected to rise. Expectations of improved 
business are leading area firms to plan higher capital outlays over 
the next two quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District retailers indicated that sales in 
January exceeded sales in the same month last year. Although the 
year-over-year comparison for the month is skewed by the low level 
of sales in January 1991, most merchants said that they continued to 
make gains in February as well. Although results varied greatly from 
store to store, on balance retailers indicated that sales in late 
February were running a few percent above the year-ago period in 
dollar terms. Most store officials said they continued to be 
aggressive in pricing and promotion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District merchants expressed some optimism for the rest of the 
year. Although most remain cautious in their planning, some store 
officials said they were reviewing their sales forecasts and might 
raise them. However, retailers continue to mention the fragile state 
of consumer confidence, and several said that a stronger sales trend 
will not take hold until worries about job security diminish.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers said that unit sales in January were 
generally above the average for the month in the past few years. 
Although reports were mixed for February, most dealers reported that 
customer traffic had remained fairly healthy. On balance, dealers 
look for gradual improvement during the year, especially if auto 
loan rates remain at or below current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Third District bankers contacted for this report indicated that 
overall loan volume was continuing to edge down. Most large banks in 
the district were experiencing declines in business and consumer 
installment lending. Some batters said seasonal factors could 
account for much of the drop. Residential real estate lending--
including home equity loans, purchase mortgages, and refinancings--
was generally steady or up at banks in the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, commercial bank lending officers generally expect the 
demand for residential mortgages to continue moving up, although a 
few believe the recent backup in mortgage interest rates could slow 
the current spurt of activity. As for commercial and industrial 
lending, most of the Third District bankers surveyed said that loan 
applications were not on the rise, but they were receiving more 
inquiries from potential business borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from some realtors and home builders indicated that home 
sales were on the rise. Several builders said customer traffic at 
their projects had grown in recent weeks and sales had picked up, 
especially for moderately priced houses. Realtors noted increased 
interest from potential buyers of existing homes, but they indicated 
that sales have been picking up only slowly, especially for higher-
priced homes. According to real estate contacts, the recent behavior 
of mortgage interest rates--falling, then moving back up--may spur 
some sales in the short run, but could restrain sales if the rates 
continue to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate values remain under downward 
pressure, according to Third District brokers. They reported that 
office leasing activity has been fairly healthy, but property values 
and rents have been soft as excess capacity remains to be absorbed. 
While new office buildings have been finding tenants, older 
buildings have been losing tenants. Demand for retail space and 
industrial buildings was reported to be weak.
