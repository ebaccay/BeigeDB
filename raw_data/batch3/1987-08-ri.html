      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Broadly speaking, economic conditions in the District have not 
changed much in recent weeks. Directors and respondents to our 
regular mail and special telephone surveys reported generally 
positive current conditions and widespread optimism about prospects 
for the economy. Manufacturing activity continued to increase 
moderately from June to July, while retail sales were unchanged. 
Wage and price pressures intensified at producer and consumer 
levels. Homebuilding and sales of single family homes were steady. 
Large banks reported strength in consumer and home equity loans, no 
clear change in commercial and industrial loans, and extraordinary 
additions to loan-loss reserves. Reports from agricultural bankers 
indicate that farmers are under less financial stress than a year 
ago, although July's hot and dry weather has probably reduced 
prospective crop yields.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers responding to our regular survey reported that their sales 
through the first part of July were about even with those in late 
June. Forty percent of the survey respondents reported increases in 
sales, as compared with 33 percent who reported declines. Weakness 
in sales of big ticket items was noted by one-fourth of the 
respondents, as compared with one-sixth who reported strength in 
this category. Retail inventories, except of automobiles, were 
reported to be higher. Retail employment showed little change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upturns were evident in retail prices and wages from June to July. 
One-third of the retailers reported increases in the prices they 
charge and in employee compensation, as compared with negligible 
percentages reporting declines. Retailers were about evenly split 
between those reporting increases and those reporting no change in 
the prices they pay for goods at wholesale.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers remain optimistic about sales in the months ahead, with 
almost two-thirds anticipating increases. Most expect wholesale and 
retail prices to rise further. Few, however, expect an increase in 
their employee numbers, even though over half currently report job 
openings. Evidently retailers are doubtful that they will be able to 
fill these positions, given the tightness of markets for service 
workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to grow at a moderate rate in July. 
Shipments, new orders, employment, and the workweek increased. The 
backlog of orders has been generally unchanged in our last two 
regular surveys. Inventories of materials increased slightly, while 
inventories of finished goods were unchanged. Manufacturers again 
reported increases in the prices of raw materials and finished 
products, and over one-third of the respondents reported that they 
had raised wages in the past month. Manufacturers believe their 
business activity will improve further in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal production is above its year-ago level, but below the level 
predicted a few months ago. Export demand is weaker than had been 
anticipated, and electrical generating utilities are not buying at 
the expected rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in most of the District report July activity was about 
even with June, but down from a year ago. Builders believe that many 
prospective buyers are staying out of the market, waiting for 
mortgage rates to decline. Meanwhile, current buyers of new homes 
are seeking more amenities, including higher ceilings and larger 
rooms. In the Washington, D.C., area, homebuilding activity, 
particularly condominium construction, continues to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors in the District report that their sales of single family 
homes were unchanged in July from June. They expect mortgage 
interest rates to remain steady for three months, and then to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial
Large District banks report that consumer loan demand is strong this 
summer compared to last, and home equity loan demand is also strong. 
Commercial and industrial loan demand is mixed. Residential mortgage 
activity other than home equity loans is lower this summer. Variable 
rate mortgages that allow conversion to a fixed rate mortgage at the 
borrower's option—the so-called convertible ARMs—are being 
offered by only a few District banks, and only one bank reported 
strong customer interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost half of the banks surveyed reported out-of-the-ordinary 
additions to their loan-loss reserves. The increases were mostly due 
to foreign debt exposure and were expected to be one-time 
adjustments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Preliminary results from our recent survey of District agricultural 
banks suggest a lessening in the financial stress facing District 
farmers. Agricultural loan repayment rates are improving and bankers 
are more optimistic that farmland values will rise. Further, 
interest rates across all loan categories eased somewhat in the 
second quarter. Hot, dry weather is the predominant problem now 
facing District farmers. If it doesn't rain soon, corn and soybean 
yields will suffer, which would reduce prospective revenues from 
crop sales at harvest and the ability of some farmers to service 
debt.
