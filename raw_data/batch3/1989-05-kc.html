      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 3, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Tenth District economy continues to grow slowly. Retail sales 
are increasing moderately, though new car sales are down. 
Manufacturers report higher input prices, but no bottlenecks or 
labor shortages. The district's energy industry shows few signs of 
improvement. Housing starts have been relatively weak so far this 
year, although they were stronger in March. Mortgage demand is mixed 
at district savings and loan institutions. Loan demand at commercial 
banks is steady to higher, while deposit performance is mixed. 
Recent rains have improved the outlook for spring crops, but winter 
wheat yields are still expected to be below normal. Bankers report 
generally strong financial conditions among farmers and ranchers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most general merchandisers report retail sales performance has 
improved from a year ago and over the last three months, although a 
few report decreasing sales. Retailers are attempting to maintain 
margins by passing through wholesale price increases. In the near-
term, retail sales are expected to be stable to slightly higher. 
Inventory levels are mostly satisfactory. Automobile sales are 
reported to have weakened over the last month. Most dealers are 
trimming inventories or maintaining current inventory levels. Most 
auto dealers expect 1989 sales to be at or below 1988 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All respondents indicate that input prices are up relative to a year 
ago, with some increases over the past three months. Prices are 
expected to stabilize or decrease in the future. Firms report few 
difficulties in acquiring materials, and lead times have remained 
steady or declined. Inventory levels are generally satisfactory. 
Most plants are operating near full capacity, but no bottlenecks or 
labor shortages are reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite the recent run-up in oil prices, the district's energy 
industry shows few signs of improvement. Continued uncertainty about 
the future course of world oil markets has held down drilling 
activity in the region and nationwide. The average number of active 
drilling rigs in the district fell from 219 in February to 211 in 
March, a fourth below the average of one year ago. However, during 
the first two weeks of April, the district rig count increased to 
233.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District housing activity through March is down from a year ago. 
However, most homebuilders report stronger housing starts in March, 
a rebound from February's weakness. Single-family construction 
continues to be stronger than multi-family. New home sales and 
prices are higher, but the higher prices reflect larger homes being 
sold. Home inventories are relatively low. Most respondents expect 
steady housing activity in the near term, and slightly improved 
activity by year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents from district savings and loan institutions report 
a net outflow of deposits over the last month. In most cases, net 
flows of deposits are comparable to a year ago. Respondents' 
expectations for deposit flows in the near future are mixed, but 
several expect further outflows if interest rates keep increasing. 
Respondents report mixed demand for mortgages, with a pickup 
expected during the summer. Many respondents expect mortgage rates 
to peak within the next three months and then to decline for the 
rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most district commercial bank respondents report constant or 
increased loan demand over the past month. The increases were 
concentrated in commercial and industrial loans and in agricultural 
loans. About half of the respondents increased both their prime rate 
and their consumer loan rates by fifty basis points in recent weeks, 
while the other half reported no change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only a few banks expect further increases in lending rates in the 
near future; the remaining banks anticipate no change. Deposit 
behavior varied both across the district and across types of 
deposits. Approximately equal numbers of respondents reported 
increases and decreases in deposits. Decreases were mostly in demand 
deposits, NOW accounts, and money market deposit accounts. Increases 
were generally in IRA and Keogh accounts and in small time and 
savings deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rains throughout much of the Tenth District improved the 
district's agricultural outlook, but the rains came too late for 
much of the winter wheat crop. Continued dry conditions throughout 
the spring and cold temperatures in February severely damaged much 
of the crop. Wheat yields are expected to be well below normal in 
parts of Oklahoma and much of Kansas. Bankers in those areas report 
that some farmers are plowing under the wheat crop and planting 
spring crops. In other areas of the district, the recent moisture 
has allayed fears of losing the wheat crop, although additional 
rains are needed to assure adequate spring growth. District bankers 
report most farmers will begin planting spring crops within the next 
few weeks. The recent rains have contributed to good growing 
conditions and an optimistic outlook for spring crops, although more 
moisture will be needed soon. Subsoil moisture remains below normal 
in many areas of the district; good snowpack in Colorado will help 
replenish depleted water stocks there.
     </p>
     <p>
      Results of spring credit reviews by district bankers generally 
reflect strong financial conditions among farmers and ranchers. Most 
operators had good financial performances both last year and the 
year before. Given the relatively strong financial conditions of 
borrowers, most bankers do not feel that their agricultural loan 
portfolios are at risk, especially if dry conditions affect only the 
wheat crop and normal weather returns to the rest of the district.
