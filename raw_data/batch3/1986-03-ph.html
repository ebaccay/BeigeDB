      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 20,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy is healthy, on the whole. Business 
continues to improve in the manufacturing sector, although order 
backlogs and employment have edged downward slightly in recent 
weeks. Retail sales in January and February were in line with or 
above merchants' expectations, and unplanned discounting was 
minimal. Bankers report continued growth in lending, although not at 
the rapid rate of increase of early 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the next six months is generally positive. 
Manufacturers expect continued improvement, although they do not 
foresee any near-term increase in employment. Retailers see no signs 
of slackening consumer demand, and they are raising their sales 
forecasts for the first half of the year. Bankers predict steady 
growth in commercial and consumer loan demand, as well as mortgage 
lending at current interest rate levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial activity in the Third District is expanding marginally, 
according to the latest Business Outlook Survey. Twenty-three 
percent of the firms replying to the March survey say their business 
has picked up from a month earlier while 13 percent say business is 
down. Sixty-four percent of the survey respondents report no change. 
Conditions are substantially the same for manufacturers of durable 
and nondurable goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers have increased shipments, but made only 
slight gains in winning new orders; the level of unfilled orders has 
dropped fractionally. Employment rose at 10 percent of the plants 
covered by the March survey but declined at 25 percent, thus 
offsetting last month's slight gain. Prices of industrial goods are 
steady in the region. More than 80 percent of the companies surveyed 
report no change in the prices of either goods purchased or goods 
sold this month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Optimistic views prevail among the local manufacturers participating 
in the latest survey. More than 40 percent forecast continued 
expansion and look forward to increases in new orders and shipments 
over the next six months; another 40 percent expect a continuation 
of present conditions. Employment prospects are not as bright, 
however; most manufacturers surveyed in March do not expect any 
change in payrolls or working hours between now and autumn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers say sales during January and February ran 
above the same period a year ago. One major department store reports 
sales up by nearly 8 percent over January-February 1985, and a 
retailer with stores throughout the Third District says an upgrading 
of product lines has been very successful. Most products are selling 
well, including appliances, which had not been strong performers 
during the Christmas shopping season, and stores have not had to 
take unanticipated markdowns to maintain post-Christmas sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District retailers contacted in March have raised their sales 
forecasts. They expect the strength exhibited by most product lines 
in January and February to continue. Although sales of spring 
merchandise have been restrained by cold weather recently, merchants 
are carrying sizable inventories of these items in anticipation of 
strong sales once warmer weather takes hold.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans outstanding at large Third District banks in February 
were approximately 10 percent higher than a year earlier. A dip in 
commercial and industrial loans outstanding in late January and 
early February had been recouped by the beginning of March, 
according to lending officers. Third District bankers expect the 
current economic expansion to continue throughout 1986, providing 
the impetus for growth in business lending of 10 percent or more 
during the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial leasing has declined substantially. Local bankers do not 
expect this business to revive unless proposed tax changes, which 
have negative implications for leasing, are modified, or the date of 
their implementation is postponed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although consumer lending is still moving up, the rate of increase 
has eased at Third District banks. Automobile manufacturers' 
incentive financing programs have taken installment lending market 
share from banks. Growth in credit card loan volume has been slowed 
by seasonal repayments of credit balances by consumers as well as by 
more cautious lending by Third District banks in response to rising 
delinquencies. Mortgage lending is brisk, both for refinancings and 
home sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bank deposits are increasing at about the same rate 
as they did during 1985, with growth relatively stronger in money 
market deposit accounts and longer-term CDs. With slower growth in 
loan portfolios than last year, banks are committing a larger 
portion of new funds to money market instruments than they did in 
1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local bank economists are raising their forecasts of economic growth 
in response to the drop in oil prices, a depreciating dollar, and a 
sustained high level of consumer demand. Nevertheless, they do not 
expect much upward pressure on interest rates until later in the 
year. Most economists anticipated the recent cuts in the discount 
rate and prime rate. As for long-term rates, they expect Treasury 
bonds to remain at 8 to 8.5 percent. Rates are expected to rise by 
year-end, however, with short term rates up about 30 basis points 
and long term rates up about 50 basis points.
