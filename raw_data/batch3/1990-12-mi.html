     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth district economic conditions have been showing signs of 
weakness recently. Labor market conditions have been mixed. Growth 
in spending on general merchandise has slowed down lately, 
automobile sales have been sluggish and housing activity has 
declined. Conditions in construction and manufacturing have been 
mixed. Resource-related industries have been doing very well. Wage 
and price increases have remained moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions have been mixed in the district. Minnesota's 
unemployment rate was 4.5 percent in September, up slightly from 4.3 
percent in August and 4.2 percent in September 1989. Unemployment 
rates in Montana, South Dakota, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan 
were slightly higher in September than their levels a year ago. 
Unemployment rates in western Wisconsin and North Dakota fell 
slightly over the same period. The number of people employed in the 
district was about 1.0 percent higher in September than in September 
1989. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, computer and electronics 
firms have continued to reduce the size of their workforce but 
demand for hospital and medical workers is reported to have been 
strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases have remained moderate. However, employers throughout 
the district report that medical insurance costs have continued to 
rise sharply. Price increases, except for fuel costs, have been 
moderate, A construction contractor reports that costs are expected 
to increase 4 to 6 percent in the first half of 1991 but does not 
expect to be able to pass along cost increases fully to customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers of general merchandise report a slowdown in sales 
growth lately. One major retailer reports that October sales in 
comparable stores were 2.4 percent higher than a year ago and sales 
in the first 10 months of the year were up 4.7 percent over last 
year. A discount chain store reports that October sales were 1 
percent lower than a year ago and an appliance retailer reports no 
change in sales over the same period. Retailers in North Dakota, 
Montana, northern Minnesota, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula report 
strong sales to Canadian shoppers. Throughout the district, 
inventories are reported to be at acceptable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car and truck sales have been sluggish lately. Dealers report 
that truck sales in early November were about 7 percent lower than a 
year ago. Reports of new car sales range from a 2 percent increase 
to a 15 percent decrease over the same period. Automobile dealers 
report that they expect sales in the first quarter of 1991 to be 
about 1 percent lower than the first quarter of this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing starts have continued to decline in Minnesota. The number of 
new housing permits issued in that state was 8 percent lower this 
September than last. This decline was concentrated in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area where the number of new 
housing permits declined by 12 percent over the same period. Sales 
of existing houses in this metropolitan area had been holding up 
well earlier in the year but fell by 34 percent this October from 
last October. Housing activity elsewhere in the district has been 
moderately good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist spending has been fairly strong, especially in areas near 
the Canadian border. Thus far this year, Canadians have reportedly 
made over 700,000 trips to North Dakota-a number which exceeds the 
population of that state. The number of tourists visiting Mount 
Rushmore in South Dakota was about 4 percent higher this year than 
last. The city of Deadwood, South Dakota, has grown explosively ever 
since legalized gambling was introduced about a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the district's construction industry have rebounded 
recently. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, the dollar 
volume of contracts for future construction had been substantially 
below 1989 levels but rose sharply in September when it was 35 
percent higher than in September 1989. However, it is expected that 
construction activity in this area will decline in the coming 
months. Elsewhere in the district, construction activity has been 
moderately good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the district's manufacturing industries have been 
mixed lately. The computer and electronics industries have continued 
to be in very poor shape and suppliers to housing construction 
report slow sales. However, aircraft industry suppliers and the 
medical instruments industry have been growing rapidly. 
Manufacturers generally report strong export demand, especially for 
capital goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's resource-related industries appear to be fairly 
healthy. Agriculture appears to be in good shape. Crop yields 
throughout the district have been excellent. There was very little 
rain in the district this fall which helped farmers dry their fall 
harvest. However, the lack of rain has also raised concerns about a 
possible drought next year. Good crop yields have been offset by a 
fall in prices of farm products so that farmers' incomes are not 
much changed from last year. However, farmers' balance sheets are 
reported to be fairly healthy and farmland values are reported to be 
rising fairly rapidly. Livestock ranchers report that this year has 
been the best in their experience. The mining industry has also been 
doing well. Oil exploration has been picking up recently, especially 
near proven fields.
