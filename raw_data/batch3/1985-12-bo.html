      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The First District economy appears to be in a holding pattern. While 
retail sales continue to exceed year ago levels, increases have been 
below plan in some cases. Retailers are anxious about the critical 
Christmas period. Manufacturing respondents report that sales are 
flat, continuing the experience of the past five or six months. One 
significant change has been a falling off in the demand for products 
associated with non-residential construction. Price increases are 
said to be negligible. Manufacturers expect 1986 to be very similar 
to 1985. The First District real estate market is healthy, but 
entering a seasonal slowdown. Listings fall short of demand for most 
realtors contacted. However, the market for condominiums is said to 
be saturated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the First District report that sales in October 
exceeded those in October 1984 by 4 to 17 percent; but for several 
contacts increases were smaller than expected. Merchants attribute 
their somewhat disappointing performance to a lack of consumer 
enthusiasm, which they fear will also affect November and December 
results. However, very early and incomplete November figures show 
sales for some merchants exceeding plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Areas of strength in October included video computers, other home 
electronics, toys, records and tapes, high quality ladies' 
sportswear, and women's accessories. Furniture was weak. The 
atmosphere is highly competitive, although the prices of high 
quality items are said to be holding up fairly well. Substantial 
markdowns have affected margins for some respondents.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are reported to be at or below planned levels, except 
for one retailer that "over-reacted" to short supplies in the last 
Christmas season. In spite of favorable current positions, several 
chains said sizable inventory reduction sales were likely in 
January, given the current outlook for Christmas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers are increasing staff as usual for the Christmas season. 
Some reported that low unemployment rates have forced them to offer 
recruiting incentives to current employees, raise wages, or reduce 
the quality of their new hires in order to staff up. None of these 
adjustments is said to pose serious problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Uncertainty about the volume of Christmas season sales is pervasive, 
although everyone expects sales to grow. According to one contact, 
"we're holding our breath and hoping for the best."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the First District is flat to down. Most 
respondents report that sales are about the same as a year ago or 
slightly lower; this situation has persisted for some months. One 
contact reports that the auto industry's demand for materials and 
components is quite strong but attributes this strength to Detroit's 
ambitious production plans for the fourth quarter and questions 
whether the strength will persist. Another contact, a manufacturer 
of electrical equipment, reports a softening in sales to the auto 
industry. Demand for housing related products is said to be strong 
but flat. Demand for products related to nonresidential 
construction, which had been strong, has recently weakened. Sales of 
a variety of capital goods are disappointing for this stage in an 
expansion. Several firms report that overseas subsidiaries are 
experiencing stronger sales than domestic operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small layoffs have recently occurred at some high technology firms. 
However, most of the firms contacted have adjusted to current 
activity levels and can continue without further cutbacks in 
personnel. Although one respondent will be increasing capital 
spending substantially in 1986, most are reducing expenditures. Most 
contacts face heavy price competition and have been unable to raise 
their prices; large firms, in turn, are refusing to accept increases 
from suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      First District manufacturers expect 1986 to be a difficult year. 
While most think their own firms' performance will be about the same 
as in 1985, they seem to have revised downward their expectations 
for the economy as a whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The New England residential real estate market remains healthy 
despite the start of a seasonal slowdown. Price movements are mixed. 
While Boston agents claim that prices are stabilizing, agents in 
other parts of the region report that prices are still climbing. 
Listings, as reported by most, are short of demand. Multi-family 
buildings, in which a family lives in one unit and rents out the 
others, are especially popular. More people are buying lots with 
intentions of later building, as they see appreciation rates out-
running building costs. Condominiums have become less popular. The 
condominium market is said to be saturated; as prices approach those 
of free standing homes, buyers are opting for the latter. Tighter 
mortgage qualification standards may be hurting some potential 
buyers, particularly first timers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       New England Economic Project Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The New England Economic Project (NEEP), a non-profit corporation 
comprised of New England business firms, government agencies and 
educational institutions has just released its semi-annual forecast 
for the New England economy. The forecast is based on state models 
developed by a local-area consulting firm and managed by NEEP 
representatives.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the NEEP forecast, New England's employment growth will 
be considerably slower in 1986 than in the past two years. Even so, 
growth is expected to be sufficient to maintain the region's 
unemployment rate at its current level of roughly 4 1/2 percent. New 
England's growth will also continue to surpass the nation's.
     </p>
     <p>
      All of New England's employment growth in 1986 will come from the 
nonmanufacturing sector. Services, trade and finance will continue 
to expand at healthy rates. Construction employment, on the other 
hand, is forecast to level off. Manufacturing employment will be 
flat, with little change expected for most individual manufacturing 
industries.
