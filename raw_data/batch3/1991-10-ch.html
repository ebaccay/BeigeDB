      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Underlying trends in the District economy have changed little over 
the past month, according to most contacts, although continued 
sluggishness in consumer demand has led to some slowing in the pace 
of recovery in industrial activity. Manufacturers generally 
continued to provide an important contribution to District growth, 
but several contacts stated that auto production gains could slow in 
the fourth quarter if car sales growth does not improve. District 
commercial and industrial loan demand remained soft, in part due to 
moderate requirements for inventory financing. The agricultural 
harvest is proceeding rapidly, and harvest estimates have been 
raised recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts indicate that consumer spending gains remained 
sluggish in September and early October, with dollar sales depressed 
by intense price competition. A large general merchandise chain 
reported continued flat sales and stated that there was little sign 
of a recovery in consumer spending. A retailers' association in 
Indiana stated that its membership's sales growth generally remains 
flat, while losses from bad checks have not improved significantly. 
A retailing analyst reported that consumer caution has slowed 
spending growth in Iowa to the rate seen nationally, despite 
relatively high levels of consumer resources. Citing longer car 
holding periods, a retailers' association in Michigan stated that 
vehicle service stores were doing relatively well. After consistent 
year-over-year declines in sales over the summer months, a large 
department store chain reported that sales in early October were 
running slightly ahead of last year, but the year-ago comparison was 
against the period when sales began to be impacted by the recession. 
Sales for the rest of the year are expected to be flat with a year 
ago, according to this contact. A market research firm reported that 
Christmas purchasing plans dropped from August to September, 
reaching a level below the weak year-earlier period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Disappointing new car sales growth could temper the production gains 
being experienced in the Districts auto industry. Several industry 
analysts noted that September sales rates benefited from strong 
fleet sales, and fleet sales are expected to run through November. 
An industry economist reported that car demand from individuals had 
improved somewhat early in the summer, but slipped a little in 
recent months. Current car and light truck production plans for the 
fourth quarter imply a small gain from the third quarter on a 
seasonally adjusted basis, and a small decline in the first quarter 
of 1992, according to one economist. An auto parts supplier remained 
apprehensive about the first half of 1992 in the absence of an 
increase in car sales rates, although several analysts anticipated 
increasingly aggressive incentive programs in coming months. A 
finance subsidiary of a large automaker reported continued growth in 
lending, citing a pullback from banks in financing consumer 
purchases and dealers' inventory. Delinquency rates have caused some 
"severe heartburn" for many lenders, according to this contact, 
leading to higher down payments and generally stricter scrutiny of 
the marginal borrower. However, one industry economist reported that 
the overall loan turndown rate generally has declined since the 
first quarter. Because dealer inventory commitments remain very 
cautious, financing inventory hasn't been a difficult problem for 
most dealers, according to this contact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity generally continued to boost the overall 
District economy in recent weeks. The most recent purchasing 
managers' surveys for Chicago, Detroit, Western Michigan, Milwaukee 
and Indianapolis each showed a majority of respondents indicating 
expansion in orders and production, although some slowing in the 
pace was indicated in the Chicago survey. A large steel producer 
reported that the auto industry continued to provide the major 
source of strength in demand. Steel industry production is expected 
to continue to expand from the third to fourth quarter (on a 
seasonally adjusted basis) under conservative assumptions about 
shipments to the auto industry, according to this contact. A large 
manufacturer of a wide variety of specialty supplies reported that 
sales in most product lines remain flat, and that sales of a product 
that has historically been a leading indicator has yet to show an 
upturn. A supplier to District manufacturers of metal furniture 
stated that sales by these firms appeared to have passed their 
trough, after a difficult period. Sales of construction machinery in 
the District began to slump again in early August, according to an 
industry analyst, after a slow recovery earlier in the year. Year-
to-date construction machinery sales in the District are still below 
last year's levels, but the decline has not been so severe as in the 
nation as a whole. A large shipper stated that overseas shipments of 
agricultural and construction machinery continued to expand over the 
summer months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most banks reported that commercial and industrial loan demand 
remained soft in recent weeks, with several indicating that most 
customers remain unwilling to commit to inventories. One middle-
market lender reported that loan demand is generally slow, and 
stated that customer optimism has been waning since a recovery in 
the summer. Capital spending project cancellations have begun to 
arise, according to this contact, joining the continuing reports of 
postponements. A middle-market lender to businesses located 
throughout the Midwest could not identify a commercial or industrial 
sector where customers had seen a significant upturn in activity.
This banker stated that most customers linked to the auto industry 
continued to expect some small improvement in sales over the rest of 
the year, but these expectations had weakened over the past 60 days. 
Several banks reported that commercial and industrial loan demand in 
Michigan remained soft, and one contact expressed concern about the 
state's prospects in the absence of a solid recovery in auto sales. 
However, one banker reported that several banks in the state were 
"fully loaned" and were eager to sell participations. A recent 
survey indicated that firms in the Great Lakes and Pacific regions 
report the least difficulty in obtaining credit among firms surveyed 
nationwide, and the survey's directors stated that the survey 
results show that credit has been easier to obtain during the recent 
recession than in prior recessions. Residential mortgage loan demand 
in the District remained a bright spot, according to one contact, as 
mortgage rates continued to decline around the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District harvest is progressing rapidly. The corn and soybean 
harvest ranges from 25 percent complete in Michigan and Wisconsin to 
75 percent in Illinois. Except for Iowa, the harvesting progress is 
double the normal completion rate for early October. Yields are 
proving much better than expected in many areas, despite a premature 
killing frost in September. The corn and soybean production 
estimates for District states were revised upward by 4 and 6 
percent, respectively, in the USDA projections released on October 
10. The soybean harvest is now expected to match that of a year ago, 
both in District states and nationwide. Corn production is expected 
to be down 10 percent in District states and down 6 percent 
nationwide.
