      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The southeastern economy continues to grow modestly. A few new 
reports of weakness were received. They were mostly related to the 
construction industry, which, with the exception of the industrial 
building sector, has been sluggish for much of the year. Capital 
spending and capacity expansion continues in industries related to 
chemicals, metals, paper and lumber, and industrial equipment. 
Retailers expect good sales of consumer nondurables in the weeks 
ahead, and inventories are reported to be leaner this year than 
last. Weakness in purchases of consumer durables like appliances, 
autos, and furniture continues. Commercial lending is down, although 
there are still signs of strength in some types of consumer 
spending. Our contacts continue to report only mild wage and price
increases and a few scattered shortages of skilled workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts report subdued wage increases and softness in input 
prices. No signs of new wage pressures were reported. Employers 
continue to note steeply rising costs of benefits, most notably 
employee health insurance. Few contacts thought that their labor 
market had changed much from last year, although some reports of 
difficulty in finding skilled workers surfaced. Several industrial 
contacts commented that finding skilled employees like mechanical 
and software engineers has been troublesome. Increasing demand for 
such employees was cited as contributing to the difficulty. A banker 
in Atlanta noted that positions like accountant and account analyst 
have been difficult to fill recently, although finding clerks and 
tellers has been relatively easy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Input prices have been reported to be mostly stable or falling in 
some instances. Construction materials prices do not appear to be 
under pressure. Building materials prices are expected to remain 
stable or decline until construction picks up. A producer of wood 
building materials says that the price pressures usually seen this 
time of year are absent. Prices of metals like aluminum and copper 
are expected to remain stable into next year. Prices for 
communications equipment are also stable or declining. Several 
trucking firms have reported that freight rates have been falling 
owing to excess capacity in the industry. Even though volume is as 
good as in 1988, total revenue is down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of automobiles continue to be weak, and most dealers do not 
anticipate much improvement soon. Several furniture retailers have 
reported that sales continue to decline, as have several retailers 
of home appliances. Sales of carpet have also slowed recently as 
replacement and home remodeling demand has weakened. A number of 
Atlanta retailers have stated that sales in the last few weeks have 
been at least equal to last year's levels. They noted that consumer 
nondurables have been selling particularly well. However, retail 
sales in New Orleans and Baton Rouge have generally been reported to 
be slower than last year. Retailers in various parts of the region
added that sales after Thanksgiving posted double-digit increases 
over the same weekend a year ago. Most contacts report satisfaction 
with retail inventories that are flat to up moderately this year. 
They anticipate more price promotions to move their inventories 
during the Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Capital Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and office construction in the Southeast remain 
sluggish. Sales of existing homes have shown some strength recently, 
particularly in Jackson, Mississippi and New Orleans. Nonresidential 
construction is up from a year ago, however, because of continuing 
strength in industrial construction. New plans for several large 
chemical plants in Louisiana were announced recently. Construction 
of retail space in Nashville was also reported to be at record 
levels according to several contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spending on capital goods continues to hold up in the Southeast, 
although there have been a few reports of plans having been revised 
down recently. Much spending involves purchases of new equipment 
rather than capacity expansion. Producers of industrial pumps, 
fabricated aluminum, and processed food report plans to update older 
machinery. Several wood and pulp producers have announced plans to 
expand capacity because of strong overseas demand. A large producer 
of building materials, however, reports recent cuts in capital 
spending plans for 1990 by 50 percent. Their purchases of new 
equipment have been put on hold until construction activity picks 
up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several bankers in Georgia and Tennessee report that commercial loan 
demand is weak. Consumer lending, on the other hand, is reported to 
be slowing in some states. Several lenders pointed out that auto 
loans by banks are down substantially because of falling auto demand 
and because more and more people are using home equity loans to 
finance automobiles. Real estate and mortgage lending is down 
compared to last year, and a contact in Atlanta thought that 
mortgage demand in that market is at its worst since the early 
1980s. Several lenders added that lending standards have become much 
more strict for real estate loans in the last few months.
