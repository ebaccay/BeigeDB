      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent improvements are reported in economic activity and the 
economic outlook in the Tenth District, apart from the agricultural 
and energy sectors which remain depressed. General retail sales are 
improving and retailers are optimistic about the rest of 1986. Auto 
sales are weaker, however, and dealers expect lagging sales 
throughout the year. Both retailers and manufacturers' purchasing 
agents expect reduced inventory purchases. Housing activity is 
expected to remain strong, except for some soft local markets. Much 
of the increased mortgage demand is for refinancing. Loan demand at 
commercial banks remains mixed, and deposits are higher. 
Agricultural lenders report somewhat tighter credit conditions than 
a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for retail sales and prices is generally positive. 
Retailers report that sales remain higher than a year ago and 
recently have been improving. Sales of men's and women's apparel 
were particularly strong over the last three months. Retailers are 
optimistic that sales will stay above year-ago levels. Prices have 
been steady and are expected to change little over the rest of the 
year. Because inventory levels range from satisfactory to high, 
leading retailers expect steady to slightly reduced inventory 
purchases for the reminder of 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales typically are down compared with a year ago. Although 
financing is readily available, favorable credit conditions have not 
stimulated sales. Most dealers report their inventory levels are 
acceptable to slightly high. Dealers expect that automobile sales 
will continue to lag behind 1985 levels throughout the remainder of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most purchasing agents have seen little or no change in the prices 
of their major inputs compared with a year earlier. Moreover, no 
substantial price changes are expected for the remainder of 1986. 
Most firms have been trimming their materials inventory levels and 
plan to continue this process through the rest of the year. 
Purchasing agents generally are experiencing no problem with the 
availability or delivery of materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District housing activity varies widely depending on the 
strength of the local markets. In some areas experiencing economic 
hardships, the demand for new houses has dropped dramatically and is 
expected to remain at a low level for the rest of the year. However, 
homebuilders in most areas report that starts of single-family 
dwellings have increased over the year-ago period, while multi-family starts have declined. These builders expect that housing 
starts will remain relatively strong over the rest of this year. 
Builders report good availability of housing materials and no 
delivery problems. Most materials prices are steady, though some 
builders are encountering higher lumber prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan institutions have experienced reduced savings 
inflows relative to a year earlier, but give mixed reports about 
their expectations for the months ahead. Mortgage activity continues 
to increase mainly because of the strong demand for refinancing. In 
areas where homes are selling, mortgage demand is expected to 
increase further over the next few months. Mortgage rates have been 
declining along with rates nationwide. Most respondents expect 
mortgage rates to fall a little more but feel that increases could 
occur later in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The downward slide in crude oil prices and a persistent surplus of 
natural gas have led to lower exploration, development, and 
production activity in the Tenth District. The average weekly number 
of operating drilling rigs fell from 550 in January to 327 in March. 
Production from high-cost stripper wells has been curtailed and 
substantial further cuts are expected if crude oil prices remain in 
the $12 to $15 per barrel range.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For a second month in a row, total loan demand was mixed and total 
deposits were higher at Tenth District banks. Residential real 
estate loans were generally up while consumer loans were mixed and 
commercial and industrial loans, agricultural loans, and commercial 
real estate loans were constant to down. Roughly half of the bankers 
surveyed lowered their prime rate during the last month, and a 
majority expected further declines even before the latest discount 
rate cut. Nearly half of the respondents lowered their consumer loan 
rates during the last month and another half look for declines in 
the near future. Total deposits rose at Tenth District banks, with 
categories other than large CD's and passbook savings all generally 
registering gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A good winter wheat crop is reported throughout most of the Tenth 
District. Due to the relatively mild winter weather, the crop is 
progressing on schedule. But a fairly dry spring for many winter 
wheat regions may soon cause the crop to begin to show signs of 
stress. With the dry mild weather conditions, field work for 
planting other crops is running on schedule or ahead of schedule.
     </p>
     <p>
      District lenders are completing their spring loan arrangements. In 
some areas up to 10 percent of borrowers have been denied credit, 
though about 5 percent seems to be more representative. Even lenders 
not denying credit to clients report that conditions are somewhat 
tighter than last year, and the number of marginal borrowers is up 
from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      The dairy herd buy-out program has provoked strong emotional 
responses from cattlemen in the Tenth District. Weakened cattle 
prices are being blamed, wholly or in part, on the buy-out. Though 
bankers in a few areas report that cattle may have been withheld 
from the market in response to the lower prices, most indicate that 
markets have not been disrupted.
