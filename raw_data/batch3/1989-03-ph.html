      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from most sectors of the Third District economy in late 
February and early March suggest very moderate growth. Manufacturers 
are posting modest gains, with increases in shipments and orders, 
while employment is flat and order backlogs are edging down. 
Retailers say the first two months of the year ran about on plan, as 
dollar sales rose about 5-10 percent above last year's level. Auto 
dealers indicate that unit sales are running about even with the 
year-ago pace. Bankers report fairly steady growth in lending. but 
note that deposit growth is slipping.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus outlook in the Third District business community is 
subdued. Manufacturers anticipate only steady activity over the next 
six months, although this is an improvement from January and 
February when they were forecasting a downturn. Retailers expect 
real sales this year to be around even with last year's results, but 
they say the spring season could be adversely affected by the early 
Easter. Auto dealers believe they can match last year's unit sales 
as long as interest rates hold steady or increase only "moderately.' 
Bankers foresee some easing in business loan demand over the next 
two quarters but they expect both consumer and real estate lending 
to stay on their growth trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Preliminary results of the Business Outlook Survey for March 
indicate that manufacturing activity in the Third District continues 
to gain slightly. Twenty-six percent of the survey participants 
responding in early March said their business was moving up from 
last month while 12 percent reported slower operations. Specific 
measures of industrial activity reflect this fractional growth. Area 
firms are booking more new orders than they did last month and they 
are stepping up shipments enough to work down order backlogs a bit. 
Inventories are level with last month. Employment shows only a 
little improvement as both payrolls and working hours are moving up 
just marginally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Survey respondents continue to report rising prices, although such 
indications do not appear to be as widespread this month as they 
have been for the past year. Nearly one-half of the firms polled for 
the March survey are paying higher prices for purchased goods 
compared to a month ago and one-quarter are charging more for their 
own products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local manufacturers forecast only steady activity for the next six 
months, an improvement from the January and February surveys in 
which expectations of a downturn prevailed. The balance of responses 
to the most recent poll indicates that managers at area plants 
expect the rate of both new orders and shipments to be fairly flat 
for the next two quarters, and they anticipate a further decline in 
order backlogs. In accordance with these expectations, local firms' 
employment plans call for steady payrolls and some shortening of the 
workweek between now and September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers contacted in late February said that sales since the 
beginning of the year have been about even with plans, and that 
inventories remain under control. Growth in dollar sales are 
generally reported to have run 5-10 percent above last year for 
January and February. Discount merchants have achieved somewhat 
better results than other retailers, probably due to greater 
promotional efforts, according to store officials. Most retailers 
say apparel sales are showing some improvement after the slowdown of 
the past few years, and several merchants noted renewed consumer 
demand for hard goods and electronic items.
     </p>
     Retailers say the outlook is problematic. Store officials note that 
with an early Easter, such as this year's, consumers tend to do less 
holiday shopping while postponing purchases for warm-weather apparel 
and other merchandise, thus raising the possibility that sales for 
the spring season overall could be weak. Consequently, merchants do 
not expect to be able to get a clear reading on first half results 
until the spring season is well underway. Looking further ahead, the 
prospect is still unclear. Several merchants have noted unusually 
large day-to-day variations in sales in the past two months, and 
they interpret this as indicating a fragile edge to an apparently 
high level of consumer confidence. At this time, the most optimistic 
retailers generally expect real sales in 1989 as a whole to match 
those of 1988.
     <p>
      Third District automobile dealers report a pickup in sales in late 
January as manufacturers stepped up incentives in response to some 
mid-January slowness. Dealers believe that matching last year's rate 
of unit sales is possible this year as long as consumer Income 
remains strong and interest rates do not rise sharply. Nevertheless, 
dealers say their profit margins remain under pressure from rising 
costs and declining gross receipts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in February 
was approximately 13 percent above the year-ago level and bankers 
contacted in early March said this pace of growth was being 
generally maintained. Some bankers noted a slowing of growth in 
consumer loans, including home equity credit lines, which they said 
is at least partially seasonal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the bankers contacted for this report anticipate an easing 
in the expansion of commercial and industrial lending as the year 
progresses. Although they do not foresee a substantial slackening in 
overall economic activity in the next two quarters, they do believe 
credit demand by businesses will ease. Most expect consumer and real 
estate lending to continue growing at their current rates through 
the greater part of this year and possibly beyond.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of growth in bank deposits continues on the slowing trend 
that began last November, according to Third District bankers. 
Demand deposits have fallen since the start of the year, and bankers 
say some of that money has been shifted into interest-bearing 
accounts. In order to maintain asset growth, some bankers say they 
are more likely to boost deposit rates to gather funds than to 
borrow in the money markets given the current interest rate 
differential. However, others believe the recent run-up in rates 
will be short-lived, and they will accept slower asset growth 
temporarily in anticipation of lower funding costs later this year.
