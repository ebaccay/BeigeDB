      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent reports on District developments have tended to be generally 
on the positive side. Retail sales were mixed during January, but 
showed some signs of improvement in February. Reports on upstate New 
York business conditions indicate a strong new orders picture and an 
optimistic outlook for 1989, but with indications of capacity 
pressures and rising input prices. Unemployment in the District 
continues below the national average, though the unemployment rate 
in New York State did rise on a year-to-year basis in January and 
employment growth in the District has been slower than in the nation 
as a whole. The demand for new housing remains generally weak in the 
District, but a slight increase in buyer interest has been noted 
recently and office leasing activity has picked up. Following the 
actions of major banks, small and medium-sized banks raised there 
prime lending rate a full percentage point in February.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales were mixed during January but respondents 
reported an improvement in February. The February upturn was 
primarily centered in home furnishings and men's and women's 
apparel, with retailers stating that the current fashions finally 
seem to have caught on. Year-to-year changes in January ranged from 
-4 percent to +3 percent, results which were below or on plan, while 
February gains were generally on plan at +4 percent to +8 percent. 
For one chain February marked the first time sales reached targeted 
levels in several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of major consumer electronics firms in the District found 
that during the 1988 Christmas season, stores posted strong over-
the-year gains of 20 to 30 percent, in sharp contrast to the past 
two years. Firms are cautiously optimistic about future demand 
since, at a recent trade show, a number of them commented about a 
shortage of televisions and VCRs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey—4.9 percent and 3.9 
percent, respectively, in January—remain lower than the national 
average. However, while the national rate declined by 0.4 percentage 
point between January 1989 and a year earlier, New York's rate rose 
0.5 percentage point and New Jersey's showed virtually no change. 
Over this same period, nonfarm employment growth in both New York 
and New Jersey was only about half as rapid as the national average, 
due in large part to sizable declines in manufacturing and in New 
York's banking and brokerage industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      The percentage of surveyed Buffalo purchasing managers reporting 
increased new orders rose in January to its highest level since late 
l987 while the percentage reporting higher input prices also showed 
a sharp rise. Elsewhere in western New York, 65 percent of the 
purchasing managers in Rochester's annual outlook survey anticipate 
an improvement in general business conditions during 1989 and 83 
percent expect their capacity utilization to top 90 percent this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among recent developments in the District, plans were announced to 
build a new police academy and a large middle income housing complex 
in the South Bronx. The complex is to include almost 300 units in 
new two-family homes on a 40-acre site now containing dilapidated 
and burned-out buildings. In the Buffalo area Du Pont will undertake 
a multimillion-dollar expansion of its plant and Ford Motor will 
make a major investment in new equipment at its stamping plant. 
Elsewhere, Crouse-Hinds approved a multimillion-dollar project to 
modernize its iron and aluminum foundries in Syracuse; and in 
Connecticut, the Stamford Urban Redevelopment Commission has chosen 
a builder for a large, mixed-use downtown project. As part of a plan 
to bring residents and nightlife to the city's center, it will 
include housing, restaurants, cinemas and medical office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for new homes continues weak in much of the District but a 
slight increase in buyer interest occurred in the New York 
metropolitan area, and builders are somewhat more optimistic about 
the outlook than they were earlier. With a heavy supply of homes for 
resale still remaining, more owners reportedly are lowering their 
prices. Some builders are doing the same while others are providing 
"extras" and maintaining stable prices. However, builders in western 
New York and some other upstate areas anticipate good housing demand 
following last year's strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity picked up further in recent weeks and 
several areas with relatively high vacancy rates report some 
improvement. Demand from tenants requiring small to mid-sized space 
was especially strong in midtown Manhattan while some renewed 
interest from securities and financial services firms was noted 
downtown. Leasing activity on Long Island and in Fairfield County 
has also been good and some observers state that the worst of the 
Fairfield overbuilding is now past. Office vacancy rates in 
Westchester and northern New Jersey have moved down as a result of 
virtually no new construction in the former and a slowdown in new 
undertakings in the latter. However, with almost 7 million square 
feet of new office space scheduled for completion this year in
midtown Manhattan and more than 2 million on Long Island, higher 
vacancy rates are expected there.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Following the actions of major banks, small and medium-sized banks 
in the Second District raised their prime lending rate a full 
percentage point in February-though several bankers stated that they 
had been surprised at the back-to-back increases by the major banks. 
Most reported that rates on adjustable rate mortgages tied to the 
prime reflected the full increase while fixed rate mortgages were up 
only twenty-five basis points. Despite the higher rates, demand for 
business loans is steady or growing. Hone mortgage loan demand is 
more sporadic with pockets of slowness. One banker did note that the 
mortgage market should not be greatly affected unless rates climbed 
to thirteen percent or more. In the deposits market, sharp increases 
in rates on certificates of deposit were cited, while rates on money 
market accounts were unchanged or slightly higher.
