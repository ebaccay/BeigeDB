      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continued strength in farm incomes and a modest improvement in the 
energy sector are helping to sustain slow growth in the Tenth 
District economy. High cattle and hog prices are the primary sources 
of strength in farm incomes, and higher oil prices are spurring 
exploration and development activity. Retail sales, including new 
auto sales, however, remain soft. Slow sales are leading both 
retailers and manufacturers to trim inventories. Despite slight 
declines in mortgage rates, new home sales and housing starts are 
weak. Loan demand at commercial banks decreased slightly last month, 
with much of the decline due to lower demand for residential 
construction loans and commercial real estate loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers report sales flat at best over the last year and 
over the last three months. One retailer noted that he would be 
thrilled if sales end up flat for the year. Sales strength is 
limited to a few categories of goods such as apparel and outdoor 
sporting goods. Sales of appliances and other big ticket items are 
generally weak. Most respondents are trimming high inventory levels 
and becoming more cautious about buying. One retailer remarked they 
were not ready for a recession because they were loaded with 
merchandise. While most respondents expect sales to be steady to 
moderately improved through the Christmas season, they also expect 
slower sales soon thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      New auto sales are flat to down in most district states. Potential 
buyers in some areas are having difficulty getting loans as lenders 
become more selective. Most dealers are trimming inventories in the 
expectation of weak sales, while still trying to maintain stocks of 
the new models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Apart from petroleum products and fuel surcharges, purchasing agents 
report only slightly higher input prices over the past three months. 
Prices are expected to increase modestly over the next three months. 
Agents report no difficulty in obtaining materials, and lead times 
continue to shorten. Most firms are trimming inventory levels due to 
lower than expected sales and continue to operate below full 
capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sharply higher oil prices have begun to spur exploration and 
development activity in the district. The average number of 
operating drilling rigs in district states increased from 305 in 
September to 325 in October, a level almost 7 percent higher than 
one year ago. Despite this improvement, uncertainty about the 
eventual outcome of the Middle East situation will moderate further 
gains in drilling activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing Activity and Finance
Housing starts are generally unchanged from last month, despite weak 
new home sales across the district. Expectations for sales are 
mixed, but starts are not expected to increase. Several builders 
report higher prices for wooden shingles and asphalt roofing. 
Availability of materials is not a problem, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on deposit flows from savings and loan respondents are 
mixed, with results often dependent on locality and business 
strategy. Mortgage demand is down and is expected to worsen due to 
seasonal factors and a weakening economy. Mortgage rates have 
declined slightly over the last month and are expected to fall 
further in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial bankers report total loan demand decreased slightly over 
the last month. Much of the decrease was due to a lower demand for 
residential construction loans and commercial real estate loans. 
Demands for commercial, consumer, and agricultural loans were 
steady, while home mortgage demand increased slightly over the last 
month. Bankers report credit standards for loan approval unchanged 
to somewhat tighter, with tighter standards generally due to a less 
favorable economic outlook and pressures on banks' capital 
positions. Respondents report no change in their prime rate over the 
last month, but several bankers expect their prime rate to fall in 
the near future. Although a few respondents reduced consumer loan 
rates recently, most did not change their consumer rates in the last 
month. Total bank deposits were stable to slightly lower over the 
last month. Demand deposits, money market deposit accounts, and 
small time deposits were stable to slightly down. NOW accounts and 
large certificates of deposit were unchanged, while IRAs and Keogh 
accounts showed some increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The harvest of most district crops is nearly complete, except for 
Oklahoma's cotton harvest. Corn, soybean, and milo yields were 
normal to slightly above normal in most of the district. Sugar beet, 
potato, and onion yields in northern Colorado were disappointing. In 
southwestern Oklahoma, peanut yields were excellent, and a large 
cotton crop is expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The district's winter wheat crop is generally in excellent 
condition. After an excessively dry planting season in much of the 
district, plentiful moisture and warm weather have given the new 
crop a boost.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop income prospects for district farmers have weakened in recent 
months, but livestock income prospects remain bright. Crop prices 
slumped as the fall harvest season neared completion. Higher oil 
prices promise to boost crop production expenses and have encouraged 
farmers to purchase fuel, fertilizers, and other petrochemicals 
earlier than normal. Crop income subsidies have been cut back in the 
new government farm program, and participation in the program by 
district farmers may decline. High cattle and hog prices, however, 
continue to bolster incomes for district livestock producers.
