      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakness in California continues to offset moderate growth in most 
other District states. In California, employment cutbacks continue 
in aerospace and defense-related manufacturing, construction, and 
trade. Holiday sales in California were characterized as flat to 
slightly improved, and the state's fiscal outlook remains troubled. 
Outside of California, moderate improvement is reported in several 
sectors, with the strongest conditions reported in eastern 
Washington, Utah, and Idaho. Holiday sales were characterized as 
moderate to strong in most of these areas. However, the Puget Sound 
area faces continued uncertainty in aerospace. Overall business 
sentiment has improved and recent rains have improved District 
agricultural prospects. Little upward pressure on prices is reported 
and wage increases are reported to be modest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sentiment among Twelfth District business leaders has improved since 
our last report. Over half of our respondents now expect the real 
economy to expand during the next four quarters at a rate of at 
least 2.5 percent. This proportion is up from one-third in November. 
An additional forty percent of our respondents expect real output to 
expand, but at a rate below 2.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little upward pressure on prices is reported by contacts in most 
District markets. Contacts report flat prices or downward pressure 
on prices for new cars, air fares, furniture, paper, and computers. 
Aluminum prices are reported as very soft. In Oregon, a contact 
reports that cold weather and the closure of a nuclear power plant 
is causing utilities to purchase replacement power and will result 
in a 10 to 14 percent rise in energy prices in 1993. Another 
contact, however, reports that the decline in manufacturing activity 
in southern California has resulted in a surplus of electric power, 
easing the short-term constraint in Oregon. Projections for wages in 
1993 range from flat conditions to 3 percent increases, with 
increases in the health care industry running higher than in other 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts from markets outside of California report good holiday 
sales, but lees robust conditions were reported within California. 
Strong sales were reported by contacts in Oregon, Washington, Utah, 
Idaho, and Arizona. A national retailer reported a 7 to 8 percent 
increase in sales in the Northwest. The same retailer, however, had 
only a 3 to 5 percent increase in California. Another contact in 
California termed retail sales as "disappointing" during the 
holidays, with little improvement seen over 1991. A contact in small 
business financing reports that sales were below expectations, and 
that many retailers are hurting in the San Francisco Bay area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the legal industry in California is termed weak, with 
several firms likely to contract employment in 1993. In addition, a 
telecommunications firm in California reported further deterioration 
in demand during November. The California governor has proposed 
significant cuts in aid to local governments in response so a 
continued state budget shortfall. The fiscal situation in Oregon is 
also uncertain, due to a property tax limitation and required 
increased spending for education. In Washington, the state has 
announced a budget deficit of $1.2 to $1.7 billion for the next 
budget cycle.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continues to contract as layoffs in 
aerospace and defense-related industries continue in southern 
California and Washington. A manufacturer in southern California 
describes conditions as very bad, with no improvement in sight and 
further layoffs anticipated by major employers. A contact in 
northern California reports that layoffs are still a great concern, 
and that many small manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see approach 
to buying. In the Puget Sound area, concern remains for additional 
layoffs in aerospace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other District manufacturing activity is showing some improvement. A 
contact in Oregon reports that electronics manufacturing is on the 
rebound. Orders for computer equipment also are reported strong for 
several categories, with foreign demand remaining brisk despite 
weakness in Japan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rains have improved the outlook for water supplies in many 
western states. The livestock industry is characterized as in fair 
to good shape, although the rain has hampered feed lots. Strong 
demand is reported in apple markets and rye grass seed. Wood product 
orders are firm, and inventory levels are low. In addition, western 
timber supplies are tight due to the lack of timber sales from 
public lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonresidential real sate and construction markets are reported to be 
weak in several District markets. One contact reports that in 
southern California hotel rates are declining due to increased room 
supply. Another contact in southern California reports that 
commercial rents and property values are depressed by high vacancy 
rates and continued employment losses. A contact from northern 
California reports that values of commercial buildings are falling--
some below replacement cost--and that rents of some buildings are 
just covering operating costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mixed conditions are reported in the residential sector. Housing 
prices in southern California continue to weaken and house prices 
also are reported softening in the Puget Sound area, particularly 
for more expensive houses. New house prices in Oregon are reported 
up 3 to 6 percent in smaller cities, with some lack of building lots 
reported due to financing constraints on developers. In Utah, 
housing price are rising and land adjacent to metropolitan areas is 
also increasing in value.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions at District financial institutions are reported as mixed. 
  Outside of California, contacts report some growth in loan demand 
  and deposits in Arizona, Utah, and Washington. In California, 
  contacts report that loan demand remains weak and that the volume of 
  outstanding loans continues to decline. Asset quality is reported 
  weak as well, although one contact reports that the pace of 
  deterioration has slowed recently. One contact reports that the 
  overall delinquency rate decreased for November. Some increased 
  demand is reported for residential mortgages and home equity lines 
  of credit.
