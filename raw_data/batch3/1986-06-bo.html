      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 24, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic imbalance that has characterized the First District 
economy for over a year continues, with manufacturers experiencing 
little or no growth while other sectors expand. Once again 
manufacturing respondents report that business is flat. The decline 
in the dollar has not yet had a clearly discernible effect on the 
firms contacted. Inventories and employment levels are viewed as a 
little high given current order rates. Retailers report mixed 
results for April and May, but more respondents were above plan than 
below. Retail inventories are up but contacts do not view this as a 
serious concern. Prices remain stable; few respondents have seen 
much increase in import prices. Retailers, even those with less than 
satisfactory sales growth in recent months, expect the second half 
of the year to be good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail results for April and May were mixed. Several department 
stores, both upscale and discount, were disappointed in their late 
spring sales, with sales in some stores and chains below those of a 
year earlier. (The year-earlier results, contacts noted, were 
unusually robust.) In one case, the month of May appears stronger 
than the preceding three months; in another, no pickup is yet 
evident. In contrast, other department stores, notably one targeted 
to low income consumers, reported sales "nicely" ahead of last year. 
Sales in hardware and home buildings supply outlets were uniformly 
buoyant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among product lines, results were similarly mixed. Hard lines, such 
as electronics and paint, are generally strong. Other items 
experiencing strong demand include outdoor footwear and expensive 
housewares, such as crystal. Apparel has performed poorly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are higher than last year, but are not, at present, a 
source of concern for the retailers contacted. In some stores, 
inventories have been intentionally increased to improve customer 
service or alter product mix. Although inventories are also high in 
stores with disappointing sales, most do not plan major price cuts 
or order slowdowns to reduce them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices are rising very moderately, in the 1-2 percent range. 
Merchants expect retail prices to remain well-behaved, with the 
effects of oil price reductions offsetting the declining value of 
the dollar; however, few have yet seen either oil-related cost 
reductions or rising import prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stores doing well expect the strength to continue through the 
balance of the year. Those with weak growth are not making major 
adjustments, confident that consumer demand will soon be back on 
track.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing respondents report that while orders are weakening in 
some areas and strengthening in others, the overall level of 
activity remains flat. General industrial demand for traditional 
machinery and fabricated metal products is slow and getting slower. 
Sales of a variety of automotive products, which had been strong, 
are also softening. One contact reports a slowing in sales to the 
industrial and commercial construction market. On the other hand, 
sales of appliances and home building supplies are doing well. The 
defense business remains very strong, with a couple of respondents 
experiencing increases. The commercial aerospace market is said to 
be strengthening.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several respondents noted that sales are stronger in Europe than in 
the United States. These reports referred to sales of subsidiary 
operations rather than exports. None of the firms contacted has 
experienced an improvement in business that he would attribute to 
the decline in the value of the dollar. Respondents in the 
traditional machinery and metals industries said that Japanese 
competitors had increased prices 5 - 6 percent; however, they did 
not think this was enough to change the competitive situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      One contact noted that prices for imported parts had increased. 
However, all respondents, including the one experiencing the 
increase in import prices, said that materials prices are not 
changing to any significant degree. Several commented on their 
inability to raise their own prices; one reported that an attempt to 
raise prices 2 percent on a commodity-type metal product was greeted 
with derision from customers. Respondents expect wage increases of 0 
to 4 1/2 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents consider employment and inventory levels to be a little 
high and will be taking modest corrective action. Plans call for 
capital spending to be higher in 1986 than in 1985, but a couple of 
larger respondents have got off to unexpectedly slow starts on their 
capital projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      While manufacturing respondents do not expect a downturn in the near 
future, they are concerned about a lack of vigor in the economy and 
they are puzzled by widespread forecasts of a strong second half of 
1986 when they see no evidence of any change.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       New England Economic Project Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The New England Economic Project (NEEP), a non-profit corporation 
comprised of New England business firms, government agencies and 
educational institutions has just released its semi-annual forecast 
for the New England economy. The forecast is based on state models 
developed by a local-area consulting firm and managed by NEEP 
members from each state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The NEEP forecast calls for employment growth in New England of just 
under 3 percent in 1986â€”about the same as in 1985â€”and 2 1/2 
percent in 1987. Growth should be sufficient to maintain an average 
unemployment rate in the region of close to 4 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      New England's growth in 1986 will depend, as it did in 1985, on the 
non-manufacturing sector, especially trade, services and the finance 
insurance and real estate group. Manufacturing employment, which 
declined throughout 1985, will stabilize in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      The NEEP expects growth in 1987 to be more balanced. Non-
manufacturing employment will grow more slowly. Construction 
employment is projected to slip a little from very high levels. 
Manufacturing employment, on the other hand, is expected to increase 
moderatelyâ€”in large part because of an improved trade situation. 
This pickup in manufacturing employment will be concentrated in high 
tech and in traditional metalworking and machinery.
