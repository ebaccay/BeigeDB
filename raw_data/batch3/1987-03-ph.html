      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 16, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District in March indicate that the regional 
economy is on an even keel. Manufacturers are operating at a steady 
rate, while retailers say that business has been good since the 
beginning of the year; many merchants indicate that sales are 
currently running above expectations. Automobile dealers report a 
pickup in sales early in March, after a slow start for the year. 
Bankers say business loan demand dropped in January but rose in the 
past month, while consumer lending has been growing steadily since 
the start of the year, bringing total loan volume outstanding in 
February about even with year-end 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus outlook in the Third District business community is 
positive. A majority of manufacturers predict expanding activity 
over the next six months, although they do not expect increasing 
orders to outstrip capacity. Retailers expect the current growth of 
sales to continue through the spring. Automobile dealers also 
predict continued improvement during the next few months. Bankers 
expect business loan demand to grow moderately throughout the year, 
in pace with continued economic expansion. They also expect consumer 
lending to be strong, with home equity loans adding significantly to 
growth in this category of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing
Preliminary results for the March Business Outlook Survey indicate 
that the gains posted by local industry in February have held, 
although the pace of activity has leveled off this month. Conditions 
are similar in both the durable goods and non-durable goods sectors. 
Overall, one-half of the companies participating in the March survey 
report no change in the pace of their operations from February, one-
fourth indicate improvement, and one-fourth report slower business. 
Specific measures of industrial activity are mixed, but indicate 
little change overall. New orders and shipments are up marginally, 
but order backlogs have eased slightly. Employment is steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices in the region are generally stable. Over 70 
percent of the firms polled in March say both input and output 
prices are unchanged from February. However, 22 percent report 
higher charges for the goods they purchase and 13 percent have 
raised the prices of their own products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, area manufacturers remain mostly positive, although 
optimistic sentiment is no more widespread now than it has been for 
the past year and a half. Forty-four percent of the March survey 
respondents predict improved business over the next six months and 
35 percent expect steady conditions; however, 20 percent anticipate 
slower business ahead. On balance, survey respondents expect gains 
in orders and shipments but no change in order backlogs. Local 
industrial firms' employment and capital spending plans call for 
little change over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that consumer spending has continued at a strong 
pace since Christmas. Sales in January and February were above sales 
in the same months of last year by more than 10 percent for many 
department and specialty stores. Discount stores posted more modest 
results. Most product lines are selling well, with apparel doing 
best and hard-goods sales relatively slower. Traditional Presidents 
Day sales were very successful for most stores. Retailers attribute 
the continued strength of sales to the region's healthy economy, but 
some merchants speculate that consumer spending may be getting a 
temporary boost because many individuals currently have higher take-
home pay than they did late last year due to delays in adjusting 
their payroll withholding to the levels required by the new tax law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers say their first quarter (February-April) should be very 
good, and they are optimistic that the current growth of sales will 
continue through spring. However, although their outlook for 1987 as 
a whole is positive, store officials say there could be a weakening 
in the second half. Merchants believe that higher tax liabilities 
will cause more affluent customers to cut back on discretionary 
spending, and that consumers will hold the line on financed 
purchases in any case, in order to bring their rising debt under 
control. In addition, some stores are tightening credit 
qualifications for their proprietary cards in response to rising 
delinquency rates, and, according to some retailers, proposed 
legislation to cap merchant credit card rates will likely result in 
even more restrictions on store credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers say that January and February have been slow, but 
they are seeing some pickup in sales in early March and are 
optimistic that sales this spring will be good. Dealers selling 
domestic cars say they have improved their competitive position 
against imports due to the dollar's decline, longer warranties on 
U.S. cars, and low finance rates. They expect manufacturers' 
financing programs to be a regular part of their marketing strategy 
from now on.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume at major Third District banks in late February was 
about even with the year-end 1986 level, and approximately 13 
percent above the level of a year ago. Lending officers say the lack 
of growth in total loans in the first two months of the year is due 
to an abnormal pattern of business borrowing, resulting from the 
movement of some normal January business into December due to 
changes in tax law. The drop was recouped in February, however, and 
bankers contacted in early March say they expect farther growth in 
commercial lending as economic expansion continues. Demand for 
fixed-rate business loans, in particular, is growing, and some banks 
are accommodating this demand, hedging interest rate risk through 
the use of interest rate swaps and financial futures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer loan volume has been growing at an annual rate of about 10 
percent since December. Banks offering home equity credit lines 
report strong growth in commitments as well as usage, with drawdowns 
of up to 50 percent. Although consolidation of credit card debt was 
significant in early use of home equity loans, bankers now say that 
consumers are using this form of borrowing for new debt, giving 
consumer installment lending a further boost.
