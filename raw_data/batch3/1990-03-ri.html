      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District economic activity was mixed in February as it was in 
January. Sales of most retail goods rose, but not sales of new cars. 
Tourism was lackluster. The manufacturing sector rebounded somewhat 
after its January decline although furniture production remained 
depressed. Exports increased at District ports and imports were 
mixed. The demand for business loans was down and lenders were more 
cautious about making real estate loans. The agricultural sector 
survived a cold snap with little damage to crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales of general merchandise rose in mid-February as compared 
with earlier in the month according to our regular mail survey; 
however, department stores reported that sales of big ticket items 
were flat. Most retailers expect sales to continue rising over the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to our telephone survey of automobile dealers and dealer 
associations, sales of new cars in February were below January and 
year-ago levels. Despite widespread manufacturer and dealer 
discounts, demand was depressed for all new models, foreign and 
domestic. Although new car sales were weak, nearly all car dealers 
said their inventories were now at comfortable levels. Some dealers 
said that sales of used cars were brisk.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts indicated that 
tourist activity this winter was about even with last winter's. Poor 
skiing conditions in some parts of the District were offset by good 
golf weather. Tourist areas throughout the District expect their 
business to be better than usual in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey of manufacturers, which registered declines 
in virtually all measures of manufacturing activity in January, 
indicated increases in shipments and new orders in February. 
Unfilled orders, employment, and the length of the workweek, 
however, were unchanged. Prices for raw materials rose at the same 
moderate pace reported in January. Inventories of materials and 
finished goods were largely unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to overall manufacturing activity, furniture output 
weakened further in February according to most of our respondents. 
Many plants shortened their workweeks, and at least two companies 
announced plant closings.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers, including furniture producers, remain 
optimistic about prospects for growth in their businesses and in the 
nation during the next six months. Respondents who look for 
increases in shipments, new orders, unfilled orders, employment, and 
the workweek outnumbered those who expect decreases. About 60 
percent expect their exports to increase in 1990 compared to the 
half who reported increases in 1989. Most of the producers believe 
national economic activity will expand or remain close to its 
current level over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives of the three major District ports -- Hampton Roads 
(Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimore -- indicated that export 
activity was higher in February than in January while import 
activity was mixed. Imports increased at Charleston, decreased at 
Baltimore, and remained unchanged at Hampton Roads. All three ports 
expect the volume of exports to increase more than the volume of 
imports over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The demand for commercial loans softened further in recent weeks 
according to executives of District financial institutions. A few 
respondents noted increases in the pace of business bankruptcies. 
Some indicated that certain retailers, such as automobile and boat 
dealers, faced financial difficulties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several business and financial executives called attention to the 
reduced supply of real estate loans. They said that pension funds 
and insurance companies had become more cautious in their lending 
for land development. They also said that many banks and thrifts had 
reduced or were seeking to reduce their real estate loan portfolios 
in order to increase other types of loans and investments and their 
capital. According to these executives, some of this increased 
caution in real estate lending is warranted in light of overbuilding 
in many urban areas, but some viable development projects cannot 
proceed because of a lack of financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent cold snap, which ended almost two months of unseasonably 
warm weather, caused little damage to District crops. Apple trees 
lost some blooms, but not enough to reduce production. Peach trees 
were almost fully in bloom and suffered some damage in northern 
parts of the District, but most orchards are located farther south 
and escaped the brunt of the cold. Some damage also occurred to 
blueberry and ornamental crops. Winter wheat growth has been far 
ahead of normal and suffered no damage from the cold.
