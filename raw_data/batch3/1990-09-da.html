      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 19, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy continues to grow slowly. Orders for 
manufactured goods have shown little overall change. Retail sales 
have recently slowed. Auto sales slowed in early August but have 
since improved. Economic activity has increased in the service 
sector. The construction sector continues a mild improvement. Higher 
oil prices are stimulating increased production from existing wells 
but have not yet motivated new drilling. Recent rains have improved 
conditions for District farmers and ranchers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, manufacturing production and orders have not changed 
significantly during the past month, although orders for 
construction-related products have declined. Manufacturing 
inventories generally are at desired levels. Most respondents are 
concerned about the outlook for the U.S. economy now that oil prices 
have risen. Also, many industries are concerned about higher 
transportation costs due to the jump in oil prices. One food 
wholesaler is already planning to curtail costs by reducing 
deliveries from five to four per week. Recent oil price increases 
have had only a small effect on the demand for oil field machinery 
but respondents expect strong gains next year if oil prices remain
high. Chemical producers say that product demand remains strong and 
they are switching feedstocks to reduce the impact of rising oil 
prices. Orders and production continue strong in the petroleum 
refining industry and producers are increasing product prices in 
line with crude costs. Refiners say that they have not experienced 
any shortages of oil. Steel production continues at high rates due 
to declines in imports, and producers continue to be optimistic 
about demand in the near future. Primary metal producers in the 
District generally say that oil is not a significant energy source 
in their production process. Respondents in the apparel industry 
note a mild increase in sales and are cautiously optimistic about 
the next few months. For electronics producers, orders generally 
remain weak but several noted that sales to the telecommunications 
industry are strong. Demand for fabricated metals remains soft. 
Among stone, clay, and glass producers, a glass producer says sales 
have decreased significantly and a producer of concrete pipe notes a 
gradual slowing. Lumber and wood products producers say that demand 
from home builders has declined but one producer noted an increase 
in demand from lumber yards.
     </p>
     <p>
      District retail sales have slowed significantly over the last few 
weeks. Respondents feel that uncertainty about problems in the 
Middle East has caused consumers to hold back purchases. Weakness is 
widespread across most product lines but respondents note a 
particular softness in durable goods. Discount stores continue to 
experience slightly stronger sales than other retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      District auto sales increased moderately in July. Sales growth was 
strong in the Houston area and mild in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. 
Sales flattened in the first two weeks of August but picked up 
slightly during the second half of the month. Respondents note no 
increase in the relative demand for fuel-efficient vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the District service sector has increased. Temporary 
employment agencies say that demand is increasing strongly. A 
respondent in San Antonio said much of the demand is from firms 
which are reluctant to hire full time workers because the economy is 
slow. An accounting firm says that activity has picked up due to 
demand from the Resolution Trust Corporation. Consulting firms note 
continued increases in the demand for office automation and 
management services. An increase in economic activity in Austin and 
Houston has created a slight increase in demand for legal services.
     </p>
     <p>
      District construction activity continues to grow slowly. Most of the 
recent growth stems from increased residential construction in 
Texas. Single and multifamily building permits have increased. 
District nonresidential and nonbuilding construction remain weak. 
Nonresidential contract values are up but remain below levels 
reached last year. Respondents do not expect an upturn in commercial 
and industrial construction for at least another year. Nonbuilding 
contract values have fallen and respondents note that expenditures 
on state highways should continue to decrease in Texas but increase 
in Louisiana.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent gains in the oil price have not stimulated new drilling. The 
District drilling rig count declined in July and August. Respondents 
in the energy industry say that they are uncertain about what price 
will be sustained. Production from existing wells should increase, 
though, as increased revenues are used to upgrade old wells and 
reopen dormant wells. Most of the work will be done on stripper 
wells which produce less than ten barrels of oil per day. Some 
enhanced recovery procedures have also become profitable. Production 
should increase about 1.1 percent due to the lifting of production 
ceilings by the Texas Railroad Commission. One respondent noted that 
about half of the current drilling is for natural gas which has not 
yet increased in price.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent rainfall has improved conditions for District farmers and 
ranchers, although some dryland cotton and corn crops were already 
destroyed. Ranges and pastures have improved significantly in many 
areas. August prices received by Texas farmers and ranchers 
increased 7 percent from last year and 2 percent from July. Rice 
prices continue to drop and are now 9 percent below a year earlier. 
Rice prices are expected to remain depressed until mills find 
alternatives to their Iraqi customers.
