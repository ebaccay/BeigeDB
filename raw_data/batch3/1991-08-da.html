      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Eleventh District is increasing very 
slowly. Output growth weakened in June but began showing signs of 
strength by the end of July. Many respondents noted that stiff 
competition had reduced prices and depressed profits. Firms in the 
Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex generally reported weaker sales than in 
the rest of the District. Department store sales have increased 
slightly, but auto sales are down sharply from last year. Service-sector growth is reported to be weak. Manufacturing orders have 
slowed but continue to increase. Energy activity has been flat. 
Construction activity has been growing very slowly, but has exceeded 
respondents' expectations. One exception is commercial construction, 
where activity remains weak. Agricultural conditions are good, but 
price declines, lower government payments and rising costs will 
lower income this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output in the service sector has increased only slightly since the 
last survey. Most industries report that competition has caused 
downward pressure on prices. More recently, respondents have noted 
some increases in demand and further evidence that demand will pick 
up. Demand for business services had been flat until recently, when 
there were some increases outside Dallas-Fort Worth. Engineering 
firms reported a modest increase in contracts resulting mostly from 
changes in state laws. Transportation and temporary employment 
agencies also reported slow growth. The rate of growth of government 
employment has been slowing, with some local governments reporting 
layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth in retail sales slowed in June but shows signs of picking up 
in July. Year-to-date sales are even or just above last year, in 
real terms. Discount retailers noted that their purchase prices have 
been moving up faster than their selling prices. This, along with 
recent increases in the minimum wage, has raised costs and reduced 
profits. Sales of home furnishings remain slow, but clothing sales 
are increasing and seasonal merchandise is selling well. Dallas area 
sales growth generally is the weakest in the District but about even 
with the nation. In Houston, sales growth has slowed but is still 
increasing moderately. June auto sales fell nearly 20 percent in 
both Houston and Dallas. Year-to-date auto sales are 10 percent 
below last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, growth in orders to District manufacturers has slowed, but 
orders continue to increase. The electronics industry experienced a 
seasonal drop in demand, although demand remains above last year's 
level. The increased demand has mostly been in the high-end of the 
industry-especially the 386 microprocessor-and production capacity 
for these high-end chips has been increased. Chemical demand has 
stabilized following declines in the first part of the year. The 
slow national economy continues to limit demand for chemicals used 
to make plastics, and inventories were reported to be up slightly. 
Selling prices for these chemicals continue to fall, although the 
decline has slowed. Input prices are flat and profits are down.
Sales of primary metals have increased mildly, but prices have 
declined. Meanwhile, a stronger dollar has reduced foreign sales. 
Demand for glass products is up seasonally but prices are very low. 
Demand for fabricated metals continues to decrease, mostly because 
of a lack of building within the region. Both selling prices and 
input prices are declining. Demand for lumber products stabilized 
after both demand and prices picked up briefly following wet weather 
in March and April. Respondents expected demand to remain flat 
throughout the year. Demand for paper products is below a year ago. 
Demand for oil field machinery has recently declined and is now 
about even with last year. Low natural gas prices have reduced 
demand for oil field equipment, but foreign demand and chemical 
plant construction have mitigated the decline. Demand for apparel 
has increased, particularly for denim products and dresses.
     </p>
     <p>
      District oil and gas activity has been flat. West Texas Intermediate 
prices have been relatively stable, ranging from $20 to $22 per 
barrel in the past six months. Natural gas prices, on the other 
hand, are at their lowest level in 12 years. Overall, the District 
rig count has fallen, mainly because of decreases in gas rigs. Wet 
weather has been a problem in Louisiana. Energy firms are downsizing 
and consolidating, and several firms have announced layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      District construction activity is slow but better than respondents 
had expected. Residential demand has held steady despite defense-
related layoffs in some areas. Home sales may have been spurred in 
June by the announcement of a July 1 increase in FHA mortgage 
insurance premiums. Multi-family demand is slow, although rents have 
increased. Office and industrial vacancy rates have increased in 
several District cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents report good District agricultural conditions, although 
low prices and rising expenses will reduce income. Good yield 
prospects, along with slow domestic and export demand, have reduced 
most commodity prices. Rice prices, however, remain high because of 
strong world demand and poor yields. Livestock prices have declined 
4 percent from last year but remain strong. The peach harvest is the 
best in several years.
