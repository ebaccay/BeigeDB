      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Third District business contacts in early June 
indicated that regional economic activity was essentially steady 
overall, although conditions varied by sector. Manufacturers 
generally noted continuing improvement, while retailers indicated 
business was only steady, and bankers reported continuing slackness 
in loan demand. On balance, industrial firms in the district were 
posting gains in shipments and orders in late May, and they were 
maintaining steady employment levels. Retailers gave mixed reports: 
discount stores were making year-over-year gains and seasonal 
merchandise was generally selling well, but total sales in May 
appeared to just match the May 1990 level, in dollar terms. Bankers 
said business and consumer loan volumes outstanding were slipping 
while residential mortgage lending was edging up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations among business contacts are generally positive although 
the level of optimism is not high overall. Manufacturers forecast a 
relatively solid improvement during the balance of the year and they 
are making plans to step up hiring and capital spending. Retailers, 
however, anticipate that real sales in the second half will be just 
even with the year-ago period. Bankers generally forecast a slow 
upturn in loan demand in the second half. They expect slight gains 
in consumer and residential lending, and, while they believe an 
increase in loans to business may be ahead, they do not foresee a 
rebound in commercial real estate lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District manufacturers contacted in late May and 
early June indicated that activity was picking up in most of the 
major industries in the region. Although half of the firms queried 
said shipments were running at just a steady pace, one-third noted 
recent increases. One-third of the manufacturers polled also 
reported that new orders have risen in recent weeks. Although demand 
for their goods appeared to be growing, most of the industrial 
companies in the region were not adding to payrolls or extending the 
workweek.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, most Third District manufacturers providing 
information for this report expect business to continue to improve 
this year. On the whole, they foresee healthy gains in orders and 
shipments. Managers at area plants indicated they intend to act on 
their optimism; one-third plan to add to their work forces and 
nearly half will step up capital spending over the next two 
quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally described May and early June 
sales as lackluster, although some said summer clothing and other 
seasonal goods sold well during a period of unusually hot weather. 
Overall, reports from store officials indicated that current dollar 
sales in recent weeks were even with the same period a year ago. 
Several discount and off-price stores, however, made year-over-year 
gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the merchants contacted for this report believe the sales 
trend over the summer will be flat in real terms. They are somewhat 
apprehensive about the fall, and several voiced concerns that 
consumers will not step up spending sharply even when the economy 
moves out of the current recession. They point to the possibility of 
growing restraint in consumer spending as a negative influence on 
retail sales growth in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the Third District reported that new car sales have 
been declining since March, both in unit and dollar terms. Some 
dealers said that potential buyers' reluctance to add significantly 
to debt loads while the economic outlook remains uncertain was 
depressing demand for new cars. In contrast, used car sales have 
been relatively healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers contacted in early June indicated that 
lending activity was soft; most reported that loan demand was weak 
in all credit categories. On the basis of these reports it appeared 
that total loan volume outstanding was declining. Although 
residential mortgage lending was expanding, albeit slowly, business 
and consumer lending was declining. In particular, several bankers 
noted that auto and credit card loan volumes outstanding were 
falling at their institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the bankers who offered forecasts said they expect a slow 
economic recovery to start in the third or fourth quarter, setting 
the stage for an upturn in loan demand. However, most bankers expect 
only sluggish growth in lending when the recession ends. They 
believe consumers will not increase spending quickly and that 
residential real estate activity will not pickup appreciably from 
the current pace. As for business lending, the general opinion among 
Third District bankers is that commercial real estate lending will 
remain depressed through this year and next; and, although several 
bankers noted that their regular business borrowers are considering 
requesting additional credit, they said that loan applications have 
not increased yet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bank executives generally indicated that funding was 
adequate given the slackness in loan demand. Total deposits at banks 
in the district have been declining, according to bankers, as 
interest rates have eased. Money market deposit account balances 
have been steady, however, and bankers believe depositors are 
favoring these liquid accounts as rates on time deposits have 
fallen.
