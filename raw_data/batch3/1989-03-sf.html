      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business contacts in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District indicate 
that economic conditions continue to be healthy, with little 
evidence to suggest that the overall pace of growth is slowing. 
Expectations regarding GNP growth rebounded in March, with only a 
third of respondents now expecting weaker growth during the next 
twelve months. Consumer spending on soft goods has improved in 
recent weeks, although car sales have been sluggish. Manufacturing 
activity continues healthy in most manufacturing sectors, with 
commercial aircraft particularly strong and mixed news coming from 
electronics and defense firms. Resource industries are stable, but 
limited log supplies are constraining growth in the forest products 
industries. Cold and dry weather has generated concern among 
farmers. Most of the District enjoys healthy construction and real 
estate conditions, although reports from local observers suggest 
that the rate of growth may be slowing. Earnings of Twelfth District 
banks rose to record levels in 1988, but some bankers are concerned 
that narrowing interest margins and lackluster loan demand may cut 
into 1989 profits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents expectations regarding GNP growth rebounded in March. 
Only 32 percent anticipate weakening during the next year, down from 
70 percent in January. Expectations regarding business investment 
are unchanged, while the prospects for housing and consumer spending 
seem to have improved. Respondents are less optimistic about 
improvements in the trade deficit, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Department store sales have improved, primarily due to gains in 
women's fashions. Sales currently are running 5 to 6 percent above 
year-ago levels. Reports suggest that higher interest rates have had 
little noticeable effect on busing activity. In Arizona, one 
consumer confidence index rose 9.3 percent between October 1988 and 
January 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, car sales have slowed. Dealer inventories are building, 
so dealers are being very cautious about additional ordering. Higher 
interest rates are not now the determining factor for car sales, but 
tighter credit requirements are hurting volumes. As a result, one 
dealer reports that 30 percent of his potential buyers were turned 
down for their loans - the highest turndown rate in 3 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity remains healthy in most manufacturing sectors. Capacity 
limits are binding for many aerospace suppliers and major commercial 
aircraft companies. Concern is rising that both Boeing and McDonnell 
Douglas could lose business to Airbus Industrie because delivery 
times are now so long. McDonnell Douglas is considering building new 
plant capacity and reportedly is looking outside of Southern 
California because of the high cost of doing business there.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports are mixed for electronics and defense firms. Some 
respondents note strong electronics and high-tech activity, while 
others note recent weakening, particularly in semiconductor orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business continues relatively strong in the paint and coatings 
industry, with some key raw materials in short supply and escalating 
in price. For several years, paint and coatings manufacturers have 
held the line on price increases, despite higher costs, but prices 
are expected to rise soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although agricultural market conditions currently are good, weather 
poses a threat to many western agricultural producers. Freezes have 
hurt the citrus and strawberry crops, although it is still too early 
to assess total damage. Continued dry weather through much of the 
winter has heightened concerns about water availability this summer. 
Unless March rains are much more plentiful than normal, California 
farmers will suffer cutbacks in water allocations of as much as 60 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      As of early February, lumber and wood products orders were running 
about 7 percent behind last year's level. 1988 production in the 
coast region was about 10 percent below its 1987 level, and the 
industry faces supply problems for 1989. Log prices are reported to 
be up as much as 33 percent, as high log exports stimulate demand 
while Forest Service policies constrain log supplies. Because of 
problems obtaining logs, 33 lumber mills on the West Coast have 
closed down during the past six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several reports indicate that paper has become more expensive and 
more difficult to obtain in sufficient quantity. Prices rose about 5 
percent for bond paper and 1 percent for newsprint on January 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity remain healthy in coastal 
states. Several respondents note slowing real estate and 
construction activity although there is disagreement regarding 
whether recent increases in interest rates have played a role.  Some 
note that the volume of sales has increased recently, and attribute 
this rise to the fear of further rate increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office building in downtown Los Angeles continues strong, buoyed by 
foreign investment.  Some are concerned that if current plans are 
carried out, over-capacity could be a serious problem by 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most bankers and thrift executives report that loan demand remains 
relatively weak. Loan volume has been flat for about six months. Few 
attribute the weak demand to higher interest rates, focussing 
instead on the continued small pool of quality borrowers. One banker 
notes that inquiries and fundings on home equity lines are 
unchanged. In contrast, others argue that higher rates have affected 
loan demand, making some customers more cautious about borrowing and 
causing others to borrow before rates increase further. Large banks 
in Oregon and Washington report that total loans and leases have 
been rising slightly faster in recent weeks, with accelerating 
growth in secured real estate loans and weakening growth in 
unsecured credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some bankers report that deposit growth is strong, but others report 
that the recent rise in interest rates has hurt balances in passbook 
savings and market interest accounts. Earnings at District 
commercial banks were up strongly in 1988, following a loss in 1987.  
Among District commercial banks, return on equity was 15 percent and 
return on assets was 0.9 percent, both higher than national 
averages. However, some bankers have expressed concern that a 
narrowing gap between borrowing and lending rates may be squeezing 
profits. But one banker notes that the large proportion of 
adjustable-rate loans should mitigate the problem to some extent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial services industry in Arizona continues to show the 
effects of the downturn in construction. Results for financial 
institutions are mixed, with sone institutions reporting 
significantly improved earnings over 1987, while others recently 
have made additional provisions for reserves.
