      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 20,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity in the First District is quite 
unbalanced. Retail sales are expanding modestly, according to plan. 
The manufacturing situation is mixed, with some responders 
experiencing a softening in order rates and others, most notably 
those in housing-related areas, enjoying an upturn. The residential 
real estate boom continues. Perhaps the most notable development in 
this month's report is the divergent import price experience of 
manufacturers and retailers. While manufacturing respondents have 
not observed any appreciable increases in the prices of imported 
components and materials, several retailers have seen very 
substantial increases in import prices. These increases will appear 
in prices to the consumer in a month or so.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the First District in January and February were 
generally consistent with plan, but contacts reported an increase in 
volatility. Inventories are also according to plan for most 
merchants contacted. Several firms expressed concern about consumer 
acceptance of projected price increases for imported goods resulting 
from the decline in the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Aside from one chain experiencing a downward sales trend, contacts 
report moderate sales growth in January and February, about at 
planned levels. Several contacts said consumers are becoming even 
more promotion-minded, with sales revenues swinging widely in 
response to advertising and perceived value. For example, a home 
furnishings chain reported that sales rise in a predictable way for 
major promotional events, but that the traditional correlation 
between sales and new home production has disappeared.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories were reported to be as planned. Firms with increasing 
sales have been increasing inventories to support them while the one 
contact with weak sales has been reasonably successful in keeping 
inventories in check.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices are reported to be stable except by firms with considerable 
imports. One respondent cited a 30-35 percent increase in costs for 
selected home furnishing items from Europe. The firm is concerned 
that consumers will balk when these price increases are passed on in 
the next month or so.
     </p>
     <p>
      First District merchants expect moderate but not robust sales growth 
in 1986. Warehouse expansions and store openings continue on 
schedule, but several contacts said they will be more comfortable 
after a few months of steadier growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from the manufacturing sector are mixed. Some respondents 
have experienced a softening in orders relative to a year ago, while 
others have enjoyed a pickup. Orders for housing-related products 
and communications equipment are rising. According to one 
respondent, demand for housing products is increasing daily. Sales 
of both capital equipment and supplies to the U.S. automakers are 
holding up well. Sales to the machine tool and apparel industries, 
on the other hand, are disappointing; respondents attribute the poor 
sales to the effects of foreign competition on their customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents continue to encounter strong resistance to price 
increases, except where they have a unique product. Prices of 
purchased materials and components, including imports, are well 
behaved. For this group of manufacturers, the most important effect, 
to date, of the decline in the value of the dollar has been to make 
the earnings of foreign subsidiaries appear more attractive. 
However, one contact from the machine tool industry reported that a 
colleague had received a number of orders from Europe as a result of 
the dollar's decline and another contact reported that European shoe 
producers are finding it more difficult to sell in the United 
States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents will spend as much or more on plant and equipment 
in 1986 as they did in 1985. Employment levels are expected to be 
fairly steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential real estate market in the Boston metropolitan area 
is very strong. Housing prices, which increased about 70 percent 
over the past two years, are still rising. In a number of 
communities prices are said to have risen 5 to 10 percent just since 
the end of 1985. Realtors attribute the sharp rise in prices to the 
strong economy and tight supply. Home production is up, but has not 
kept pace with demand-in part because of limited building space and 
no-growth attitudes in many communities. The greatest growth in 
housing has been the outer suburbs to the west and southwest of 
Boston. The housing market is also said to be strong in southern New 
Hampshire and the Providence area.
     </p>
     <p>
      In commercial real estate, many new office buildings have recently 
been built in the Boston suburbs and more are coming on-line. 
Absorption rates have been healthy, but so much space is available 
that the vacancy rate has reached 20 percent and developers expect 
it to go higher. Demand and supply are more in balance in downtown 
Boston, where the vacancy rate is about 10 percent. While a lot of 
new space has been added, the percentage increase was not as large 
as in the suburbs. Because Boston's vacancy rates are still lower 
than those of other major cities, developers from other parts of the 
country are becoming interested in Boston. At the same time, some 
Boston developers are beginning to look at other New England cities. 
Providence and Hartford are said to have vacancy rates of about 15 
percent. Vacancy rates in southern New Hampshire are about 25 to 30 
percent but some developers find the area attractive because 
absorption rates are high and there is a lot of land available to 
develop.
