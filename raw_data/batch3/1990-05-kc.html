      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Tenth District economy continues to grow modestly. Retail sales 
are up from a year earlier, and auto sales are beginning to pick up 
a bit in some district states. Manufacturing plants continue to 
operate below capacity, though a few are experiencing skilled labor 
shortages. Oil and gas exploration and development remain stronger 
than a year ago. Housing activity is down from a year ago, but 
starts have increased recently due to warmer weather. Mortgage 
demand is weak at thrift institutions, and loan demand at commercial 
banks is generally steady to down from a month ago. Small businesses 
report only slight tightening in the availability of credit to them 
from traditional sources. Little if any such tightening is reported 
by agricultural borrowers. Rural nonfarm businesses are benefiting
from the improved performance of the agricultural sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most district retailers report higher sales over last year, but 
mixed sales over the last three months. Some improvement in sales is 
expected in the next few months. Retailers are generally satisfied 
with current inventories and will try to keep them at current 
levels. Prices have changed in line with cost increases and are 
expected to change little in the near future. New auto sales have 
improved slightly in some district states but remain sluggish in 
others. Some dealers report tighter credit terms for potential 
buyers. Most dealers continue trimming inventories in expectation of
only slightly higher sales in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most purchasing agents report moderate input price increases from a 
year ago. Prices have been fairly steady over the last three months 
and are expected to remain so or to increase slightly over the next 
three months. Materials inputs are readily available, and purchasing 
agents expect no problems in obtaining materials for the rest of the 
year. Lead times on certain inputs have increased slightly, however. 
Most firms continue trying to trim inventories. Plants are operating 
below capacity, though a few are experiencing skilled labor 
shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Oil prices were expected to soften in the second quarter, but high 
OPEC production and weak world demand caused prices to fall faster 
than anticipated. Already down $3 from their mid-winter peak, prices 
declined an additional $2 a barrel during the first two weeks of 
April. Despite softer prices, exploration and development activity 
in the district has increased from a year ago. The district rig 
count fell from 255 in February to 226 in March, but was 7 percent 
above the rig count in March 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District housing activity is down from a year ago. However, builders 
report stronger housing starts over recent months because of warmer 
weather. Single-family construction continues to be stronger than 
multi-family. New home sales are slow, and prices remain generally 
stable. Respondents expect housing activity to remain slow for the 
rest of the year. Most district savings and loan respondents report 
deposit increases both over last month and over last year. 
Respondents have mixed expectations about deposits in the near term. 
Some expect outflows due to continuing problems in the industry, 
while others expect inflows due to a return of customer confidence. 
Mortgage demand is weak at most institutions, and is expected to 
improve only seasonally. Mortgage rates remain steady and are 
expected to be steady to down slightly over the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial bank respondents report total loan demand was constant or 
down over the last month. Home mortgages, commercial real estate 
loans, and commercial and industrial loans were constant at most 
banks; agricultural loans were down. In contrast, most banks report 
higher demand for construction loans, and higher or constant demand 
for home equity loans. Prime rates and consumer lending rates were 
unchanged at nearly all banks, with no change expected in the near 
term. Nonprice terms of lending have changed for some borrowers, 
however. Some small businesses, and especially newer businesses and 
start-ups, report facing slightly more stringent lending terms, 
often in the form of higher collateral requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most banks report loan-deposit ratios unchanged or up from last 
month. Deposit activity was mixed at district banks. Levels of NOWs, 
MMDAs, IRAs, and Keoghs were constant at most banks, while demand 
deposits and large CDs were down at many banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's winter wheat crop is in good condition due to 
plentiful rainfall and mild temperatures in recent weeks. Above 
average wheat yields are expected in much of the district. Continued 
rainfall and low soil temperatures threaten to delay planting of 
spring crops in some states. Improved soil moisture conditions have 
bolstered the outlook for the district's spring crops, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Credit standards at district agricultural banks are generally 
steady. Credit is readily available to creditworthy farm borrowers, 
with repayment capacity a key lending condition. Some bankers in 
areas affected by the past two years of drought, however, report a 
modest tightening of credit standards on farm loans. Where the 
drought was especially severe, some farm loans restructured during 
the mid-1980s have required additional attention. Across most of the 
district, however, bankers report no undue problems with previously 
restructured farm loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      The performance of rural nonfarm businesses in the Tenth District 
varies widely. Most are stable, but some are growing moderately and 
others are declining slowly. Those rural nonfarm businesses 
dependent on agriculture have benefited from the improved 
performance of the farm economy.
