      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 19, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy expanded in December. Manufacturers 
reported growth in orders, particularly for construction-related 
goods and computer-related electronics. Energy-related manufacturing 
was boosted by strong international drilling and a strengthening 
domestic economy. Residential construction exceeded expectations 
while commercial construction increased across much of the District. 
Business service firms reported increased activity and retail sales 
continued to expand. Bankers reported a pick up in loan growth and 
optimism. Drilling continued to slow as real oil prices fell to 1973 
levels. Dry weather weakened agricultural conditions across most of 
the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers reported continued growth in orders. Demand 
for construction-related products and computer-related electronics 
remained strong while energy-related manufacturing increased. Demand 
for brick, glass and cement continued to be strong and contacts said 
they had increased their prices. Brick producers reported that they 
were hiring additional workers. Sales of lumber for residential 
construction was strong while lumber sales for industrial 
construction picked up. Lumber prices had increased. Primary and 
fabricated metal producers reported that sales were much higher than 
this time last year. Substantial international drilling boosted 
demand for oil services and machinery, while a strengthening 
domestic economy increased demand for refined products and 
petrochemicals. Lower oil prices reduced costs for these industries 
but continued overcapacity pushed prices and margins down. Sales of 
electrical and electronic machinery remained strong particularly for 
personal computers, communications equipment and construction-
related equipment. Several electronics contacts reported recent 
hiring for new facilities. Demand for paper products was up 
slightly. Apparel manufacturing slowed but remained above a year 
ago. Sales of food and kindred products increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business service firms reported increased activity. Demand was 
particularly strong for temporary services and contacts said they 
had increased their prices. All other service contacts, however, 
reported that heavy competition was forcing their prices to remain 
unchanged. Costs had held steady at most firms and some companies 
reported that they are getting ready to hire additional experienced 
workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales continued to expand. Retailers said that holiday sales 
met their expectations but were not outstanding. Sales of women's 
apparel was reported to be particularly slow, however. Heavy 
discounting kept prices at or below last year's level. Retailers 
said that consumers were very value oriented and merchandise was 
discounted earlier than last Christmas. As a result, stores were not 
left with excess inventory. A few retailers reported that they may 
have over-discounted because their inventories fell below desired 
levels. Auto dealers reported steady sales gains. A recent increase 
in the price of new cars had combined with a shortage of used 
vehicles to boost used car and truck prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity had increased. Single family homebuilding 
remained strong and contacts said that 1993 had exceeded 
expectations. Commercial construction expanded across much of the 
District, with strong demand for large discount retail stores and 
retail "power centers". Industrial construction also increased. 
Shortages of concrete, fiberglass insulation, and gypsum wallboard 
were reported to have slowed construction in some markets. Houston 
and Dallas office markets remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Drilling declined with lower oil and natural gas prices. The Baker-
Hughes rig count for the United States ended 1993 at 814 working 
rigs, well below the 883 working rigs at the end of 1992, and below 
expected seasonal increases. Weak global demand and large supplies 
pushed down real oil prices to 1973 levels. Natural gas prices also 
fell, with the February futures contract below $2.00 per thousand 
cubic feet. Contacts said that they do not know whether current 
price levels will hold.
     </p>
     <p>
      District bankers reported a pick up in loan growth and optimism. 
Lending for housing construction remained strong while contacts 
reported an increase in consumer and commercial loan demand. Demand 
for loans is reported to have increased mostly from established 
customers, with many companies using existing lines of credit, 
Bankers reported intense competition for consumer loans from 
retailers and captive finance companies. Most contacts said they are 
hoping to accommodate loan growth without additional hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dry weather had weakened agricultural conditions across most of the 
District. Contacts reported that insufficient moisture had damaged 
pastures, the winter wheat crop and contributed to a shortage of 
hay. Supplemental feeding of livestock was above normal and some 
producers had culled their herds earlier than usual. The Texas 
cattle on feed inventory continued to reach record high levels. 
Higher prices for all major crops more than offset declines in major 
livestock items causing the Texas All Farm Products Index of Prices 
Received to increase 3 percent above December 1992.
