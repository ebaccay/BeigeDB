      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The weather has combined with some other factors to cloud the 
economic picture of the Southeast economy in the fall. As summarized 
by the broad unemployment rate yardstick, the regional economy 
weakened somewhat in September. With the ending of cheap auto 
financing deals, car-buying plummeted in October, pulling down 
consumer spending. Total consumer borrowing has slowed as buyers' 
appetites apparently have been temporarily satiated. Construction 
activity indicators show that sector rebounding in response to 
easing credit conditions. The pace of tourism has been uneven and 
below last year's Fair-boosted levels in some states, and wet 
weather has further depressed farm revenue estimates, particularly 
in Louisiana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to weaken in September, with the District 
unemployment rate edging upward to 8.1 percent. Total employment 
dropped, moderately, for the first time since June. However, trends 
in factory employment are little changed since the last reporting 
period. Textile employment, while down sharply from a year ago, has 
stabilized in recent months. Textile industry contacts are 
encouraged by the recent weakening of the dollar but they look to 
the protectionist measures now in Congress for fundamental relief 
from import pressure. Employment growth in the region's auto 
assembly and parts plants has plateaued temporarily, but industry 
spokesmen are encouraged by the planned renovation of an auto 
assembly plant in Atlanta that will add 900 jobs and the selection 
of a Tennessee site for a major new assembly plant. Estimates 
indicate the latter facility will provide 6,000 jobs directly and an 
additional 14,000 support jobs at part. suppliers' plants. At 11 
percent in September, Louisiana continues to have the highest 
unemployment rate in the region. The petrochemical and oil field 
machinery industries continue to suffer, with the latter losing an 
additional 2,400 jobs in the year ending in September. Southeastern 
timbermen expect lumber and wood prices to remain depressed in the 
year ahead despite the encouraging building outlook suggested by 
falling mortgage interest rates. Canadian import pressure is likely 
to continue keeping prices below break-even levels for many domestic 
producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most merchants posted moderate gains in October although some 
stores, including a large national chain, fell short of October 1984 
sales levels. On a year-to-date basis, sales activity remains above 
last year's levels throughout the region, with women's and 
children's apparel, electronics, appliances, and jewelry the best 
selling items. Retailers generally are projecting only moderate 
gains in year-end holiday sales and are consequently holding leaner 
inventories relative to 1984, when holiday sales were not as strong 
as expected. October car sales in most areas of the region were off 
sharply from October 1984 and September 1985 levels. During 
September, more cars were registered than in any other month in the 
1980s.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential housing markets are slowing as usual as winter 
approaches, but sales levels are above those at this time last year, 
probably because of lower mortgage rates. The strong economic 
performances of Atlanta and Nashville are reflected in their 
healthy, migration-induced single-family home sales, and projections 
are for a continuation of high sales levels. Meanwhile, the Miami 
market is also showing notable growth over last year and the outlook 
is favorable, while the performance and outlook for Louisiana and 
Mississippi are poor. Office construction activity also has 
maintained its mixed growth course. Completion of new space has led 
to what are thought to be temporary increases in vacancy rates in 
Tampa and Orlando and to a more lasting increase in Miami. An 
unusually low vacancy rate makes Birmingham a good market for new 
construction, and the Nashville retail market is expected to boom in 
the next year. The Atlanta market keeps zooming along.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The growth rate in loan demand continues to trend downward for a 
sample of large commercial banks in the Southeast. October's growth 
in total loans, although still strong, represents the continuation 
of an unbroken pattern of softening growth since January. Both 
consumer and real estate lending account for recent weaknesses which 
follow unprecedented high growth in such lending earlier in this 
economic expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer purchases of travel services in the Southeast do not seem 
to have accelerated appreciably in the fall, although the reports 
available indicate that air travel increased in September at most 
regional airports. Auto travel fell in both September and October in 
most District states, although sharp declines in Louisiana, Alabama, 
and Mississippi no doubt reflect the unusually high levels of auto 
travel last year in conjunction with the World's Fair. Attraction 
attendance showed little growth. State parks, for example, had fewer 
visitors in October, and most private attractions surveyed had only 
modest gains. In the lodgings sector, activity was mixed, and hotel 
occupancies in several markets, including Orlando, remain extremely 
depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Low market prices continue to dim revenue prospects for District 
crop farmers. Louisiana farmers have had to cope additionally with 
multiple hurricane damage. Apparently, the sugarcane crop suffered 
most, with its projected yield falling by one-twelfth from earlier 
estimates. Prospective regional production of grain sorghum and 
cotton is the highest in this decade; yields of other major crops 
are also generally favorable throughout the region. The cattle, 
pork, and egg industries are experiencing low prices and poor 
returns but the poultry meat producers enjoy profitable conditions.
