      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Trends in employment indicate that the pace of activity in this 
District continues to trail the U.S. Additional layoffs and plant 
closings recently have been announced in several industries. Capital 
goods demand generally remains weak. Auto production schedules have 
been reduced but remain near year-earlier levels. Consumer spending 
and residential investment are relatively strong. Commercial 
construction, mainly in the Chicago area but also in other District 
centers, continues at a high level. Some holders of real estate and 
other assets are pushing to dispose of these by year-end to receive 
more favorable tax treatment. Prices paid for materials and 
components increased significantly in October for steel and various 
other items. A large retailer reports prices of textiles rose after 
import restrictions were imposed. Livestock and dairy farmers have 
been helped by low feed costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Plant Closings and Jobs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District companies in several industries continue to announce 
reductions in employment and shutdowns of manufacturing plants and 
other facilities. Most notable is General Motors' planned closing of 
7 manufacturing plants and part of another plant in the District, 
currently employing more than 20,000. Cummins Engine, a leading 
diesel producer, plans to close two plants in the District employing 
1,500. We are informed by industry analysts that the GM and Cummins' 
plant closings are part of broad programs to reduce capacity. 
Operations will be consolidated in other plants. Other closings 
recently announced include a computer parts distribution center in 
Indiana, a town's largest employer with 1,000 workers; an Illinois 
hog processing plant, 780 employees; two motor vehicles parts makers 
near Chicago; and the Michigan headquarters of a machine tool maker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reasons cited for these closings include foreign competition, excess 
capacity, high labor costs, and mergers. A Chicago-based paper 
company is cutting 1,000 jobs after a merger, and its local 
headquarters is expected to close. At least two more tire 
manufacturing plants in Illinois and Iowa are likely to be shut 
down. Additional jobs cutbacks have been announced in computers, 
health care products, banking, machine tools, and heavy-duty 
transmissions. On the plus side, additions to employment totaling 
nearly 400 are planned by two consumer appliance makers in Iowa, a 
response to strong demand. Also favorable are the expansion plans of 
Japanese vehicle producers in several locations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for mechanical capital goods remains weak. The market for 
industrial diesel engines is very slow. Orders for machine tools 
have declined. Oil and gas development equipment continues 
depressed. The last U.S. producer of 50-100 horsepower tractors 
plans to close its Michigan plant, and shift all production to 
Europe. Most smaller tractors have been imported for years. The 
Department of Justice has signaled that it will raise no antitrust 
objections to consolidations that would reduce from four to two the 
number of U.S. producers of large four-wheel-drive tractors. Deere, 
shut down by a strike since August 1, has offered  aggressive 
incentives to reduce tractor and combine inventories, including big 
discounts and zero-interest financing for up to two years. Orders 
have slumped for air conditioning equipment for office buildings, as 
construction nationwide has turned down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicle
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto production schedules have been cut from earlier plans but 
remain at high levels through the first quarter of 1987. Heavy truck 
orders have improved slightly. Sales of heavies are projected by one 
analyst at 125,000 in 1986 and 130,000, possibly up to 140,000, in 
1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The work stoppage at USX since August 1 has boosted demand for other 
steel producers. A leading Chicago-area producer is now operating at 
effective capacity, in part reflecting a reduction by one-third in 
the firm's capacity. Steel prices have increased on new contracts, 
but most integrated producers arc still losing money. Analysts 
expect prices to fall once the USX labor dispute is settled. Orders 
for steel from capital goods producers remain weak. Oil and gas 
industry demand for pipe is up, from a very low level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices paid rose at an "alarming rate" in October, according to the 
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. Higher prices were 
reported for a broad range of products and materials. Largest 
increases were for steel sheet and plates, related to the work 
stoppage at USX, and also to the Administration's partially 
effective program to limit steel imports. Other categories with 
higher prices included corrugated and kraft paper, wood, caustic 
soda, resins, and precious metals. One airline analyst discounts 
reports of a renewed "fare war."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Work on office buildings in downtown Chicago continues at a vigorous 
pace, despite high vacancies. Some projects have been deferred for 
lack of sufficient preleasing, but others already underway assure a 
high level of activity into 1987. Manufacturing building is low 
except for warehouse facilities in locations well-served by major 
roads. Highway work is slowing rapidly because Congress did not pass 
enabling legislation prior to adjournment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home building is well above last year in many parts of the Midwest 
including the Chicago area. Multifamily starts also are up 
substantially in the Chicago area. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages 
are commonly being offered at rates ranging from 9.5-9.75 percent. 
Mobile home shipments by Indiana builders, a major center of this 
industry, are higher this year, in contrast with a declining 
national trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A large general merchandise chain project a sizable rise in general 
merchandise sales in 1986, with prices up only slightly. A smaller 
rise in dollar sales and larger price increases are expected in 
1987. Restraints on textile and apparel imports are blamed for a 
recent jump in prices in those lines, which had been stable. Airline 
traffic was up strongly in September and October, with prices 
stable. A consultant expects consolidations and resulting cost cuts 
to improve profitability in 1987. Second mortgages are being 
advertised extensively by banks, S&amp;LS;, and other lenders. Some 
advertisers are holders of first mortgages. Second mortgages are 
being advertised as a way of tapping accumulated home equity and 
avoiding loss of interest deductibility under the new tax law.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bumper corn and soybean harvest estimates were raised recently for 
Iowa and Wisconsin, contrary to many analysts' projections following 
heavy September-October rains. Production estimates were cut 
slightly for Indiana. Prices remain low but have edged higher in 
recent weeks.  A feared storage crunch was lessened by a stretched-
out harvest season, caused by heavy rains and attractive options 
offered to farmers which encouraged them to redeem PIK certificates 
and sell their grain rather than store it under the government's 
support program. Returns to livestock producers are quite favorable 
because of low feed costs and higher prices for cattle and hogs. 
Dairy farmers also are benefitting from lower feed costs. Milk 
prices have recovered to year ago levels as cuts in dairy cow 
numbers, from the whole-herd buy-out program, and strong gains in 
commercial demand for milk have trimmed the milk surplus.
