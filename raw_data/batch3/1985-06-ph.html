      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District are mixed. Manufacturing 
activity is basically unchanged in June for the third consecutive 
month. Retail sales are flat and, for some major stores, below 
expectations for this time of the year. The financial and real 
estate sectors are more positive. Both commercial and consumer loan 
volume at area banks in June is greater than it was at this time 
last year, but the rate of increase is slowing. Mortgage lending is 
increasing rapidly, reflecting increased real estate sales. In the 
agricultural sector, some area farmers are under financial pressure, 
but overall conditions appear to be better than in other parts of 
the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, the outlook for the Third District economy, although 
weaker than it was a few months ago, is still positive. In 
manufacturing, about 40 percent of the industrial establishments 
participating in the June Business Outlook Survey anticipate 
improvement over the next six months. Retail merchants expect a 
slight improvement in sales between now and the start of the holiday 
shopping season, despite the present slowdown. Area bankers forecast 
slower but sustainable growth in commercial lending and a slackening 
in the growth of consumer credit from its rapid pace earlier this 
year. Real estate sales and mortgage lending are expected to 
accelerate as long as interest rates do not rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District remains generally 
stable in June for the third month in a row, according to the most 
recent Business Outlook Survey. Seventy percent of this month's 
survey respondents say there has been no change from May in their 
rate of operations; however, the portion reporting a decline (18 
percent) exceeded the portion indicating an increase (11 percent) 
for the first time since September 1982. The rate of shipments in 
June was the same as in May, but new orders dropped marginally, 
pulling down producers' backlogs and delivery times. Although 
workforces were reduced at one-fifth of the industrial plants 
surveyed in June, most survey respondents said their employment was 
stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      In reply to questions about general business activity during the 
rest of the year, 40 percent of the June survey respondents said 
they expect present conditions to persist, more than one-third look 
for improvement, and nearly a quarter expect further deterioration. 
The outlook for increased employment and capital investment is 
growing dimmer. The portion of manufacturers scheduling increases in 
expenditures on new plant and equipment fell to 20 percent of those 
participating in the survey this month, the lowest level yet this 
year. Little change in factory employment is likely in the near 
future. Less than 20 percent of the June survey respondents plan 
increases in either payrolls or the length of the workweek over the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have been flat in the Third District over the past two 
months. Local merchants say there has been no increase in sales in 
either May or June compared to April. Sales volume is also unchanged 
compared to the same period last year. Sales of home goods and 
higher priced items have been particularly weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cautiously optimistic is the term store managers use to describe 
their short-term outlook. For the months remaining until the 
Christmas shopping season, retail sales are generally expected to 
post gains of 5 percent or more above year-earlier periods, with the 
most optimistic retailer forecasting a 10 percent increase. Lower 
interest rates and the faster pace of income tax refunds are cited 
as factors tending to boost consumer spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Borrowing in the Third District remains strong, with both business 
and consumer loans up substantially from a year ago. Consumer loan 
volume is approximately 25-30 percent higher than it was in June 
1984, with credit card and automobile loans accounting for most of 
the increase. Commercial and industrial loan volume at Third 
District banks in early June is approximately 17 percent higher than 
it was twelve months ago. Business borrowing is likely to ease off 
in coming months, however; many borrowers have been able to improve 
their balance sheets recently and are likely to have less need for 
borrowed funds. Lending officers see economic growth tapering off 
further over the summer, resulting in year-over-year increases of 
about 10 percent in commercial loan volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lenders report large increases in the demand for housing 
finance in recent weeks, with outstanding mortgage volume up 14-20 
percent from last year at commercial banks. A major thrift 
institution in the Third District is receiving one-third more 
mortgage applications this spring than last, and reports the dollar 
volume of new mortgages made this April to be three times greater 
than that in April 1984. The average rate on conventional, fixed-
rate 30-year mortgages is 12 percent in mid-June. Falling mortgage 
rates appear to be the major force behind the boom in housing 
demand, offsetting any downward pressure stemming from concern over 
the effect of proposed tax changes on the cost of home ownership.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District banks lowered their prime rate to 9.5 percent on June 
18. Some local bank economists feel interest rates in general will 
drop further in the short-run, but they expect higher interest rates 
later in the year. The consensus of their forecasts is a prime rate 
of 11 percent by December, federal funds above 8 percent and 
Treasury bills and bonds at about 8 and 11 percent, respectively. 
Consumer loan rates are expected to fall in the immediate future and 
then parallel the movement of other rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The financial and market conditions of the Third District 
agricultural sector are not as critical as in other areas of the 
country. Farms in the Third District are not as highly leveraged as 
farms elsewhere, and farmland prices have not declined 
substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dairy farming is the weakest of the District's agricultural 
industries, as the end of the federal diversion program and 
reduction of the milk price support have contributed to lower dairy 
prices and incomes. Other important farm products face better 
markets. Poultry sales are expected to increase during the rest of 
the year, with prices remaining stable. Income from fruit and 
vegetable products in the region this year should meet or exceed the 
level of last year if prices hold at current levels.
