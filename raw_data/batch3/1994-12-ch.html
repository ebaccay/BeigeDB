      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 7, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic growth remained strong in October and 
November. Retail sales seemed to grow at about the same pace or 
slightly higher than in previous months on a seasonally adjusted 
basis; durable goods continued to lead overall sales growth, while 
the tardy arrival of cold weather prompted greater strength in 
seasonal apparel sales. Manufacturing activity generally remained 
robust, although some durable goods producers expectations for 
domestic sales gains in 1995 have been tempered in recent months. 
District labor markets continued to tighten up, and reports of labor 
shortages remained relatively widespread. Discussions with
retailers, manufacturers and a wide range of staffing services firms 
revealed a greater frequency of reports of wage pressures in 
permanent positions, albeit for a subset of occupations and 
geographic areas. Reports of price increases remained concentrated 
in crude goods and intermediate materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales growth seemed to strengthen further in recent weeks, 
after the underlying trend gathered momentum late in the third 
quarter. Reports from several large retail chains and shopping malls 
suggest that the holiday sales season began on a vigorous note, with 
full parking lots and high sales levels. One retail association 
stated that "things have been going great;" sales for the holiday 
season were previously forecast to rise 6 percent, but sales gains 
in the membership over the past week seem to have been significantly 
above that expectation. A survey by a check processing firm showed a 
stronger year-over-year same-store sales gain in the Midwest for the 
day after Thanksgiving than the survey had been showing in previous 
months. Several retailing contacts reported high sales levels for 
seasonal durable goods like snowblowers and car batteries, after the 
late-developing but harsh winter last year caught many consumers 
unprepared. One large retail chain noted that apparel sales rose 
significantly in recent weeks; unseasonably warm weather held back 
seasonal apparel sales in October and masked stronger gains in other 
apparel and home fashions lines within its overall mix. Another 
large retailer reported that apparel sales remained relatively weak 
in those regions of the country where warm weather continued to 
linger, while apparel sales in most District states picked up with 
the belated onset of colder weather. Nationally, this contact stated 
that sales over the past week have been "fabulous," with year-over-
year growth well in excess of the growth for the month of November 
as a whole. A continuing large majority of Michigan retailers 
surveyed in November reported year-over-year sales growth, while an 
even larger share of respondents expected further gains over the 
next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District industrial activity remained robust. Production readings 
from the Chicago and Milwaukee purchasing managers' surveys remained 
quite vigorous during September and October, while the Detroit 
survey showed new strengthening. Surveys conducted in western 
Michigan have been depicting some of the strongest results in the 
District, and these surveys showed even greater momentum in 
September and into late October. In November, the production 
component of the Chicago survey showed faster growth than September 
and October. Large automakers reported that sales closure rates 
improved in recent months, after slipping during the summer. 
Showroom traffic continued to run at high levels for this time of 
the year, and dealer orders reportedly accelerated during October 
and early November. Heavy-duty truck build plans for the fourth 
quarter have been on the rise in recent months after slipping in the 
third quarter. A large steel producer shipped its highest volume for 
a third quarter since 1981, and total steel production in the region 
showed stronger year-over-year gains in October and November than in 
previous months. This steel manufacturer's materials distribution 
group reported that the Midwest and the South continue to be its 
strongest geographical areas. A large cement producer stated that 
interest rate increases have not yet had a noticeable affect on its 
own market, with residential deliveries still "doing very well, and 
better than last year." A large manufacturer of gypsum wallboard 
reported that industry shipments have been running at a record level 
during 1994. This company expects housing starts in 1995 to run even 
with 1994, but with a larger multifamily component, which use less 
wallboard and could dampen overall shipments. Several durable goods 
manufacturers expected slower growth in domestic markets during 
1995. At the same time, a number of heavy equipment producers noted 
increased sales to Europe, and these contacts expect greater export 
gains to help offset slowing growth in domestic markets during 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continued to tighten, and discussions with 
many staffing services firms revealed a somewhat greater frequency 
of reports of wage pressures for permanent positions than in 
previous months. Among those staffing firms that reported little 
change in compensation for permanent positions, several expected 
greater pressure in early 1995. However, some staffing services 
stressed that organizational restructuring and technological 
advances continue to weigh on job opportunities and salaries for a 
significant portion of the overall workforce. Shortages and wage 
pressures seem to be centered in light industrial, construction, and 
entry-level retail occupations, although one large retail chain 
stated that it hasn't been any more difficult to attract seasonal 
labor for the current holiday season than it was in 1992 and 1993. 
Temporary help companies have been reporting wage increases for the 
past several quarters, and one temporary help company stated that 
"orders we used to he able to fill in two or three days, now it 
takes two or three weeks." Another staffing services firm reported 
that the price of help-wanted radio advertising space has risen in 
recent months. An engineering firm in a robust area of the District 
reported that construction has been moving at a very slow pace on 
individual projects, due to the shortage of skilled labor. This 
contact stated that customers of construction contractors are 
bidding against one another in order to get priority for project 
completions, and new contract prices are also moving higher. An auto 
supplier stated that a scarcity of production workers has curbed the 
firm's ability to add a third production shift, and a staffing 
services firm believed that labor shortages have played a role in 
auto component shortages. A number of managers of fast-food 
restaurants located in relatively strong areas of the District 
expressed heightened concern about labor shortages, with one busy 
manager stating "I've got to get back to work, we're short two 
people as I speak." While a majority of these restaurants reported 
that wages have risen, none of them reported higher menu prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price increases remained centered in commodities and industrial 
materials. A wide range of respondents to area purchasing managers' 
surveys continued to comment about shortages, capacity constraints, 
demands for shorter lead times, planning difficulties for work-in-
process inventory, and higher input prices generally. In November, 
the prices-paid component of the Chicago purchasing managers' survey 
climbed to its highest level since late 1988. A steel consumer 
expressed concern that faster growth in Europe would reduce supplies 
of imported steel next year, adding further upward pressure to steel 
prices. A large cement manufacturer stated that its baseline cement 
prices are slated to rise roughly 6 percent at the beginning of 
1995, although this represents a smaller hike than the last baseline 
increase in April. Cement allocation restrictions have been 
shrinking in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence of greater inflation in retail prices remained relatively 
scarce. Most retailing contacts continued to stress that price 
competition remains intense, with little change in overall prices 
reported even among those retailers experiencing increased labor 
shortages and higher wages. One large retail chain stated that 
department stores "seem to be running a little more promotional than 
people might have expected a few months ago." Another large chain 
concentrated in apparel stated that price increases have played "no 
role whatsoever" in same-store sates gains in recent months. "We've 
had a lot of threats, but very few suppliers have really had the 
guts to try to put anything through."
