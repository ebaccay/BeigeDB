      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 16, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Twelfth District economy continues to present an uneven picture, 
across states as well as across sectors. The first two months of 
1987 have seen weak retail sales, at least partially due to the tax-related buying binge at the end of 1986. Nevertheless, demand for 
consumer credit continues strong in some areas. Capital investment 
activity, while uneven, appears to be weakening overall. Prices of 
many products are edging upward, particularly in sectors strongly 
affected by exchange rates. Housing market activity has been robust 
in fast-growing states such as California and Arizona, but slow in 
hard-hit Alaska.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have been weak during the early part of 1987, although 
it is not yet clear how much of the weakness is fundamental and how 
much is a result of the year-end tax-related buying binge. 
California retail sales reportedly have shared in the weakness 
during January and February.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car sales have fallen since the first of the year in most parts of 
the District, as the tax-induced sales surge in December suggested 
they would. Auto sales decreased dramatically between December and 
January in California, Washington, Oregon, and Utah.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys of purchasing managers in Oregon and Arizona suggest that 
prices of some products are starting to creep upward. In January, 
the fractions of both surveys respondents reporting rising prices 
increased while the proportions reporting falling prices declined. 
Price increases have been most pronounced in sectors heavily 
influenced by exchange rate fluctuation. Despite these inflationary 
tendencies, many respondents pointed out that substantial market 
competition and limited consumer demand should keep any price 
increases modest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many firms plan to spend less on capital investments during 1987 
than they did during 1986. These decreases are attributed to slow 
economic activity overall, to an increased focus on cost-cutting 
associated with recent restructuring, or to the reduced investment 
incentives under the new tax bill. One savings and loan plans to 
spend 15 to 20 percent less in 1987 than it did in 1936, while a 
survey of pulp and paper producers reveals that they plan to 
decrease investment spending by an average of 24 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, a survey conducted during January in Arizona 
suggests that investment spending in that state is likely to remain 
stable, since about 20 percent of the respondents said they would 
increase capital spending, while another 20 percent planned 
decreases and the remainder planned to continue spending at their 
1986 levels. Throughout the District, investment spending is 
expected to increase for firms whose economic fundamentals indicate 
substantial investments, including an energy distribution company 
and a retailer that are expanding their territories, and a forest 
products firm newly flush with funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The price of oil is expected to increase during 1987. Utilities 
disagree as to whether higher oil prices would cause significant 
increases in their rates. In the Pacific Northwest, the Bonneville 
Power Administration faces enormous debt obligations and has 
requested a 15 percent rate hike to pay them off.
     </p>
     <p>
      An unusual mid-January frost in southern California caused extensive 
damage to avocado and citrus caps in Ventura and San Diego counties. 
The estimate of total damage currently stands at $60 million, 
although the California Avocado Commission reports avocado damage 
alone at $110 million. The damage, compounded by more generalized 
low yields, is likely to cause price increases for some fruits, 
vegetables, and nuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Western farmers should benefit from the last-minute trade pact 
agreed upon between the U.S. and the European Economic Community 
since it averts stiff European tariffs on such products as avocados 
(California), roasted nuts (California), and flower and vegetable 
seeds (Oregon), as well as further tariffs that could have been 
imposed on other specialty crops if the trade war had escalated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      California housing market activity has continued at a robust pace, 
although the number of residential building permits issued in 
January fell sharply from December's inflated level due to the 
January imposition of a new school fee. The single-family segment of 
the market remains healthy in most parts of the District. In 
California, the median home price rose by 9.4 percent during 1986. 
In Alaska, however, where the drop in oil prices has affected the 
economy severely, single-family home prices reportedly fell 10 to 20 
percent during 1986. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation has 
foreclosed on many homes, and in December 23 percent of its 
condominium mortgages were in default.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The performance of consumer lending in the West appears to be highly 
uneven. Some banks and savings and loans are experiencing a 
slowdown, which they attribute to a combination of high consumer 
debt levels, refinancing of consumer debt through home equity loans, 
and more favorable terms offered by auto companies' finance 
subsidiaries. Other financial institutions continue to experience 
growth in both installment and credit card outstandings. In some 
cases, the increase seems to be driven by continued strong consumer 
spending, but in other cases the growth is attributed the aggressive 
marketing that has increased their market share. In most areas, 
installment loans appear to be losing ground to home equity 
instruments.
