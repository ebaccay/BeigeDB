      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 24, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Expansion in activity in the District apparently is continuing, but 
still trails the nation. Respondents report consumer products doing 
better, but industrial markets disappointing. The strongest sector 
is housing, which is booming in most areas. Sales of related 
consumer goods, including appliances and home furnishings, are also 
strong. Auto sales are at a high level, but not growing, and imports 
have made further inroads into auto markets. Office and retail 
construction continue vigorous. Contracts for nonresidential 
building are about even with last year. Demand for gypsum board, 
cement, and other building materials is very strong. Capital goods 
generally remain weak. Steel shipments are about flat. Crop planting 
conditions were favorable, and abundant moisture will get crops off 
to a good start, suggesting continued downward pressure on grain 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction, both homes and apartments, remains strong. 
Housing starts are sharply higher than last year. Resales of 
existing homes continue at very high levels, but the rise may be 
slowing. The surge in new loan applications and refinancings, in 
response to the lower mortgage rates, has caused major processing 
problems for area lenders and appraisers, and substantial delays in 
closings. The rise in mortgage interest rates in the past month 
appears to have accelerated refinancings by those who think they may 
have "missed the bottom." Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages commonly are 
around 10.5 percent, compared with under 10 percent earlier this 
year. Some lenders are quoting several sets of rates and points, 
with higher rates corresponding to lower points and vice versa. 
Strong demand has pushed housing prices significantly higher in some 
favored areas. Realtors report instances of two or more buyers 
bidding for a house above its list price. Production of mobile homes 
has been higher than a year ago in the District, mainly in Indiana, 
in contrast with a decline for the U.S.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Additional office buildings continue to be announced for the Chicago 
area, despite substantial vacancies and large concessions to new 
tenants. Office construction activity remains at a high level, 
especially in Chicago and Indianapolis. Scattered strikes have 
disrupted work in Chicago. (Strikes have been uncommon in recent 
years.) Retail construction is vigorous in suburban areas where 
population has been rising. Concessions are offered on retail 
leases. Some expect the pace of leasing to slow by year-end. Demand 
for small to medium-sized industrial buildings, particularly multi-
use structures, is strong in some Chicago suburbs readily accessible 
to major highways. Contracts for nonresidential construction, 
District-wide, are about flat. Highway and public works activity are 
expected to be up this year from an improved level. Skilled building 
trade workers are in short supply. Many such workers retired or left 
the District in recent bleak years. Some are said to be returning in 
response to contractor appeals. A major supplier to ready-mix 
cement, which cut capacity a few years ago, reports shortages of 
trucks and drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for steel have slipped recently, and output appears likely to 
remain flat, slightly above last year. Strongest markets are 
galvanized sheet, especially for motor vehicles; structurals and 
other contractors' products; and a variety of consumer goods. But 
"one-third of the economy is missing," meaning most heavy capital 
goods, utilities, and oil, and gas development. Steel imports are 
lower than last year but still substantial. Part of the decline in 
imports reflects the collapse of oil country tubular goods. Steel 
producers are still losing money. Efforts to raise prices have 
failed. Cost-cutting continues, including labor costs. One producer 
is transferring production of structural steel to Chicago from 
Pittsburgh. The same company has started a new continuous caster at 
a Chicago-area plant with 3.3 million tons of annual capacity. 
Inventories are under control, with managements determined to keep 
them under control.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of auto sales this year has been near last year's level, 
with imports accounting for a larger share. More aggressive 
incentive programs and modest production cutbacks by auto makers 
appear to have brought domestic inventories back into overall 
balance. Stocks of imports are generally lean. Sales of light trucks 
also have been boosted recently by incentive programs. Heavy truck 
sales remain soft, and will be 15 percent lower this year than in 
1985, according to one industry observer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for most mechanical capital goods remains weak. Consolidation 
of facilities and firms continues. A District manufacturer of heavy 
cranes sold that division to another heavy equipment maker. Another 
firm is selling a majority interest in its construction equipment 
business to a Japanese competitor, which will close the division's 
headquarters in the District and a manufacturing plant elsewhere. 
Railroad and farm equipment are down from last year's dismal levels. 
Additional layoffs, extended summer shutdowns, and plant closings in  
3 District states have been announced by farm machinery makers. Oil 
and gas development equipment has fallen very sharply. Diesel engine 
demand is below expectations. Buying of lighter construction 
equipment has risen with home building. Food processing machinery 
also is higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A leading general merchandise retailer reported that sales in May 
showed the largest gain over a year earlier in 1 1/2 years. Other 
chains' results also are improved. Inventory levels are about 
normal. Delinquency rates on credit sales are high but stable. Major 
home appliance shipments continue to set records, and industry 
observers expect continued strength. Airline travel is above last 
year's level but by a smaller margin than earlier in the year. 
Michigan sources note increased construction activity to meet 
demands related to increase travel and tourism. An industry analyst 
projects a 10 percent rise this year in auto miles driven, which 
would boost demand for a wide range of travel-related products and 
services.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Spring crop plantings in the District are winding down on schedule. 
A favorable planting season and abundant moisture reserves will get 
crops off to a good start for the critical summer growing months. 
Despite less acreage, the consensus is that the 1986 crop harvest is 
again likely to exceed commercial market needs and add to already 
burdensome (price-depressing) stocks of grain. District pork 
producers have benefited from a rise in hog prices in recent weeks. 
Cattle prices remain at depressed levels, in part because of the 
heavy movement of animals to slaughter following the start of the 
whole-herd dairy buy-out program in April.
