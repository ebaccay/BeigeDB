      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The end of the Persian Gulf war has not altered the outlook for a 
brief and mild recession, although some respondents believe that the 
probability of recovery by summer, along with prospects of 
moderating inflation, has improved. Manufacturing conditions in the 
Fourth District have deteriorated in recent months, but the overall 
unemployment rate in Ohio in January was still below the national 
average. The worst of the production cutbacks in manufacturing, 
especially in autos and steel, appear to be over. Retailers note a 
recent pickup in sales. Credit is still available to qualified 
borrowers in the District, and banks and thrifts report a recent 
flurry of activity for mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       National Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents have not changed their view that the recession will last 
two to three quarters and will be milder than the average of post 
World War II recessions. The end of the Gulf war, raises the 
probability of growth instead of decline in real GNP by 1991:IIlQ, 
according to some respondents. Real GNP is expected to decline by 
nearly the same rate this quarter as last, based on the weakness 
already seen in January. Also, an overall annual inflation rate of 
about 3.5% for the balance of 1991 appears more probable now that 
oil prices have fallen to the pre-Kuwait-invasion level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Regional Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's unemployment rate, although rising slowly in recent 
months, remained below the national average again in January. 
Manufacturing continues to outperform the nation, but showed some 
signs of weakening in late 1990. This Bank's estimate of industrial 
production in Ohio fell in both November and December, and 
employment in manufacturing has been edging downward since late last 
fall. Additional layoffs in late January and February, especially in 
the auto and steel industries, suggest that the unemployment rate in 
Ohio will rise closer to the national average over the next few 
months, according to some analysts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in February apparently strengthened from January, and 
retailers are encouraged that the pickup in sales will carry into 
March and the spring season. One retailer, who ordered goods based 
on his anticipation that weak sales since mid-1990 would continue 
through the spring, now believes that the season could be better 
than he expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nevertheless real consumer spending this quarter will likely show 
about a 1% annual rate of decline from last quarter because of the 
weak January performance, according to some retail analysts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories are judged to be about in line with desired 
levels. There appears to be little concern that retail inventories 
are excessive, except for new cars. A few retailers assert that even 
a mild pickup in sales would result in prompt increases in orders 
and production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Fourth District respondents still believe that the worst of the 
slump in industrial production occurred last quarter, and that 
production cuts this quarter will be smaller than last.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory reduction is not expected to be quite as large this 
quarter. Auto stocks will be reduced again this quarter, but not as 
much as last. In general, the inventory buildup prior to the 
economic contraction was relatively small, and manufacturers have 
been promptly reducing stocks because of the weakness in sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto output in 1991:IQ was cut back more than expected as recently 
as a month ago, and production this quarter is now estimated at a 
5.0 to 5.4 million annual rate compared with a 5.5 million rate last 
quarter. Industry analysts report that auto dealers cut orders below 
sales because of weak sales in January. New car sales strengthened 
in February, and dealers apparently have stepped up orders. As a 
result of recent production cutbacks, the auto industry is operating 
at slightly less than 60% of capacity. New car production in 
1991:IIQ should be higher than in the current quarter if orders are 
placed at or above sales levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods output has been holding up better than is typical for 
a business slowdown. However, heavy-duty truck output has slumped 
more than expected, although the bulk of that decline reportedly has 
already occurred. Some producers of electrical and industrial 
machinery are encouraged by the way orders have been holding up 
relative to past recessions, apparently supported by continued 
strength in exports and closely controlled inventories. One analyst 
expects that a slight reduction in real producers' equipment output 
this quarter will be followed by a slight pickup next quarter. A 
capital goods supplier also expects that its business will not slide 
as much as in the "average" recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel operations have fallen to about 65% of capacity this quarter 
in response to cutbacks in consumption and steel inventories. Steel 
exports have fared relatively well, While the bulk of the inventory 
correction is expected to be completed by the end of this quarter, 
reduction in stocks will continue into the second quarter, 
constraining output.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is still little indication that qualified borrowers in the 
District are being denied credit, although borrowers may have to 
search harder and meet higher terms for loans than they did last 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks and thrifts report that lower mortgage interest rates have 
stimulated activity for home loans, especially for refinancing, in 
recent weeks. Some thrifts report a surge in mortgage loan activity 
since about mid-February, and are hoping for at least a seasonal 
pickup in mortgage loans this spring. Lenders report that ample 
funds are available for mortgage loans. Housing affordability is 
judged to be the best in several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lower interest rates have not yet stimulated activity for commercial 
and industrial loans. Some banks experienced either a slight decline 
or a slight increase in loans in January, because of a weakened 
economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks generally are avoiding construction loans, but they are still 
being made available to qualified borrowers. A well-capitalized 
thrift also reports making construction loans, including for 
apartments, industrial warehouses, and shopping strip malls, to 
qualified borrowers who were refused loans by some commercial banks.
