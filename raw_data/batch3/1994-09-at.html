      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to business contacts, the Southeast economy continued to 
expand in August, although at a somewhat less rapid pace than 
before. Retailers again reported higher sales, and their 
expectations for Christmas are mildly optimistic. Activity among 
District manufacturers has been mixed; however, most expect orders 
to increase over the next few months. Building remains strong, 
although single-family home sales slowed in August. Commercial and 
multifamily residential real estate markets continue to improve, 
with rising rental prices and falling vacancy rates. Commercial loan 
demand is generally on the upswing, while consumer loan demand is 
said to be weaker. Contacts report that some input prices are on the 
rise, but wage increases are described as stable except for a few 
specific sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail contacts generally report improving sales. Women's 
apparel sales are showing gains, while sales of men's wear continue 
to increase. Back-to-school sales have been mixed in the region. 
Some contacts note strong sales with double digit growth while 
others report that children's apparel has not sold well. Sales of 
home-related products continue to slow. However, retailers generally 
expect year-over-year gains in fall and Christmas sales. Apparel 
sales are expected to make the largest gains over last year. In 
response to these better expectations, many retailers report that 
they are building up inventories, although some continue to purchase 
closer to time of need than they have in the past. Auto sales have 
slowed somewhat; the ending of the model year has some customers 
delaying purchases and some dealers running out of popular product 
lines, although the slowdown seems concentrated in imports. 
Merchants say that competition remains strong throughout the 
District, keeping pressure on retailers and manufacturers to hold 
the line on prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory activity has been mixed since the last reporting period. The 
outlook over the next few months remains upbeat, however, as most 
contacts expect to see increasing orders. Structural steel producers 
note strengthening orders for new building and bridge construction. 
Business is also increasing for paper and newsprint producers. Some 
textile markets, like denim, are improving, although other apparel 
fabric production reportedly remains weak. Home textile production 
remains at high levels. Some manufacturers of healthcare textiles 
and bedding fabric are adding employees and increasing factory 
workweeks in response to strong product demand. Suppliers to the 
auto and light truck industry continue to expand operations and 
increase production at plants in the region. Less positively, 
suppliers to the aerospace industry are operating at low levels of 
capacity due to a continued dearth of new orders. The recently 
announced purchase delay of F-22 fighters by the Air Force is 
expected to affect future hiring of production workers in Georgia. 
Other regional military contractors note declining orders and are 
concerned about future prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist traffic remains heavy at casinos on Mississippi's Gulf 
Coast. Convention activity continues to push hotel occupancies to 
high levels in New Orleans. Florida tourism officials, however, are 
concerned about a sustained slowdown in visitor arrivals. Hotel 
occupancies are down from a year ago in southern and central 
Florida; officials blame this sluggishness on competition from other 
tourist destinations and adverse publicity about crime. Continuing 
growth in the Asian and Latin American markets, however, appears to 
be offsetting some of the reported slowdown in visitors from Europe, 
and cruise industry bookings remain strong year over year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to District realtors, home sales slowed in August, with 
most attributing this to higher mortgage rates. However, home prices 
continue to rise across the region. Existing home sales are reported 
to be stronger than sales of new ones. Builders said that activity 
has increased in August compared with July, because of better 
weather conditions. Builders also report that construction time for 
homes has increased because of the reemergence of a shortage of 
skilled laborers seen earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report 
improving conditions in their markets. Multifamily occupancy rates 
continue to rise and rental rates have also been on the increase. 
New apartment and condominium developments have been announced 
recently in many parts of the District. Commercial realtors continue 
to report tightening markets characterized by falling vacancy rates 
and rising rental prices, though commercial construction is reported 
to continue at low levels, except in the retail sector which is 
seeing moderate gains, and the Atlanta metro area, in which there is 
some new building in preparation for the 1996 Olympics.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers around the region reported that overall lending was steady. 
Commercial loan demand outpaced consumer demand in most areas. 
Several bankers noted significantly increased competition on the 
commercial side. Some banks described consumer loan demand as 
disappointing. Auto lending has slowed at the end of the model year 
with the decline in sales. Mortgage lending seems to be slowing in 
most markets as refinancings have disappeared and home sales 
decelerate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although there have been some recent reports of labor market 
tightness in parts of the region, they have mostly been limited to 
clerical and some service personnel as well as skilled construction 
workers and are not widespread. Reports of price increases have 
become more numerous since the last reporting period, especially at 
the raw material level. Some contacts in the paper, apparel, metals, 
and building products industries now that their input prices are 
trending upward, but few say that they are able to pass on these 
rising costs. The competitive environment appears to be holding 
finished goods prices steady.
