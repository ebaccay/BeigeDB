      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 7, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District grew moderately in late 
October and November. Areas experiencing growth included the 
service-producing sector, commercial real estate, ports, and state 
revenues. Consumer spending was up slightly, but very strong holiday 
sales were expected. Manufacturing, tourist, and agricultural 
activity were flat and housing activity and loan demand declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers, retail associations, and retail analysts contacted by 
telephone reported increased activity in November, and they expected 
sales during the upcoming holiday season to exceed last year's 
robust level. Contacts indicated that November retail sales 
increased because of weekend promotions. There was disagreement, 
however, over whether consumers began holiday shopping earlier than 
normal. Looking ahead, retailers expected December sales of 
computers and other electronics to be strong. They also expected 
good winter apparel sales in December, even though such sales were 
weak in November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service-Producing Firms
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to a mail survey indicated that activity in the service-
producing sector increased in October. Revenues rose, except in 
business services, where they decreased. Wages also rose, and 
employment changed little except in the wholesale sector, where it 
increased. Service producers indicated that prices rose 0.4 percent 
in October. They expected increased demand for their services and an 
increase of 1.1 percent in their prices during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of factory activity changed little in October from their 
September levels, according to a mail survey of District 
manufacturers. Capital expenditures were up compared to six months 
ago, and respondents expected a further increase during the next six 
months. Manufacturers expected shipments and employment to increase 
during the next six months, but they anticipated little change in 
the workweek. Finished goods and raw materials prices increased 
faster in October than in September but at rates less than the 
general inflation rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated that tourist activity experienced its usual 
November slowdown. Contacts from mountain areas expected tourist 
activity this winter to exceed last year's level as long as the 
areas received normal amounts of snow. Rates for some rooms, meals, 
and activities were expected to increase more this winter than last 
winter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at the District ports of Baltimore and Charleston 
indicated that export levels in October were higher than those of 
September and a year ago: import levels remained about the same. The 
port representatives expected that during the next six months both 
exports and imports would increase and exports would grow faster 
than imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone reported that 
loan demand slowed during late October and the first three weeks of 
November. Consumer loan demand fell sharply, while commercial and 
mortgage loan demand declined slightly. Interest rates were higher 
on consumer, commercial, and mortgage loans. Looking ahead, most 
lenders contacted were cautious about future loan demand. Some 
consumer and commercial lenders in North Carolina, however, were 
confident that loan demand in their areas would remain strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a telephone survey of District realtors and builders, 
residential real estate activity declined during the four weeks 
preceding Thanksgiving. Building permits and buyer traffic 
decreased. Home sales also decreased, except in West Virginia, where 
contacts reported an increase in sales of lower-priced homes 
following the introduction of a state program providing low-interest 
mortgages. Builders indicated that they started fewer houses after 
the recent rise in mortgage rates. Home prices remained stable, 
although subcontractor wages increased in West Virginia, South 
Carolina, and North Carolina.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported that commercial real estate activity in 
November grew at the same pace as in October. Real estate contacts 
reported little change in construction, except in North Carolina, 
where speculative construction increased. Commercial vacancy rates, 
however, declined throughout the District. Posted commercial rental 
rates remained steady, except in the District of Columbia, where 
they rose. Real estate contacts reported that fewer landlord 
concessions were available to tenants, and they anticipated rental 
rate increases soon. Leasing agents reported that the availability 
of prime office space tightened in the District of Columbia, South 
Carolina, and North Carolina. Those in Charlotte, N.C., and 
Columbia, S.C., said the shortages in their areas existed even for
less-than-prime office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State government forecasters said that tax collections grew 
moderately in October. Real revenue growth declined in South 
Carolina but picked up significantly in Maryland and slightly in the 
District of Columbia. Growth remained strong in North Carolina, 
Virginia, and West Virginia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural activity progressed at the same rate as a year ago, 
according to District farm analysts. Fall harvesting activity for 
most crops neared completion, but rain delayed cotton harvesting in 
some areas of the District. Crop yields were strong. Fall small-
grains planting activity was comparable to that of a year ago, and 
the crops' condition was good in all District states except South 
Carolina, where crop growth was off to a slow start.
