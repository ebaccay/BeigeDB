       March 9, 1994
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Harsher-than-normal winter weather put a chill on the District 
economy, but the underlying momentum in business activity remained 
quite positive. Manufacturing activity continued to lead the 
expansion. with auto production providing a major source of 
strength. In each District state, unemployment rates closed out 1993 
at (or very close to) their lowest levels since 1977. Survey data 
and help-wanted advertising suggested that hiring plans rose 
significantly in early 1994. Purchasing managers surveys pointed to 
a somewhat faster pace in price increases, much as they did when 
growth strengthened at this time last year. Nonetheless, evidence of
broad-based or significant price increases remained relatively 
modest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continued to expand at a moderate 
pace in January and February. The composite production index of 
purchasing managers surveys in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee rose 
slightly from the high level reached in the fourth quarter of 1993, 
in spite of the deterioration in the weather. After climbing sharply 
in January. the production index for Chicago registered no change in 
February, remaining at one of its highest levels in the past four 
years. Results for two surveys in Western Michigan remained quite 
strong in late January, when the weather was at its worst, and the 
survey organizer noted that results in one survey were the strongest 
since 1985. A utility in Michigan noted that power sales rose from 
December to January on a seasonally adjusted basis, after adjusting 
for the deterioration in the weather, with sales gains led by 
industrial customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heavy-duty truck orders and output surged in the fourth quarter, and 
an industry analyst reported that assemblies rose further from 
December to January. Parts shortages are playing a more important 
role than bad weather in constraining heavy-duty truck production, 
according to this contact. A construction machinery industry analyst 
reported that manufacturers were raising production and building 
inventory to a greater extent than expected during the fourth 
quarter. A survey of freight forwarders showed sharply higher 
expectations for trade activity in coming months. District steel 
output rose 6 percent above year-earlier levels in the first three 
reporting weeks of 1994, but then plunged during the worst week of 
cold weather. Even so, output for January as a whole was 2 percent 
higher than January 1993, and reached the highest January level in 
the past five years. District steel output recovered only modestly 
in February, however, with faster growth evident for production in 
the nation as a whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bad weather slowed production growth in the auto industry, as it did 
in almost every sector in the District. Even so, the underlying 
momentum in the industry remained quite positive. Automakers 
reported that car sales actually rose on a seasonally adjusted basis 
in January, in spite of the weather. Fleet sales rose only slightly 
on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to these contacts, and 
only accounted for a small part of the month-to-month increase in 
overall sales. A large automaker based overseas reported that sales 
in January in the District were slightly higher than year-earlier 
levels, in spite of the weather. "The buyers are out there, and the 
outlook for the first quarter as a whole is very optimistic." After 
surging in the fourth quarter, District light vehicle output is 
expected to continue to grow in line with, or slightly faster than, 
the national average. Weather-related production postponements were 
disproportionately concentrated in the District in January, and 
sales expectations are high for some new models produced in District 
plants. Suppliers in the region also report sharply higher domestic 
parts purchasing plans for transplant assembly operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption and Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Discussions with retailers indicated that District consumer spending 
continued to increase during January and February on a seasonally 
adjusted basis, after surging during the fourth quarter. One large 
retailer stated that sales certainly weakened on the worst weather 
days, but the losses were almost always recaptured when the weather 
improved. This firm's sales in the region continued to rise in 
January and February on a seasonally adjusted basis, after 
strengthening significantly in the fourth quarter. Durable goods 
continued to lead overall sales gains. Another large retail chain 
noted that sales growth remained on the higher path established late 
in the holiday season. This contact stated that weather disruptions
were isolated to a few days, with only a marginal impact on overall 
sales. A survey of a large number of smaller retailers in Illinois 
and Indiana continued to show an improving trend in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home sales and construction activity surged in the region as 1993 
came to a close, with little sign of a slowdown in the underlying 
momentum thus far in 1994. Some realty and banking contacts 
attributed at least part of the increased activity to home buyers' 
beliefs that mortgage interest rates may have stopped declining, 
leading sonic to conclude that the recent burst in activity could 
prove short-lived. Still, reports from local realtor boards in the 
region remained quite optimistic, with most noting that sales 
closings rose faster in January and February than in late 1993. At 
the same time, the bad weather postponed home showings, which could 
be followed by slower growth in closings in March and April. One of 
the largest realtors in the District reported that transactions in 
January rose over 30 percent from year-earlier levels, partly due to 
special factors, but results were still a good deal better than 
expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District labor markets also continued to strengthen in late 
1993 and early 1994. Unemployment rates ended 1993 at or below their 
lowest level since 1977 in each District state, and help-wanted 
advertising has been on the rise in the region in recent months. A 
survey showed further gains in hiring plans among Midwest employers 
during January and February, after significant improvement during 
the fourth quarter. A large metropolitan daily reported that help-
wanted advertising space in January was over 20 percent higher than 
year-earlier levels, and space climbed consistently during each week 
in February. This contact stated that "it looks like employers are 
beginning to tee it up." A large personnel recruitment firm noted 
that permanent placements growth slowed in early 1994, mainly as a 
result of a shortage of job candidates. An analyst of labor markets 
in Western Michigan reported that strong improvement in employment 
in the fourth quarter was led by manufacturing payrolls. Scattered 
reports of worker shortages in Western Michigan have been 
supplemented by a high level of average hours worked in the region 
(well above the national average) and growth in help-wanted ads. 
However, several large District manufacturers emphasized that their 
employment remained on a long-term downtrend, in spite of recent 
improvement in orders and output, and a large auto supplier reported 
that recent hiring has been confined to production workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A quarterly survey of agricultural bankers indicated that farmland 
values and credit conditions varied significantly around the region, 
with the effects of flooding in 1993 playing an important role. 
Bankers from Illinois and Indiana reported significant gains in 
farmland values, as farmers in these states experienced an above 
average harvest for 1993, along with sharply higher crop prices. 
Conversely, bankers in Iowa and Wisconsin reported flat to modestly 
higher farmland values, as many farmers in these states experienced 
sharply lower yields during 1993. Farm loan demand was also reported 
to strengthen in most areas, accompanied by ample funds for lending 
and further declines in the rates charged by banks on loans to 
farmers. Loan repayment rates weakened in areas hardest hit by 
flooding in 1993, but improved in most other areas of the District. 
Capital expenditures by farmers are expected to be weak in Iowa and 
Wisconsin this year, but strong in the other District states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The price components of District purchasing managers' surveys 
generally suggested that purchased materials prices rose at a 
moderately faster pace in early 1994 (on a seasonally adjusted 
basis) than in late 1993, similar to the pattern when production 
growth strengthened at this time last year. The price component of 
the Chicago survey moved back down slightly from its January level. 
Most discussions with businesses suggested that upward price 
movements remained modest, even in some markets experiencing 
relatively strong demand growth. For example, two large capital 
goods manufacturers with strong sales gains each reported that in-
house price indexes for their own purchased materials were flat or 
only increased slowly in recent months, with little change in trend 
since the third quarter of 1993. Another large capital goods 
manufacturer reported that signs of production bottlenecks among 
suppliers are spotty at best. While suppliers are testing price 
increases, this firm does not expect most of them to prove 
sustainable. Weak overseas economies and underutilized capacity 
among foreign competitors continued to weigh on output prices in 
domestic markets, according to this contact, and its own prices 
actually declined, on average, during 1993. Scrap steel prices 
surged in 1993, but have remained flat in recent months. However, 
capacity constraints and upward price pressures have been noted with 
increasing frequency and intensity by producers of building 
materials.
