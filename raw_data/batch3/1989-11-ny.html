     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A mixed pattern of developments continued in the Second District 
economy during recent weeks. Unemployment rates were at or below the 
national level, though above levels recorded early this year, and 
the pace of office leasing picked up. Sales at department stores and 
homebuilding activity varied across the District. Demand for 
commercial business and real estate loans at small and medium-sized 
banks was moderate to slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results at District department stores were mixed during 
September. Most respondents reported that sales fell below targeted 
levels, although a few experienced demand that met or exceeded plan. 
Some chain retailers noted a recent slowdown in the northeast in 
general relative to the rest of the nation. Over-the-year sales 
changes in September ranged from -1.0 percent to +13.2 percent among 
District retail contacts. Children's back-to-school items were the 
biggest sellers followed by women's and junior apparel. However, 
sales of big ticket items like furniture and rugs remained weak and 
women's and men's accessories also moved slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of one chain that has stocks somewhat above 
desired levels, department store contacts described their current 
inventories as being in good shape. Most said they would continue a 
close monitoring of stocks because their outlook is not particularly 
optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of homebuilding activity continues to vary across the 
District. Demand for new housing remains strong in upstate New York 
communities such as Buffalo and Syracuse where current activity is 
comparable to the relatively high levels of 1988. A glut of homes 
for resale continues to plague much of the New York metropolitan 
area, however, with price markdowns and other concessions 
increasingly being offered. One notable exception is a New Jersey 
developer that builds relatively low-priced housing, primarily for 
first-time buyers: in one of its subdivisions 130 new homes recently 
sold over the course of a single weekend, and hundreds of phone 
calls were received at the company's main office regarding another 
new 1200-unit development before the on-site sales office was 
actually opened.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity picked up recently in the District. The 
vacancy rate declined in midtown Manhattan as activity reached its 
highest level this year. Leasing activity has also been strong in 
some other areas of the District as well. Opinions are mixed 
concerning what lies ahead, however. Several very large leases are 
reportedly under negotiation by companies seeking new headquarters 
in midtown Manhattan, but with 17 more office buildings scheduled 
for completion there over the next two years, it is unclear what 
will happen to the vacancy rate in coming months. The opposite 
pattern holds in downtown Manhattan. The vacancy rate has risen in 
the past few months as further consolidations at brokerage firms 
have occurred. However, no new buildings are planned in that area 
after this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Reports on Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates are currently at or below the national 
level with September readings or 5.4 percent in New York and 4.6 
percent in New Jersey. Nonetheless, rates in both states have risen 
in recent months. Because of virtually no increase in District 
employment over the last several months and its rising unemployment 
rates, some recent articles have voiced concern that the region will 
face a rerun or the stagnant employment picture of the 1970s without 
some improvement in its business climate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some 40 percent of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
reported improved business conditions in September, up from 33 
percent in the previous surveys. Substantially more firms reported 
an improvement than reported a deterioration, although the number of 
firms in both cities reporting worse conditions increased. With 
regard to the outlook, a recent survey of 550 chief executives of 
medium-sized firms in the region found that 88 percent plan either 
to expand their businesses or to maintain current employment levels 
during 1990.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several new developments were announced or undertaken since the last 
report. Ford Motor Company plans to spend $285 million retooling its 
Edison, New Jersey, plant for producing pickup trucks instead of 
small cars. Also in New Jersey, ground was broken for a $250 million 
pharmaceutical research facility at the Schering-Plough campus in 
Kenilworth. In Yonkers, New York, a Japanese-owned rail car 
manufacturer was awarded a $170 million contract to build the first 
132 subway cars for a new mass transit system under construction in 
Taiwan. The three-year-old plant has already done work for local 
transit companies and is currently working on contracts to build 
rail coaches for Massachusetts and "people-mover" cars for the Las 
Vegas airport.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for commercial business and real estate loans at small- and 
medium-sized banks in the Second District has been moderate to slow 
in recent weeks. Half of the respondents surveyed reported slow 
demand, citing concern about the economy and a weak local real 
estate market. None reported strong demand for commercial loans and 
all stated that the recent leveling off of interest rates has had no 
appreciable effect on demand. Most respondents anticipate that the 
demand for these loans will continue to be slow to moderate through 
the first half of 1990.
     </p>
     <p>
      No bankers reported a change in the short-term to long-term loan 
mix. Most stated that the majority of their loans were short to 
intermediate-term (less than 5 years), with commercial real estate 
loans comprising the bulk of long-term loan portfolios. Of all the 
banks surveyed, only one purchased merger and acquisition loans on 
the secondary market. A representative from this bank said that each 
deal is examined separately because of the risk with highly 
leveraged transactions.
