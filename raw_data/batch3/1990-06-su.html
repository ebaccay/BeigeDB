      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 20, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The tone of District reports suggests continued slow growth in the 
economy with little change in the underlying inflation rate. Reports 
on the behavior of consumption are mixed, and construction is 
indicated to be softening further. Capital goods industries are, on 
balance, pointing toward growth, and manufacturing is expected to 
strengthen in several Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in 
several Districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent 
months, and are expected to remain so in the short term. It is 
unclear how much of the recent softness in retail sales represents 
temporary factors, such as unusual weather over the last several 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both residential and nonresidential construction have been edging 
downward in recent months in most Districts, and indicators of 
future construction suggest further softening.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a 
result of ample rainfall in previously drought-stricken regions of 
the country, but cool, wet weather has delayed planting by as much 
as several weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The slow-growth economy is accompanied by an easing in demand for 
credit. Real estate loans, consumer loans, and business loans are 
still growing, but at reduced rates in recent months. Lenders are 
reported to have tightened standards especially for real estate 
loans, but there is still little information that suggests credit 
restraint is spreading into other markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports suggest very little growth, if not a decline, in 
real consumer spending for durable and nondurable goods this quarter 
from last. Retail sales have been marked by sluggish behavior in 
several Districts that has apparently continued into May and early 
June (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Richmond 
and St. Louis).
     </p>
     <p>
      Unseasonably cold and wet weather has reduced demand for summer 
goods and for apparel. Weakness in home furnishings is attributed to 
softened conditions in housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in Atlanta, Dallas, and Minneapolis apparently 
continued to increase in May, but at a reduced pace from earlier 
this year. Kansas City described retail sales as having increased 
moderately over the past three months, and San Francisco described 
sales as "continuing healthy."
     </p>
     <p>
      Several Districts reported that retail inventories are either high, 
or larger than desired (Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, 
and Kansas City).
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in several Districts are cautious about the short-term 
outlook for retail sales. In Boston and Cleveland, respondents 
apparently expect little improvement at least through the summer 
months, and Philadelphia reports that some retailers are lowering 
their sales forecasts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing production has been relatively flat over the last few 
months, but several Districts expect strengthening in output despite 
softness in some industries. Defense, building construction 
machinery, and apparel industries are experiencing some softening. 
In contrast, the aerospace industry is a source of strength in 
several regions of the country, (Boston, Minneapolis, and San 
Francisco), and the energy sector is expanding (Dallas and Kansas 
City).
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods industries still point toward growth, despite mixed 
performance. Construction machinery, excluding building, is "doing 
well," agricultural machinery is strong, and orders for 
communications equipment are rising, according to Chicago. Demand 
for heating and air conditioning and industrial pumps is strong in 
Atlanta, and capital goods is "surprisingly strong" in Minneapolis. 
Cleveland reports that capital spending plans are stronger than 
reported in the latest Commerce Department survey, which should be 
an important support to manufacturing output.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output in the auto and auto-related industries, such as glass and 
rubber, has been a drag on manufacturing in Atlanta, but Chicago and 
Cleveland note some strengthening in auto production that should add 
to total output this quarter and perhaps next. Steel production has 
rebounded, and some analysts have upgraded their steel outlook for 
1990 (Chicago).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most Districts, except San Francisco and Minneapolis, residential 
and nonresidential construction has been flat to declining in recent 
months, with prospects for further easing. Housing sales were either 
flat or fell in recent months in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas 
City, but were generally stronger in Minneapolis, and rebounded in 
California. Housing sales have been increasing at double-digit rates 
in Oregon, Idaho, and Utah.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contract awards for future starts fell in April in Chicago and 
Dallas, and permits in Minnesota were off 20 percent in March from a 
year earlier. Atlanta notes that contracts for both residential and 
commercial construction continue to slow, in part because of 
overbuilt markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      An underlying problem in commercial construction is an apparent 
excess supply of new office space in many parts of the country. 
Commercial construction in downtown Manhattan is marked by the 
highest office vacancy in two decades. Dallas notes that office 
occupancy rates in major metropolitan centers in that District have 
been increasing, but are still low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rains in the Southeast, the North Central states, and 
California generally relieved drought conditions and appear to have 
improved farm crop yields. Richmond reports that grain yields are 
expected to be normal to above normal. Recent rains in the North 
Central states "substantially brightened prospects for agriculture," 
especially in Minnesota and North Dakota, and ranchers in Montana 
expect a record year this year (Minneapolis). Kansas reports heavy 
spring rains ended the drought of the pest two years and boosted 
prospects for winter wheat output. Expected yields range from 
average to well above average, with record crop yields likely in 
much of that state. Recent rains in California have relieved some of 
the drought conditions, but storms have caused significant damage to 
some fruit crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heavy rainfalls in the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas 
Districts however, have damaged crops and delayed other crop 
planting by several weeks. Below-normal temperatures and above-
normal rainfall since mid-May have delayed planting of an estimated 
13% of corn acreage and 47% of soybean acreage as of June 2, 
according to Chicago. St. Louis reports that poor weather and 
disease and insect problems suggest that 1990 crop yields may fall 
below normal in some parts of that District. Moreover, an estimated 
one-fourth to one-half of the wheat and cotton crop is rated as in 
poor to very poor condition in several states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand continues to expand, although the pace has eased for 
most types of loans. Philadelphia reports easing in growth for most 
loans, and Atlanta comments that weak loan growth has led lenders to 
encourage borrowing. Home equity loans continue to rise in New York 
and Richmond, although growth in Philadelphia has slowed along with 
other kinds of consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Constraints on credit seem to be primarily in real estate, although 
limited information suggests small business firms in some areas may 
also be affected. New York notes that home builders report a 
shortage of credit for acquisition and construction loans is 
becoming a major problem, especially in downstate New York and 
northern New Jersey. Cleveland points out that credit restraint is 
largely confined to multi-family construction and commercial 
buildings, but that there appears to be ample funds for single-
family housing. San Francisco reports that "lending standards have 
become more stringent in recent months," and both Richmond and St.
Louis reported about credit constraints for the first time this 
month.
