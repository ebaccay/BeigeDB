      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Sixth District contacts indicate that economic activity 
in the Southeast grew somewhat more slowly in July and August than 
during the first half of the year. After recording relatively strong 
growth in the first two quarters, retail sales gains tapered off 
early in the third quarter and have maintained this slower pace of 
growth since. Reports from manufacturers also varied over the same 
period. Firms in the apparel, packaging, and aerospace industries 
reported decelerations in new orders and current production, while 
manufacturers of home furnishings, appliances, and building 
materials reported steady to slight improvements in overall 
activity. Demand for housing-related items continues to be supported 
by single-family home sales and construction, which have remained 
healthy in most of the Southeast. Multifamily and commercial 
construction activity, however, has continued to be sluggish. 
According to bankers, consumer loan demand increased slightly during 
the last two months, while commercial lending was generally flat 
over the same period. Prices generally were said to be stable; some 
firms reported modest wage increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported that consumer spending growth slowed unseasonably 
in July and August. Sales of apparel and other consumer nondurables 
were said to be particularly sluggish. Although sales of furniture, 
appliances, and automobiles have continued to improve on a year-
over-year basis, recent gains have been more muted than earlier in 
the year. While most retailers reported that they continue to expect 
sales during the upcoming holiday shopping season to equal or 
surpass year-ago levels, they said that the recent softening in 
consumer demand has made them more cautious in placing orders. 
Tourism remains strong in the Southeast. Hotel occupancy rates and 
convention attendance are above last year's levels, and most 
industry contacts expect further improvement through the end of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on factory activity in the Southeast were mixed in July and 
August. Textile and apparel industry contacts reported that sluggish 
retail sales had led to reduced orders overall, with the exception 
of denim. Producers of packaging materials reported a fall in new 
orders that they attributed to the recent weakness in consumer 
spending. Chemical producers expressed concern that the floods in 
the Midwest could later contribute to reduced demand for 
agricultural chemicals, while cutbacks in the space station program 
are expected to add to the job losses already experienced in the 
aerospace industry. On the other hand, industries that are closely 
linked to regional and national housing markets have continued to 
report increases in overall business activity. Producers of lumber, 
carpets, appliances, and furniture continued to experience gains in 
production and shipments. However, even in these industries the 
expansion in the volume of new orders has declined frown the more 
rapid pace recorded earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Realtors again reported strong single-family home sales through the 
end of August. Contacts noted that after slowing briefly at the 
beginning of the summer, home sales have picked up again. Year-to-
date sales continue to outpace last year's relatively strong levels. 
New mid-priced homes were said to be selling particularly well, and 
agents noted that inventories of both new and existing homes for 
sale were tight in many market areas. Home builders reported that 
increases in demand had kept them extremely busy through August, and 
that they saw signs of a shortage of subcontractors available to 
work on new projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Multifamily and commercial construction activity remained sluggish 
across the District, though several contacts noted improvement in 
vacancy and rental rates in their market areas. In particular, large 
blocks of space are becoming scarce in some of the more desirable 
locations. However, no new speculative building projects were 
announced.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers from across the Southeast reported that loan demand was flat 
or up modestly in August. Loans for automobile purchases have been 
the source of most of the growth in new consumer loans. Residential 
mortgage lending also has continued to increase, but bankers said 
that about three-quarters of this activity was due to refinancings. 
Business lending has been flat and dominated by debt refinancing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory contacts reported that prices for both raw materials and 
finished goods have been stable in the last two months. However, 
home builders noted that lumber prices were beginning to rise again 
in anticipation of increased demand from the rebuilding in the 
Midwestern flood areas. In regard to wages, several firms said that 
they were giving their employees only cost-of-living wage increases.
