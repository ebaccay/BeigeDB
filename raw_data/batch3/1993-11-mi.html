      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 3, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Moderate growth continues to characterize the economy of the Ninth 
Federal Reserve District. Employment is growing modestly in all 
district states, and unemployment rates have declined slightly. 
Prices are stable, with no indication of inflationary pressures. 
Construction remains strong throughout virtually all areas of the 
district. Manufacturing is stable. Mining output is unchanged in 
spite of one iron mine closing, and there is increased oil 
exploration. The livestock sector shows good prices and output. But 
crop output is down sharply and spending by farmers has reportedly 
slumped. Retails sales of general merchandise vary across the 
district, although vehicle sales are up slightly. The summer tourist 
season turned out to be quite good in most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continue to show moderate improvement. Non-farm 
employment in August and September continued above year-earlier 
levels in all Ninth District states. Unemployment rates had declined 
year-on-year in all states. Sioux Falls, S.D. a particularly tight 
labor market, had an unemployment rate of 1.6 percent as businesses 
report difficulty finding qualified help New claims for unemployment 
in September were below month-earlier and year-earlier levels in 
most district states. One iron mine in Minnesota was closed in 
October, putting 700 miners out of work, and a telephone company 
announced that it will lay off over 1,700 workers in four district 
states.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is virtually no sign of inflationary pressures. Food, general 
merchandise and energy prices show little change from a year ago. 
New wage settlements are said to include small increases. Unions are 
reportedly seeking employment stability and continuation of existing 
benefit levels rather than increases in direct wages. A director 
noted that one mining firm signed an unprecedented six-year contract 
that included wage increases of 2 percent or less per year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and light commercial construction is apparently the 
strongest sector in the economy. New permits for single-family 
housing in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area continue about 10 percent 
above year-earlier levels, and industry spokespersons rate the 
season as very good. Residential construction is also particularly 
strong in South Dakota cities. Directors and newspapers report good 
retail and other light commercial construction in Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. In Minneapolis-
St. Paul, commercial real estate markets and new construction are 
reportedly good in suburban areas but continue weak in downtown
areas. In August, publicly awarded construction contracts in 
Minnesota and the Dakotas dropped below year-earlier figures for the 
first time in 1993, but strengthened in September. Awards that month 
were 6 percent above year-earlier levels and year-to-date awards 
were up 11 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing shows moderate growth. Weather-adjusted electricity 
usage by manufacturers continues to grow slightly above trend 
levels. One director reported that manufacturing firms are investing 
to replace obsolescent equipment or to improve productivity, but not 
to expand total capacity. Publicly traded manufacturing firms 
continue to report moderately improved revenues. A director noted 
greatest strength in instrumentation and biomedical equipment, but a 
slump in sales of goods for schools.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Metal mining output appears stable. Copper output in September and 
October is apparently unchanged from earlier months in spite of 
declining prices, but one Montana official warned that one mine may 
halt production soon if some price upturn does not occur. An iron 
mine in Minnesota was closed indefinitely following a strike, but 
the owners said they would buy output from other mines in the area. 
All other iron mines in the Lake Superior region now have signed 
labor contracts. Gold production in Montana and South Dakota mines 
continues above year-earlier levels and mine expansions are 
reportedly under consideration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Drilling rig counts are up significantly from 1992 in both North 
Dakota and Montana, and one firm had a very good strike near 
Dickinson, N.D. Several refineries in Minnesota and Montana are 
completing upgrading projects, and refineries across the district 
are reportedly running at full capacity. North Dakota coal 
production is down slightly over the year to date as a result of 
slack consumption by utilities over the cool summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Traditional lumber output is declining in South Dakota and Montana 
as a result of dwindling availability of timber. One small sawmill 
in Rapid City closed and a much larger Montana operation is 
scheduled to close soon. But plants in Minnesota, Wisconsin and 
Michigan producing wood-based lumber substitutes are reportedly 
running at full capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is a marked contrast between crop and livestock enterprises in 
agriculture. As a result of adverse weather experienced throughout 
the growing season, crops are poor in all Ninth District states with 
the exception of Montana. The Agricultural Statistics Service 
estimated on Oct. 1 that corn, soybean and wheat production for 1993 
will be down from 20 percent to 50 percent from normal levels in 
Minnesota and the Dakotas. Grain quality is generally poor, and 
wheat producers in Minnesota and North Dakota have experienced great 
difficulty in harvesting waterlogged fields. Edible bean production 
in these areas is also down. The sugar crop reportedly shows average 
yields in spite of harvesting difficulties. Montana is an exception 
to the generally bleak crop situation; the 1993 wheat crop was 9 
percent above the previous record and nearly 40 percent above 1992. 
The Ninth District's latest quarterly survey of agricultural credit 
conditions showed a sharp drop in bankers' estimates of farm income 
and spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, output in the livestock sector, particularly for meat 
animals, has remained stable. Cattle prices, while still good 
relative to long-run trend, are declining somewhat, but slaughter 
numbers are above year-earlier levels. Hog prices are stable, with 
slaughter numbers down only slightly from 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Available reports suggest little change in consumer spending on 
general merchandise, with poor sales in eastern areas of the 
district offsetting somewhat stronger sales in the west. One firm 
with department stores in the eastern half of the region reports 
that "sales are tough." And a Minnesota-based national retailer 
describes same-store sales increases as "disappointing." But news 
media and mall managers in regional centers in the Dakotas and 
Montana continue to report good business. Vehicle sales are 
reportedly above year-earlier levels in most states, though down 
somewhat in North Dakota and areas of Minnesota and South Dakota 
affected by flooding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the district enjoyed strong late summer and early fall 
tourist seasons. Casino visitors and campers boosted spending to 
three-year highs in northern Michigan. Bridge officials at Mackinac 
and Sault Ste. Marie report crossings up 8 percent and 3 percent, 
respectively, during September and October in comparison to year-
earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Northern Wisconsin resorts and restaurants report unusually heavy 
business for October, according to a chamber of commerce official. 
While outdoor activities saw modest improvement in Minnesota, 
tourist officials cite active shopping by visitors in Minneapolis-
St. Paul.
     </p>
     <p>
      A South Dakota tourism attraction reported a record year so far, 
with a 10 percent increase in business this fall compared to last 
year. Five consecutive years of record tourism in Montana probably 
ended this year, although inquiries were up 4 percent in September 
over year-earlier levels, according to tourist authorities. While 
totals didn't match last year's boom, North Dakota reported 
improvement in late summer.
