      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Slow growth continues in the Tenth District economy. Although retail 
sales are improving, new car sales are mixed. Manufacturers report 
significantly higher input prices and strains on capacity. District 
farmers and ranchers are generally in relatively good financial 
condition after strong income growth last year. Housing activity is 
little changed from a year ago, however, and home mortgage demand is 
steady to lower as rates trend higher. Uncertainty about world oil 
production and prices continues to restrict improvement in the 
energy sector. Loan demand at commercial banks remains relatively 
stable, while deposit growth is somewhat weaker.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents report current-dollar sales slightly ahead of a 
year ago, and all respondents report improving sales over the last 
three months. Promotional activity, in general, is at a normal 
level. Prices have been relatively steady. All respondents are 
satisfied with their inventories, which for the most part remain 
lean. Retailers expect sales to hold at current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales results have been mixed, with some respondents reporting 
increases over the past month and others reporting decreases. 
Adequate dealer and customer financing is generally available. Most 
dealers report satisfactory inventory levels, although some desire a 
slight inventory reduction. In general, dealers expect 1999 sales to 
be near 1988 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents indicate input prices are up relative to a year ago 
and are significantly higher than three months ago. Price increases 
are expected to continue the rest of the year. Despite some 
increases in lead times, firms report few difficulties getting 
materials and do not anticipate future problems. Inventory levels 
are generally satisfactory, though some firms plan increases. Plants 
are operating close to full capacity, but no bottlenecks or labor 
shortages are reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite the firming of oil prices since the beginning of the year, 
the district's energy industry shows few signs of improvement. 
Uncertainty about OPEC's resolve to rein in production has held down 
drilling activity in the region and nationwide. The average number 
of active drilling rigs in the district fell from 246 in January to 
219 in February, a fifth below the average of one year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District housing activity is generally unchanged from a year ago. 
Most homebuilders report housing starts were stronger in January 
than in December, in large part due to good weather conditions. 
Single-family construction continues to be such stronger than multi-
family construction. New home sales and prices generally have been 
steady. Most respondents expect steady or improved housing activity 
in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents from district savings and loan institutions report 
a net outflow of savings deposits over the last month. In almost all 
cases, net deposit flows were less favorable than a year ago but 
either unchanged or improved from January. Most respondents expect 
net outflows of deposits to continue over the near term. Almost all 
respondents noted adverse reactions of depositors to the recent 
publicity regarding the savings and loan industry. Mortgage demand 
is steady to lower. Nearly all respondents report mortgage rates are 
trending higher. Respondents expect rates to be steady to slightly 
higher in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of district banks surveyed report little change in loan 
demand over the past month. Commercial real estate loans were down 
slightly, while consumer real estate loans increased. Responses 
regarding consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans were 
mixed. As the survey was taken, virtually all banks were in the 
process of making their second 50 basis point increase in their 
prime rate within a month. Deposits at district banks were constant 
to down slightly over the past month. All categories of transaction 
accounts showed weakness, and remaining deposit categories were 
essentially unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most district farmers and ranchers withstood last year's drought and 
entered 1989 in relatively solid financial condition. Farmland 
values continued a steady rise toward yearend and are now 16 percent 
above the lows recorded in late 1986. Results of spring credit 
reviews by district agricultural bankers reflect generally high farm 
incomes in 1988. Strong incomes have allowed district farmers and 
ranchers to pay down debt and replace worn farm machinery. Bankers 
throughout the district report agricultural loan demand is generally 
stronger this spring than in recent years. The greater financing 
requirements of a larger planted acreage and smaller advance 
deficiency payments are contributing to increased demand for 
operating credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Much of the district's winter wheat crop is under weather-related 
stress. Warm early winter temperatures and a lack of snow cover left 
the crop vulnerable to subsequent cold weather, but the extent of 
damage is not yet known. Some areas of the district have recently 
received beneficial rains, but subsoil moisture reserves remain 
below normal. Additional rainfall is needed to ensure development of 
the crop through the remainder of the growing season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite continued high cattle prices, little expansion has occurred 
in district cattle herds. Operators are generally maintaining herds 
at current levels. Inadequate wheat pasture in some areas of the 
district and high feed prices have discouraged ranchers from 
enlarging herds.
