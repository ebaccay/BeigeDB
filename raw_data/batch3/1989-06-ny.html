     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A mixed pattern of developments in the Second District economy 
continued during recent weeks. District retailers had over-the-year 
sales gains during both April and May, though the extent of the 
increases varied widely. Unemployment rates in District states have 
seesawed recently but are currently at or below the national level. 
While office leasing activity picked up further, homebuilders 
reported a slower pace of construction. Most small-and medium-sized 
banks reported that demand for commercial loans is generally the 
same or somewhat weaker than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported over-the-year sales gains during both 
April and May though the extent of the increases varied widely. 
April gains ranged between 2.7 percent and 13.6 percent while the 
May range was from 0.5 percent to 6.6 percent. several contacts 
described their April sales as well above plan but a few found 
theirs disappointing. May results were generally below or just about 
on target. Among items in strong demand at District department 
stores throughout the period were women's apparel, accessories and 
cosmetics. Men's apparel and home furnishings also sold well in 
April but demand for them slowed after that.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories at the start of June were characterized by most 
respondents as satisfactory, though in one case only as a result of 
heavy markdowns during recent promotionals. This retailer remarked 
that profit margins at many stores are increasingly being squeezed 
by higher import and supply prices on the one hand and customer 
resistance to paying for these costs on the other.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates have seesawed in recent months but 
currently are at or below the national level with a May reading of 
5.3 percent in New York and 3.0 percent in New Jersey. (The New York 
rate averaged 4.2 percent last year, however.) In New York, 
spokesmen for Grumman now predict that as many as 10,000 to 15,000 
jobs would be lost on Long Island if the Pentagon carries out its 
plan to cancel several Navy aircraft contracts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some 40 percent of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
reported improved business conditions in May, unchanged from the 
last surveys. However, in Buffalo, there was also an increase in the 
percentage of firms with worsened conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several large projects here announced in the District since the last 
report. An aluminum company will invest $175 million over die next 
three years to modernize a sheet-producing plant north of Syracuse, 
and General Electric will produce eight steam turbine engines at its 
Schenectady facility as part of a $750 million order from a foreign 
utility company. Elsewhere, the Yonkers City Council gave final 
approval to a $300 million waterfront project which will include 
apartments, a shopping mall and various recreational facilities, and 
the Islip Town Board approved a master plan for redeveloping an 800-
acre former state hospital into a mixed-use complex composed of 
industrial, office and retail space, a hotel, housing, recreational 
facilities and an expansion of the New York Institute of Technology 
campus. Newark was the site of several recent developments: 
construction was begun on two shopping centers; Seton Hall 
University will build two office towers and expand its law school in 
conjunction with a development corporation and the city; plans were 
also announced for a $130 million office, hotel and retail complex 
to be linked by "skyways" to the nearby railroad station.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders report a slower pace of construction activity 
in recent weeks. In some areas where builders earlier had been quite 
busy, this slowing was attributed in large part to unusually rainy 
weather, which deterred potential buyers from looking and restricted 
the amount of construction which could be done. In other areas, 
however, where large inventories of homes for resale exist, demand 
for new homes continued weak in the face of buyer resistance to high 
prices. Some observers noted a pickup in the remodeling and 
expansion of existing homes by owners unwilling to reduce their 
asking prices. While the current lull in the housing market is 
viewed by many as an inevitable part of a cycle following several 
years of substantial strength, the recent decline in interest rates 
has generated hope that an upturn in buyer enthusiasm will occur.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity picked up further in recent weeks and both 
downtown and midtown Manhattan had volume well above year-earlier 
levels. Despite strong leasing, however, Manhattan vacancy rates 
showed no improvement because of the large amount of additional 
space recently put on the market. Office vacancy rates did edge down 
in some parts of the District such as northern New Jersey and 
Fairfield and Nassau counties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manhattan is currently undergoing a spate of hotel-building activity 
in areas which, until recently, had been deemed unlikely locales. 
Three hotels are under construction near Times Square, where the 
first new hotel opened four years ago, and two others are going up 
in the Wall Street area, where the first hotel opened eight years 
ago. New developments such as tourist attractions, a convention 
center, and a cluster of new office buildings are created with 
turning these areas into more viable hotel sites.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Based on a survey of senior officers at small-and medium-sized banks 
in the Second District, demand for commercial loans is generally the 
same or somewhat weaker than a year ago. Most officers did not 
believe that the rise in interest rates over the past year 
substantially dampened commercial loan demand. In their opinion, 
other factors such as projected sales and expectations of future 
economic conditions are probably more crucial in expansion and 
modernization plans of firms and the subsequent loan demand. With 
regard to particular types of commercial lending, bankers in upstate 
New York tended to report strong demand for construction loans while 
those in the southern portion of the Second District stated that the 
commercial real estate market is quite weak. However, except for the 
real estate sector, most respondents believed that their local 
economy is basically healthy, though only a few noted strong growth. 
The majority of those surveyed expect demand for commercial loans to 
remain stable through 1989, barring a sharp fall in interest rates.
