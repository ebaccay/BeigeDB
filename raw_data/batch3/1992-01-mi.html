      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 22, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's economy has been largely stagnant lately. Labor 
market conditions generally deteriorated. Retail sales increases 
were modest, except in those areas that continue to benefit from the 
influx of Canadian shoppers. New auto sales remain weak, though 
truck sales have rebounded sharply. Construction and manufacturing 
conditions were mixed. Agriculture did well, with high crop yields 
offsetting price declines. Tourism has remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The November unemployment rate in Minnesota was 5.0 percent, 
slightly higher than its 4.7 percent rate of the month before, but 
substantially above its year-ago level of 3.9 percent. The growth of 
Minnesota's nonagricultural employment in November was only 0.38 
percent over the last year, with declines in all sectors except 
government (up 1.02), transportation (up 0.27), and finance, 
insurance, and real estate (up 1.36). In particular, manufacturing 
(down 1.47), mining (down 1.18), and construction (down 7.68) all 
posted substantial declines. The November unemployment rate in 
Montana, at 7.4 percent, was also higher than it was a month ago 
(6.2) or a year ago (6.8). This weakness was also reflected in the 
anemic growth of Montana's nonagricultural employment in November, 
up only 0.96 percent from a year ago. The November unemployment rate 
at 4.0 percent was higher than its month-ago (3.4) or year-ago (3.3) 
levels in North Dakota. November's unemployment rate was higher in 
the Upper Peninsula (up to 11.7 percent from 9.8 percent a year ago) 
and western Wisconsin. The only part of the District in which the 
unemployment rate fell in November was South Dakota, which at 2.8 
percent was down only 0.1 percent from the previous month and 0.4 
percent from a year ago. South Dakota's economic strength was also 
reflected in nonagricultural employment growth which was up 3.0 
percent in November relative to a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Holiday retail sales in the District showed very modest growth. A 
number of major retailers reported sales increases in comparable 
stores ranging from 1 to 6.5 percent in December relative to a year 
ago, with discount chains reporting increases of 6 to 16 percent 
over the same period. Retailers also reported more frequent bad 
checks and shoplifting. Retail sales continued to be strong in those 
parts of Montana. North and South Dakota, and the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan within a reasonable drive from the border due to the 
continuing influx of Canadian shoppers, and hotel occupancy rates in 
these areas were quite high.
     </p>
     <p>
      New truck sales surged in December with some dealers reporting sales 
increases of 83 percent in December relative to a year ago. However, 
year-to-date truck sales were still 9 to 13 percent below last 
year's level. New car sales in the District improved in December, 
but continue to be weak, with local dealers of domestic cars 
reporting year-to-date sales declines ranging from 20 to 25 percent, 
while foreign car dealers reported flat year-to-date sales in 
October. Used car sales continue to be strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing sales improved in the District. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
area, housing sales were up 13 percent in the fourth quarter, and 
3.8 percent year-to-date. This was despite the fact that sales fell 
slightly in December relative to the previous month, and were 
essentially unchanged from their year-ago level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist activity has been excellent in the District. Yellowstone 
National Park had its best year ever. Total bridge crossings onto 
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan this year have been above their 
year-ago levels, with crossings over the Mackinac and International 
bridges in November and December up 4.8 percent and down 0.3 
percent, respectively, relative to their year-ago levels. The 
upcoming Super Bowl is expected to bring $45-$50 million in direct 
expenditures to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Heavy early snow fall 
got the skiing and snowmobiling seasons off to a good start, but the 
lack of recent snow has slowed winter recreation considerably.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's construction industry have been mixed. 
The November level of new housing permits in Minnesota was down 5.6 
percent relative to a year ago, while commercial construction in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area continues to be depressed. Elsewhere, 
construction is reported to be doing well in North and South Dakota, 
and holding its own in Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions were mixed in the District's manufacturing industries. In 
Minnesota, average weekly hours at 40.8 in November were slightly 
higher than their year and month-ago level of 40.5. In contrast, 
Minnesota's November average hourly earnings were up only 2.8 
percent relative to a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      High crop yields in the District generally more than offset price 
declines in 1991. Dry beans and potato production are at record 
levels in both North Dakota and Minnesota. Top soil moisture is in 
good condition for spring planting. Recent milder weather has 
stirred some concern about spoilage in the sugar beet crop. 
Minnesota's mid-December all farm products crop price index was down 
1.5 percent relative to its year ago level, with crop prices up 1.0 
percent, livestock prices down 17.0 percent, dairy products up 21.6 
percent, and poultry products down 2.7 percent over this period. 
Uncertainty about future farm income has depressed farm machinery 
sales somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mining conditions have been mixed in the District. Copper prices are 
holding firm, but oil and molybdenum prices remain low. The lumber 
and wood products market is mixed, with problems due to 
environmental issues anticipated in the near future.
