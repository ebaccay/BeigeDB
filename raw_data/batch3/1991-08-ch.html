      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy generally remained on a modestly 
expanding path in June and early July. District consumer spending 
appears to have risen slightly over this period, according to 
several contacts. On balance, District manufacturing activity 
strengthened in June, and the recovery in the auto sector continued. 
However, several contacts reported that the capital goods sector 
remained weak. Drought-like conditions have placed stress on 
potential District crop yields. Bank credit growth in the District 
was restrained by both demand and supply factors, and commercial 
real estate portfolios continued to weigh on bank capital positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending gains in the District were sluggish in June and 
early July. A recent survey of retailers in Illinois and Michigan 
indicated that June sales were about equal with last year, in 
contrast to a decline nationally. Earlier-than-expected growth in 
sales of seasonal merchandise helped generate a good national retail 
sales report in May, but was followed by some softening in June, 
according to one District contact. Sales were not simply shifted to 
the earlier month; however, as many retailers found themselves low 
on stocks of items that remained in demand through June. Several 
appliance retailers in the Illinois state capital reported that 
year-over-year sales gains resumed after state workers began 
receiving paychecks, which had been suspended during recent budget 
negotiations. The Wisconsin vacation season is going very well, but 
low occupancy rates and heavy discounting continue to depress the 
Detroit hotel industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      National reports showing car sales rising from low levels in March 
and April were joined by increasingly optimistic reports from 
several District auto dealers. The slippage in auto sales reported 
for mid-July may have been due in part to a heat wave that made 
shopping unattractive, according to several dealers. An industry 
economist noted that sales were buttressed by fleet purchases in 
June and should have been expected to ease somewhat, but auto sales 
in the second half of 1991 are still expected to be better than in 
the first half. Several dealers located in stable markets reported 
that sales have begun to show a steady rebound. Dealers located in 
less stable or more diverse markets reported that sales remain 
sluggish, in part due to stricter financing conditions. A 
distributor of transplant autos reported good sales growth in the 
Midwest in June and early July, and market share gains in the 
District continue. Several contacts indicated a growing importance 
of need-based buyers in the sales mix. Fewer buyers are "reaching 
up" to more expensive models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The balance of momentum in District manufacturing activity shifted 
toward expansion in recent months, after lagging other sectors of 
the region's economy. Purchasing managers' surveys around the 
District continued to show improvement. In July, the Chicago index 
registered net expansion for the first time since last August, 
although new orders was the only component to register over 50 
percent. Slower employment cutbacks also contributed to the rise in 
the overall index. Still, the trend in the overall Chicago index has 
been unambiguously positive since a January low. Sharper improvement 
was recorded in June by two surveys in Michigan. The Detroit index 
for June registered what the survey director described as "the first 
full-fledged recovery signal," with above-average gains recorded in 
the auto sector. A survey conducted in Southwest Michigan has shown 
solid expansion for several months, and sharp gains in the 
employment and production components of the June index joined 
continued expansion in new orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports by individual manufacturers suggested continued gains in 
production of consumer durable goods, while reports from capital 
goods manufacturers were mixed. A large steel producer reported that 
its order book points toward shipment increases through the end of 
the third quarter (on a seasonally adjusted basis), and additional 
growth is anticipated in the fourth quarter as well. This contact 
cited strength in orders from auto and appliance manufacturers, 
while bookings from producers of construction equipment, 
agricultural machinery, and office furniture remained soft. A large 
electronics supplier reported that new orders gains, which began in 
April, continued through June. A manufacturer of paper containers 
reported that year-over-year shipment growth returned in June, after 
new weakening was recorded earlier in the second quarter. This 
contact also cited strength in orders from appliance manufacturers. 
A survey of printers indicated modest yet clear improvement in 
orders from District manufacturers in May and June. Heavy-duty truck 
orders softened in June, but only after an earlier surge generated 
by a price increase announcement, and one large manufacturer delayed 
a temporary factory shutdown for the second time. Several other 
capital goods producers, which typically lag in the early stages of 
a recovery, reported that orders remain soft. Sales and rentals of 
construction equipment remained weak. Promotional activity bolstered 
sales of agricultural machinery in the second quarter, but one 
manufacturer stated that diminishing earnings prospects have 
dampened farmers' capital spending plans, both domestically and 
internationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crops in major portions of the District have been under considerable 
stress recently because of the drought-like conditions that have 
prevailed since the end of May. The hardest hit areas stretch from 
north central Indiana to central Iowa. Many observers believe that 
corn yields in the hard-hit areas suffered considerable irreversible 
losses during the past two weeks. Forecasts of continued hot and dry 
weather during early August raise the possibility of more extensive 
crop damage, especially for soybeans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The need to strengthen capital positions and uncertainty over the 
future course of financial market regulation continued to suppress 
the demand for and supply of District bank credit. One large bank 
reported that its loan portfolio declined in the second quarter, 
despite the bank's growth objective. Customer demand ebbed in 
several areas, including cyclically-sensitive working capital 
financing. A middle-market bank in Michigan reported net shrinkage 
in its loan portfolio in recent months, after showing growth through 
most of 1990 and into early 1991. A contact with this bank stated 
that improving customer cash flow led to higher levels of debt 
retirement, which combined with low levels of demand for new 
financing to produce a net decrease in the portfolio. The surge in 
long-term debt issuance since the first quarter also contributed to 
the decline. A bank economist cited uncertainty over the future 
structure of financial market regulation as an important factor 
affecting banking markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction loans secured by real estate continue to 
weigh on bank capital positions, according to a recent survey of 
large District banks and branches of large foreign banks. Roughly 
one-third of these loans that expired over the past year were 
retired as specified in the loan contract. Most respondents expect 
the proportion of loans requiring renegotiation or foreclosure to 
rise over the next twelve months. However, most respondents had not 
yet committed to internal refunding of the credits scheduled to 
mature over the next year, and few contacts had purchased 
commitments by other lenders to provide takeout financing. Still, 
several lenders reported making new commercial construction loans in 
1991, suggesting that at least some credit-worthy projects continue 
to find funding.
