     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity in all Districts seems to be slowing 
across most sectors. Retail sales generally continue to sag yet 
inventory levels appear satisfactory and the outlook remains 
optimistic. An important exception is auto sales which are strong in 
most areas and the strength is extending to suppliers. While primary 
metals manufacturing is improving in some areas, manufacturing 
growth in general seems to be modest or declining. Residential 
construction is a source of strength throughout the country, but 
signs of weakness exist in parts of some districts. Non-residential 
construction is mixed. Agricultural conditions remain difficult 
almost everywhere, but financial problems appear concentrated in the 
Plains states. Mining and drilling activity is declining throughout 
the country. Bank loan activity is mixed with most growth occurring 
in the consumer sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending has slowed in recent weeks and continues to vary 
widely across the country. Six districts report generally weak 
sales; strong sales are reported by Richmond and St. Louis. Atlanta 
and San Francisco report a more mixed picture with significant 
growth in much of their districts but still some sluggishness in 
certain areas. In general, demand in the automotive sector appears 
strong, as a result of lower interest rates and promotions by 
manufacturers and dealers. Retailers' inventories were generally at 
satisfactory levels, but Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City 
report that some actions have been taken to reduce stocks. 
Automobile dealers reported tight inventories, especially for 
imports, in three midwest Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for consumer spending was generally optimistic across 
the country; lower interest rates and increased mailings of tax 
refunds were commonly expected to boost demand. Only Dallas 
mentioned expectations of further slowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity seems to have slowed in much of the country, 
but remains varied across districts and industries. Five districts 
reported weak or slowing industrial activity, and four reported 
stable levels or only modest growth. The only report of sharp 
improvement was for Missouri. The outlook generally is for little 
change, but Philadelphia and Cleveland report moderation of growth 
forecasts, Dallas reports an increase in optimism, and some 
observers in the Eighth District expect a slight improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business for primary metals producers was mixed. Continued distress 
for steelmakers was reported in the Cleveland district and in the 
Chicago area. Minneapolis noted that iron ore processing cutbacks 
are soon expected. However, steel and other metals producers report 
gains in the Dallas District as well as in New York. Alabama, and 
the Detroit area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two districts report slowing in high-tech industries, Boston and San 
Francisco both report weakness among semiconductor firms (with signs 
of recovery only in Arizona), attributed to weak domestic demand. 
Business for New England computer manufacturers was mixed. Suppliers 
to the auto industry have benefitted from that industry's strength, 
according to reports from Boston and Chicago. Energy-related 
producers in three districts report slack demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then were several reports of hardship caused by import competition 
and the strong dollar. Reports of adverse impacts come from 
steelmakers (Cleveland), manufacturers of home appliances and 
capital equipment (Chicago), paper producers (Atlanta and Dallas), 
the lumber industry (San Francisco), and apparel and textiles firms 
(Richmond and Atlanta).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity varied greatly across the United States. 
Residential construction has been proceeding at an exceptionally 
rapid pace according to New York, Boston, Minneapolis. and Richmond; 
but Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City report some areas with 
significant weakness. Non-residential construction slowed in the New 
York and St. Louis districts, and Cleveland indicates that no new 
construction contracts are expected for the next few years due to 
recent overbuilding. In contrast, absorption is "strong as ever" in 
Atlanta. The market was "vigorous" in the Chicago district but 
observers believe a glut may develop next year when a great deal of
space comes on line. Industrial construction has been increasing 
according to reports from Richmond.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weak prices across commodities continue to compound the difficult 
conditions in the farm sector. Dairy prices and output are weakening 
largely due to reduced federal support. St. Louis, Dallas, and San 
Francisco report attempts to reduce inventory in livestock. Good 
weather and early planting using full acreage should yield large 
harvests in the autumn in most areas except South Dakota and 
Montana, where dry conditions currently prevail. This may put 
additional price pressure on farmers. Vegetable, fruit, and poultry 
producers in the Mid-Atlantic and the West coast, however, seem to 
face a much better outlook than others.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most natural resource industries seem to be hard hit. Dallas notes a 
continued slide in the number of drilling rigs, primarily due to 
declining petroleum prices. Richmond and San Francisco report 
employment declines in mining. Minneapolis contacts, however, 
observe a boom in the wood products industry as a result of strong 
construction activity. Forest fires in the Sixth District have 
created tremendous, and largely uninsured, timber losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite the sluggishness of retail spending, growth in total loans 
seems to be sustained primarily by consumer lending. St. Louis, for 
example, reports a retail lending increase of more than 30 percent 
over last year. Chicago notes, however, that the rapid rise in 
consumer credit is accompanied by a rising delinquency rate. For the 
most part, real estate lending remains strong, while weakness in 
commercial lending seems widespread and Dallas has even been 
experiencing a decline in business loan volume. Only Philadelphia 
and San Francisco report continued strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial pressures in agriculture seen to remain concentrated in 
the Plains states. Kansas City reports that agricultural bank 
closings have shut many farmers out of the credit markets due in 
part to higher credit standards of the remaining banks. Chicago adds 
that pressures seem to be increasing on the cooperative Farm Credit 
System.
