      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 19, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy continued mixed to 
somewhat soft during recent weeks. On the positive side, 
unemployment rates remained below the national average and the pace 
of office leasing was good in much of the region. Retailers reported 
disappointing sales results, however, and homebuilders reported no 
improvement in market conditions. Most respondents surveyed at small 
and medium-size banks described current economic conditions as soft 
or slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported disappointing sales results since they 
were last contacted and a worsening of conditions as the period 
progressed. All our contacts reported year-over-year declines in 
August as consumers seemed increasingly reluctant to spend. This 
compares with over-the-year sales gains that were somewhat below 
plan but, in most cases, positive during July. Big ticket items such 
as furniture and rugs were especially hard-hit and other types of 
home furnishing were also weak. Sales of men's and women's apparel 
showed some improvement, though.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales results in July ranged widely-from -6 percent to 
+14 percent-but in August results clustered in a -10 percent to -2 
percent range. Despite the below-plan sales volume, however, 
inventories were reported at comfortable levels and, in some cases, 
below plan. One retailer did remark that if consumer spending 
continues weak, a cutback in the targeted level of inventories will 
probably take place.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders report no improvement in market conditions 
during recent weeks. In downstate New York and northern New Jersey 
residential construction activity continues to be very slow and 
respondents do not anticipate an improvement in the foreseeable 
future. Housing starts have also declined in some upstate New York 
areas, but the over-the-year slowdown was from a previously high 
level of activity and has not been as severe as in other parts of 
the region. The shortage of credit for acquisition and construction 
loans continues to be a problem. In addition, some respondents noted 
that potential buyers are hesitant because of softness in the 
economy and uncertainty about the impact of the Middle East crisis.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of office leasing remained good in much of the District 
during recent weeks as tenants continued to avail themselves of 
generous landlord concessions. Leasing in midtown Manhattan was the 
highest in several months and leasing in downtown Manhattan also 
expanded. However, with the addition of two newly completed 
buildings in mid-Manhattan, the midtown vacancy rate moved somewhat 
higher though the downtown rate held steady. Westchester County 
reports a reduction in the amount of leasing activity as very few 
large-scale transactions have recently taken place, and the 
absorption of vacant space in northern New Jersey has also slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates remained below the national average in 
August. New York's rate declined to 5.0 percent from 5.3 percent in 
July while New Jersey's rate was unchanged at 4.8 percent. 
Employment conditions vary greatly within the District, however, 
with increased weakness in the New York metropolitan area coupled 
with strength in some other areas. A recent BLS study found that 
during the first five months of this year a loss of several thousand 
private sector jobs occurred in New York City and northeastern New 
Jersey--the first drop in local private employment since 1982. On 
the other hand, some areas in upstate New York and parts of New 
Jersey have reportedly been experiencing labor shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The percentage of Buffalo purchasing managers reporting an increase 
in new orders rebounded in August after a sharp drop in July. The 
percentage with stable or greater production also rose. In the July 
survey of Rochester managers, however, only 25 percent of 
respondents anticipated improved conditions over the next three 
months, down from 47 percent in June. The outlook for capital 
investment in both areas was described as generally weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents surveyed at small and medium-size banks in the 
District described current economic conditions as soft or slow. All 
of the banks that make business loans reported weaker demand, while 
demand for consumer and home equity loans has been mixed. Although 
several bankers stated that real estate loan demand had declined 
significantly, two bankers noted increased activity in August after 
a decline in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Just under half of the bankers surveyed said that they had begun to 
tighten credit standards on all types of loans. Over sixty percent 
of those making business loans had tightened standards on those 
loans. While none of the surveyed banks have raised interest rates 
as a means of tightening credit, about half have reduced the maximum 
lines of credit available to new borrowers and increased collateral 
requirements. One banker stated that his bank will scrutinize loan 
applications more carefully because of an anticipated recession. All 
of the bankers tightening credit gave a less favorable economic 
outlook as the main reason, and almost three quarters cited a 
deterioration in the quality of their loan portfolios as well. About 
half mentioned that they had faced more loan defaults and increasing 
regulatory pressures. Of the banks which had not tightened credit 
only one expected to do so in the near future. Most of the others 
will continue to lend both because they have an adequate supply of 
funds, and because qualified borrowers are still in the market.
