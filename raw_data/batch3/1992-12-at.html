      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts in the Sixth District, the Southeast economy 
was showing signs of moderate improvement through the end of 
November. After the first weekend of the holiday shopping season, 
retailers report sales increases across a broad range of goods, and 
most merchants believe that this season will be the most profitable 
one in three years. Most manufacturers indicate that factory 
activity has held steady in recent weeks, but persistent weakness is 
reported by firms linked to defense production. Home builders and 
realtors say that single-family residential markets remain healthy, 
and contacts in south Florida note that the hurricane rebuilding 
effort has begun to stimulate local construction and retail sales. 
Commercial construction, however, continues to be slow in most 
areas, and business and consumer loan demand remains muted. On the 
inflation front, most contacts report that they have seen no signs 
of upward pressure on either wages or prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers throughout the District were upbeat in their assessment of 
sales through the end of November. Weekend sales following 
Thanksgiving were reported to be above year-ago levels throughout 
the District. Increases have been reported across a broad range of 
goods, with nondurable items leading the way, but sales of durable 
goods such as home furnishings, electronics, and appliances have 
also shown improvement. Inventories are relatively lean as planned, 
and merchants expect this season to be characterized by fewer 
discounts and higher profit margins than in the past few years. 
Retailers are in the process of hiring seasonal employees to meet 
this annual surge in activity, and most indicate that they will hold 
the line even if sales are stronger than anticipated. Although auto 
dealers have seen little change in showroom traffic in recent weeks, 
the majority continue to report at least modest increases in sales 
over year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers' reports on factory activity were mixed in November. 
Some industries continue to be plagued by persistent weakness. This 
is particularly true of defense contractors, several of which have 
announced plans to cut a substantial number of jobs at District 
plants. Firms linked to the production of communications equipment 
and autos have also reported slowing production, shipments, and new 
orders. Producers of nondurable goods, however, generally have 
recorded moderate increases in factory activity. Apparel and textile 
manufacturers characterize current levels of production and 
shipments as encouraging, but they expect a leveling off by early 
next year as their backlogs are reduced and customers' inventories 
restored. Manufacturers of building supplies and other home products 
continue to report increases in demand stemming from the hurricane 
rebuilding effort. Producers of shingles, plywood, roofing felt, and 
carpeting report that they are running their plants at capacity 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After taking into account normal seasonal patterns, most residential 
realtors report that conditions continue to improve in single-family 
housing markets. Low-to-mid priced homes are still the best sellers, 
but the market for trade ups and more expensive homes has improved. 
Builders note steady single-family construction activity, and a 
growing minority are seeing increases in speculative building. 
Multifamily and commercial construction, however, remains slow in 
most parts of the District and contacts suggest that there is little 
near-term prospect for improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      South Florida is beginning to experience the expected increase in 
economic activity as a result of the hurricane rebuilding effort. In 
particular, contacts report that the local economy of Dade county 
has recorded substantial increases in both retail sales and 
construction. However, contacts also report that a number of 
individuals and families have opted to move out of the area rather 
than to rebuild their damaged or destroyed homes. On the commercial 
side, realtors in areas around Dade county have seen a surge in 
short-term leasing from companies whose facilities were damaged by 
the storm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers around the District report that loan demand was flat to up 
slightly through the end of November. Mortgage refinancings still 
represent the most prevalent form of loan activity, but contacts 
believe that this wave of refinancings has finally peaked. Other 
forms of consumer lending have shown some improvement in recent 
weeks, particularly auto financing in parts Florida and Georgia. 
Commercial lending, however, is reported to be flat, and most loan 
applications have been for refinancing, debt consolidation, or 
acquisitions, rather than new business activity. Contacts in Miami 
have seen deposits rise by about 10 percent since the hurricane, but 
there still have not been any reports of a significant increase in 
commercial or consumer lending in the area. Small business continues 
to report difficulties obtaining credit, although conditions have 
not worsened. It appears that lenders are becoming more aggressive 
in consumer lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wages and Prices
Contacts report that wage pressures are practically nonexistent. 
Firms continue to focus on cost cutting, including workforce 
reductions, in order to improve balance sheets. Materials input 
prices have remained stable for most producers, and competitive 
market forces have foiled recent attempts to raise prices of final 
products.
