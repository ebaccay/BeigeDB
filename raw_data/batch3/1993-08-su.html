     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 4, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Federal Reserve Districts reported that economic activity 
continued to expand slowly to moderately in June and the first half 
of July. Flooding inflicted considerable damage in parts of the 
Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts, but the 
effects of flooding were said to be highly concentrated and were not 
seen to threaten overall economic expansion in any District. Single-
family home construction continued as a source of strength for many 
areas of the country. Retail sales grew across most Districts 
although the rate of increase varied widely. Auto sales rose in many 
areas of the country. Price pressures in the markets for materials 
and finished products were reported to be mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output growth was described as generally sluggish in 
most Districts although conditions varied. Most Districts said that 
manufacturers have not increased employment and do not plan to for 
the remainder of the year. Several Districts noted weak sales to 
Europe, but strong exports to developing countries. The Cleveland 
District reported strong demand for steel and heavy truck 
components, but softening orders in several other industries. 
Respondents in the Chicago District cited a modest slowdown in 
industrial expansion, although auto and heavy truck production 
remained high. The Atlanta and Dallas Districts noted modest growth 
in overall output, but found strong growth among sectors tied to 
residential construction. Rates of expansion for manufacturing 
output in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts were unchanged. 
Growth in Boston and Minneapolis was generally considered sluggish. 
The San Francisco District reported weakness in aerospace and 
defense-related industries, and strength in textiles and apparel and 
in computer-related industries located outside of Silicon Valley.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions were said to be generally favorable, 
although flooding and drought have destroyed crops in several 
Districts. Overall, agricultural conditions were seen as favorable 
in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Kansas City and St. Louis 
reported that, in areas not affected by wet weather and flooding, 
crops were mostly in good condition and farmers were benefiting from 
higher grain prices. Kansas City also noted that a large wheat crop 
was expected and many farmers anticipated strong earnings. In the 
Minneapolis District, above-normal precipitation has been a boon to 
cattle raisers, and pasture and range conditions in the Dakotas and 
Montana were said to be the best in many years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several Districts reported too much rain, too little rain, or both. 
Crop prospects are uncertain in many of these areas and will be 
determined by conditions between now and the frost. Atlanta, St. 
Louis and Richmond reported that hot dry weather has damaged crops 
in their Districts. High temperatures and drought have weakened 
rangeland and pastures in the Dallas District. Heavy rains and 
flooding ruined crops in portions of the Chicago, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. The Minneapolis and Kansas 
City Districts noted that corn and soybean crops were particularly 
hard hit by heavy rains and flooding. Minneapolis reported that 
unseasonably cool weather slowed crop development across the 
District. Chicago also reported that crops have been slow to
develop.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Richmond and San Francisco Districts said seafood production has 
declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales were reported to have increased somewhat in most 
Districts, although Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia 
reported that sales weakened slightly in July. Overall sales 
strengthened in the last month in Kansas City and Minneapolis, but 
both the Minneapolis and Chicago Districts noted slow sales in 
flooded areas. Apparel demand was reported to be higher in the 
Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia Districts and weak or 
sluggish in the Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City Districts. 
Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City all reported increased 
auto sales. Philadelphia reported that, while growth of auto sales 
slowed somewhat in July, sales were expected to be above last 
summer's rate. Retail and auto sales were said to be mixed in the 
San Francisco District.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Atlanta, Richmond, San Francisco, and portions of the Minneapolis 
District, tourism was strong and the New York District reported 
minor gains in tourism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction and real estate activity remained strong in 
most Districts. Minneapolis reported that residential and commercial 
construction was perhaps the strongest component in the region's 
economy. Housing activity continued to increase in the Chicago 
District, but growth was thought to have slowed somewhat. San 
Francisco reported strong housing markets for most of the District, 
although southern California and western Washington were exceptions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity remained sluggish or weak in most 
areas of the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Dallas, Kansas City and Atlanta Districts reported that higher 
natural gas prices have led to increased drilling, and a rise in 
activity for related service companies. Although drilling is 
generally expected to continue its upturn, Dallas respondents said 
that lower oil prices have clouded the drilling outlook for the 
second half of the year. In the San Francisco District, recent 
Alaskan oil discoveries were said to have improved the prospects for 
economic activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mineral mining activity was mixed. The San Francisco District noted 
weaker mining activity in Utah, Idaho and Alaska, while iron output 
increased slightly in Minneapolis. Timber and logging activity was 
also cited as weakening in the San Francisco District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many Districts reported that business loan demand was unchanged, and 
that demand for mortgage refinancing was strong. According to 
respondents in the New York District, commercial and industrial loan 
demand continued to rise. Bankers in the Philadelphia District 
indicated that lending was generally unchanged although borrowing 
increased slightly among middle market companies. The Atlanta and 
St. Louis Districts noted recent strength in auto loans. The 
Cleveland District reported that business loans had softened and 
that consumer loans had leveled off, after a surge last spring. In 
the Kansas City District, consumer loans have increased, while 
business loans were flat to slightly up. Dallas said that overall 
loan demand had declined. Respondents in the San Francisco District 
said that banking conditions in California continued to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports suggested that price pressures were mixed. The San 
Francisco and Richmond Districts saw some increased prices for 
building materials and other raw materials. New York and Minneapolis 
Districts reported that lumber prices have declined. Manufacturing 
input prices were stable to slightly higher in Kansas City. Chicago 
mentioned higher prices for auto parts. Boston reported that auto 
parts suppliers are under much pressure to freeze or reduce prices, 
and that they will try to offset higher material prices with 
productivity gains. Retail prices were reported to be very 
competitive in New York. Chicago, Cleveland, and Dallas mentioned 
that several retailers have lowered their prices. Kansas City 
District retailers said they were holding prices steady. The 
Richmond District reported that retail prices were rising. Atlanta 
and Minneapolis noted stable price levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Higher prices were reported for natural gas, but lower prices for 
oil. Several Districts reported higher agricultural prices, 
particularly in areas affected by flooding.
