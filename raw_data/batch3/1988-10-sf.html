      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 18, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economy of the Twelfth District continues to grow, with little 
sign of a change in direction. Growth remains strong in the Pacific 
Northwest and California, and the weaker economies in other parts of 
the District show few signs of further slowing. The Business 
Sentiment survey reveals that respondents are becoming more 
pessimistic about future national growth and unemployment, but they 
report few signs of an impending slowdown. Retail sales improved in 
September, although they remain generally lackluster. Construction 
has been strong in the Northwest, while slow in Arizona and Utah. 
Housing prices continue to boom in Southern California, Washington,
and Oregon, although some slowing of sales is reported in Northern 
California. Manufacturing remains strong in aircraft, electronics, 
paper, aluminum, and machinery. Output in forest products industries 
has slowed, but rains at a high level. Agriculture remains strong in 
the District, while gains in refining profits have offset the 
negative effect of falling oil prices on production in the energy 
sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continuing the trend reported last month, respondents have become 
more pessimistic about GNP growth. Over 40 percent of the 
respondents to the Twelfth District Sentiment Survey expect growth 
to slow, up from 34 percent in September. Expectations about housing 
starts remain low, with 83 percent anticipating further slowing, and 
no respondents anticipating an improvement. Concern about inflation 
has moderated since the last report, although concern about 
unemployment is increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite a drop in expectations about overall growth, the respondents 
did not report any immediate signs of slowing in the regional 
economy. The rapidly growing Northwest is expected to continue to 
boom, while the slower-growing areas see no signs of further 
slowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales improved in the District in September from August 
levels, but overall activity remains sluggish. Retailers report 
softer-than-expected sales in September, although one respondent in 
Washington reports a 14 percent rise in retail sales over last year. 
Classified advertising volumes continue to drop in Los Angeles and 
in the nation, indicating a slowdown in consumer spending and the 
consolidation of the industry. Upward price pressure continues to 
appear in imported products, but the soft retail market is making it 
difficult to make price increases stick at the retail level. 
Inventories are reported to be in line with desired levels. 
Retailers note some problems attracting qualified sales people, and 
register concern about a possible increase in the minimum wage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers report price increases of 4 to 5 percent on both 
domestic and imported 1989 cars. A substantial number of 1988 models 
remain in dealer inventories, and GM has extended its rebates to 
eliminate the surplus. One respondent reports fairly high sales of 
new cars and light trucks in the Southern California area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues to exhibit strength, particularly 
in the Pacific Northwest. Pulp and paper production remains strong, 
although some slowing in growth is being noted and some inventories 
are rising. Several respondents report significant increases in farm 
equipment purchases, with some shortages evident. Moreover 
construction equipment sales are reported strong in Utah. The 
slowing expansion of the wood products industry is being offset by 
continued expansion of aerospace, aluminum, shipping, and electronic 
industries in the Northwest, with Boeing near capacity and delivery 
times lengthening. Some concern about semiconductor demand is being 
voiced in the San Francisco area, and Arizona respondents remain
concerned about the effect of IBM's plant closure. Food processing 
and canning industries are expanding in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity are highly variable in the 
District. Construction has been strong this past summer in 
Washington and Oregon, and housing prices have increased sharply in 
Southern California. The strength of the Washington economy is now 
boosting prices in that region as well. Some slowing of sales has 
been noted in the San Francisco area. In contrast, construction in 
Arizona is called the slowest in 15 years, and construction, other 
than for road building, remains depressed in Utah.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture has had a strong year in the District. Yields in most 
areas are average or down mildly, but the higher prices have more 
than compensated. Inventories of table grapes are high, the tomato 
crop has been damaged by heat, and almonds have been bothered by 
insects, but prices have been strong. Livestock producers report 
strong prices, although feedlot producers are losing profits to 
higher feed costs. The wood products industry is still strong, 
although production of lumber and plywood has begun to fall. 
Excessive fire danger and environmental restrictions are limiting 
access to forests, decreasing the supply of logs. The shortage of 
logs has boosted prices in the Northwest. In the energy sector, the 
recent drop in oil prices has had little negative impact so far. 
Drillers are waiting to see if the lower price persists before 
changing plans, while refiners and retailers are enjoying the 
highest margins in years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Strong competition among banks for quality loans continues to be 
reported in the District, particularly in the Northwest and 
California. Conditions are improving in agricultural areas, with a 
drop in non-performing loans and improved asset quality. Loan growth 
is above expectations in Washington. Several respondents cited 
problems competing with below-market offers by Savings and Loan 
institutions.
