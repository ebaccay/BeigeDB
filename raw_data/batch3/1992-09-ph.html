      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 23, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District appeared to edge up slightly 
in August and early September, according to reports from area 
businesses. Manufacturers noted continued gains, on balance, with 
increases in orders and shipments. Retailers generally indicated 
that sales picked up in late August and early September from the 
summer pace although the year-over-year increase was slight. Bankers 
said loan volume outstanding has been virtually steady in recent 
weeks, with business lending flat, and gains in residential mortgage 
lending offset by declines in consumer installment lending. Realtors 
indicated that home sales continued to exceed last year's rate, but 
demand for office space remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District business contacts expect little change 
from current trends. Manufacturers expect orders and shipments to 
continue to rise. Retailers forecast a seasonal increase in sales 
for the fall but only a small year-over-year gain. Bankers generally 
expect little or no growth in overall lending in the months 
immediately ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued on the rise 
in late August and early September, according to industrial firms 
contacted for this report. While a little more than half of the 
companies indicated their business was steady, just over one-fourth 
said they had stepped up activity in recent weeks. Activity appeared 
to be steady or rising in nearly all major industries in the Third 
District with the exception of transportation equipment where orders 
and shipments were reported to be falling. Overall, however, area 
manufacturers indicated that shipments and new orders were moving up 
although order backlogs were declining. Employment appeared to be 
steady as most firms were maintaining constant payrolls, and 
cutbacks at some plants were being offset by increase at others.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, a majority of Third District manufacturers expect 
business to remain on an upward trend through the coming winter. On 
balance, they plan to step up shipments and they anticipate an 
increase in orders that will boost backlogs. Employment increases 
are planned by approximately one-third of the firms contacted while 
half intend to maintain current payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally indicated that sales picked up in 
recent weeks for the back-to-school shopping period, although year-
over-year gains appeared to be slight; results varied among stores, 
and reported increases were 5 percent or less, in dollar terms. 
Merchants continued to cite lackluster economic conditions as a 
retraining influence on consumer spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, Third District retail executives expect sales to move up 
seasonally through the fall, but they anticipate only a modest 
increase for the period compared to last year. While several 
merchants said they planned expanded advertising and promotional 
campaigns for the balance of the year, they do not appear to be 
boosting sales plans. Most said they will attempt to keep 
inventories lean.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks was 
described as stable by bankers contacted in early September. Most 
banks gave similar reports indicating that commercial and industrial 
lending was flat, consumer installment loans were edging down, and 
residential real estate loan volumes were continuing to rise. 
Bankers noted increases in mortgage lending for new purchases as 
well as refinancings and home equity loans. Several bankers said 
their institutions were actively seeking new business borrowers but 
finding loan demand weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers anticipate little growth in lending ahead. Some 
speculate that consolidations and restructurings by business firms 
are resulting in fundamental reductions in their credit needs and 
that a significant increase in business borrowing will not occur 
until a trend of strong economic growth is well under way. Consumer 
loan demand will pick up, according to bankers, with a resumption of 
growth in employment and income.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential realtors reported that home sales during the summer were 
slightly above sales in the year-ago period, and the pace seemed to 
be continuing. However, they noted that there are a large number of 
homes on the market, keeping prices in check. There are few reports 
of price appreciation, and realtors indicated that there is a great 
deal of variation in trends from place to place, with prices firm in 
some areas and falling in others. In particular, real estate agents 
said prices are dropping for very expensive homes and for homes in 
some resort areas. Realtors said that both existing and new homes 
are selling at a better pace than they did last year, although it 
was noted that some builders who announced price increases in the 
past few months have seen traffic fall off at their developments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for office space remains weak, according to commercial 
realtors. They estimate that vacancy rates this summer reached about 
16 percent in central Philadelphia and varied from 13 to 27 percent 
in suburban areas. Realtors said ongoing consolidation by local 
companies is continuing to reduce demand for office space. Older 
buildings are especially vulnerable to declining demand, according 
to realtors; they estimate that the vacancy rate in Class B 
buildings is about 22 percent and that rents are being reduced from 
10 to 40 percent depending on the age and condition of the building.
