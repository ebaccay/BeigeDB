      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic conditions improved in October and 
November. Consumer spending continued to advance on a seasonally 
adjusted basis, and appears to have gained momentum in recent weeks. 
Retrenchment was evident in the District's manufacturing sector in 
August and September, but activity seems to have stabilized and 
moved somewhat higher. Automakers' appraisals of market conditions 
were much improved compared to the third quarter, when production 
edged downward. Household survey data depict a significantly more 
robust recovery in District labor markets than establishment survey 
estimates, and a quarterly survey of hiring plans showed continued 
improvement in the Midwest. However, large firms generally have 
stated that hiring in 1993 will be restricted even in the event of a 
significant economic upturn. Reports on commercial and industrial 
loan demand were mixed but suggestive of some strengthening overall. 
A record soybean harvest is nearly complete, but extensive rains 
have led to major delays in the corn harvest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in the District appears to have moved higher in 
October and November, and retailers' expectations for holiday sales 
gains rose in recent weeks. One recent survey showed that the 
percentage of Michigan retailers expecting holiday sales increases 
reached the highest level in the past eight years. The survey's 
director stated that "this is a clear break from the uncertainty of 
the recent past." Another holiday sales survey indicated that a 
greater share of retailers in Illinois and southern Wisconsin expect 
sales gains than the national average. A discount retailer reported 
that sales stalled out during election week, then reversed and 
strengthened significantly in mid-to-late November. This retailer 
raised its forecast for sales in the holiday season, and is now 
looking for its best year-over-year holiday sales increase (in real 
terms) in the last eight years. A survey conducted by a check 
processing firm indicated that day-after-Thanksgiving activity rose 
over 10 percent in the Midwest, compared to 5 percent nationally. 
One District retailer reported that same-store sales gains improved 
over the Thanksgiving weekend in spite of bad weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After losing some momentum in the third quarter, the auto industry 
contributed to growth in the District economy in recent months. A 
large automaker stated that dealer orders had been lagging sales as 
the market softened in the third quarter, but orders turned around 
and rose faster than sales during October and early November. 
Another automaker noted that recent light truck sales gains have 
been well distributed by product category, with new increases in 
sales of full-size pickups (which are primarily for commercial use). 
Dealer complaints about the "upside-down" problem (where used car 
trade-in value is less than the outstanding loan balance) have been 
on the wane, according to another automaker, and there has been a 
substantial increase in the number of debt-free vehicles on the 
road. One automaker noted continued increases in used car prices, 
which also could help buoy the trade-in market. Increasingly 
optimistic appraisals of sales trends were joined by higher 
expectations for production, although significant gains were not 
expected to develop until the first quarter of 1993. Another 
automaker noted that the scheduled gain in car production in the 
first quarter of 1993 would be the best (on a seasonally adjusted 
basis) in the last two years, although actual assemblies are 
dependent on dealer orders holding at current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity moved sideways to modestly higher in 
October and November, and reports from individual firms took on a 
more positive tone following the national election. A majority of 
District manufacturers continued to report production gains in 
various purchasing managers' surveys. That majority grew 
increasingly thin during the third quarter and into October, 
although some improvement was evident in the Chicago survey for 
November. The price component of the Chicago index fell for the 
fifth consecutive month in November, reaching one of the lowest 
levels in the past five years. The production component of the 
Milwaukee survey joined its counterpart in the Chicago survey by 
falling in October and rising in November, but signaled expansion in 
activity during both months. Surveys conducted in Western Michigan 
were summarized in October by the survey's director as indicating 
that "things are flat and getting flatter," although modest 
improvement was noted in November. A survey of metalworking firms in 
the Chicago area indicated some slowing in the rate of recovery in 
October.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports provided by individual manufacturers were more optimistic in 
recent weeks than in October. A manufacturer of parts used in heavy 
machinery stated that "after the usual lead times following the end 
of a recession, we are beginning to sea a recovery in capital goods 
markets." This company also noted that sales of controls for 
household appliances continue to benefit from the housing recovery. 
A large appliance manufacturer expected industry-wide domestic 
shipments to rise modestly again next year. A chemical company 
reported that sales of coatings used in finishing consumer durable 
goods are "by far our strongest" area, principally due to strength 
in sales of housing-related products like cabinetry and furniture. 
At the same time, this contact noted that sales of coatings used in 
general industrial purposes remained soft. An office furniture 
manufacturer stated that sales stopped declining in August, and have 
experienced a modest but consistent recovery since then. A large 
manufacturer of fluid power equipment reported that the heavy-duty 
truck market "is clearly the strongest area of our business." 
Assemblies have grown slower than orders, mainly because OEMs have 
been trying to lock in production for later-than-usual delivery next 
year. However, this contact did not express concern about the 
prospect of order cancellations, and expects heavy-duty truck 
assemblies to rise nearly 20 percent in 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continued to recover in recent months, 
although measuring the extent of the recovery is difficult with 
available data. Establishment survey data suggest that total 
District nonfarm payroll employment was flat to slightly higher in 
recent months, but household survey data and reports from temporary 
help firms suggest a stronger upturn may be underway. According to 
household survey estimates, District employment began a significant 
recovery late in 1991, and by August 1992 had returned to pre-
recession levels. More recently, the unemployment rate fell markedly 
in Illinois over the four months ended in October, as a sharp 
decline in the number of people reporting themselves unemployed was 
joined by a significant increase in the number of people having a 
job. A quarterly survey of employer hiring intentions indicated 
renewed improvement among Midwest firms. Anecdotal evidence for a 
recovery in permanent employment among larger District companies 
remained sparse at best, however, with most firms indicating that 
productivity gains are expected to restrict hiring, even if economic 
growth increases. A large retailer stated that retailing is rapidly 
becoming more capital intensive. A communications company reported 
that continued growth in telephone line installation has been driven 
partly by a trend among its customer base towards substitution of 
labor with capital. A large food processing company stated that "as 
we put capital in, we take people out."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from large banks on the demand for their commercial and 
industrial loans were mixed but suggestive of some strengthening 
overall. Those banks reporting improved demand cited customers' 
financing needs for capital spending more frequently than for 
inventory investment. Several banks reported having undertaken 
efforts to strengthen capital positions in recent months; planned or 
actual equity issuance was the most frequently cited measure. Loan 
sales and securitization initiatives were noted more frequently than 
credit standard tightening. Regulatory capital positions were 
characterized as adequate or comfortable by each bank contacted. 
Credit standards and loan terms were largely unchanged, although a 
minority of respondents noted a modest decline in the spread between 
loan rates and base rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farmers in District states have nearly completed what is estimated 
to be a record soybean harvest, but progress in harvesting the 
record-large corn crop is characterized as the slowest in 20 or 30 
years. As of November 22, a third of the corn acreage in District 
states was still waiting to be harvested. The high moisture content 
of this year's slow-to-mature crop accounted for the initial harvest 
delays. More recently, extensive rains have limited the amount of 
field-drying and rendered many fields too muddy. The harvest in 
several areas of the District may not be finished until well into 
the winter months. The field losses on the remaining acreage will be 
larger than normal. The losses will be costly to individual farmers 
but are not likely to alter the overall implications of a record 
crop.
