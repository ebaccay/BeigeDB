      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District economy made modest gains in March and prices rose 
further. Retail sales appeared to increase at a somewhat faster pace 
than in previous months, although big ticket items were steady. As 
compared with our previous survey, a slightly smaller proportion of 
retailers reported increases in the prices of their purchased 
products and of the items they sell. Most manufacturing indicators 
were higher in March, but shipments were steady to lower in early 
April. Prices of manufactured goods and materials rose in March. 
Housing activity remains relatively strong. Reports of seaport 
activity indicated that exports grew faster than imports in March, 
although both rose. Tourism was strong in the winter compared to a 
year ago and is expected to remain robust throughout the spring and 
summer. The agricultural and financial sectors were little changed, 
although each demonstrated some signs of strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers responding to our regular survey reported 
somewhat higher sales in mid-April compared to March, with half 
indicating higher sales and 30 percent indicating lower sales. About 
half said their sales of big ticket items were unchanged while the 
remainder was split evenly between those reporting higher sales and 
those reporting lower sales. The majority of respondents expect 
their sales to increase in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers continue to report price increases, although there was 
some hint of abatement in inflation in their reports for March. 
About one-third of our retail respondents increased their prices 
while 63 percent reported no change. In the previous survey, about 
40 percent had reported increases while about half indicated no 
change. Moreover, 43 percent indicated that the prices of items they 
purchased had risen, compared with over half in the previous survey. 
Forty-four percent of our respondents expect to raise the prices 
they charge sometime in the next six months. The remainder expect to 
make no changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sizeable increases in March shipments compared to February levels 
were indicated by respondents to our regular survey. Other 
manufacturing indicators rose modestly. More manufacturers reported 
increases than reported decreases in new orders, the backlog of 
orders, and material and finished goods inventories. Employment and 
the length of the workweek also reportedly increased slightly in 
March.
     </p>
     <p>
      When respondents compared manufacturing activity in the first half 
of April to late March, they reported that the more recent period 
was not as strong. For the first half of April, more manufacturers 
reported decreases in shipments than reported increases. Likewise, 
new orders and the backlog of orders were weaker over this period 
than in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prices of raw materials and finished products rose further in 
recent weeks according to respondents. Sixty-eight percent reported 
they paid higher prices for raw materials in March and about one-
fourth said they raised the prices of their finished products over 
the period. Three-fourths of the respondents look for further 
increases in the price of raw materials over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturers expect their business activity to increase in the 
next six months. Half of the respondents believe their shipments 
will rise during the spring and summer, as compared with 15 percent 
who expect declines. Increases are also expected in new orders. The 
majority of manufacturers plan to keep their inventories at current 
levels in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ports
Reports received from the three major District portsâ€”the Port of 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk), the Port of Charleston, and the Port of 
Baltimoreâ€”noted general increases in import and export activity for 
the month of March. Import shipments were higher at Hampton Roads 
and at Charleston but were reported unchanged at Baltimore. All 
ports indicated an upturn in export volume in recent weeks. When 
compared to a year ago, recent growth in export activity was 
outpacing that of imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of resorts and hotels throughout the District 
indicated strong tourist activity. The majority of the respondents 
said that the winter convention season was good in their areas, and 
they expect stronger activity this spring compared with previous 
years. Summer bookings are running well ahead of last year. Only 
one-fourth of respondents expect the decline in the exchange value 
of the dollar to boost tourism this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A special survey of District builders and realtors indicated an 
upturn in activity in the District's housing sector. Realtors 
reported that sales of single-family homes rose in March and 
remained strong through early April. Starts of single-family homes 
were also up in the period. Respondents noted continued strong 
construction and sales activity in the homes priced in the higher 
end of the market. A majority of respondents expect mortgage rates 
to remain at current levels or to decrease slightly over the next 
six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Preliminary results from a recent survey of District agricultural 
bankers showed that farm financial conditions appeared to be 
strengthening somewhat but were not yet robust. Farmland prices were 
relatively stable in the first three months of this year, and 45 
percent or the rural bankers expect farmland prices in their areas 
to rise over the next three months. None expect land prices to fall. 
Farm loan demand is higher compared to our survey three months ago, 
but 20 percent of the bankers still characterize demand at their 
institutions as below normal, while only four percent reported it as 
above normal. Funds are reported to be readily available at almost 
90 percent of the responding institutions, and only four percent 
indicated that loans were refused due to shortages of funds.
Interest rates were reported to be lower across all agricultural 
loan categories, but bankers anticipate farm loan demand will be 
generally weaker in the coming three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The reports of executives of commercial banks and thrift 
institutions indicated little if any change in banking activity 
except in consumer loans. These loans, including home equity loans, 
rose at a faster pace in recent weeks, although at least some of the 
increase may have been due to seasonal factors. On balance, the 
reports indicated that commercial loans and deposits were about flat 
to up slightly.
