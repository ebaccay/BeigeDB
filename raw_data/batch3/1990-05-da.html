      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 2, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy continues its pattern of slow growth. Expansion 
has accelerated slightly in manufacturing. Non-auto retail sales 
softened in March. Auto sales are generally below a year earlier, 
but not in all parts of the District. Expansion in the service 
sector has resulted in labor shortages in some professions. 
Construction contract values are showing renewed signs of weakness, 
but employment in the industry is expanding. Oil and gas drilling 
activity is strong. Recent rains and rising prices have improved the 
outlook for agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturing activity has picked up somewhat since the 
last Beige Book survey. Oilfield equipment manufacturers note some 
seasonal declines in sales, but they expect growth this year as a 
result of rising drilling activity. Orders to steel firms are a 
little below a year ago, but are up from six months ago, and selling 
prices are increasing slightly. A maker of extruded aluminum 
products cites strong sales growth and says that such reports are 
common in his industry. Orders to construction-related fabricated 
metals firms are also rising, but a can manufacturer notes that the 
agricultural damage due to Texas' December freeze has lowered demand 
for his products. In the wood industry, sales by flooring and 
millwork makers are sluggish while lumber and plywood sales have 
increased. Demand is essentially unchanged for most respondents in 
the stone, clay and glass industries. Among electronics producers, 
orders for telecommunications equipment are showing strong growth, 
but demand for most other products has not changed much. With a few 
exceptions, demand for food products has held fairly steady, but 
prices have increased on average. Paper producers note softening 
orders and say that pulp prices have fallen, in part, because of 
increases in the value of the dollar. In the apparel industry, 
demand has changed little in recent months, but is somewhat below 
last year's levels. Although demand for chemical products has 
increased in recent months, it is lower than a year ago. Oil 
refineries report stable demand, after seasonal adjustment, and 
several note increasing profit margins due to a widening spread 
between gasoline and crude oil prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some District retailers said their sales were weak in March because 
Easter came late this year. Nevertheless, several national chains 
noted that year-over-year growth was slower in the District than in 
the nation. Among larger District cities, growth was strongest in 
Houston, and weakest in San Antonio. At the department stores, 
women's ready-to-wear sales were said to be fairly high, while sales 
of housewares were low.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales vary widely across the District, but they are generally 
weak. Auto sales are down markedly from a year earlier in Dallas and 
San Antonio but up in Houston, where sales so far in 1990 are 21 
percent over the same period in 1989. Houston dealers say they do 
not expect such high growth rates to continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      The services sector continues its pattern of expansion. Business 
services and health care firms cite recent acceleration in demand 
growth. Health care firms cite shortages of personnel and relatively 
strong increases in wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      After a mild recovery during the second half of 1989, District 
construction contract values have weakened in recent months. 
Construction employment is increasing, however, due to earlier 
growth in contracts. Nonresidential contracts have been particularly 
weak this year, following a runup last year that was led by 
increased chemical plant construction. Residential building has 
declined slightly after mild improvement in the second half of last 
year. Conversely, after a weak second half, nonbuilding construction 
has recently been increasing. Multifamily permits continue to 
suggest growth in apartment construction. In both Dallas and 
Houston, apartment occupancy rates are above 90 percent and rents 
are increasing. Respondents in the Dallas area note a strong 
increase in single-family home sales, but prices remain sluggish and 
inventories have not declined much.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like that of the nation, seasonally adjusted District oil and gas 
drilling continues to grow at a healthy pace. Year-over-year, the 
growth rate of drilling in the District is more than 50 percent 
higher than in the nationâ€”partly because the new horizontal 
drilling technology is particularly applicable to the Austin chalk 
formations in Texas. Recently, however, drilling activity has begun 
to grow faster in the United States than in the District. Despite 
declines in oil prices within the last month, respondents say that 
prices remain high enough to motivate further growth in drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural conditions are improving, as frequent rain in February 
and March provided necessary moisture across the District, and 
prices received by Texas farmers and ranchers continue to rise to 
new record levels. The rain has markedly increased soil moisture in 
drought-damaged south Texas. Rain in the Texas panhandle has led to 
more optimistic expectations about yields for the winter wheat crop 
there. The March index of prices received by Texas farmers rose 5 
percent above a year earlier, to reach its highest level ever.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of business borrowers finds that credit is tight in the 
District but that this is not a new development. Recent credit 
restrictiveness has primarily affected building contractors and some 
of their suppliers. As a result of new restrictions on loan size, 
tougher loan standards, and larger and more liquid collateral 
requirements, speculative home building is said to be curtailed in 
some portions of the District. Large businesses, including large 
home builders, had few complaints about credit shortages. Many 
smaller businesses say their long-established relationships with 
their banks have allowed them to avoid funding problems.
