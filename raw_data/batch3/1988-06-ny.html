      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District has continued mixed. 
Overall business conditions were stable to improved and office 
leasing activity was moderate to good. Retail spending remained 
sluggish, however, and demand for new homes varied somewhat among 
areas. Small-and medium-sized banks raised their mortgage rates 
following the May 11 prime rate increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail spending in the Second District continued somewhat sluggish 
in recent weeks with April sales ranging from below year-earlier 
levels to moderately above. The earlier Easter this year was noted 
as one factor in the slow April performance, but partial results for 
May were disappointing as well. As one retailer commented: 
"Customers just aren't spending and we really don't know why". 
Women's apparel sales have remained weak and the gains which 
occurred in other lines were not particularly strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Year-to-year changes at District stores in April ranged from -6.9 
percent to +3.3 percent, results which were "well below" to "just 
about on" plan. Partial data for May show some over-the-year gains 
but smaller than were expected. Inventories were generally at 
comfortable levels, however, due to close monitoring and aggressive 
markdowns, though one respondent reported an undesired buildup.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Second District have been stable to 
moderately improved in recent weeks. The proportion of Buffalo 
purchasing managers reporting higher new orders rose by 13 
percentage points in May while the latest Rochester survey indicated 
little overall change. In both areas the percentage of surveyed 
firms with lower inventories has declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      As was true nationally, unemployment rates in the District were 
somewhat higher in May. However, rates of 4.2 percent in New York 
and 3.7 percent in New Jersey represented May-to-May declines of 0.7 
and 0.4 percentage point, respectively. While May data for New York 
City are not yet available, it appears that, through April, the 
employment declines resulting from the stock market crash were 
offset by job growth in other sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several recent announcements point to continuing expansion in the 
District's economy. The Defense Department awarded a $236 million 
contract to a team headed by General Electric for the development 
and initial deployment of the "Star Wars" defenses. In addition, a 
number of firms are planning substantial growth and modernization 
here. These include firms making products ranging from radial tires 
and fiberglass insulation to aerospace and telecommunication 
equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity has varied within the District 
since the last report. In some areas the prime homebuilding season 
began strongly with little or no slowdown from the year-earlier 
pace, while in others, builders are busy but activity has declined 
to a more normal level compared with the past few years. Things 
remain sluggish in some areas, however, particularly where home 
prices are quite high and where layoffs resulting from the Wall 
Street cutbacks have occurred. The rise in mortgage rates was 
reported to have had little impact on homebuilding thus far.
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the District's commercial real estate market have 
been mixed. Office vacancy rates have declined in areas such as 
northern New Jersey and Long Island while remaining at virtually 
unchanged high levels in Westchester and Fairfield counties. Leasing 
activity has generally been moderate to good, particularly for 
buildings in desirable locations and of good design. The major 
exception is downtown Manhattan where leasing activity continues 
weak. Given the large number of buildings currently under 
construction in midtown Manhattan and northern New Jersey, however, 
there is concern that vacancy rates will rise as this new space 
becomes available.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small-and medium-sized banks in the Second District survey generally 
raised their mortgage rates in response to the May 11 increase in 
the prime rate. However, rate increases on non-prime based business 
and consumer loans have been more spotty. Most of the bankers expect 
further rate increases during the second half of 1988, though none 
predicted sharp rises. A few of the surveyed officers believe that 
interest rates have already reached their 1988 highs and should 
stabilize at current levels. While many analysts link rising 
interest rates to inflation fears, most of our respondents did not 
expect a surge in inflation though nearly all believe their local 
economy is strong. The rise in mortgage rates has reduced mortgage
activity somewhat, but the response to date has not been pronounced. 
Mortgage activity in the New York City metropolitan area remains 
more sluggish than in other parts of the District. With the rise in 
interest rates, many mortgage officers have noted a shift back to 
adjustable rate mortgages. One banker said that those with caps on 
future rate increases were particularly popular. Business in home 
equity loans, usually priced separately from mortgages, continues to 
be brisk.
