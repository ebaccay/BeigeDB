      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 22, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the Second District economy since the last report 
were generally on the soft side. During November retail contacts 
were split between those with sales above and below plan while 
December results were generally below target. Residential 
construction activity remains low and office leasing activity 
slowed. District unemployment rates rose in December for the third 
consecutive month following a seesaw pattern during most of the 
year. Most senior loan officers at small and midsized banks reported 
no change in their willingness to lend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail contacts had mixed results during November, 
splitting almost evenly between those with sales above and those 
with sales below plan. While December results were more uniformly 
below target, several retailers expressed pleasure that sales proved 
better than the dire media forecasts. The sales environment was very 
competitive and marked by considerable price-cutting which began 
very early in the holiday season. Despite relatively lean 
inventories, retailers were heavily promotional in an attempt to 
overcome anticipated consumer caution. Over-the-year sales changes 
at department stores ranged from -4 percent to +5 percent in 
November and from flat to +2 percent in December. An annual survey 
conducted by the Retail Council of New York State covering some 200 
stores across the state found sales volume during the Christmas 
season to be generally unchanged from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Items which sold relatively well included staples such as men's and 
women's sweaters, gloves, and outerwear as well as dresses, 
cosmetics and certain toys. Sales of big ticket items varied among 
respondents. Due in large part to a substantial pickup in sales 
during the two weeks surrounding Christmas, inventories were 
reported at or somewhat below targeted levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity remains slow in the District due 
to both the season and generally sluggish demand. The high inventory 
of homes available in the resale market and consumer uncertainty 
about the economic outlook continue to be cited as major factors. 
Reportedly, much of the homebuying which is currently taking place 
is by first-time buyers and others in need of  "affordable", lower-
priced units. Two yet-to be-constructed communities in New Jersey 
and New York were recent sellouts because of their relatively low 
prices and attractive financing. Among other housing construction 
scheduled are an $18 million building in the Bronx to house homeless 
adults and, in all five boroughs of New York City, new housing for 
working and middle-class families under a recent $76 million federal 
grant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity slowed somewhat since the last report. 
Midtown Manhattan witnessed its second largest transaction or the 
year, but a sizable amount of vacant space was marketed and the 
primary vacancy rate rose. In downtown Manhattan, where no new 
construction is underway and several well-known buildings are 
undergoing extensive capital improvement, the vacancy rate declined 
for the second consecutive month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates rose in December for the third 
consecutive month following a seesaw pattern during most of the 
year. New York's rate edged up to 8.1 percent from 8.0 percent in 
November while New Jersey's rate increased to 7.4 percent from 7.1 
percent. Since the last report, plans for some sizable cutbacks have 
been announced which are likely to have a downward impact on local 
employment. Nynex, the local telephone company in New York state and 
New England, will reduce its workforce over the next two years by 
almost 10,000 and Xerox, which has several locations in the 
District, will eliminate 2500 white-collar positions by the middle 
of this year. Moreover, in the semiannual survey of the 
Manufacturers Association of Central New York, nearly 25 percent of 
respondents in January said they plan to cut employment over the 
next three months, up from 15 percent last July.
     </p>
     <p>
      On a more positive note, Ford and GM recently announced plans to 
invest a total of $350 million in their western New York plants over 
the next two years. Most of the money will be used for new machinery 
and retooling. In addition, a Dallas-based firm plans to move a 
manufacturing operation from the South to New York State.
     </p>
     <p>
      The December survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed a doubling 
of the percentage of firms with fewer new orders and a substantial 
increase in the percentage with lower production. While some of this 
slowdown apparently is a seasonal pattern, the extent of it is 
somewhat greater than in December 1990. The November survey of 
purchasing managers in Rochester, however, showed a decline in the 
percentage anticipating a deterioration of business conditions over 
the next quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District reported that their willingness to lend remains 
unchanged from three months ago. Credit standards at most banks 
surveyed remain the same, though a few banks reported stricter 
standards for consumer loans. Most respondents stated that overall 
loan demand was stable with some variation across categories. Nearly 
all loan officers reported charging lower rates than three months 
ago, reflecting decreases in the prime rate. These lower rates have 
brought about increased demand for mortgage refinancings, even 
though the demand for new residential mortgages and construction 
loans remains weak. Those respondents noting a decrease in overall 
loan demand are using advertising campaigns and aggressive rate-cutting policies as a way of attracting new loans. The majority of 
banks surveyed report an increase in delinquency rates on all types 
of loans, forcing some to restructure existing loans.
