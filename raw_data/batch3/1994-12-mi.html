      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 7, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Ninth District continues to grow briskly, but is 
apparently beginning to encounter some problems. On the positive 
side, manufacturers report strong orders. Overall mining and forest 
product output remains high. Agricultural production is at or near 
record levels. Non-residential construction remains robust. Retail 
sales of general merchandise are strong and vehicles generally 
continue to sell well. Fall tourism was excellent as are prospects 
for winter activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, some problems are emerging. Residential building clearly is 
slackening. In agriculture, unfavorable prices are limiting farm 
household and capital spending. Urban labor markets have tightened 
to a point where many businesses encounter difficulty in securing 
employees. Reported wage increases are larger and more widespread 
than earlier in the year. Price hikes for raw materials and 
intermediate goods are becoming common, and a survey shows 
increasing expectations that such increases in business costs will 
eventually be passed along to consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Manufacturing is very good." reported an advisory council member 
from north-central Wisconsin. and other sources indicate that this 
is true across the district. News media report that some firms have 
such strong orders that they have difficulty meeting promised 
shipping dates. Auto and machine components, builders' hardware, and 
commercial printing businesses are all described as having full 
order books. Publicly traded manufacturing firms continue to 
announce strong revenue increases over the previous year. Moreover, 
industrial sales of electricity continue to grow substantially 
faster than long-run averages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mining and forestry are responding to strong demand and favorable 
prices by increasing output wherever possible. A previously idled 
iron mine in Minnesota that was brought back into production in late 
summer is already outstripping production expectations, and an 
industry spokesman stated that Minnesota's 1995 iron shipments will 
be the highest in over a decade. Copper producers and an aluminum 
processor face especially favorable prices and are described as 
producing at capacity. Paper mills are reportedly increasing output 
as strengthening national and international demand for many types of 
paper allow them to bring underutilized capacity back into use. Oil 
and gas drilling remains higher than earlier in the year. Lumber and 
building board production remains strong. Sawmills in Montana 
reportedly are having a better year than anticipated as timber sales 
from private lands have increased to partially fill the gap caused 
by reduced federal sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Housing activity is starting to level off," said one advisory 
council member from Wisconsin, noting the effects of higher mortgage 
interest rates. His comments were also echoed by colleagues from 
Montana. Single-family home permits issued in October in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area were about 9 percent below year earlier 
figures. And while building activity in the eastern Dakotas remains 
strong, advisory council members and directors indicate that fewer 
new jobs are in the pipeline and that the 1995 building season will 
be down somewhat from 1994. These views were confirmed by a 
Minneapolis Fed mid-November poll of business people who reported a 
marked softening of their expectations for housing starts in their 
communities, compared to responses to the same question six months 
and a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and heavy construction, however, continues to outpace 
year-earlier levels, and the number of projects already initiated 
should ensure that the 1995 season will also be a busy one, 
according to one industry source. Publicly let contracts in 
Minnesota and the Dakotas for 1994 through October were 13 percent 
above 1993 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ninth District agriculture is celebrating its best crop ever, but 
mourning the lowest combination of crop and livestock prices in many 
years. Corn, soybean and sugar crops were the best ever for the 
district and wheat yields were excellent in most areas. Grain prices 
have generally stabilized at levels 15 percent to 30 percent below 
1993 harvest prices after dropping nearly continuously from February 
into early fall. Favorable yields will offset the drop in prices and 
crop incomes will be substantially above 1993 in all areas except 
Montana and western North Dakota. But 1993 was an unusually bad year 
and 1994 crop income is likely to be only slightly above longer run 
averages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock prices, particularly for hogs, is where the farmer's shoe 
is pinching. In early November slaughter hog prices hit the lowest 
point in more than two decades in current dollars and in constant 
terms approached 20th century lows set in 1933. Cattle prices are 
also down substantially, with the greatest impact felt by cow-calf 
operators in Montana and in western South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      The upshot of this pattern of good crops but unfavorable prices for 
both grains and livestock is that farm household and capital 
spending are expected to be muted this year. Bankers responding to a 
Minneapolis Fed third quarter survey of agricultural credit 
conditions indicated that while farmers are generally able to 
service debt, few are expected to make major capital expenditures. 
Exceptions are crop-dependent eastern North Dakota, where farm 
machinery sales are particularly strong. At the other extreme, 
Montana bankers in areas where no crops are grown have begun to 
express concern about the ability of less well capitalized ranchers 
to weather the slump.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise sales reportedly improved through the fall. 
Traffic in malls and sales figures for national chains, regional 
retailers, and specialty "category killer" merchandisers all point 
to strong consumer spending as the year closes. Although a snowstorm 
slowed shopping at the end of the Thanksgiving weekend, store 
operators reported very good sales before the storm hit and 
expressed optimism about holiday season sales. But there are some 
signs of slackening demand; a few advisory council members described 
increasing consumer caution in their communities. And a director who 
operates a trucking business noted a distinct drop in furniture 
shipments into the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicle sales continue to generally be robust, with reports from 
Wisconsin to Montana of dealers who are unable to get certain 
popular models. One industry source, however, noted a plateauing in 
sales of sedans, station wagons and minivans. Pickups and sport 
utility vehicles continue to sell well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism and recreation businesses are doing well. South Dakota had 
an excellent pheasant hunting season with optimal weather conditions 
and record spending by out-of-state hunters. The warm, late fall 
delayed ski and snowmobile recreation, but expectations for such 
winter business are very good. However, Canadian cross-border 
tourist traffic reportedly is down from previous years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "It is hard to hire anyone to do anything," is how one advisory 
council member from eastern North Dakota described labor markets in 
his area. There are many other indications that labor markets 
continue to tighten. Help wanted signs are ubiquitous in most urban 
areas. Employment applications commonly are placed at sales counters 
in retail establishments, Minneapolis-St Paul school bus operators 
reportedly are short over 300 drivers, while retailers in these and 
other cities are having extreme difficulty finding seasonal workers 
for the holiday rush. Some firms offer employees bonuses for new 
recruits.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Labor shortage raises wages in region," was the headline in one 
central Wisconsin newspaper, but that headline would accurately 
characterize wage tendencies in many other areas of the Ninth 
District. One director from North Dakota described wage increases of 
4 percent to 10 percent in manufacturing firms he had contacted. 
News reports and advisory council members also note that substantial 
wage increases are becoming more common, One Minnesota manufacturer 
reportedly raised its starting wages from $6 to $7 per hour to 
attract needed workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many sources report price increases in raw materials or intermediate 
goods. Both steel and non-ferrous metals continue to rise in price, 
as have hardware items. Adhesives and plastic laminate prices have 
increased by 6 percent to 10 percent in recent months. And a 
Minneapolis Fed survey of business, people showed a marked increase 
in expectations that consumer prices would increase at an above-
trend rate, compared to responses to the same question six and 12 
months earlier.
