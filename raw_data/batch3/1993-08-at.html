      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 4, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to Sixth District contacts, the Southeast economy grew at 
a modest pace in June and early July. Consumer spending gains were 
again reported by most retailers, but momentum has slowed. Realtors 
and residential builders reported healthy sales and building 
activity, although multifamily and commercial real estate markets 
remain sluggish. Manufacturers generally experienced increased 
production and orders in June, with lumber, furniture, and home 
textile producers noting increases because of strong residential 
construction. However, their expectations about fixture production 
are less optimistic than they were earlier this year. According to 
bankers, commercial loan demand remains flat, but consumer lending, 
especially for automobiles and home refinancing, has increased in 
most areas. There were no reports of increasing wage or price 
pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers throughout the District reported chat an upward sales 
trend continues; however, consumer spending growth has slowed in 
recent weeks. Smaller retail stores consistently had weaker sales 
than major retailers. Sales gains were most prominent in apparel, 
home improvement products, big ticket consumer durables, and autos. 
Auto sales did particularly well in June and mid-July, and the 
majority of dealers expect the recent trend to continue through the 
end of the summer. Most contacts in the hospitality industry expect 
further improvement in already strong tourism and business travel 
through the summer as air passenger traffic and convention 
attendance continue to outpace year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity expanded modestly in June and early July 
according to industry contacts. Most firms reported current 
increases in production and new orders; although few reported new 
hiring. Expectations for the near-term future have become less 
positive. Uncertainty and concern over taxes and health care have 
contributed most to declining expectations about future activity, 
according to many contacts. Most manufacturers stated they are not 
planning to add workers in the near term. Increasing backlogs of 
orders for home textiles were reported, as well as a pickup in 
orders for sportswear, but production of other types of apparel has 
slowed because of declining retail sales growth. Strengthening 
residential construction is stimulating new orders at lumber and 
furniture companies, but commercial construction suppliers remain in 
the doldrums. Increased natural gas prices have boosted oil and gas 
production as well as business for related service companies. Energy 
companies are also planning capital expansion projects to meet 
environmental requirements. Defense-related job cuts continue for 
military contractors in the region, and cuts in both military and 
civilian aircraft orders have resulted in layoffs. Some industries, 
such as auto parts, noted slowing exports to Europe.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate agents from across the District reported that home sales 
had leveled off in June and early July, though they remained above 
last year's levels. Starter and mid-priced homes continue to sell 
well, but luxury home sales are still fairly flat. Despite healthy 
single-family building, a lack of new home inventories has increased 
demand for resale homes in some areas. Most realtors and builders 
remain optimistic about the rest of the year, although a few 
contacts expressed concern that uncertainty about government fiscal 
policy was keeping potential buyers in their current homes. 
Increased rental rates have encouraged some multifamily building 
activity. Several contacts reported older multifamily properties 
were being purchased and refurbished at a much lower cost than new
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets remain slow. Several contacts have 
seen modest improvement in leasing activity and occupancy rates, but 
effective rental rates remain too low to encourage any new 
speculative building. Retail construction and build-to-suit projects 
are providing almost all of the new commercial projects in the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers' reports indicate that loan demand was mixed in June and 
early July. Weak demand was noted in Mississippi and Louisiana, 
while the rest of the District experienced a modest increase. 
Contacts noted that there is a lot of competition for good 
commercial loans, with several banks pursuing any good deal that 
comes along. Many commercial borrowers are taking advantage of the 
low rates to refinance existing debts. Consumer lending, especially 
for new cars, has picked up modestly in most of the District. 
Residential mortgage lending continues at a strong pace. Mortgage 
refinancings have begun to surge again after tailing off the latter 
part of June. Refinancings now make up about three-quarters of all 
mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In contrast to the Midwest, drought conditions exist in portions of 
Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. The situation is most severe in 
east-central Georgia and east Tennessee. In the affected areas of 
Georgia, the dry land corn crop may have been entirely lost. Cotton 
and soybean crops are also in need of rain, but are more drought 
tolerant than corn. Dairy farmers have been forced to dip into 
winter hay reserves because the pastures have become too dry to 
graze. In east Tennessee, grazing pastures and tobacco are being 
hurt the worst. Alabama crops have been less affected, but one-third 
of the corn crop acreage is now rated poor or very poor. On the 
other hand, Florida farm land has had at least adequate soil 
moisture in all areas except the northeastern coast. Mississippi and 
Louisiana crops are in good to excellent condition for the most 
part.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory contacts did not report any increases in raw materials or 
finished good prices. There were no reports of increasing wage 
pressures.
