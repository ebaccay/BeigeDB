      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 4, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The composition of Seventh District economic expansion shifted in 
September and early October, as disruption in the auto industry 
combined with a sense of uncertainty to contribute to mixed reports 
from the District's manufacturing sector. In contrast to earlier in 
the year, when manufacturing activity led the District recovery, 
consumer spending now seems to be supporting income gains in the 
region. Growth in retail sales and housing activity continued in 
September and early October. Reports on commercial and industrial 
loan demand were mixed A record corn and soybean harvest is well 
underway. Many contacts shared the perception that the nearing 
election has played a role in dampening economic activity, but they
differed on the reasons why.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers indicated that sales growth continued in much of the 
District in September and early October. However, sales of durable 
goods were mixed, as growth in sales of housing-related products was 
offset by some reports of sluggish demand for cars. A large retailer 
expected its fourth consecutive monthly increase in same-store sales 
in October on a seasonally adjusted basis, led by durable goods 
linked to housing activity. This firm also reported that growth 
resumed in its outstanding customer credit in recent months, as new 
credit sales offset the continuing liquidation of existing credit 
balances. A large discount store chain reported little change in a 
trend of modest improvement in most District markets in recent 
months. A store chain selling mid-priced apparel experienced 
significant sales gains in September and October, and a regional 
analyst's survey of commissioned salespeople in department stores 
also indicated higher growth in sales and customer traffic. A large 
appliance manufacturer reported better-than-expected growth in 
retail sales of its own products, but gains remained restricted to 
inexpensive models within various categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Slower-than-expected growth in car sales combined with labor 
disputes to lead to a decline in District auto production in 
September and early October. One large automaker expected domestic 
sales of light vehicles in the fourth quarter to be flat to down 
slightly from the third quarter (on a seasonally adjusted basis). 
Another automaker reported that retail sales of its cars generally 
remained sluggish relative to pre-recession levels, but noted that 
sales in most markets in the Midwest continued to hold up better 
than the national average. One of the largest auto dealers in the 
District reported that sales weakness has persisted after a slowdown 
was first reported late in the summer, and this dealer recently 
lowered reorders for 1993 models from the levels that were planned 
earlier this year. An auto dealer exchange reported that used car 
prices continued to rise in recent months, even as the volume of 
trading among dealers declined, and this contact expressed 
frustration with an unexpected shortage of used cars in its market. 
After labor disputes contributed to an underbuild in third quarter 
production, one industry analyst expects modest production gains for 
light vehicles in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While reports were mixed by area and industry, overall District 
manufacturing activity lost some of its upward momentum in September 
and October. Purchasing managers' surveys in Chicago, Detroit, and 
Southwest Michigan generally indicated that expansion continued 
through September, albeit at a slowing pace in several areas. The 
Milwaukee survey for September showed especially strong results, but 
other data and reports from individual firms largely indicated 
softer conditions in more recent weeks. A large manufacturer of 
heavy machinery reported modest growth in orders and shipments over 
a weak year-earlier period, but expressed growing concern with
conditions in several of its markets. A producer of heating, 
ventilating, and air conditioning equipment reported that demand 
softened in recent months. A manufacturer of construction and 
industrial equipment reported that shipments growth slowed since the 
summer. The firm is still expecting a sales gain for the fourth 
quarter, but distributors' sensitivity to price indicated that 
underlying demand remained sluggish. A machine tool manufacturer 
reported that bookings growth slowed during the third quarter, but 
expected higher growth during 1993. A large manufacturer of 
electronics reported that growth in industry orders has lagged 
previous economic recoveries, but stated that the industry is "still 
seeing good growth," and noted that its own orders have 
significantly bettered the gains shown in national statistics. A 
large truck producer stated that orders for its heavy-duty trucks 
recently flattened out, and some other industry contacts expressed 
concern about the vulnerability of heavy-duty truck orders to 
cancellations. An association of machining companies reported 
slowing production in September and October, citing production 
cutbacks by a large automaker. A large steel producer reported that 
its order book for fourth quarter production is full, but the order 
book for first quarter 1993 production has been slow to build due to 
weakness in orders from the auto industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from realtors, banks, and other contacts were largely 
consistent with statistical evidence of improvement in the 
District's housing market, although several regions and market 
sectors remained soft. One of the largest realtors in the District 
reported a record month for sales in September, partly (but not 
entirely) due to market share gains. This contact also noted a 
modest upturn in its commercial mortgage business. A realtor based 
in a healthy market reported some slowing in transaction volume on a 
seasonally adjusted basis, but only after strong gains during the 
summer. This realtor expected growth to resume in 1993. A large 
association of homebuilders reported that an uptrend in sales and 
building activity was little changed over the last three months 
(after accounting for seasonal factors). Traffic slowed in recent 
weeks, however, and the association does not expect acceleration in 
growth in the fourth quarter; a contact noted that "there is a lot 
of optimism among members about sales prospects in 1993." One large 
homebuilder stated that traffic was falling off somewhat faster than 
normal for this time of year, but expected demand to improve after 
the election. A large manufacturer of construction materials stated 
that production increases led to a further rise in its capacity 
utilization in September and October, although price increases 
became more difficult to implement. A large bank reported that 
residential mortgage activity continued to exceed plan, due both to 
refinancings as well as new lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on trends in commercial and industrial loan demand were 
mixed. A middle-market lender reported that loan demand recently 
fell below expectations, stating that "clients' planning horizons 
skipped the third and fourth quarter -- many people seem to have 
decided to wait out the election." A regional bank holding company 
noted that loan demand from retailers in its market remained 
sluggish, despite a pickup in retail sales activity. A bank reported 
a pickup in demand for loans from small and medium-sized 
manufacturers and wholesalers, "mainly because borrowers are trading 
money between banks, not because there is any surge in capital 
spending." Reports from two middle-market lenders indicated that 
demand for loans from commercial borrowers in Michigan was little 
changed in recent months, while another lender reported increased 
growth in loans to borrowers in Wisconsin. The leader of an 
association of small banks reported that loan demand remained 
sluggish, and stated that low confidence levels were the most 
important reason for the continued insensitivity of loan demand to 
lower interest rates. A large bank revealed increased loan demand 
from companies expanding production and distribution capacity in 
Mexico.
     </p>

      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The fall harvest is well underway. The soybean harvest has 
progressed at a near-normal pace and is now nearing completion in 
most areas, except for Michigan where rain has slowed harvesting. 
Progress with the corn harvest has been considerably slower than 
normal because of the high moisture content of this year's crop. The 
latest U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates suggest the corn and 
soybean harvest will be up a fifth from last year and modestly above 
the previous high set in 1985.
