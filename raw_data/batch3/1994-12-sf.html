      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 7, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The expansion of economic activity in the District as a whole is 
continuing at a moderate pace. A slight pickup in growth in 
California, which accounts for about 60 percent of the District 
economy, is being offset by some slowing in fast-growing District 
states, like Idaho and Utah. Real estate and construction activity 
in the District has slowed to a more moderate pace. Within the 
retail sector, a slight dropback in motor vehicle sales has not 
overshadowed strength elsewhere. Business investment appears to be 
strong in most of the District, owing, in part, to manufacturers' 
efforts to expand capacity. Loan demand at banks is increasing, 
buoyed by strength in the commercial and consumer segments. 
Scattered reports of price pressures pertain mainly to intermediate 
materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District business leaders generally remain optimistic. 
Survey respondents expect national output to grow faster next year 
than the long-run average pace of growth, and respondents continue 
to expect inflation to accelerate slightly next year. Regional 
growth over the next four quarters is expected to exceed the 
national average in Arizona, Oregon, and the intermountain states, 
match the national average in Washington, and be only slightly 
weaker than the nation in Alaska and California. Compared to the 
previous survey, the outlook for regional growth has been scaled 
back a bit for interest-sensitive sectors, such as business
investment and residential construction; some potential investors 
were reported to be adopting a "wait-and-we" posture on whether the 
interest rate increases to date will seriously impede demand. 
Nevertheless, about one-half of the respondents still expect 
business investment to accelerate next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Within the retail sector, a slight dropback in motor vehicle sales 
has not overshadowed strength elsewhere. Respondents from California 
describe recent retail activity as bustling and report high 
expectations for holiday sales; more recently, media reports suggest 
a strong Thanksgiving weekend start to holiday sales in California. 
A major western grocery chain reports good sales and some pressure 
on food prices from the earlier passthrough by manufacturers of 
increases in prices of plastics and other packaging raw materials. 
In Idaho and Washington, truck sales generally were reported to be 
strong, though some softening in the mini-van market was noted. New 
vehicle sales as a whole were reported to have been constrained 
earlier by delays in deliveries to dealers from manufacturers. More 
recently, the lead time from order to delivery is reported to have 
shortened, owing, in part, to a slight dropback in dealer sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions are mixed among service producers. In California and 
Washington, employment and investment in the health care industry 
reportedly are being restrained by consolidation and uncertainty 
about future industry structure. Also, given an uncertain regulatory 
environment, a major auto and home insurer is modifying earlier 
plans to expand in Central California. In contrast, the 
transportation, communications, computer services, and tourism 
industries generally are operating at high levels and expanding. 
Sales of software produced in Washington are strong, and respondents 
expect software sales to be buoyed further by increasing exports. In 
Utah, hotel occupancy rates are high, and advance reservations for 
die ski season are strong; several hotels in Salt Lake City plan to 
expand their capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Outside of the depressed aerospace sector, District manufacturing 
activity remains at high levels. A Washington electronic components 
manufacturer reported a further increase in order volume, and a Utah 
machinery manufacturer indicated that general business conditions 
remain strong. Sales of western wood products also have been strong, 
despite recent moderation of housing construction, as supplies of 
southern wood products have been limited by weather-related 
production difficulties. Respondents from Oregon indicate that paper 
prices are up sharply, and timber costs remain high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Efforts to expand capacity were reported for many manufacturing 
industries. A U.S affiliate of a Japanese television manufacturer is 
reported to be expanding research, development, and distribution 
facilities in San Diego, as production at its Tijuana manufacturing 
plant picks up. In Central California, a major food processing plant 
is doubling capacity. An air bag manufacturer as reported to be 
expanding operations in Utah, and a multinational consumer 
electronics manufacturer is building a large plant in Oregon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent reports from the farm sector suggest improved sales volumes 
and prices for some major commodities. Sales volumes for cattle, 
grain, and late season crops have been moderate to strong, and most 
respondents from the agricultural sector report that product prices 
are relatively high. Particularly strong prices are reported for 
cotton and wheat, and fresh fruit prices have risen. In contrast, 
potato prices are weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate activity has slowed noticeably in some areas. In 
California, housing sales volume dropped back in the third quarter 
from a strong second-quarter pace; however, respondents from 
Southern California described the overall increase in real estate 
activity as "meaningful." Outside of California, residential sales 
activity appears to have slowed significantly from a rapid pace, 
particularly in Idaho and Utah.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity is mixed. In Idaho and Utah, a slowdown in 
residential construction in the last three months is reported to 
have eased capacity constraints; however, prices of construction 
materials are reported to be still increasing quickly. In eastern 
Washington, residential housing investment continues at a relatively 
high level, but a respondent sees preliminary evidence of a 
softening in demand. In Southern California, new construction of 
office properties is almost non-existent, but the industrial real 
estate picture is reported to be brighter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Distract banking conditions are reported to be healthy. In 
California, commercial loan demand at large banks has picked up, and 
asset quality is reported to be improving slowly. Consumer loan 
demand is strong in Utah and Idaho, but real estate lending is down 
substantially from a year earlier.
