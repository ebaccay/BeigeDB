      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity strengthened somewhat in August from its 
sluggish pace in July, although a few sectors remained flat. Retail 
sales continued lackluster but tourism rose. Manufacturing activity 
grew slightly after declining the previous month. Export and import 
activity was again mixed at District ports. Home sales increased in 
some areas and remained steady in others, and nonresidential 
construction activity strengthened. Loan demand was generally 
steady. The District's agricultural sector looks strong this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey indicated that retail activity in the 
District was flat in August. New car sales apparently increased 
somewhat after two consecutive months of decline, but department 
store sales were unchanged after two months of reported increases. 
Sales of big ticket items at department stores declined slightly in 
August. Some stores, however, reported strength in sales of fall 
apparel. Most retailers expect sales to rise in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts in the District 
indicated an increase in tourism this summer compared to last 
summer. Most respondents expect tourist activity to continue better 
than a year ago in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers responding to our regular mail survey 
reported increased activity in August following a decline in July. 
Reports of increases outnumbered decreases in shipments, new orders, 
and new export orders. Unfilled orders, employment, and the length 
of the workweek were largely unchanged. Inventories of materials and 
finished goods declined somewhat. Prices for finished goods 
continued to rise, but at a rate slightly slower than reported in 
July. Increases in the prices of raw materials slowed sharply, 
however, as 30 percent of our respondents reported increases in 
August compared with 41 percent in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers were less optimistic than in July about 
prospects for growth in their businesses in the next six months. 
Respondents who expect declines in sales, new orders, unfilled 
orders, employment, and the length of the workweek slightly 
outnumbered those who expect increases. Textile producers, for 
example, expect demand to decline soon because of a recent increase 
in the volume of imports. In all manufacturing, the number of 
respondents who expect decreases in overall U.S. economic activity 
in the next six months remained above the number who expect 
increases, while the number who expect no change remained about the 
same.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      Reports received from the three major District ports—Hampton Roads 
(Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimore—indicated that import and 
export levels were mixed in August as in July. Imports were reported 
to be higher at Baltimore, slightly lower at Hampton Roads, and 
about the same at Charleston. Exports were slightly higher at 
Hampton Roads, lower at Baltimore, and unchanged at Charleston. Both 
Charleston and Hampton Roads indicated that export activity outpaced 
import activity, a trend they expect to continue in coming months. 
Baltimore reported exports were lower than last year and expected 
them to decline further in coming months. Hampton Roads noted that 
coal exports were down about 35 percent from a year ago, evidently 
because of the Pittston coal strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of District realtors and homebuilders' 
associations suggested that housing activity in the District 
remained steady or increased slightly in recent weeks. Some 
respondents credited lower interest rates for increases in home 
sales. Most homebuilders observed, however, that construction 
remained well below the levels of a year ago. Looking ahead, 
respondents expect activity in the housing market to increase soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonresidential construction activity apparently gained some strength 
in recent weeks. Industrial building was reported strong, and one 
respondent sensed an end to the decline in commercial building 
activity. Another noted that public construction continued steady 
with good prospects for increases in road building, but that power 
plant construction had slowed. Architectural engineering firms were 
reported to be busy, which implies a favorable outlook for activity 
in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of District financial institutions indicated that 
demand for commercial and industrial loans remained steady in 
August. Nearly all respondents reported moderate increases in 
mortgage demand, especially for fixed-rate loans. The cost of funds 
to depository institutions was apparently largely unchanged in 
August. Deposit growth was generally sluggish to moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the harvest approaching, crop prospects are excellent for the 
Fifth District. Yields of corn, soybeans, and small grains should be 
at or near record levels, and tobacco yields should also be good. 
Prices of most grain and bean crops are likely to average well below 
last year's drought-boosted levels but to be relatively strong 
nonetheless when compared to most other recent years. Tobacco prices 
also have been firm this year. Prospects for livestock producers are 
bright as fall approaches. Firm prices for beef, pork, and poultry 
are helping producers offset higher feed costs, and with feed costs 
expected to decline faster than meat prices, margins may widen 
somewhat in the fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Income prospects for District farmers are good, with cash receipts 
possibly exceeding the relatively strong 1988 showing. Further 
adding to farmers' financial security are rising farmland values. 
All District states are experiencing rising values, but particularly 
Maryland and Virginia, where increases in land values over the last 
year exceeded 10 percent.
