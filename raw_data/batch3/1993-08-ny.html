      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 4, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most sectors of the economy of the Second District made headway 
during June but there are a few preliminary indications of some 
retrenchment in July. June retail sales were reported "good" to 
"very good" with gains averaging 4 to 13 percent above year ago 
levels. Home builders reported generally fair-to-good housing starts 
although there was considerable variation within the region. Office 
leasing activity gained in most areas throughout the district and 
vacancy rates inched lower. The unemployment rate in New Jersey fell 
to 6.9 percent in June, from 7.4 percent in May, while in New York 
the unemployment rate rose from 7.5 percent to 7.8 percent. Early 
reports of economic activity in July, however, suggest some 
softening of the economy with a retreat in retail sales and housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers were generally upbeat, reporting good-to-strong gains in 
all merchandise categories during June. For many merchants, calendar 
shifts pushed extra spending into June because the timing of 
Memorial Day and July 4th meant that sales on those days would he 
counted in the June figures. Sales gains generally ranged from 3.8 
percent to double digit growth. Demand was strong across all 
categories including apparel, electronic goods, fashion and 
furniture. Inventories were largely in good shape, the result of 
close control throughout the year. Several retailers mentioned that 
there is no pricing power, however. In contrast, early July sales 
were characterized as very disappointing or poor. Because of the 
erratic trend in the month-to-month retail figures and the sharp 
retrenchment in July sales, retailers have lowered their 
expectations and now expect generally modest gains in the coming 
months, below the rates of increase in the first half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity was mixed with the market tone 
improving with the distance from the New York City metropolitan 
area. Most builders report that banks will lend construction money 
only if the builder has a signed sales contract in hand. There is no 
lending for construction on speculation. Thus current building 
activity represents the strength in April-May sales. Since then, 
floor traffic has faded in many areas and fewer contracts were 
signed in the June-July period, suggesting some slowdown will 
develop in August-September construction. Even as lumber prices 
continued to move lower, some builders reported a cost-efficient 
trend of substituting steel for lumber in certain applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Higher loan-to-value ratios with downpayments as low as 10-15 
percent were a boost to New Jersey home sales but credit remained a 
difficult issue for many builders. The scarcity of acquisition and 
development loans is driving many builders out of the market; those 
who can borrow cite private lenders and pension funds as their 
sources, not banks. In addition, restructured projects from the 
Resolution Trust Corporation are viewed as a potential threat by 
many builders who feel that they cannot compete financially, and the 
potentially larger supply of RTC projects is viewed as particularly 
worrisome.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial vacancy rates drifted lower in most areas throughout the 
region including Fairfield County, Northern New Jersey and 
Westchester, but the trends in Manhattan were mixed. Because 
employment growth remains negligible in most areas, the absorption 
rate for office space is slow. In addition, declining vacancy rates 
for primary space were also frequently associated with rising 
vacancy rates for secondary space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Signs of strength were evident in state tax collections. Following 
two months of declines, personal income tax collections, a proxy for 
personal income, rose 3.8 percent in June from a year earlier in New 
York State, while tax collections for retail sales posted a 4 
percent gain for the April-June quarter. Tourism sustained minor 
gains, despite the bombing of the World Trade Center and the 
subsequent revelation of additional terrorist plots -- no 
significant cancellations of tours or conventions were reported. 
Base closings in or near the Second District over the next five 
years are estimated to cost the region a net 7400 military and 
civilian jobs, representing less than 0.1 percent of the combined 
job base in New York and New Jersey. The monthly reading of the 
unemployment rate remained erratic with New York rising to 7.8 
percent in June, while New Jersey declined to 6.9 percent. However, 
the overall trend remains definitively down; the unemployment rate a 
year ago for both states was close to 9 percent. A major regional 
retailer, Jamesway Corporation, filed for protection under Chapter 
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and retail analysts expect several 
stores to be closed in the coming months. Merck &amp; Co., a New Jersey 
based pharmaceutical manufacturer, announced plans to eliminate 2100 
jobs through an early retirement program. The reduction will be 
diffused throughout their worldwide operations which employ 
approximately 38,000 people.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Almost all senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks 
in the Second District indicated that their willingness to lend was 
unchanged relative to two months ago. The few bankers who cited an 
increased willingness to make loans attributed it to a sharp 
increase in demand deposits. However, this increase in deposits was 
not widespread, as a majority of officers instead noted a decline or 
a lack of growth in certificates of deposit and money market 
accounts. Passbook savings accounts grew slightly. Overall demand 
for loans stabilized, although demand for commercial and industrial 
loans continued to improve. Interest rates on loans were steady or 
lower. Delinquency rates for all types of loans were unchanged or 
improved slightly during the preceding two months.
