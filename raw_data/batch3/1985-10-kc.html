      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District is improving somewhat, apart 
from the weak farm sector. Retail sales are growing, with new car 
sales especially strong. Prices at retail and for factory inputs are 
generally stable. Inventories of industrial materials and retail 
goods are generally viewed as satisfactory. Residential construction 
activity varies widely across the district. Inflows to thrifts are 
increasing, with mortgage demand mixed to slightly higher. Loan 
demand at commercial banks is off slightly and deposits have 
increased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report a slight increase in sales this year over last 
year, and sales have been improving in the past three months. 
Clothing sales have been strong while home furnishing sales have 
been weak. Sales are expected to increase seasonally with the coming 
holidays. Prices are stable and are expected to remain so through 
year-end. Retailers have been trimming inventories but expect to add 
stocks in anticipation of seasonal sales increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers report strong sales and large reductions in 
inventories of 1985 models, due largely to financing incentives. 
Inventories of 1986 models are beginning to grow. Some dealers are 
apprehensive about sales following the end of the interest rate 
incentive programs, but generally express optimism for 1986 model 
year sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most purchasing agents report that input prices have remained nearly 
constant from a year ago and 3 months ago, and they generally expect 
input prices to remain constant through the end of the year. Few 
difficulties in obtaining materials are reported, and few new 
problems are expected to arise. Most firms report either that 
materials inventories are satisfactory or that they are reducing 
stocks. Changes are not expected to be large for the rest of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders report that starts of single family houses have 
remained flat, but give mixed reports. about multi-family housing 
starts. Most area housebuilders expect starts for the remainder of 
the year to follow current trends. Sales of new homes, prices of new 
homes, and the inventory of unsold homes vary widely across 
reporting areas. Prices of materials are generally steady and 
material availability is good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most savings and loan associations report a significant increase in 
savings inflows relative to last year. Several institutions 
reporting strong inflows also report aggressive campaigns to attract 
funds. Each respondent expects the current trend to continue. 
Respondents also report mixed to slightly higher mortgage demand and 
commitments. Somewhat lower demand is expected as winter approaches. 
Mortgage rates are constant and are expected to remain so. Most 
institutions have not reduced to $1000 their minimum deposit on 
money market deposit accounts, Super NOW accounts, and 7-31 day 
certificates of deposit. Those that have reduced their minimum 
deposit believe that deposits have grown as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents at Tenth District banks report loan demand has fallen 
slightly while deposits have risen slightly, on average, in the last 
month. Commercial and industrial loans and residential and 
commercial real estate loans fell slightly. Agricultural loans fell 
more sharply. Consumer loans, on the other hand, increased. The 
prime rate remained unchanged at nearly all of the banks surveyed. 
No change in the prime is expected in the near term. A majority of 
respondents report lower consumer lending rates. Although some 
respondents expect further easing in these rates, most report they 
did not anticipate any near term change. Deposits were slightly 
higher, on average, during the last month. Demand deposits, 
conventional NOW accounts, Super-NOW accounts, IRA and Keogh 
accounts, and small time deposits increased slightly. Money market 
deposit accounts and large CD's showed greater increases. Passbook 
savings accounts were down slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most areas in the district have more farm land on the market this 
fall, but very little appears to be changing hands. Farm land values 
continue to drift lower reflecting the weak farm economy. Some of 
the increased amount of land for sale results from higher 
foreclosure rates. Many lenders believe farm business failures will 
continue to run well above normal over the next six months. Bankers 
report that Farm Credit System outlets are adhering to fairly strict 
loan review guidelines, apparently leading to the sale of more farm 
assets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fall grain harvest is underway in the district following a good 
wheat harvest. District farmers expect excellent corn, milo, and 
soybean yields. Nearly all farmers who are eligible are choosing to 
store their grain under Commodity Credit Corporation loans. In some 
areas, however, the number of farmers selling grain on the cash 
market is up somewhat from last fall. Though not a preferred option 
because of depressed grain prices, some farmers are pressed for cash 
to pay outstanding loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Winter wheat is being seeded in the district, though planting is 
behind in some areas due to wet weather. In general, district wheat 
growers are not having serious problems obtaining credit, although 
conditions are somewhat tighter than a year ago. A higher percentage 
of growers in Oklahoma and Missouri are having problems than in 
other district states. In most cases, input suppliers are unwilling 
to provide inputs on credit.
