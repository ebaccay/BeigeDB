     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 18, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic recovery continues to be uneven across the country. 
Although some Districts apparently are not sharing in recovery, 
others, such as Chicago and Cleveland, continue to revive largely 
because of the upswing in manufacturing. Industrial production has 
provided considerable impetus to recovery, reflecting in part export 
demand and a reduced pace of inventory liquidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      As yet, there is little sign of a sizable rebound in consumer 
spending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery. 
Retail sales in recent months show only scattered improvement, and 
most retailers are cautious about sales prospects. Retail 
inventories are indicated to be close to desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential investment seems to have lost some upward momentum in 
recent months, with fewer than half of the Districts reporting 
further increases in housing sales and housing starts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hot, dry weather in much of the country has hampered farm output, 
especially corn. Bumper crops of rice in some parts of the St. Louis 
District and record crops of cotton are anticipated in St. Louis and 
Dallas. Farm commodity prices and livestock prices have declined 
recently (San Francisco, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas).
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan activity remains soft in most Districts. Chicago, Cleveland, 
Philadelphia, and St. Louis report a continued reduction in business 
loans, while mortgage loans in general remained flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The strongest sector of the economy is manufacturing. Most Districts 
note a continuing upturn in activity in recent months, but 
manufacturing apparently is still languishing in a few Districts 
(especially Boston and San Francisco).
     </p>
     <p>
      Export growth has been a source of strength in manufacturing, and 
more recently, a reduced pace of inventory liquidation in some 
industries reportedly is adding to the recovery. Developments are 
not uniform through all Districts, however. Some inventory 
liquidation apparently continues in Chicago, Philadelphia, and 
Richmond, while Boston reports satisfactory inventory levels and 
Cleveland comments that the correction phase in inventories is 
nearing an end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both Chicago and Cleveland note strengthening among consumer durable 
producers, led by rising automotive and appliance output, which has 
supported a gradual rise in steel production. Further increases in 
auto output are expected for next quarter (Cleveland). Capital goods 
industries are beginning to show signs of recovery. Chicago points 
out that electronics, heavy machinery, and food processing machinery 
have all shown some recent turnaround in orders, and Cleveland cites 
an uneven revival in heavy-duty trucks and industrial equipment. 
Dallas also reports that sales have increased in the electronics and 
electrical machinery industries because of some rebuilding of 
depleted inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retarding a comeback in production in some Districts is the cutback 
in defense contracts, resulting in declining orders in Philadelphia 
and Atlanta and in San Francisco's aerospace industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers in most Districts appear to be more optimistic about 
near-term prospects, and those in Philadelphia and Richmond plan to 
increase their capital spending over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is still little indication of a stepped-up pace in consumer 
spending for durable and nondurable goods. Retail sales between July 
and early September were relatively flat or slightly higher than 
their levels earlier in the summer. Sales of back-to-school 
merchandise were described as "weak," "slower-than-expected," or 
"disappointing" (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and 
Dallas). New car sales in August were off in some Districts 
(Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta), although a limited inventory of 1991 
model cars is partly blamed for the reduced sales pace. Cleveland, 
however, expects a somewhat higher level of new car sales this 
quarter than last. In general, retail inventories appear to be close 
to desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers generally are cautious about near-term sales prospects, 
and only a few of the Districts report optimism about the outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports suggest that recovery in housing sales and starts 
has slowed recently, although a few Districts comment that sales or 
starts were still rising in July and August. Both San Francisco and 
Chicago report that home sales softened in recent months after a 
spring rebound. Still, housing apparently has become more affordable 
because of recent easing in mortgage rates and because of lower home 
prices in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction appears to be at a virtual standstill in 
many Districts. High vacancy rates for commercial buildings and 
declines in rental prices have been blamed (New York, Chicago, 
Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco), but tight credit standards 
for acquisition and development loans have also apparently 
restricted commercial construction (New York, Chicago, Atlanta).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dry weather is expected to reduce the corn yield in Kansas City, and 
early reports on this crop in the St Louis District are mixed. 
Richmond expects that corn and soybean yields will be normal to 
above normal in some areas, because of recent timely rain. A bumper 
rice crop is expected in Arkansas, but yields in Mississippi may not 
be as good (St. Louis). A record harvest for cotton is expected (St. 
Louis and Dallas). Crop yields in Minneapolis are predicted to be 
"generally good."
     </p>
     <p>
      Adverse weather has also affected pasture conditions in Kansas City, 
but the livestock industry is nevertheless "mostly good" in St. 
Louis. Fruit growers in California report large harvests, but dry 
August weather reduced the harvest of apples and grapes in 
Washington (San Francisco).
     </p>
     <p>
      Several Districts report declines in farm commodity prices. Potato, 
hay, and beef prices are off substantially from a year ago in San 
Francisco, and the Minnesota index of farm products fell sharply 
again for a variety of crops and livestock.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all of the Districts state that loan activity is relatively 
flat, or has eased further in recent months. The New York District's 
comment that banks are willing to expand loans but are facing 
reduced demand, seems to capture a theme common to several 
Districts. Demand for business loans continues to be weak, and has 
softened further in some Districts (Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
Chicago, St. Louis). In some Districts, consumer installment loans 
either fell or held steady, except in Atlanta, where some pickup 
occurred. Most Districts report either little demand for new 
mortgage loans or slight declines from previous months, and even 
some easing in mortgage refinancing (Cleveland). Some Districts find 
that credit standards have not changed in recent months (New York 
and Chicago), but Richmond notes a tightening for commercial loans 
and Atlanta cites a tightening for both auto dealer and commercial 
development loans. In several Districts, mortgage rates have eased 
recently.
