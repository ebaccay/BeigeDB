      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 20, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consistent with reports received since March, our business contacts 
continue to indicate generally slow growth throughout the Southeast. 
Retailers around the District convey a mixed picture but generally 
note that sales growth is slower than last year with apparel doing 
well and durable goods picking up but still off from last year's 
pace. Reports from auto dealers continue to show sales at or below 
last year's levels. Manufacturers, except for textile, auto and 
auto-related producers, are seeing some strengthening of sales, 
which is allowing planned capital expenditures to progress. Because 
of generally overbuilt markets, contacts in the construction sector 
continue to indicate weakness and see no quick relief. Financial 
institutions again report weak loan growth. Little wage or price 
pressure is being reported in the District, although reports of 
shortages of skilled workers are increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity in the District is generally reported to be growing 
but at a rate somewhat slower than last year. Apparel continues to 
be mentioned as the backbone of sales growth; several merchants 
indicated some pickup in durable sales. Department store contacts 
report sales growth on a par with or slightly above expectations 
earlier this year. Appliance and other consumer durable sales have 
reportedly declined recently in line with the slowdown in 
residential real estate sales in certain areas. However, contacts 
report that furniture sales in the Southeast have picked up in 
recent weeks and are now growing a percentage point or two faster 
than last year's levels. Reports from do-it-yourself specialty 
stores indicate strong growth in building materials and related 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from auto dealers indicate that sales weakened further 
recently and one contact speculated that rumors of increased 
manufacturers' incentives on the forthcoming 1991 models are hurting 
current sales. A majority of the dealers, however, expect some 
pickup in activity in coming months, especially if those dealer 
and/or consumer incentives are put in place by manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers in the District point to a mixed picture, but those 
not associated with textile or auto and auto-related production 
generally indicate that activity levels are picking up. The slowdown 
in new residential construction, which reduces demand for new 
carpets and drapery, and greater competition from foreign apparel 
producers are reportedly taking their toll on southeastern textile 
and apparel producers. Job losses continue to be reported in these 
industries although contacts generally believe activity will pickup 
in the third quarter. The weakness in auto manufacturing is 
reportedly affecting suppliers; tire and glass producers are the 
most recent to feel the strain. One glass producer has been 
adversely affected by both the slowdown in auto production and 
construction, and is trying to offset the impact by lowering prices 
and emphasizing export markets. Manufacturers of heating and air 
conditioning equipment report that consumer demand has strengthened 
over first quarter levels, especially for replacement equipment. 
Producers of industrial pumps and metering equipment report record 
sales caused mostly by increased export demand. Pulp and paper 
producers also report benefiting from strong export demand. 
Producers of marine equipment are reporting a noticeable improvement 
in business activity and attribute this to the improvement in the 
oil and gas industry. These producers indicate that capital spending 
to expand capacity is now being actively considered. Despite current 
weakness in demand, certain manufacturers of major household 
appliances and fixtures report that they are building new 
manufacturing facilities in the Southeast.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction contacts continue to indicate weakness in residential 
and commercial construction. They attribute much of the weakness to 
overbuilt markets but reports of more stringent lending conditions 
imposed by financial institutions continue. Public infrastructure 
and industrial building are the only sectors where strength is 
reported. Reports from Florida indicate that the new limits on loans 
to a single borrower imposed on savings and loans and a new state 
law requiring concurrent additions to public infrastructure in 
conjunction with new developments are also adversely affecting 
construction in that state, and our contacts around the District 
indicate no relief to this construction slowdown is in sight.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several bankers noted a continuation of weakness in consumer loan 
demand. These bankers report business loan growth is also slow. 
However, the majority of our bank contacts indicated no change in 
credit policies and none of our business contacts indicated problems 
obtaining credit. Businesses that are doing well report that 
financial institutions are encouraging them to borrow. One of our 
contacts also indicates that his institution has tightened its 
lending standards--requiring stricter documentation and more 
collateral--in the last few months, especially for real estate loans 
and to a lesser degree for small business lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from around the District reveal little change in wage or 
price pressures. A few of our contacts noted that certain types of 
skilled labor are in short supply, but these tight markets are 
localized and have not resulted in increased wage pressures. With 
the resurgence of the energy sector, contacts noted that qualified 
welders and pipe fitters are in especially short supply. No new 
price pressures were mentioned by our contacts.
