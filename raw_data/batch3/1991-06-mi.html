     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the Ninth District has continued to feel the effects of the 
national recession, recently there is some evidence that the region 
is rebounding. Labor market conditions have improved slightly, while 
retail sales have exhibited moderate growth. Conditions in 
manufacturing, construction, and resource-related industries have 
been mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions improved in most of the District. North and 
South Dakota have continued to do well, with their unemployment 
rates falling in April from a year ago; 3.7 from 4.0, and 3.4 from 
3.6 respectively. Minnesota rebounded in April with the unemployment 
rate falling to 5.0 from 5.5 a year ago. In Minnesota, however, this 
strength was a result of fewer people looking for work rather than 
more people finding jobs. Total nonagricultural employment was 
essentially unchanged in April from a year ago, with a drop in 
manufacturing, construction, and trade employment offset by growth 
in the service, financial, and government sectors. In North and 
South Dakota, by contrast, nonagricultural employment was up 1.6 and
3.1 percent respectively in April from a year ago. A recent survey 
of hiring activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area contained some 
grounds for optimism; 20 percent of the companies surveyed reported 
that they planned to increase the number of employees, while only 10 
percent reported planned reductions. A Twin Cities help wanted index 
was 28.6 percent below its year-ago level in April, though this was 
better than at the national level where this was 31.7 percent below 
its year-ago level. Unemployment rates in Montana and the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan were higher in April than their year-ago 
levels; 6.7 percent from 5.3, and 12.3 percent from 9.8 
respectively; and were generally higher in western Wisconsin. In 
Montana nonagricultural employment rose by only 0.5 percent in April 
relative to a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state's average weekly hours in manufacturing at 39.7 in March, 
are still below their year-ago level of 40.0. However, March new 
business incorporations were substantially higher than their year-
ago levels. Minnesota's April average weekly earnings in 
manufacturing was up 4.2 percent from its year-ago level, and up 1.8 
percent from March. Employment in manufacturing in Minnesota and 
Montana was lower in April than its year-ago level by 2.0 and 2.8 
percent respectively. However, it rose in North and South Dakota by 
5.4 and 1.5 percent respectively over the same period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the District exhibited moderate growth, and some 
retailers expressed optimism about the future. March retail sales in 
Minnesota were 4.9 percent higher than a year ago. One District 
retailer reported first quarter sales in comparable stores were 9 
percent higher, and May sales were 16 percent higher than the same 
periods a year ago. However, a number of major local retailers 
reported that sales were flat or only slightly higher in comparable 
store sales in May relative to a year ago, though sales in the first 
week of June are reported to be stronger.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales in the District continue to be weak with dealers 
reporting sales declines of 6 to 11 percent thus far this year, 
relative to a year ago. Sales in May have continued this negative 
trend with dealers reporting new car sales declines of 11 to 20 
percent, relative to a year ago. However, truck and used car sales 
appear to be picking up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing sales have been weak in the District, due in large part to 
the depressed market in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. However, 
recently both existing home sales and prices were up in Minneapolis-
St. Paul. Existing home sales were up 13 percent in April relative 
to a year ago, posting a three-year high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity throughout the District has been generally good. 
The number of crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan was up 1.2 percent in the first four months of 
this year, and 3 percent in May, relative to a year ago. Resort 
owners in northwestern Wisconsin report that lodging reservations 
are ahead of last year and general inquires are 30 percent higher 
than a year ago. In Minneapolis, the U.S. Open is just beginning on 
a local golf course. In addition, the Wally Byam Caravan Club 
International, whose Airstream Convention brought in S million 
dollars to the Duluth region in 1983, has returned to Minnesota this 
June and July. Also, the International Special Olympic Games will be 
held in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's construction industry have been mixed. 
The overhang of office space in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
metropolitan area is expected to continue to depress commercial 
construction activity in the area. The value of future construction 
contracts in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area remain 
substantially below year-ago levels. In addition, Minnesota housing 
permits were down 17 percent in March from their year-ago level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing conditions in the District have been mixed lately. An 
index of Minnesota's economic indicators rose slightly in March, but 
is still 0.4 percent below its year-ago level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent high levels of precipitation in the District were a blessing 
for North and South Dakota. South Dakota, which had been reporting 
40 to 60 percent of normal rainfall this year, reports that topsoil 
moisture is now in excellent condition, while planting in North and 
South Dakota is ahead of its five year average. However, recent 
precipitation in southern Minnesota was so high that parts of the 
state were flooded, and planting was delayed. Statewide, only 80 
percent of the normal corn crop and 60 percent of the normal soybean 
crop has been planted. For corn, in particular, time is running out. 
The governor of Minnesota has applied to the Agriculture Department 
for disaster relief. To make matters worse, the mid-April index of 
prices received by Minnesota farmers was down 12 percent from a year 
ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the District's mining industry have been fairly good. 
Ranchers in the District have also been doing well due to high 
cattle prices.
