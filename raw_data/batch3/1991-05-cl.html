      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 1, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Signs of bottoming out are apparent in the Fourth District, even 
though the unemployment rate rose and manufacturing production fell 
more than nationally in recent months. However, the worst of the 
cutbacks in output and employment appear to be over, and District 
respondents report some signs of revival in activity. Auto output 
and sales apparently are recovering slowly from their depressed 
levels. Retail sales strengthened in April, and real consumer 
spending is expected to pick up this quarter. Mortgage loan demand 
and housing sales have strengthened. Depositories report an ample 
supply of funds, but loans are still generally weak, except for 
mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Regional Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unemployment rate in Ohio rose half a percentage point above the 
national rate in both February and March, after six months when 
performance was better than in the nation, However, the latest 
spread between Ohio and the nation was small relative to previous 
recessions. Moreover, total employment rose in Ohio, but the 
increase was more than offset by a jump in the labor force. Nonfarm 
payroll employment has been relatively unchanged since last fall, in 
contrast to the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other information suggests an early end to the recession. The 
leading economic indicators for Ohio held steady for the third 
straight month in February, following a five-month decline. 
Moreover, the March survey of 450 CPAs in Ohio reported that 
business in the State is close to a trough and is "poised for 
recovery."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cutbacks in manufacturing production in recent months have been 
sharper in the District than nationally. Industry sources believe, 
however, that the worst of the reductions were in the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto production has already begun a slow recovery from recent 
depressed levels, and industry analysts expect gradual improvements 
in both output and sales through the balance of this year. According 
to one estimate, weak auto production last quarter trimmed the real 
GDP growth rate by about one percentage point, and auto output this 
quarter will contribute either no change or a slight gain to overall 
output this quarter. Scattered recalls of production workers are 
also reported, although layoffs of white-collar workers continue. 
Auto production remains at a pace below sales, but dealers are 
reported to be satisfied with a smaller-than-usual 60-day supply of 
inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers operated at about 70% of capacity in the first 
quarter, and expect operations in a 70% to 75% range this quarter. 
Steel inventory liquidation is likely to be somewhat larger than 
last quarter, according to some industry sources. Some specialty 
steel producers report that their operations have been faring better 
than the overall industry, and better than in past recessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of traditional capital goods report that contraction in 
most industry groups has been less than in past recessions. Machine 
tool business has been holding up better than in previous 
recessions, but largely because of strong demand from the aerospace 
industry and exports that have masked weakness in some standard 
products.
     </p>
     <p>
      A slide in industrial equipment shipments that began last fall 
appears to have leveled cut in the first quarter, but the increase 
in April is less than seasonal, according to one producer. Also, 
heavy-duty truck output now appears to be bottoming out at extremely 
low levels, but is expected to gradually revive in the second half 
of 1991 as the pace of industrial activity quickens.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction machinery sales continue to decline and have not yet 
reached their trough, according to some industry sources. The 
weakness has been centered in domestic markets, especially in 
commercial and residential construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents expect a smaller decline in real producers' 
equipment output in the second quarter than in the first, especially 
if motor vehicle output increases enough to offset further expected 
declines in the information processing and industrial machinery 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer Spending
District respondents are encouraged by the strengthening in retail 
sales in April, except in those areas affected by auto layoffs. They 
expect a revival in real consumer spending this quarter, supported 
especially by a higher volume of car sales than last quarter. One 
retailer reports a double-digit year-to-year increase in sales in 
the last two months, apparently because of its more aggressive 
advertising and sales promotions. Sales of appliances have picked 
up, according to a major retailer and a producer. Some also cite a 
step-up in use of consumer credit since March, which one retailer 
attributed to a no-interest-charge promotion.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car dealers report that sales have been strengthening slowly 
over the past several weeks, and they expect continued but slow 
growth through the year. Dealers believe that new car sales have 
been dampened by increased credit tightening by banks and auto 
finance companies in recent months. They also believe that sales of 
"nearly new" cars purchased at auction from national car rental 
companies have dampened new car sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Credit Market Developments
Banks and thrifts generally report that an ample supply of credit is 
available, but that loan demand is still weak. Thrifts in Ohio are 
said to be highly liquid and are anticipating a better-than-seasonal 
pickup in housing sales this spring. Some report a significant 
revival in home sales since late March, especially in Cincinnati and 
Columbus. Mortgage loan activity has picked up in recent weeks, but 
a large volume is for refinancing, as mortgage holders substitute 
fixed-rate mortgages for adjustable-rate mortgages. Some thrifts 
also report deposits have risen each month this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks report ample funds for lending, and note a pickup in mortgage 
loans in the last two months. So far the rise has been less than 
seasonal in Cleveland, but more than seasonal in Pittsburgh. 
Commercial real estate loans are still scrutinized by lenders. Some 
developers and builders of strip shopping malls claim that tight 
credit standards since early last summer have choked commercial 
construction, but acknowledge that financing is available for 
commercial buildings that are nearly pre-leased to creditworthy 
tenants, and when developers have an equity interest.
