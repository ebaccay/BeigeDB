      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Continued moderate growth of the nation's economy is again confirmed 
by reports from the Federal Reserve Districts. Manufacturing sector 
activity remains strong, with export growth a major contributor. 
Recent retail sales growth generally has been modest. Housing 
activity in most Districts has shown some recent improvement, but 
remains below that of a year earlier. Nonresidential construction 
activity is mixed. Conditions appear to be improving in resource 
industries, including energy where there is some pickup in oil 
drilling activity. Farm sector conditions are also continuing to 
improve. Generally stronger loan demand is reported at banks in a 
number of Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent improvement in retail sales is best described as generally 
modest, with this year's early Easter affecting comparisons with a 
year earlier. Several individual District reports use words like 
sluggish, slow, and modest in describing recent sales growth (New 
York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Minneapolis). Somewhat 
greater strength is suggested by reports from Richmond, St. Louis, 
and Boston. Where specific lines of goods are mentioned, apparel 
sales are generally described as weak, while strength in sales of 
appliances and home furnishings varies from region to region. 
General merchandise and department store sales appear to be faring 
better than sales at specialty stores. Retail inventories are being 
closely monitored, with aggressive markdowns reported in several 
Districts in order to keep inventories under control. Several 
Districts note strong sales for domestically produced new cars, 
including light trucks and minivans. Inventories of new cars were 
generally described as satisfactory to tight.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing sector activity remains strong. The strength appears 
to be generally broad-based, with export growth often cited as a 
major contributor. Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond note general 
strength in both shipments and orders. Chicago remarks on the 
reopening of export markets for heavy trucks. Atlanta reports 
apparel exports are growing and textile mills are running at or near 
capacity. St. Louis and Dallas, however, note some slowing in 
textile and apparel production. Chicago and Cleveland report 
continuing strength in heavy industries such as steel and machine 
tools. Chicago reports strength in steel mill orders into the third 
quarter. Steel fabricators have orders backlogged into the third 
quarter, and service center business is also strong. Prices are up 
for most types of steel, with some types in short supply. 
Manufacturers' purchasing agents in both the Chicago and Kansas City 
Districts are seeing a longer delay in deliveries of goods ordered. 
Respondents are also concerned about higher materials prices, 
especially for steel, paper, plastics, and aluminum.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing sector activity in most Districts has shown some recent 
improvement, but remains below levels of a year earlier. 
Nonresidential building activity is mixed. According to the Atlanta 
Bank, the decline in nonresidential construction activity in the 
southeast is slowing. Chicago reports modestly higher nonresidential 
building activity and expects a higher level of industrial 
construction this year. The pace of office leasing has improved in 
the New York District and considerable hotel construction is 
scheduled or underway in New York City. Overall construction 
activity in the Dallas District continues to decline with little 
evidence of recovery in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions appear to be improving in resource industries, including 
the energy sector. San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Kansas City all 
report some pickup in oil drilling activity, but Kansas City notes 
further improvement may be limited by uncertainty about oil supplies 
and prices. Dallas notes a sharp rebound in oil, drilling, 
concentrated in Texas where the rig count increased for the first 
time in six months; further gains are expected. Forest products 
companies and copper mining in the San Francisco District are 
benefiting from strong prices and improved cost structures. 
Minneapolis reports its important forest products industry is 
currently running at capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the farm sector generally continue to improve. Farm 
incomes. are expected to be relatively high again this year but not 
as high as in 1987, due primarily to smaller government payments and 
smaller returns to the livestock sector. Farmland values are 
generally rising in most areas and farm financial conditions appear 
to be strengthening. Dallas reports the number of farmers and 
ranchers leaving agriculture is slowing considerably. Cotton acreage 
planted is expected to increase substantially in the Atlanta and St. 
Louis Districts, Dry conditions are of some concern in several 
states, with water shortages of increasing concern in the San 
Francisco District where livestock producers are already suffering 
and crop irrigation may be reduced this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of Districts report stronger loan demand. Relatively strong 
loan demand in the Cleveland District is concentrated in business 
lending, with smaller gains in consumer installment lending. 
Consumer lending growth is mentioned by several Districts, with 
Richmond and Philadelphia noting some strength in the demand for 
home equity loans. San Francisco, however, reports overall loan 
demand appears about unchanged. Also, Dallas says loans in that 
District are generally still in a slide, with business loans 
declining most. Dallas also notes, though, that the rates of decline 
in loans at large banks slowed markedly in the first quarter 
compared with the last half of 1987.
