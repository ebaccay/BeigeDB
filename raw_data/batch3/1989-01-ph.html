      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 25, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy continues to expand as 1989 begins but 
there are indications that the pace of the advance may be 
slackening. Manufacturers polled for the January Business Outlook 
Survey report moderate improvement again this month, marking a full 
year of expansion according to the survey. Most retailers report 
meeting their Christmas sales goals of modest real growth from the 
previous year. Bankers indicate that loan growth was good as 1988 
closed, with business, personal, and real estate lending all on the 
rise. Realtors describe the commercial real estate market as healthy 
but note a decline in residential sales since the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      While current conditions indicate continuing growth in most sectors 
of the Third District economy, slower progress may be ahead. 
Manufacturers expect activity to ease from its current pace during 
the first half of the year. Retailers are generally cautious in 
their sales planning for the new year and most are keeping 
inventories under tight control. Bankers note a falloff in business 
loan and mortgage applications in recent weeks, and they expect 
slower growth in all types of lending this year compared to last. 
Realtors expect commercial leasing activity in 1989 to run at around 
the same rate as in 1988. Although they are looking for a pickup in 
residential sales by spring, they say the prospect is uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Local manufacturers are starting 1989 on a positive note, according 
to the January Business Outlook Survey, although they believe 
business might dip later in the year. Among firms participating in 
the survey, 36 percent report business is moving up while only 8 
percent say it is slowing. In both the durable and nondurable goods 
sectors most measures of industrial activity reflect moderate 
expansion. New orders, shipments, and order backlogs were rising in 
January, and inventories were edging down. On balance, survey 
participants were increasing working hours and adding marginally to 
payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices in the region remain on an upward trend. Sixty-one 
percent of the January survey participants said they were paying 
more for inputs compared to December and 38 percent were raising the 
prices of their own products.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to current reports of generally healthy business 
conditions, local manufacturers predict some decline in activity by 
midyear. Looking out six months, 27 percent of the January survey 
participants expect the pace of business to slow while only 18 
percent expect further improvement. On balance, survey respondents 
foresee the rate of orders holding steady during the first half of 
the year while shipments rise slightly, leading to a decline in 
order backlogs as manufacturing activity slows. Despite this 
forecast, survey respondents are planning to add workers and boost 
capital spending between now and summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District merchants generally reported meeting sales goals for 
the Christmas season, helped by stronger than usual sales in the 
week after Christmas. Department stores in the region averaged 
around 6 percent year-over-year gains, in current dollar terms. 
Discount stores did somewhat better. Specialty store results were 
mixed: some posted strong increases white others only matched or 
fell below their 1987 performance. Most store officials said their 
inventories were lean as Christmas approached, and they did not make 
significant unplanned price reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most merchants contacted in early January described their sales 
plans for 1989 as very cautious. Their impression of consumer 
confidence is that it is high but fragile; and many retailers 
believe that sales could drop off sharply in the wake of any 
negative economic news.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto sales in early January were up from the same 
period last year for domestic makes, but off for imports. Dealers 
say demand for most U.S. models is running above expectations 
although a few are not proving popular and incentives are being 
offered to reduce inventories of these cars. Area dealers say total 
unit sales in 1988 were around 3 percent higher than in 1987, in 
contrast with forecasts of a slow year. Few dealers expect growth to 
continue in 1989, but most think sales will not fall substantially 
below the 1988 level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan volume at major Third District banks in December was 
approximately 13 percent above the December 1987 level, reflecting a 
year-over-year growth rate that has been steady since mid-1988. 
Bankers contacted in January said the volume of commercial and 
industrial loans being booked was moving up strongly, but inquiries 
and applications from potential borrowers were dropping off. 
Consumer credit lending was increasing at a pace that bankers 
described as healthy but not exceptionally strong after accounting 
for seasonal variation. Real estate lending continues on a trend of 
strong but slackening growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most area bankers expect that the pace of growth for all types of 
lending will ease as the year progresses. They base this forecast on 
estimates of slower economic growth nationwide.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The commercial real estate market in the Third District is 
characterized as generally healthy by area real estate firms. The 
office vacancy rate in the central business district of Philadelphia 
is estimated at 14 percent currently, up only slightly from a year 
ago. The vacancy rate is projected to be stable in 1989 and then 
move up slightly as new buildings are completed in the next few 
years. Suburban office vacancy rates range from 16 to 25 percent, 
essentially unchanged from a year ago. Effective rent charges (rates 
minus the value of concessions and services provided by landlords) 
throughout the Third District are described as stable for older 
office buildings but rising somewhat for new buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for industrial buildings has been strong, coming mainly from 
area manufacturers who are expanding. Realtors say the supply of new 
space is tight; and they believe construction of new industrial 
buildings may decline this year due to a pullback in lending to 
builders by financial institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential realtors say sales of existing homes have declined in 
many parts of the Third District since the summer, and price 
appreciation has slowed, as potential buyers are increasingly 
reluctant to pay current asking prices. Realtors expect sales 
activity to pick up gradually this spring as sellers begin to accept 
lesser gains than they had been anticipating on sales of their 
homes. Realtors do not view current mortgage rates as a deterrent to 
sales.
