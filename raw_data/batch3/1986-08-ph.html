      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions are steady or improving for major sectors of the 
Third District economy. Manufacturing activity edged up in July, 
following three level months. Retail sales in June and July 
generally met merchants' expectations of 5-10 percent year-over-year 
growth. Automobile sales increased also. Total loan volume at large 
Third District banks in June was above the level of June 1985, but 
growth during the month was slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations for the Third District economy are generally positive. 
More than half of the industrial firms contacted for the July 
Business Outlook Survey anticipate improved conditions over the next 
six months. Retailers say the summer selling season, which went 
well, is essentially over; they are preparing for the fall, and are 
holding to their earlier forecasts for a good year as a whole. 
Commercial bankers believe the Third District economy is 
fundamentally healthy, and they expect moderate loan growth during 
the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District has picked up 
marginally, following a three month lull. Among industrial firms 
polled for the July Business Outlook Survey, 25 percent reported 
increased business since June while only 16 percent noted a 
slowdown; 49 percent indicated no change. Nondurable goods producers 
reported somewhat better conditions than did makers of durable 
goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specific measures of industrial activity for July were mixed, but 
indicate some improvement, on balance. New orders and shipments were 
up fractionally, but order backlogs were unchanged. Employment in 
the manufacturing sector was also steady, and working hours edged 
up. Prices of industrial goods in the region are stable. Eighty 
percent of the July survey respondents say neither input costs nor 
output prices have changed since June.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers have positive views of the future, on 
the whole. More than half of the companies participating in the July 
survey predict better business conditions over the next six months 
while 20 percent expect a slowdown. Survey respondents forecast 
gains in new orders and shipments, but anticipate an essentially 
stable employment situation, with steady payrolls and a slight 
upturn in working hours. Local manufacturers plan some increases in 
capital spending for the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally report good conditions. 
Department store and general merchandise sales met plans in June, 
with increases in the range of 5-10 percent above June 1985. Sales 
have been holding up in July, which retailers say is often a slow 
month. Merchants say seasonal goods have sold well, and they 
attribute this to several weeks of hot, dry weather. Sales of 
clothing and furniture are also strong. Automobile sales have picked 
up in recent weeks, but do not appear to be exceeding the sales rate 
in the comparable period of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District retailers expect the usual lull in August, but are 
looking for further growth in sales in the fall season. Some major 
store chains expect to finish the year with record sales and gains 
over 1985 near 10 percent. However, competition among discount 
stores is increasing as national chains expand their presence in the 
District; and some merchants say that profit margins are contracting 
slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from major Third District banks indicate that the total 
volume of loans outstanding in June was approximately 16 percent 
above the level of June 1985. Since May, however, loans have grown 
at only a 4 percent annual rate. Growth has bean weakest in the 
commercial and industrial sector, mainly as a result of efforts on 
the part of the banks' themselves. Some Third District bankers say 
they have retrenched in this category in order to maintain loan 
quality as demand for funds from more creditworthy borrowers 
slackens. In addition, some bankers have reduced the extent of their 
participation in national credits as net interest margins on these 
loans have narrowed and reduced their profitability.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer lending is moving up at about the same pace as it has since 
the start of the year, but Third District bankers say this momentum 
may have been maintained by the marketing of low rate (9-10 percent) 
loans by some banks. These promotional rates were discontinued in 
July, and bankers expect slower growth in consumer lending for the 
balance of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate and construction lending slowed somewhat in June, but 
was still nearly 10 percent above June 1985. Construction lending is 
still strong although some industry contacts say the pace of 
building is slowing due to concern over anticipated tax changes. 
Mortgage lenders say they are still working on backlogs, although 
the pace of new applications has slowed in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total deposits at large Third District banks in June were up 
approximately 10 percent from a year ago. The narrowing spread 
between rates paid on passbook savings and market-related rate 
accounts is becoming a matter of concern among local bankers. Some 
say they are beginning to think about possibly reducing passbook 
rates in order to maintain the customary differential.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the exception of farms in Delaware, and especially those in the 
southern half of the state, the agricultural sector of the Third 
District economy is generally healthy at this time. Dairy, 
livestock, and poultry farmers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are 
holding their own, with profit margins widening as a result of 
stronger prices and lower feed costs. Dry weather still prevails in 
most parts of the area, but recent rainfall saved some crops from 
failure.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cattle and hog farmers in the area have seen prices rise in the last 
few months, probably by enough to offset lower production and give 
total revenues a boost. The dairy industry is holding steady, with 
June production by Pennsylvania farmers 2 percent higher than a year 
ago and at an all-time high; however, milk prices are down about 5 
percent over that time. Poultry farmers are also posting gains, 
benefiting both from lower feed grain costs and higher prices for 
both eggs and broilers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the District experienced very dry weather in May and June, 
and, although wheat and barley crops were doing well, corn and 
soybeans were at a critical stage, and the second cutting of hay was 
reported to be short. Heavy rain arrived in mid-July, however, and 
prospects for field crop harvests in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are 
improved. Fruit and vegetable farmers in South Jersey report higher 
prices for their products, partly as a result of the crisis in the 
Southeast. Most fruit and vegetable farms in the area are irrigated 
and did not suffer from the earlier dry weather, and production, 
while not reaching last year's levels, should still be high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop farmers in Delaware, especially southern Delaware, are reported 
to be experiencing drought conditions. Losses are expected to exceed 
30 percent of projected crop yields, in some cases by a wide margin. 
Livestock farmers are in distress because they have little or no 
pasture left.
