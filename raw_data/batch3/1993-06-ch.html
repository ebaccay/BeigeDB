      Beige Book Report: Chicago

       June 23, 1993
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expansion in the District continued in May and early June. 
Reports from retailers and consumer goods manufacturers suggest that 
retail sales growth picked up modestly, aided in part by pent-up 
demand after unseasonably bad weather in the first quarter. 
Manufacturing activity continued its expansion, with slowing growth 
in some sectors offset by improving results in several industries 
that had previously been weak. Motor vehicle production continued to 
gain momentum, with output plans for the third quarter calling for a 
significant increase over year-earlier levels. Survey-based measures 
and reports from individual businesses gave no evidence of 
significant upward pressure on prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from large retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods 
suggest that consumer demand increased in the District in recent 
months. A large department store chain reported that sales growth in 
the Midwest increased moderately (on a seasonally adjusted basis) in 
May and early June, after a snapback in April from weather-depressed 
levels in the first quarter. Sales strength remained concentrated in 
durable goods, notably appliances and home improvement items. Credit 
utilization continued to rise and delinquency rates continued to 
improve. A large discount chain reported improvement in traffic and 
increased sales momentum during May and early June. This firm 
expected same-store sales growth to improve modestly in the latter 
half of 1993. A manufacturer of home entertainment products reported 
that shipments gains continued in the early part of the second 
quarter, and stated that feedback from dealers suggested that sales 
growth should continue into the summer. This contact stated that 
"inventories are not a problem, either for us or our dealers." An 
electronic industries association reported that year-over-year 
growth in retail sales of consumer electronics slowed modestly 
during the second quarter, but stated that "sales are still going 
well, after 1993 got off to a great start."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers' surveys and reports from individual 
manufacturers indicate that production growth also continued in 
recent months. The production component of purchasing managers' 
surveys in Chicago and Milwaukee followed the national pattern by 
slipping back marginally in recent months, but both of these 
indicators remained at levels consistent with continued expansion in 
activity. The production component of the Detroit survey climbed 
again during May to a level above those for Chicago, Milwaukee and 
the nation as a whole, reflecting relative strength being 
experienced in the motor vehicle industry. Purchasing managers 
surveys conducted in Western Michigan were also indicative of 
somewhat stronger production trends than those in Chicago and 
Milwaukee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from individual manufacturers west mostly positive. After 
lagging the recovery in much of the District's industrial sector, 
several manufacturers of construction machinery increased their 
production plans in recent months. One of these firms cited 
increased economic activity, growth in corporate cash flow, and 
favorable financial conditions as leading to "an upbeat domestic 
environment for the first time in a long time." The turnaround in 
demand for this firm's products has been led by housing activity, 
but demand for equipment used in nonresidential construction 
recently began to improve as well. A manufacturer of heavy-duty 
trucks reported that orders continued to run at high levels, but 
stated that "there may be some chinks in the armor," noting modestly 
increased cancellation rates. This contact noted that recent
strengthening in medium-duty truck orders has been concentrated in 
leasing and rental firms. A heavy-duty truck industry analyst 
reported that production continued to rise on a seasonally adjusted 
basis during May. A large supplier to heavy-duty truck manufacturers 
reported that the pace of expansion in its own production has 
leveled off somewhat, but this contact also noted a recent pickup in 
orders from medium-duty truck manufacturers, a market that had been 
dormant for some time. A steel industry analyst reported that order 
books for integrated manufacturers are generally full into the 
fourth quarter, primarily due to strength in demand from auto and 
appliance producers, but also due to recent strengthening in 
construction and, to a lesser extent, agricultural machinery 
markets. A diversified manufacturer of heavy machinery stated that 
orders for its oilfield machinery and material handling equipment 
remained relatively weak. A manufacturer of plumbing products 
expressed some concern about recent trends in housing activity, but 
another producer reported that shipments of equipment linked to 
housing construction continued to run at good levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production of light vehicles continued to gain momentum in May and 
early June, and several large automakers released third quarter 
assembly schedules calling for significant further improvement in 
production. Contacts with several automakers recently revised upward 
their forecasts for vehicle sales in 1993. One stressed that vehicle 
sales should not be seen as being detached from the rest of the 
economy; "modest gains in employment and income, reduced consumer 
debt, low interest rates and pent-up demand are all factors driving 
the recovery forward." Another large automaker remained confident 
regarding future sales growth, especially on the retail side of the 
market. This contact stated that increased production schedules 
appear very reasonable, in part because dealer orders have been 
outpacing sales. A large bank reported that commercial and 
industrial loan growth in Michigan has been running above the 
national average, citing strength in demand from auto suppliers. 
Auto suppliers generally reported stronger orders and improved 
assessments of the potential for further gains in the latter half of 
1993. One supplier expected sales gains in the second and third 
quarters to run in line with those in the past six months, with all 
of the expected gains arising due to increased volume; "customers 
are not paying our price increases."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers' surveys suggest that price pressures in the 
District's industrial sector moderated in recent months, while 
reports from a wide variety of individual firms gave no evidence of 
significant upward pressure on prices. The price component of the 
Chicago purchasing managers' survey rose at one of the highest rates 
in the past decade over the five months ending in March, then fell 
back somewhat in April and May. The price component of the Detroit 
survey also gave back some ground in recent months. Two large 
retailers continued to emphasize that intense competitive pressures 
in retailing are still holding down prices to consumers. One of 
these firms stated that price increases are generally running in 
line with, or slightly lower than, those experienced at this time 
last year. A manufacturer of consumer products also noted that 
intensified competition at the retail level has left little room for 
price increases by producers of consumer electronics. A chemical 
producer stated that overcapacity in production has dampened price 
increases in this segment of the company's business, while input 
price changes (except for steel) also have been relatively modest. A 
producer or heavy machinery expressed skepticism about the 
sustainability of recent or continued increases in steel prices. An 
auto supplier noted some new price increases in purchased materials, 
but stated that they were modest and selective by type of input. 
Earlier in 1993, some manufacturing contacts reported seeing larger 
price increases than normal for that time of year, but these posted 
increases were also accompanied by deeper discounts. A manufacturer 
of heavy equipment experiencing renewed strength in most of its 
business lines cited the lack of a generalized upturn in demand for 
commodities as the most important factor leading sales of mining 
equipment to lag the companywide average. One manufacturer in an 
international market stated "many of the price increases we do see 
are coming from the import side."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace in crop plantings improved considerably in recent weeks, 
overcoming most of the earlier delays from cool, wet weather. The 
delays may result in some modest shifting in the mix of crop acres. 
However, analysts believe that virtually all of the intended corn 
acreage in District states was seeded prior to the passing of 
critical planting dates. (June 15 is generally regarded as the 
latest acceptable date for planting corn.) Early crop development -- 
both for field crops and for much of the District's vegetable 
acreage -- is below normal due to the late plantings. However, 
moisture supplies in most areas are adequate to abundant and the 
return of warmer weather brings hopes for faster crop development.
