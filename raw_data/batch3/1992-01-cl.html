      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 22, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is still little sign of a renewed recovery in the Fourth 
District. Major retailers experienced a sales gain during the 
Christmas season from levels a year earlier, but the increases were 
less than expected. Industrial activity in the District slowed 
recently, led especially by the auto industry. Revived growth in 
industrial production could occur this quarter, if auto production 
strengthens as generally expected. Lower interest rates have boosted 
refinancing of mortgage and business loans, but new business and 
consumer lending still shows little indication of growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales during the Christmas season were reported between 2% 
and 4% above levels a year earlier. A few retailers cited better-
than-expected sales, but others described sales as disappointing or 
"below plan". Sales in a large upscale shopping center were said to 
be better than in 1990, but ranged widely between retailers who 
posted large gains and those who had declines from a year earlier. A 
retailer with stores throughout the District reported that sales in 
Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati were stronger than nationally 
and than a year ago, but sales in some smaller metropolitan centers 
of the District were weak. Despite the uncertain outlook going into 
the holiday shopping season, price discounting was no greater than a 
year earlier, according to some retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      At year-end 1991, inventories were larger than desired by some 
retailers. They generally have shaved their sales goals for the 
spring months, but uniformly expect a stronger second half than 
first half of 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to economists associated with consumer goods industries, 
real consumer spending last quarter rose between zero and a 1% 
annual rate, and is expected to rise between a 1% and 2% annual rate 
this quarter. There is little support among them for a temporary cut 
in personal income taxes to stimulate spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automotive
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most automotive analysts anticipate that the auto industry will 
contribute to growth of industrial production and total output this 
quarter, following a decline in auto output last quarter. Auto 
production is expected to increase a few percent this quarter from 
last. Industry analysts do not expect additional production layoffs 
this quarter, although temporary plant shutdowns could occur if 
inventories rise more than desired. New car stocks are said to be 
larger than desired for some cars, but low for a few popular models.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the District are a little more optimistic about 
short-term sales prospects than they have been in recent months, 
because their December sales improved from November and from a year 
earlier. That helped to cut some of their excess inventories, and 
most dealers contacted now expect that they will slightly increase 
their factory orders this quarter from last.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakened automotive output has set back auto-supplying industries. 
Steel producers note a letup in orders for delivery during the rest 
of this quarter, and consequently a shortening in lead times. Also, 
some cutback in steel inventories this quarter, following a larger-
than-desired buildup last quarter, will likely result in a trimming 
of steel output. Orders for auto paints and coatings and glass have 
softened since last fall, but are no longer deteriorating, according 
to a major supplier. Some auto tire analysts expect that both 
original equipment and replacement tire demand in 1992 will be up a 
few percent from 1991, but no pickup from the present weak demand is 
expected until after the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several capital goods producers report a softening in orders in the 
past month or two following a revival that began last spring. The 
upturn in heavy-duty truck output flattened in recent months after 
several months of irregular but rising activity, according to a 
supplier. The daily average of orders for an industrial equipment 
producer in December fell after a steady climb through November. 
Customer inventories are believed to be low, however, because orders 
have been more frequent but smaller. A parts supplier to the office 
machinery industry reported a further rise in orders through last 
quarter. He expects that spending for real producers' durable 
equipment last quarter rose at about a 5% annual rate, led by the 
computer and aerospace industries, with most other capital goods 
industries showing little change from the previous quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers in general do not anticipate an increase in their 
capital spending in 1992 from 1991, although spending plans vary 
widely by industry. Some producers expect higher outlays this year, 
particularly for equipment, to improve product quality, broaden 
product lines, and increase productivity. Some plan less spending 
this year than last because of cutbacks in business structures. A 
tool producer plans a step-up in spending this year for further 
modernization of existing facilities. Although the primary metals 
industry is apparently anticipating some cutback in spending this 
year, a producer plans a large capital expenditure for quality and 
cost improvement. A mineral resources producer expects his firm and 
industry to cut back spending in 1992 because of prospects for weak 
prices for their products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital spending plans are not being delayed, although some may be 
stretched out, and discussion of a possible tax change is not yet 
affecting spending plans. A common view among manufacturers seems to 
be that an investment tax credit, although less beneficial over the 
long run than a cut in corporate tax rates, would be a temporary 
stimulus to investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is still little sign of strengthening in new business or 
consumer loans, according to banks and thrift institutions. Lenders 
report, however, heavy demand for refinancing of mortgage loans, and 
more businesses are refinancing bank loans. Some lenders have only 
recently begun to lower borrowing rates on consumer installment 
loans, but interest rates on a 30-year fixed-rate loan have been 
easing steadily and are now common at 8%, with some mortgage bankers 
offering rates at about 7.5% plus points. Many mortgage lenders 
anticipate a sharp rise in demand for new loans during the spring. 
Some thrifts report that mortgage holders are shifting from 
adjustable-rate to fixed-rate mortgages.
