      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is easing, according to 
indications from businesses surveyed in July. Manufacturers reported 
a drop in business for the month. Retailers said sales were flat 
compared to last year and auto dealers indicated sales were running 
below the year-ago pace. Bankers said that loan growth for the 
second quarter eased from the first quarter's pace and appeared to 
be slowing further in July. Despite the slackening pace of business, 
employment in most industries remains healthy. Many firms indicate 
they are raising wages for entry-level employees in the face of a 
shortage of qualified workers; however, there are not widespread 
plans to boost payrolls further.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, the consensus opinion in the Third District business 
community is that business with be steady or slightly slower for the 
rest of the year. Manufacturers expect activity to stabilize at 
about its current pace. Retailers expect real sales in the second 
half to run about even with or slightly below the rate of the sane 
period last year. Auto dealers anticipate a further decline in sales 
but not a substantial drop-off. Bankers expect loan growth to 
slacken as the economy slows somewhat and as banks tighten credit 
standards for real estate lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District showed signs of slowing 
in July, according to companies polled during the month. Nearly one-
third of the manufacturers surveyed said activity was declining, 
while half reported steady business, and the rest indicated some 
improvement from June. Firms in nearly all the goods-producing 
industries in the region contacted in July indicated that business 
was off from June.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, area firms were receiving fewer orders for their 
products in July than they did in June, and order backlogs were 
declining significantly as local companies stepped up shipments. 
Overall, area manufacturers said inventories remained level, with 
little change since April. Measures of employment were mixed: area 
firms were adding marginally to payrolls in July, but they were 
trimming the workweek. Industrial companies reported paying higher 
wages for new employees, both production workers and professional 
personnel. On the price front, area manufacturers continue to report 
more increases than decreases; however, the incidence of price 
hikes—for either inputs or outputs—appears to be declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking to the future, the balance of opinion among Third District 
manufacturers is that business will stabilize at about its current 
pace for the rest of the year. They expect new orders to run at a 
steady rate into the beginning of next year, but they anticipate 
further declines in order backlogs. Despite signs of slower 
business, area firms intend to maintain current employment levels 
and working hours, and they plan to boost capital spending, on 
balance, over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in July said sales for June and 
July were about even with the year-ago pace, in dollar terms. 
Merchants say women's apparel is selling above last year's rate, 
while appliances and other big-ticket items are weaker. Discount 
stores are achieving somewhat better results than other types of 
stores, and merchants describe shoppers as very price-conscious and 
selective with regard to the quality of merchandise they are buying. 
Nearly all store executives contacted in July said inventories were 
at planned levels. Many retailers report they are having difficulty 
finding entry-level employees although plans to increase staffing do 
not appear to be widespread.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, retailers say real sales in the second half of the year 
will probably run about even with or slightly below the same period 
last year. Many merchants are trimming orders for fall merchandise 
although women's apparel retailers are preparing for continued 
improvement in sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District domestic auto dealers contacted in July said both 
unit and dollar sales were running slightly below the pace of last 
year. Foreign auto dealers are achieving somewhat better sales (in 
unit and dollar terms) than they did last summer. All dealers report 
a continuing squeeze on profit margins due to higher car and parts 
prices from manufacturers and rising costs for financing 
inventories. Locally, domestic car dealers report inventories 
ranging up to twice desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in early 
July was approximately 9 percent above the year-ago level, as the 
pace of growth in lending continued to ease from the rate set in the 
first quarter. Growth in business and consumer lending has slowed 
significantly in recent months. Real estate lending has remained on 
a strong upward trend during this same period but bankers contacted 
in late July said they have been booking less real estate credit in 
recent weeks compared to the buildup in real estate loans earlier 
this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers generally expect loan demand to weaken in the 
second half in all credit categories in response to slower economic 
growth and tightened credit standards, especially for real estate 
loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, bankers indicate that deposit growth is in line with 
asset expansion plans, but net interest margins are under some 
pressure because loan rates have declined while relatively high 
rates are still being paid on certificates of deposit booked earlier 
this year.
