      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most sectors of the District economy grew moderately in June and 
early July, although finance and residential real estate slowed 
somewhat. Manufacturing and retail activity rose, and modest price 
increases were seen in both sectors. Port activity and tourism 
picked up. and commercial real estate activity was strong. Mortgage 
originations and consumer lending, however, declined slightly. 
Agricultural activity was at a normal level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to a regular mail survey indicated that District retail 
activity increased in June. Sales. wages. and shopper traffic rose, 
but employment, big-ticket sales, and inventories changed little. 
Survey respondents indicated that retail prices increased 0.3 
percent in June, and they expected prices to increase 1.3 percent 
during the next six months. They also foresaw increased demand for 
their products in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's board of directors reported that retail sales--
especially sales of autos and building materials--generally were 
strong in their areas. They noted, however, that consumers continued 
to be price conscious and willing to shop at several stores before 
making a purchase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A mail survey of District manufacturers showed increased factory 
activity in June. Survey respondents reported increases in 
shipments, the volume of new orders, order backlogs, and the hours 
worked per week. Despite increased factory activity, there was no 
rise in factory employment. Capital expenditures were up compared to 
six months ago. Manufacturers expected shipments and capital 
expenditures to increase during the next six months, but they 
anticipated no change in employment. Finished goods prices were 
steady; raw materials prices increased, but by less than the general 
inflation rate. Producers expected these price trends to continue 
during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service-Producing Firms
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to a mail survey of District service-producing firms 
indicated higher revenues and wages in June. Employment changed 
little, except for increases in the wholesale and health services 
sectors. Service prices rose 0.2 percent in June, and respondents 
looked for them to rise 0.7 percent during the next six months. 
Respondents also expected demand for their services to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated that tourist activity in June and early July was 
higher than in May and a year ago. Over the last several weeks, many 
beach area hotels were reported booked to capacity; the Fourth of 
July weekend was especially busy. Other beach and mountain area 
hotels and resorts experienced increased bookings. All respondents 
expected tourist activity for the remainder of the summer to be 
above last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at the District ports of Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk) indicated that both exports and imports were 
higher in June than in May. Compared with a year ago, imports were 
higher, but exports were unchanged. Baltimore reported that 
warehouses were filling up because of increased imports but noted 
that the weak dollar could soon shift activity from imports to 
exports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions indicated that lending activity 
slowed slightly during the last six weeks. Mortgage originations 
declined somewhat, and refinancing remained weak. Consumer lending 
also declined slightly, although it remained at a fairly strong 
level. Interest rates on both mortgage and consumer loans rose. 
Commercial lending remained weak, and rates were unchanged. Most 
lenders were cautious about future loan demand and expected slow to-
moderate levels of activity through the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate contacts reported steady buyer traffic but fewer home 
sales in June and early July. Homebuilders said there were fewer 
starts and building permits because of fears of future mortgage rate 
hikes. Home prices were unchanged; lumber prices and construction 
wages were stable, although the cost of other building materials 
rose.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts continued to report strong leasing activity in 
June and declining vacancy rates, creating shortages of space in 
some areas. The supply of newer office space was particularly tight. 
The price of commercial office space continued to inch upward, 
especially in suburban areas. Increased prices of newer space led 
some businesses in Charleston, W.Va., to move to older, less 
expensive buildings to save money. Financing for speculative 
construction remained tight; however, real estate agents anticipated 
new build-to-suit construction in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State government revenue forecasters said tax collections from June 
suggested that economic growth in Maryland and South Carolina slowed 
slightly but remained steady in the other states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop and weather conditions were normal across most of the District 
in recent weeks. Scattered rainfall brought relief to crops in many 
areas, although some remained dry, and temperatures were above-
normal in others. Corn and soybeans generally were in fair-to-good 
condition. Hay cutting was underway, and the harvesting of tobacco, 
vegetable crops, and peaches was beginning. The small grains harvest 
was nearly complete, and reports suggested good yields.
