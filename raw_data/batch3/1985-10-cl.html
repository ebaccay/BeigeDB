      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's economy remains weak overall albeit with pockets of 
improvement. The unemployment rate remains high and is exceptionally 
high in some areas, while manufacturing employment continues to 
decline. Department store sales are disappointing and auto sales 
have fallen to typical levels following the end of special financing 
programs. Manufacturing activity is increasing in the Cincinnati 
area but declining in northeast Ohio. The steel industry continues 
in difficulty with another major plant closing recently announced. 
The housing industry is showing further strengthening. Commercial 
bank loan demand has picked up somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the District remain soft. The Ohio 
unemployment rate was 9.4% (s.a.) in September, up 0.2 percentage 
points from a year ago. Manufacturing employment continues to 
decline. Some manufacturing firms report they are not laying off but 
are not replacing workers who leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major Fourth District department stores report that sales over the 
last six weeks were disappointing. Retailers point to exceptionally 
warm weather in September, which discouraged shopping, and an early 
Labor Day, which shortened the back-to-school shopping period, as 
sources of sluggishness. One analyst asserted that record auto 
sales, most of which were heavily financed, hurt department store 
sales because monthly car payments reduce disposable income 
available for other spending. All major stores expect improved sales 
in the fourth quarter, and therefore are not worried about the 
moderate inventory accumulation from recent slack sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers report that, as expected, sales fell during the first 
week of October as special financing on 1985 models ended. However, 
this decline was not as severe as many had expected and sales are 
described as "typical" for October. Expectations for the rest of 
1985 are mixed, with some dealers building inventories in 
anticipation of strong sales through November, while others expect 
an immediate sharp decline in demand. Several dealers express 
confidence that major manufacturers are likely to re-establish low 
financing rates on virtually all models soon because bank loan rates 
for car purchases are far above the banks' cost of funds and these 
spreads are unlikely to diminish much in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is uneven in the District and mining remains 
depressed. Manufacturers in the Cincinnati area report solid gains 
in production and new orders, slight increases in employment, and 
small declines in inventories. In contrast, manufacturers in 
northeast Ohio continue to report declines in production, new 
orders, and employment, and slight, probably involuntary, increases 
in inventories. A survey of manufacturing firms in midwestern states 
shows incoming orders falling for consumer non-durables but rising 
for consumer durables and capital goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing managers generally report slight declines in prices paid 
for materials and components and in prices received for finished 
goods, and describe the current situation as a buyers' market. They 
expect no increase in inflation in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand is improving in the fabricated aluminum products business, 
but ingot aluminum prices are very low and continue to decline 
because of excess world smelting capacity. A major aluminum producer 
recently announced plans to diversify away from supplying the 
primary aluminum market.
     </p>
     <p>
      The steel industry continues to face weak demand and prices and 
strong competition from abroad. A major producer recently announced 
plans to close a 1,200 employee plant by yearend 1985 because of 
strong import competition and weak domestic demand for seamless 
tube. A strike continues at a major steel producer that is in 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
     </p>
     <p>
      High labor costs are claimed to be hampering some other firms. A 
major manufacturing firm recently cancelled a $185 million planned 
renovation of a mill because its union refused to make any 
concessions. Another firm is moving a plant out of this area because 
it is unable to obtain any concessions from its union.
     </p>
     <p>
      The coal mining industry in the District remains in distress with no 
relief in sight. Unemployment rates in the teens are common in coal 
mining counties in this District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      More optimism is evident in midwestern housing markets than last 
month because of lower mortgage rates, strong income gains, and 
availability of state-subsidized mortgage money. A major builder in 
this District reports strong gains in house construction in August 
and September, and if fourth quarter earnings are only fair, the 
firm will post record earnings for 1985. Despite the gains, the firm 
recently reduced slightly its forecast for housing demand in the 
fourth quarter and into 1986. Sales of existing houses have been 
strong in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, encouraging builders there to 
begin again to construct houses on speculation. Asking  prices on 
new houses are reported to be much higher than on equivalent
existing houses.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major real estate firm reports new listings remain very strong and 
should sustain strong real estate broker activity into 1986. In 
Pittsburgh, lower interest rates have boosted existing home sales 
but it is still very much a buyers' market.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large mortgage lender in this District reports that as mortgage 
rates have fallen to what many borrowers view as the interest rate 
trough, the incidence of mortgage refinancings has increased. 
Mortgage refinancings represent one-third of total mortgage volume 
at this mortgage lender.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District loan demand has picked up somewhat. Loans outstanding in 
all major categories at large banks increased over the past month. 
Contacts report some pick up in business loan demand and expect a 
small increase in commercial and industrial lending during the 
fourth quarter. Despite weakness in auto lending due to the 
availability of cut-rate financing through auto companies, banks 
posted healthy gains in overall consumer loan volume during 
September. Unless these special financing deals are resumed on a 
broad scale, bankers anticipate further strength in consumer loans 
over the next few months.
