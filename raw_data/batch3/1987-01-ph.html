      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy appears healthy, although growth in 
several sectors has slowed recently. Manufacturing activity was only 
steady in January, following six consecutive months of expansion. 
Retail sales during the holiday shopping season met merchants' 
plans, which called for modest year-over-year gains, and they have 
been enjoying a healthy rate of sales since Christmas. Automobile 
sales were high in December but low in January. Total loan volume at 
major Third District banks was growing slowly as 1986 came to a 
close, although real estate lending remains strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations for the Third District economy are generally positive. 
A majority of manufacturers polled in January predict steady or 
improving business during the first half of the year. Retailers also 
expect a good year, but express some concern that consumer debt 
burdens could limit discretionary spending. Automobile dealers say 
it will be several months before the slack following the December 
rush of car sales is reversed. Bankers expect business lending to 
parallel moderate economic growth in 1987, but they believe 
consumers will not be willing to add much to their current debt 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After posting six consecutive monthly gains, the Third District 
manufacturing sector is pausing in January, according to the latest 
Business Outlook Survey. Overall, business is running at a steady 
rate in both the durable and non-durable goods sectors. While firms 
reporting improved business in January edged out those reporting 
slower business, they did so by only a slim margin. This lull is 
reflected in most measures of industrial activity. New orders are up 
fractionally, but shipments, order backlogs, and inventories are 
virtually unchanged. Employment is also at a standstill.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices in the area are mostly stable; 80 percent of the 
firms contacted in January said both input and output prices were 
unchanged from December. However, 15 percent noted increased costs 
for the goods they purchase, and 12 percent charged more for their 
own products.
     </p>
     <p>
      In their outlook for the first half of 1987, local manufacturers 
have mostly positive views. Forty-three percent of the January 
survey respondents expect continued growth and 38 percent anticipate 
steady conditions; only 15 percent forecast a slowdown. Overall, 
survey respondents expect increases in orders and shipments. They 
remain cautious, however, and are planning no changes in either 
employment or capital spending schedules during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers generally made their modest Christmas sales targets, 
averaging 4-5 percent over 1985, after a late burst of buying. Year-
over-year gains varied widely by type of store, however. Specialty 
retailers recorded the best increases, with sales at some stores up 
around 10 percent from the previous year; general merchandise stores 
posted gains at the lower end of the scale. Clothing and housewares 
were the best performing product lines. Going into the holiday 
season, inventories were leaner than in previous years; thus, 
retailers did not resort to unplanned markdowns despite the slow 
start of Christmas buying. Store executives contacted in January 
said their inventory-to-sales ratios remain about where they want 
them. Automobile sales were strong in December as buyers took 
advantage of the expiring sales tax deduction, according to dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers are optimistic that the healthy rate of sales so far in 
January indicates a good year ahead. However, some express concern 
that discretionary spending could lag, as consumers make payments on 
automobiles and other high-priced merchandise purchased late in 
1986. Automobile dealers reported a sharp slowdown in sales in 
January, which they attribute to the shifting of purchases into 
1986; they do not expect sales to pick up for several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loam volume at large Third District banks edged up slightly 
during the first three weeks of December, and near the end of the 
year stood approximately 15 percent above the December 1985 level. 
Real estate lending is especially robust, and commercial lending is 
also strong. Bankers say loan demand in these categories was high 
near the end of the year due to tax changes which became effective 
January 1. Lending officers expect commercial and industrial loam 
demand to grow this year at nearly the same rate as it did in 1986, 
provided the economy does not weaken. But bank profits may come 
under pressure despite a healthy economy. Although still a minority, 
an increasing number of Third District banks say their net interest 
margins may shrink this year as a result of increased competition in 
lending to the middle market and a slowdown in deposit growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth in consumer loan volume at major Third District banks tapered 
off during 1986, and near the end of the year consumer credit 
outstanding was approximately 10 percent above the December 1985 
level. This is a continuation of a trend to slower growth in 
consumer lending that began in the second half of 1985. Local 
bankers generally believe that consumers are approaching the limit 
of their willingness to add to debt burdens. Nevertheless, home 
equity lending appears to be increasing, prompted by the new tax law 
and strong promotion by banks. A significant portion of this new 
lending reflects consolidation of bank and merchant credit card 
debt, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial and residential real estate markets in the Third District 
are active, and most real estate contacts expect healthy conditions 
in 1987. Demand for office space continues to absorb new 
construction; new buildings are substantially pre-leased, especially 
in the Philadelphia and Wilmington central business districts. There 
is more slack in suburban areas, and leasing activity is expected to 
decline somewhat this year in these outlying markets. For industrial 
properties, realtors forecast stable or slightly easing demand this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate activity is strong. The average rate for 30-
year fixed rate mortgages has fallen to around 9 percent in the 
region, and realtors say this enables a substantial number of buyers 
to afford homes for the first time. Consequently, sales and prices 
rose throughout 1986, and realtors expect this trend to continue. 
However, builders note increasing resistance to higher prices for 
newly constructed homes. One large mortgage lender is predicting a 
10 percent decline in housing starts in the region this year, but 
most builders think this is an overly pessimistic view.
