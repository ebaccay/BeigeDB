      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 24, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Moderate growth is being reported by most Federal Reserve Districts, 
although the regional variations in economic conditions are 
substantial. Retail sales are expanding slowly, but several 
Districts report an acceleration in sales in recent months. 
Automobile sales are declining from their year-earlier levels and 
inventories have grown, but remain within acceptable ranges. 
Manufacturing activity is weak, especially in energy-dependent 
industries and regions. Past reductions in oil prizes have led to 
significant declines in drilling. Residential construction activity 
remains strong overall. Nonresidential building, while maintaining a 
high level, is beginning to decline. Loan demand has been stable in 
most Districts. Agriculture is still facing low prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have been growing moderately in most Districts. 
Cleveland, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia report accelerating 
rates of expansion, but Dallas and St. Louis note absolute declines 
from a year earlier. Little change is cited in inventories, which 
are generally said to be tightly managed. Prices are stable, 
although some Districts say that respondents expect price increases 
for imported goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales are sluggish in most Districts. The exception is 
Chicago, where sales have been matching last year's levels. 
Respondents report that a significant portion of the decline was 
anticipated because of the exceptionally strong sales of preceding 
years. In the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Cleveland Districts, sales 
have been increasing in the second quarter over the first quarter 
levels, but remain below a year earlier. Inventories are growing, 
but are still within acceptable levels. For some particularly 
popular models, however, inventories are lean.
     </p>
     <p>
      Early reports on tourism support the outlook for increased domestic 
travel this summer. Respondents report that lower gasoline prices, 
the weaker dollar, and preference for domestic vacations are the 
contributing factors. New York reports that foreign tourism is 
buoying retail sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing remains weak overall. Although several Districts note 
growing manufacturing output and employment, Cleveland, Chicago, and 
Dallas all report that the slump in energy has markedly reduced 
demand for manufactured goods, particularly steel and machinery. A 
number of Districts, however, cite industries such as tire 
manufacturing and petrochemicals that are benefiting from lower 
energy costs. Increased construction activity nationally is buoying 
orders to lumber and wood products firms and paper goods producers 
in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts, but it is providing little 
impetus to these industries elsewhere. Richmond notes that furniture 
manufacturers have excessive inventories due to lower-than-expected 
orders, and that longer-than-normal plant closures are planned for 
this summer. Boston's respondents have noticed some increased prices 
for imported manufactured goods, but they have seen little effect on 
sales or output. San Francisco's comments on weak employment growth 
in the electronic equipment sector seem to reflect this industry's 
national experience, especially with regard to computer-related 
goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, the strongest construction sector is single-family 
residential building, but this strength is not uniform. New York, 
Cleveland, and San Francisco all describe booming residential 
construction, aided by falling mortgage interest rates. In the 
Boston and Chicago Districts, shortages of skilled construction 
labor are now providing a drag on residential building. In contrast, 
home building in the Dallas District, and in some states of the 
Minneapolis and Atlanta Districts, has been stymied by weak economic 
conditions in these areas. Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas all cite 
sluggishness in multifamily building.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth rates of nonresidential building activity are declining or 
negative in every District that mentions this indicator. 
Nevertheless, the pace of nonresidential construction remains high 
in some Districts, notably Chicago, Atlanta, and New York. Retail 
building is generally the most active nonresidential category. 
Office construction is the weakest category, with rent concessions 
resulting from overbuilding in many major cities nationwide. St. 
Louis and Dallas report absolutely declining commercial 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The oil and gas extraction industry continues to reel as a result of 
falling oil prices. Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Minneapolis 
note reduced exploration and development activity in their 
Districts. The number of drilling rigs in operation is dropping 
nationwide. Richmond and Cleveland say that competition from oil and 
gas is reducing output and employment among coal mining firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Favorable weather is facilitating crop planting in the Chicago, St. 
Louis, and Minneapolis Districts, while adverse weather has hindered 
such activities in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts. 
Low crop prices are mentioned as a concern in most agricultural 
regions. Chicago and Minneapolis note that increased dairy herd 
slaughter is depressing prices for cattle. Despite their uncertainty 
about the effects of the federal program to buy out dairy herds, 
cattle feeders in the Kansas City District are marketing their 
livestock on schedule. Both beef and poultry producers are expected 
to benefit from reductions in feeding costs. A slowing rate of 
increase in overdue agricultural loans is cited by St. Louis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand has been stable in most Districts. Continuing strong 
demand for mortgage refinancing is cited by San Francisco, Richmond, 
Chicago, and Kansas City. A result has been higher mortgage rates 
and delays in closing. Cleveland, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas 
note growth in real estate and construction lending. The demand for 
commercial and business loans has been soft in Cleveland, 
Minneapolis, and Dallas, while increasing in Philadelphia. Consumer 
lending has been rising with particular vigor. New York, Cleveland, 
Atlanta, and Philadelphia all report strong growth in this asset 
category.
