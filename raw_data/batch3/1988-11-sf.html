      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 30, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Twelfth District economy continues to post healthy economic 
growth. Although respondents to this Bank's Business Sentiment 
Survey indicate that their expectations about the national economy 
continue to deteriorate, most paint upbeat pictures of conditions in 
their industries and regions. Increases in wages and prices are 
noted for a wide range of products and industries, while recent 
price decreases have occurred only in a few sectors. Although 
consumer spending has been lackluster in recent months, 
manufacturing activity continues strong. In the forest products 
industries, demand for lumber and plywood has fallen slightly, while 
capacity constraints are easing in paper production. Gold mining
activity continues strong in Nevada. The pace of construction and 
real estate activity varies widely within the District, with 
strength noted in California, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada; 
markets in Arizona, Alaska, and Utah remain weak. Financial 
institutions continue to report stiff competition for quality 
borrowers, but industry profits appear to be holding up well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents reported further weakening in their expectations 
regarding GNP growth during the next year. In the November survey, 
53 percent anticipate that next year's growth will be weaker than 3 
percent, compared with 43 percent in October and only 34 percent in 
September. Less dramatic weakening in expectations was noted in 
business investment, consumer spending, and the trade deficit. 
Respondents indicated that their expectations about housing starts 
during the next year have improved somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports suggest varying degrees of upward pressure on wages and 
prices. Structure adjustments for wages and salaries are expected to 
be close to 5 percent in most cases, which represents a slight up-
tick from the 4 to 5 percent range earlier this year. Some note 
dramatic price increases. For example, one respondent notes price 
increases of 10 to 14 percent during the past quarter for such "big-
ticket" items as large generators and steam boilers. Others report 
more modest, but also more widespread, increases. For example, a 
vintner reports increases in the costs of many materials, including 
grapes, glass, corks, and labels, which have led to slight increases 
in his company's wine prices. Newsprint prices seem to be 
stabilizing after dramatic increases earlier in the year. Reports 
indicate recent price decreases for natural gas, plywood, and used 
cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of soft goods have been relatively flat since late summer, 
although one respondent notes some improvement during October and 
early November. Weakening consumer spending also has been reflected 
in reduced spending on advertising in both print and broadcast 
media.
     </p>
     <p>
      October was a sluggish month in the retail automobile business, with 
weak demand for new cars. Moreover, a general absence of buyers at 
wholesale used car auctions suggests that the used car market, which 
until recently had been very strong, may be weakening as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents generally indicate that manufacturing activity is 
strong, particularly in the Northwest. Increased aluminum production 
in the Pacific Northwest has cut the region's previous electricity 
surplus in half. Capacity constraints are clearly evident in the 
aerospace industry, as Boeing has a three and a half year backlog of 
unfilled orders for commercial aircraft. A shortage exists for 
titanium dioxide, a key whitening and opacity agent used in paints 
and coatings. No additional production is anticipated until 1992, 
but demand continues to grow, particularly offshore. As a result, 
the price of titanium dioxide continues to escalate.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the same time, the volume of orders continues to decline in the 
semiconductor industry. The book-to-bill ratio (orders received 
divided by orders shipped) has fallen in each of the past six 
months, and now stands at a two-year low of 0.96. Moreover, many 
producers are experiencing declining profits, and some layoffs and 
plant shutdowns have been reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for lumber and plywood has fallen in recent weeks, and prices 
are eroding slowly. In contrast, log and timber prices remain firm 
due to continued strong export demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bottlenecks and capacity constraints are easing in the paper 
business. The operating rate for linerboard, which is used to make 
boxes, declined about 2 percent during 1988. Demand growth slowed to 
a 2 percent pace, while the capacity growth rate staged to 3.5 
percent. This rate of capacity growth was much higher than estimates 
made in 1987 suggested it would be. Newsprint operating rates also 
are declining, with significant capacity growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      There continues to be a great deal of activity in gold mining in 
Nevada, both in production and exploration. The decline in the price 
of gold has not been large enough to have a significant adverse 
effect on the industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity continues strong in 
Washington, Oregon, California, and Nevada. One respondent from 
central Oregon notes that some title companies in his area are 
working their employees overtime to process the large volume of 
transactions. Increases in California residential property values 
have slowed substantially from the 15 to 20 percent rates seen 
earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Utah, Arizona, and Alaska, however, construction activity remains 
at low levels. An Arizona developer reports that for the first time 
in twelve to fifteen years, property values are starting to decline. 
The average resale price for a single-family home in Arizona has 
fallen by more than 3 percent during the past year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks and thrifts report continued competition for quality loans. 
Some report that, as a result, credit requirements are being relaxed 
in order to attract additional business. Despite the relatively 
small volume of loans being made, many financial institution are 
experiencing improvements in net income over last year.
