      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 23, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic weakness persists in California, and conditions are mixed 
in other District states. In California, cutbacks continue to be 
announced in aerospace and defense-related manufacturing. 
Furthermore, cutbacks in state and local government spending are 
expected to reduce employment growth in that sector. Outside of 
California, moderate improvement is reported in retail trade, non-
defense manufacturing, and residential construction, with the 
strongest conditions reported in Utah and Idaho. Drought is 
threatening agriculture in certain sections of the Pacific 
Northwest. Overall business sentiment continues to decline. Little 
upward pressure on wages and prices is reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Pessimism is increasing among Twelfth District business leaders. 
Less than 20 percent of our respondents now expect the real economy 
to expand during the next four quarters at a rate of at least 2.5 
percent. This proportion is down from one-third in July and one-half 
in June. Three-quarters of our respondents expect real output to 
expand, but at a rate below 2.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts continue to report little upward pressure on prices in 
District markets. Grocery prices are reported flat, with meat prices 
reported down 3 percent from a year earlier and produce prices 
reported down 9 percent. General merchandise and pharmacy price 
increases are running at 3.5 percent versus the 6 to 9 percent 
annual increases seen in 1991 and 1990. Aluminum prices are dropping 
due to weak demand and large inventories. Lumber prices, which 
decreased in July, however, have rebounded to high levels as result 
of Hurricane Andrew. Also, electricity prices are up in Oregon due 
to drought-related reductions in hydroelectric power. A 20 percent 
increase in wholesale electricity rates has been proposed in that 
state, which would increase average retail bills by 5 to l0 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases appear modest in most District industries. Increases 
in the retail sector are reported in the 3 percent range, while 
contacts in banking expect small increases in wages during the next 
12 months. Little upward pressure on manufacturing wages is reported 
due to cutbacks in production and employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers report sluggish conditions for soft goods in most 
markets. Most retailers are reported to be working to reduce 
inventories. Major grocery chains are reporting flat sales and 
declining earnings. Contacts in Oregon report that retail business 
has been slow, but still profitable, and retail sales in Arizona are 
reported to have improved. Retail activity in southern California, 
however, is reported to have deteriorated. Contacts report that 
tourist-related retail and service sector jobs are down in Los 
Angeles due to the riots.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some increases in auto sales in Oregon were reported for August, and 
contacts in Utah report good summertime new auto sales. A moderate 
rebound in auto sales is reported in Arizona. However, farm 
equipment sales are off 50 to 60 percent in Idaho due to the 
drought.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent state budget settlement in California has reduced 
uncertainty about financing among local governments, but significant 
cuts in state assistance are expected to result in layoffs. Local 
governments in Washington have announced a hiring freeze, and state 
government employment is off in Oregon. Law firms are growing very 
slowly, and net job losses are expected in accounting. Health care 
employment continues to increase. Tourism in Hawaii for July was 
reported down due to discounted air fares within the 48 contiguous 
states that caused a large drop in California visitors. The effects 
of the recent Hawaiian hurricane are not yet known, but major damage 
was confined to the lesser populated island of Kauai.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Job losses continued to be reported in defense, aerospace, and high-
tech manufacturing. Major additional layoffs in these sectors were 
recently announced in southern California. Layoffs by defense 
manufacturers and airlines also are reported in Utah. Aviation 
production rates are dropping, with a small avionics manufacturer in 
Washington expecting a 10 to 15 percent reduction in its production 
over the next 12 months. In Washington, contacts report that 
Boeing's backlog of orders appears to be softening due to weak 
worldwide economic conditions. The company continues to win a large 
share of world-wide orders, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of these sectors, some modest improvement is noted. In 
Washington, contacts report improvement in food processing and non-
military electronic equipment. In Oregon, heavy truck production is 
expanding to meet demand from Latin America. Production of computer 
printers is expected to expand in Washington and Oregon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought conditions in Idaho are expected to lower farm income by 20 
percent this year. Contacts from eastern Oregon report that drought 
and hot weather have resulted in a short supply of livestock 
pasture. Wheat yields are anywhere from 15 to 50 percent below a 
year earlier and are resulting in reduced grain shipments bound for 
Pacific Rim markets. However, the unusually sunny weather has 
produced sharp increases in tree fruit crops in Oregon and 
Washington. Lumber demand and prices have been boosted by 
reconstruction activity in Florida and Louisiana. Wood products 
production and employment, however, continue to deteriorate due to 
the lack of raw timber sales from public lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity is mixed across District markets. Contacts 
report that construction activity is stable in Washington and 
Alaska, but is weak in California and Hawaii. Homes and ranch 
properties are selling well in Oregon. One contact in Oregon, 
however, reports that several major nonresidential projects are on 
hold until next year. In the Puget Sound area, single family 
construction is 10 percent above a year earlier, but multi-family 
construction is 60 percent below a year earlier. Residential 
construction activity in eastern Washington and northern Idaho 
continues to rise in response to strong demand. Construction 
activity in California, however, continues to decline, particularly 
in nonresidential sectors. Residential markets in California are 
sluggish, with price decreases reported far higher priced 
properties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Low interest rates are improving the profitability of District 
financial institutions, but demand remains soft for commercial, 
industrial, and consumer loans in most markets. The weakest loan 
demand is reported in California. Delinquency ratios for commercial 
real estate in California continue to rise. Deposit growth is 
reported relatively strong in Arizona, but loan demand has been 
sluggish except for increased interest in mortgage refinancings. 
Relatively stronger demand for consumer loans is reported in Oregon, 
and demand for both consumer and mortgage loans remains brisk in 
Utah and Idaho. Currently low interest rates have increased the 
level of mortgage refinancings across the District, but refinancings 
are still below the levels seen in early 1992. In California and 
Oregon, contacts report that conventional sources of financing have 
been almost completely out of the market for construction financing 
and long-term financing of commercial real estate.
