      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall economic activity in the Third District is advancing 
modestly in September, although the manufacturing sector continues 
to soften, with area industrial firms reporting declining business 
activity edging out those indicating improvement for the third month 
in a row. Retailers, however, report moderate growth in line with 
expectations, and auto sales picked up in August as manufacturers 
offered more generous incentives. Banks benefited from improved auto 
sales in the consumer lending area, while the growth of business 
lending has slackened. Real estate lending remains on a strong 
upward trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District business contacts generally foresee a continuation of 
current trends. Manufacturers predict some further declines in 
business over the next six months. Retailers expect sales to grow at 
about their current pace but they are being cautious in their 
planning for the fall and winter. Bankers anticipate slower growth 
in lending of all kinds during the rest of the year as a result of 
the slower economic activity they forecast, as well as the more 
stringent credit standards they are implementing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturing activity continued to slow in August 
and early September, according to firms contacted for this report, 
as the region's goods-producing sector experienced a third 
consecutive month of slowing business. Overall, while about half the 
companies surveyed indicated they were maintaining steady 
operations, nearly one-third said they were experiencing a drop in 
activity. Durable goods producers, particularly those in heavy 
manufacturing industries, indicated the sharpest drop in activity 
while nondurable manufacturers generally reported steady or 
improving business conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, area firms were stepping up shipments in August and 
September, but they were obtaining new orders at just a steady rate, 
leading to a drop in order backlogs. Employment also showed some 
weakness, as area firms were reducing both payrolls and working 
hours; many firms that had been running double shifts have now pared 
second shift hours. Industrial contacts noted continued slackening 
in the pace of price increases for both inputs and outputs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, managers at area plants generally expect a further 
decline in business. Among firms polled for this report, pessimistic 
forecasts for the next six months edge out optimistic predictions. 
On balance, area companies expect a pickup in both orders and 
shipments while order backlogs continue to fall. With some further 
slippage on the horizon, local firms plan additional cuts in 
payrolls and working hours between now and next spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally described sales as having run at 
a satisfactory rate in August and into September. Department store 
sales showed a year-over-year increase of approximately 6 percent, 
in dollar terms, while discount and specialty stores achieved 
somewhat better gains. However, some local specialty chains that 
have been expanding locations aggressively indicated that results at 
new stores were not meeting expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly all retail contacts reported that inventories were under 
control. Auto dealers trimmed inventories as sales picked up in 
August with new manufacturers' incentives to clear out 1989 models
     </p>
     .
     <p>
      Area merchants said they are being cautious in their planning for 
the rest of the year. Orders to suppliers are conservative and 
promotional plans are modest. Store officials generally do not 
anticipate a consumer pullback in the months ahead but they believe 
that some slackening in demand through next spring is more likely 
than an acceleration in spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Outstanding loan volume at major Third District banks in late August 
was approximately 12 percent above the level at the same time last 
year. Commercial and industrial loan growth was described as good by 
bank lending officers contacted in early September, but several 
noted that growth has been easing over the summer and they believe 
it is likely to slacken further as the year comes to a close. The 
slower growth is predicted by area bankers as a result of easing 
demand as well as a tightening of credit standards. Besides taking a 
more restrictive stance with regard to new applicants for business 
loans, some banks indicated they were winding down relationships 
with current borrowers who do not meet more rigid credit standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer loan growth picked up in August, primarily due to increased 
auto loans as consumers took advantage of manufacturers' rebates. 
Other categories of consumer lending were showing only slight 
growth, according to local bankers. As with business lending, 
personal loan credit standards are being tightened by several banks 
in the region; lending officers said this move is being taken even 
though they do not expect strong loan demand from consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate lending continued to grow at a strong pace at most Third 
District banks. However, bankers noted that weakness is developing 
in office leasing in some suburban areas and they plan to limit the 
expansion of commercial real estate lending.
