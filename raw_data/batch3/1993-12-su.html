      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity 
continued to expand at a moderate pace through the end of November 
and reports were generally more optimistic than those of this 
summer. Consumer spending improved in a majority of Districts, with 
sales of autos and other durable goods said to again show relative 
strength. Retailers in several Districts reported that the holiday 
shopping season got off to a good start over the long Thanksgiving 
weekend with sales at or exceeding expectations. Manufacturing 
activity also was seen as improving in most Districts, but few 
businesses reported new hiring. Residential real estate markets were 
once again noted as a source of strength in most District economies, 
while commercial real estate markets have begun to show a few signs 
of improvement. Wage increases and prices for final goods generally 
were said to be stable, although several Districts reported that 
prices for lumber and other building materials have risen since 
October. Commentary on conditions in three Districts--Boston, New 
York, and San Francisco--was more mixed, with particular weakness 
indicated in reports from California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While retailers in a few Districts saw unseasonably slow retail 
sales in the early fall, most were reporting gains by late October. 
Stores in the Atlanta, Cleveland, and New York Districts noted that 
consumer spending momentum began to pick up in late October, and 
that it has continued into the holiday shopping season. Holiday 
sales through the Thanksgiving weekend were better than they had 
anticipated in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and 
St. Louis Districts, despite severe weather in some areas. Reports 
from Richmond and San Francisco indicate that retailers in those 
Districts also expect relatively strong fourth quarter sales. The 
Boston, Cleveland and Philadelphia Districts said that retailers 
were relying upon special promotions to bring shoppers into the 
stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dealers in most Districts noted moderate year-over-year increases in 
auto and truck sales in October and November. Those in the Dallas 
and St. Louis Districts reported that trucks and minivans were 
selling the fastest, while leasing activity picked up in Cleveland. 
At the same time, low inventories of new model year vehicles were 
said to be constraining sales in parts of the Chicago, San 
Francisco, and St. Louis Districts, although in Chicago most 
shortages had been alleviated by November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers in most Districts reported some strengthening in 
current manufacturing activity, as well as improvements in 
expectations of future business conditions. Firms in the Atlanta, 
Dallas, and St. Louis Districts noted that production of lumber and 
other building materials continues to benefit from increased 
construction activity, while factory reports from the Cleveland and 
Minneapolis Districts noted increased demand for construction-
related heavy equipment. Strong demand for consumer durables is said 
to have provided a boost to manufacturers in the Boston, Chicago, 
and Minneapolis Districts, while improved demand for autos and 
trucks increased production at plants in the Atlanta, Boston,
Chicago, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts. Capital goods producers 
in the Cleveland District indicated that automobile-related orders 
are a source of strength for the region into 1994. Looking forward, 
manufacturers' expectations of future business activity in a 
majority of Districts have improved recently, while many firms in 
the New York and Philadelphia Districts have revised their capital 
spending plans upward for the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although business conditions are seen as improved in many 
industries, employment gains remain muted, with continued reports of 
defense and aerospace cutbacks. Manufacturers in the Atlanta 
District said that employment has been flat, while those in the 
Cleveland District noted that small firms also were not adding new 
employees. Reports from manufacturers in California indicate 
continued sluggishness. Businesses in the Atlanta, San Francisco, 
and St. Louis Districts cited new layoffs prompted by cutbacks in 
defense and NASA programs, while manufacturers of aircraft parts and 
defense-related equipment in the Boston District have continued to 
experience sales declines. Employers in the apparel industry in the 
Atlanta and Boston Districts also reported decreases in employment. 
Weak demand from foreign customers was said to be a source of 
concern to producers in the Boston and Cleveland Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in most Districts reported continued strength in housing 
markets, although those in the New York and San Francisco Districts 
were not as positive. Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis District 
contacts said that year-to-date home sales remain well ahead of last 
year. Builders in the Minneapolis District reported that residential 
construction remains one of the District's strongest sectors. 
Builders and realtors in the Atlanta, Dallas, and Kansas City 
Districts said that inventories of homes for sale were tight, while 
those in the Richmond District noted that strong demand and rising 
lumber prices have pushed new home contract prices higher. Shortages 
of available subcontractors and developed lots were said to be 
starting to constrain home construction in some areas of the Atlanta 
District. Builders in some part of the Dallas District are concerned 
about a shortage of qualified construction laborers and sales 
people, while those in St. Louis said they are struggling to keep up 
with the backlog of orders caused by rainy summer weather. In 
contrast, the reports from Philadelphia note that home inventories 
remain elevated, while those from New York saw few signs of 
increased interest from home-buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from commercial real estate markets were more mixed. 
Contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco 
Districts said that office and commercial vacancy rates remain at 
relatively high levels, although those in New York noted some 
improvement in downtown Manhattan. For Richmond, some improvement 
was seen in commercial leasing activity, as well as in office 
vacancy rates, but not enough to stimulate new building. In the 
Atlanta, Dallas, and Minneapolis Districts, however, construction of 
new retail space is said to reflect an improvement in commercial 
real estate markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks in most Districts said that overall loan demand improved 
modestly, with all reporting stronger demand in at least one sector. 
Those in the Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts 
noted that commercial loan demand had risen modestly, while banks in 
Cleveland, Dallas, and Philadelphia said it was still flat. 
Commercial lending was reported to be weak in the New York District 
and California. Atlanta, Kansas City, New York, and parts of the San 
Francisco District saw generally stronger consumer loan demand, 
while Cleveland, Philadelphia, and St. Louis noted specific 
improvement in auto lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the exception of some construction-related occupations, 
businesses generally commented that wage increases were modest and 
stable, while they said that prices of raw and intermediate 
materials as well as final goods were rising slightly in some areas. 
Higher agricultural prices stemming from weather-related crop damage 
were noted in several Districts. Contacts in the Atlanta, Richmond, 
and Kansas City Districts said that higher lumber prices were 
driving up new home prices. Firms in the Chicago District noted that 
signs of increased raw materials prices were becoming more common, 
while those in Boston and Richmond said that some manufacturers have 
been able to raise their prices. However, reports from contacts in 
the New York, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Atlanta Districts said 
that prices for finished goods have remained stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Poor summer and fall weather were seen as having had a negative 
impact upon crop yields in several Districts. The Kansas City and 
Minneapolis Districts reported that corn and soy bean yields and 
quality have been disappointing. Cotton yields were described as 
substandard by contacts in the Dallas District and in much of the 
St. Louis District. Dry weather combined with a poor hay crop has 
some farmers in Richmond worried about the adequacy of their winter 
feed stocks. Ranchers in the Kansas City District also report 
concerns over possibly rising feed prices. Conditions in the seafood 
industry in the San Francisco District were said to be poor. On a 
brighter note, record levels were seen for soy yields in Illinois 
and Indiana, corn production in Texas, and the wheat harvest in the 
northern plains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent weather conditions are said to have been favorable for 
agriculture in much of the country. In the Richmond District, the 
warm, dry weather has allowed fall planting activity to progress 
ahead of schedule. The recently planted winter wheat crop in the 
Kansas City District was reported to be in good condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on mining activity were mixed. Kansas City reported that 
drilling activity was seen as steady to improved in all Tenth 
District states except New Mexico. Dallas, however, reported that 
rig counts had been falling in response to weak oil prices and a 
recent dip in natural gas prices. Miners in the Minneapolis District 
reported that strong gold prices were encouraging activity in South 
Dakota and Montana, but that low aluminum prices and higher 
electricity costs might begin to curb aluminum mining in Montana.
