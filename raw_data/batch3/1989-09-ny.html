      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District activity continues to be basically mixed but with some 
recent signs of strengthening. Retail contacts reported over-the-year sales gains during July and August that, for the most part, 
were on or above targeted levels. Unemployment rates in the District 
have bounced around in recent months, but remain slightly below the 
national average.  Buffalo purchasing managers report improved 
business conditions.  In contrast, demand for new housing continued 
mixed, with some areas noting price declines, and office leasing 
activity slowed somewhat in its usual summer pattern. Most small- 
and medium-sized banks stated that they have not lowered rates on 
consumer loans since the latest decrease in the prime rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail contracts reported a wide range of over-the-year 
sales gains during July and August, but they were, for the most 
part, on or above targeted levels. July gains ranged between 2.5 
percent and 13.0 percent, while the August range was even wider: 
from 0.5 percent to 19.0 percent.  Most respondents described their 
July results as on or above plan though a couple found them to be 
disappointing. Two chains characterized their August sales as "well 
above plan", and a third posted higher-than-targeted results for the 
first time in several months. Women's apparel remained in strong 
demand at all stores during both July and August, and in August 
back-to-school departments also fared well. Reports on the demand 
for items such as men's clothing, furniture, and home furnishings 
were mixed, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories at the end of August were generally described as 
satisfactory. One retailer continued to have stocks above desired 
levels, but greatly reduced from the previous two months, while 
another reported an actual shortage of fall merchandise which he 
expected to be rectified in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for new housing in the District remained mixed in recent 
weeks.  An oversupply of homes in the resale market continues to be 
cited as a major deterrent to new construction activity in downstate 
New York and New Jersey where price cutting by both homeowners and 
developers has been noted lately. Some developers on Long Island, 
for example, have reportedly been reducing home prices by more than 
10 percent in order to reduce swollen inventories and pare carrying 
costs. However, in several upstate communities where prices continue 
to rise, homebuilders are quite busy and report an upturn in demand 
as a result of low mortgage rates and an end to exceptionally rainy 
weather. Observers in these communities anticipate that construction 
activity in 1989 will come close to the high level attained in 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity slowed somewhat since the last report in its 
usual summer patters.  Several new buildings were completed in 
midtown Manhattan which had tenant commitments for less than half 
their space, while in downtown Manhattan a sizable amount of 
existing prime office space was also placed on the market. As a 
result, the vacancy rate for prime space has increased somewhat in 
both these areas, though the rates remain below the national 
average. Office vacancy rates in most other District areas showed 
little change in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Reports on Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates have bounced around in recent months, 
but remain slightly below the national average with August readings 
of 5.0 percent in New York and 4.5 percent in New Jersey. In 
contrast to the national pattern of an over-the-year decline, 
though, unemployment rates in both New York and New Jersey have 
risen since last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The August survey of Buffalo purchasing managers reversed the July 
pattern, showing a sharp rise in firms with improved orders and 
production and a decline in those experiencing a worsening. August 
data for Rochester are not yet available but in July, 90 percent of 
surveyed managers there anticipated stable to improved conditions 
over the next three months after some deterioration from June to 
July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eastman Kodak recently announced that it will lay off an additional 
4500 workers this year, but it did not specify how many would be 
affected at its Rochester, New York headquarters. On Long Island a 
final decision has not yet been made public with regard to the 
Pentagon's plan to cancel Navy aircraft contracts at the Gruman 
plant. Among other recent developments which could have an adverse 
impact on the District's economy, two of New York's oldest retail 
chains—B. Altman and Bonwit Teller—filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection as a result of their parent company's financial 
difficulties, and a large furniture chain was unable to meet its 
interest payments and began discussing debt restructuring with its 
lenders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior officers contacted at small- and medium-sized banks in 
the Second District stated that they have not lowered their raises 
on consumer loans since the decrease in the prime rate on July 31 
nor do they plan to although many loan rates have been reduced. The 
majority of respondents noted that consumer loan demand has fallen 
off since this time last year. Those who have not experienced a 
decline in demand for consumer loans ascribed their success to 
aggressive marketing campaigns. Auto loan demand was perceived as 
very weak compared to this time last year due to a slowing of auto 
sales and to increases in dealer financing incentives. Respondents 
also stated that delinquency rates on consumer loans were slightly 
higher than a year ago. One banker said that their collection 
department has been expending increasing effort in order to keep 
delinquency rates from rising above acceptable levels. Most 
respondents believed that consumer loan demand will remain soft in 
the near future due to a weakening economy and two bankers said that 
consumers were far too extended to incur more debt. Some respondents 
indicated that if demand falls further, they may be forced to lower 
rates.
