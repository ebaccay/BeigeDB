      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The region's economic indicators continue to show signs of expansion 
for most non-energy related sectors in early spring. Output and 
employment are increasing for key regional industries such as 
textile, aerospace, and building products. Easter retail sales were 
favorable, but strength in auto sales was limited to imported 
vehicles. District building permits increased, and builders 
anticipate vigorous spring construction. International tourism is 
up, and rising imports are still boosting port activity. Less 
positively, farmers will reduce plantings, and the peach crop was 
severely damaged by cold weather. The petroleum and coal extraction 
industries remain at a low ebb with little reason to expect 
improvement at least for the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues to advance in the region. A record 
volume of direct foreign investment, largely in plants producing 
consumer goods and auto parts, is boosting manufacturing employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the first time in years, textile industry spokesmen have a 
positive outlook for their sector. After a shakeout in which many 
weaker firms either went out of business or were absorbed by 
stronger firms, profits and orders are rising, and employment levels 
are increasing. Defense spending also continues to bolster 
employment in the region, helping to maintain the Southeast's 
manufacturing jobs near a record high level. For example, two large 
aerospace companies have announced major contracts for the middle 
Georgia area, which are expected to spawn over 30 satellite 
industries to service the contracts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand appears to be holding up for the building products industry, 
although industrial spokesmen are concerned about the recent rise in 
mortgage interest rates. Paper packaging manufacturers report brisk 
business with hefty order backlogs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major southern retailers report that Easter sales met their 
expectations for good performance. Lean inventory levels reduced the 
need for Easter price promotions, but retailers are now finding it 
more costly to rebuild inventories as a result of the falling dollar 
and the recently imposed tariffs on electronic items from Japan.
     </p>
     <p>
      District car dealers reported mixed sales behavior through mid-
April; softening demand for some domestic models was partially 
offset by continued growth in sales of imported vehicles. Despite 
price hikes, imports continued to fuel much of the activity in 
dealers' showrooms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family building permits increased in the Sixth District in 
February after a four-month decline, leading builders to expect a 
strong upturn in construction this spring. The recent hike in the 
mortgage rate spurred an immediate rush by consumers to complete 
housing purchases; an Atlanta realtor reported a doubling of 
business the first weekend following the rise its rates, although 
business has since slowed as consumers await further indications of 
interest rate direction. Lenders are unwilling to make rate 
commitments beyond a few days.
     </p>
     <p>
      An oversupply of space still plagues the Sixth District's commercial 
construction industry. Atlanta developers say speculative building 
is very slow, and lenders require substantial preleasing when 
financing new projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In March, total loans at the District's larger commercial banks grew 
at 18 percent for the third consecutive month. Competition for 
commercial and home equity loans is unusually strong in Miami and 
Nashville. Bankers in Miami are poised for another round of 
reductions in credit card rates. None of the major Florida banks 
have lowered their rates yet, but cuts are possible considering 
recent reductions in a few Georgia banks and lagging outstanding 
credit card balances due to the popularity of home equity lines. 
Credit card delinquency rates and bankruptcies have jumped sharply 
in some of the most rapidly growing sectors of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The arrival of spring break again brought an influx of students to 
the beaches of Florida. A record number of college and high school 
students flocked to Daytona Beach; however, contacts in Fort 
Lauderdale report a 20 percent decline in student visitation this 
year. International tourists, whose numbers appear to be on the 
rise, find Florida a prime attraction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The falling dollar apparently has not yet improved trade activity at 
District ports. In New Orleans, for example, import volume continues 
to climb stubbornly. Port officials report that much of the recent 
tonnage increase there is due to rising imports of auto parts from 
Brazil, bagged fruits from the Caribbean, and steel and ore products 
from various countries. Except for forest products, exports are less 
than expected. An improving trade volume through Florida's ports is 
principally attributable to rising exports to the gradually 
recovering economies of Latin America.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fewer oil drilling rip were in operation in the District in March 
than any time in the past decade. Active rigs in the District number 
only 56 percent of those a year ago. It is unlikely that future 
production will return to past levels as many stripper wells have 
been closed and are unlikely to resume operation. District coal 
production in the first quarter of 1987 averaged 12 percent less 
than a year ago. Industry spokesmen indicate coal prices and profits 
will remain low until supply is more clearly in balance with demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the agricultural sector, land values appear to be stabilizing. 
Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee experienced modest increases in 
average prices during the past year, while Louisiana and Mississippi 
suffered further severe declines. District farmers intend to cut 
planted acreage by an additional 9 percent this year, further 
shrinking the prospective demand for products of farm suppliers. A 
late freeze eradicated about half of the region's peach crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lumber industry reports that southern pine is selling at prices 
14 percent above a year ago, reflecting a combination of influences 
including the Canadian export tax on lumber, rainy weather reduction 
in local production, and strong residential housing demand.
