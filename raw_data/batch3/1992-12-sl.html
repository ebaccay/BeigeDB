      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity continues to increase modestly, fueled by 
positive expectations for the current holiday shopping season. Many 
manufacturing firms have not experienced any recent changes in their 
demand, but see a bright future. Others, especially those in 
defense-related industries, continue to undergo reorganizations to 
compete in global markets. Nonmanufacturing firms have experienced 
increases in demand, especially retailers; many retailers predict 
the strongest year-end rally in recent years. Residential housing 
construction continues to be a source of strength throughout the 
District. Buoyed by business loan growth, total loans outstanding 
continue to increase at large District banks. Bumper crops are 
expected in most areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District manufacturing firms continue to be mixed, as 
some see better times ahead, while others are extremely cautious. 
One contact in the air conditioning and heating equipment industry 
reports an optimistic outlook for next year, especially in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Andrew; sales are expected to increase 10 
percent. Other durable goods producers also see improvements. For 
example, a maker of aluminum wheels for cars and trucks is 
expanding, leading to 300 new jobs, and an electrical components 
assembler is moving production from New Jersey to the Memphis area, 
creating 130 positions. In addition a maker of tennis equipment will 
renovate its plant and resume production after a two-year 
suspension, creating 150 new jobs by March, and a shoe plant, 
previously scheduled to close, will remain open until at least early 
next year because of an unexpected increase in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among firms less optimistic about the future, one contact in the 
electrical equipment sector reports that worsening foreign economies 
have led to growing skepticism about export growth, which had been a 
bright spot in the company's sales picture. Sales are down about 6 
percent from last year's modest level, A glass company in Illinois 
and an art supply manufacturer in Missouri will close by January, 
eliminating a total of 500 jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for restructuring in the District, a major chemical company 
announced a new reorganization and cost reduction plan that will 
eliminate 500 jobs. Increased development costs for new 
pharmaceuticals, without similar increases in product prices, have 
strained the company. A St. Louis defense contractor laid off 
another 400 workers at the beginning of November. Additional 
layoffs, possibly affecting up to 3,500 St. Louis workers, are 
expected in the near future. A maker of agricultural spraying 
equipment in Arkansas announced that it will move production to 
Texas and northern Illinois, taking 160 jobs with it. Finally, a 
company producing household storage containers is closing its 
Tennessee plant and consolidating production in South Carolina, 
resulting in a loss of 800 District jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonmanufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District nonmanufacturing firms are generally 
optimistic, especially from area retailers. Many area retailers 
reported increases in sales during October. In light of recently 
reported increases in consumer confidence and initial reports of 
strong post-Thanksgiving Day sales, retailers expect inflation-
adjusted holiday sales to be up significantly from last year. Some 
retailers have reported that they would rather forego sales than be 
stuck with excess inventory; therefore, stock is being maintained at 
minimal levels. Other nonmanufacturers also see growth. For example, 
a women's clothing chain is expanding its Memphis distribution
facility, adding 100 new jobs, and a mortgage company that had 
previously laid off about 700 St. Louis employees will add 250 new 
positions during the next six months. A telecommunications firm, 
however, decided to close its Louisville office, eliminating more 
than 110 jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction continues to be a bright spot in most parts 
of the District. Single-family housing permits in September and 
October were up substantially from their year-ago levels, though 
most areas reported stronger year-over-year increases in September 
than in October. New and existing home sales are also reported as 
strong in most areas of the District. One contact noted that recent 
increases in interest rates have encouraged potential homebuyers to 
get into the market before rates rise further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loans outstanding at 12 large District banks increased 0.6 percent 
from mid-September to mid-November, after declining 0.4 percent 
during the prior two months. Much of this turnaround can be 
attributed to business loans, which grew 1 percent during the past 
two months after a 4.7 percent decline during the prior two months. 
Consumer loans rose 1.6 percent from mid-September to mid-November 
after a 2.8 percent increase from mid-July to mid-September. Real 
estate loans, however, remained flat, declining as much in the last 
two months as they had risen in the prior two months. A sample of 93 
small and mid-sized District banks showed comparable trends. All 
categories of loans except for consumer loans posted increases in 
the last two months that exceeded their performance in the prior two 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Persistent rainfall has hampered the fall harvest in many District 
areas. For example, the corn harvests in Illinois, Indiana and 
Missouri are expected to continue well into December. The cotton 
harvest is also behind schedule in Tennessee. Nonetheless, bumper 
crops are expected in most areas. Record corn and soybean yields are 
expected in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee; 
Arkansas also expects to have a record soybean yield this fall. In 
terms of actual production, Illinois and Indiana farmers expect to 
have record-breaking corn and soybean crops, while Kentucky and 
Missouri farmers expect to harvest a record corn crop as well. A 
record rice crop is expected in Arkansas and Missouri; likewise, 
Tennessee cotton producers expect to harvest a record crop.
