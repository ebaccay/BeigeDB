      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Seventh District continue to trail the 
U.S., but there are some bright spots. Output of autos and trucks is 
scheduled at high levels in the second and third quarters, steel 
output is rising, and commercial construction is vigorous. However, 
orders for farm, construction, mining, and railroad equipment 
continue at very low levels: demand for heavy trucks and trailers 
has slowed: and the depressed farm sector has weakened further. 
Residential construction is expected to about equal last year. Total 
employment is flat, with new weakness in finance and medical care. 
Except for autos, retail sales are lackluster. Permanent plant 
closings continue to be announced in a variety of industries. Many 
financially-stressed businesses are pushing efforts to control 
costs, often with plant or office closings, hiring freezes and staff 
reductions. The flood of imports adversely affects a broad spectrum 
of industry, agriculture, and transportation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Further sizable increases in domestic auto and truck output relative 
to last year are planned for the second and third quarters. Sales 
continue strong helped by cut-rate financing on some models. Some 
Japanese imports and favored domestic models are in short supply. 
Car and truck makers plan large increases in capital spending for 
major renovations and new plant construction. Several states have 
been competing for new plants, domestic and foreign, offering tax 
breaks and other benefits. Easing of Japanese restraints on auto 
exports will affect investment plans and encourage foreign sourcing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production at District steel mills is rising, but remains short of 
levels reached in the first half of 1984. Stronger demand for steel 
is centered in cold rolled and coated sheets, especially for motor 
vehicles, but also for appliance., office furniture, and light 
construction. Orders from makers of heavy machinery are only 
slightly improved. A Chicago area mill is running two shifts at its 
structural steel facilities because of plant closings by competitors 
in the East, South, and West. Domestic producers hope to benefit 
from agreements being negotiated with major steel exporting 
countries to limit shipments to the U.S. Steel makers continue 
efforts to lower costs. One of the strongest District firms recently 
announced plans to shrink capacity and employment substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District equipment producers still face weak markets. 
Construction, farm, and mining equipment makers are still losing 
money. Rail equipment orders remain very low. Orders for hoists and 
indoor cranes have increased, from a low level. Few large outdoor 
cranes are being produced. Machine tool orders are better, but still 
far below good levels of the past. Competition from foreign 
producers continues fierce, here and abroad. More U.S. capital goods 
producers are shifting production to their foreign plants or are 
sourcing abroad. Demand for automated warehouse facilities, which 
offer large gains in productivity, is strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Farm Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A leading farm equipment maker has agreed to sell its agricultural 
lines, and will close two plants. Another major firm sold out 
earlier this year. Tractor plant closings in District states, 
apparently permanent, announced over the past 6 months cut industry 
capacity by about half. Another producer plans a 6-month halt in 
output of four-wheel-drive tractors to reduce inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reported shipments by truck and rail have been running below last 
year. This is believed to reflect a shift to owner-operator trucks 
and private truck fleets. Demand for rail equipment remains very low 
and sales of heavy trucks and trailers have been slipping. The huge 
trade deficit has created an imbalance in ground transport, with 
many trailers and freight cars returning empty to port areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction, especially large office buildings in 
downtown Chicago, is strong. with vacancy rates substantial, it is 
believed that some of these projects are being pushed ahead to 
qualify for tax incentives which may be altered. Heavy industrial 
and utility construction are at very low levels. Residential 
building appears to be rebounding from the effects of adverse winter 
weather, but is still well below levels of the 1970s. Apartment 
rents are rising about 9 percent this year. Apartment vacancy rates 
are low, but new building is weak. Highway and bridge construction 
is expected to continue very strong into 1986 as a result of release 
of impounded federal funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales gains have recently been disappointing at some major District 
general merchandise retailers. Inventories are being brought back 
into line, often through price promotions. Orders for standard 
appliances and recreational equipment have slipped below last year's 
improved levels. Increases in general merchandise prices continue 
small, around 2 percent over a year earlier. Consumer attitudes in 
the District remain relatively optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in agriculture continue to deteriorate, depressing local 
economies and industries dependent on agriculture. Prices of corn 
and soybeans, major District crops, have fallen 20 to 25 percent 
since the downtrend began last April. Surveys indicate large 
plantings, which could bring another year of surplus production and 
low crop prices. Livestock prices are down 12 to 15 percent from a 
year ago, but are expected to rebound by summer. Agricultural 
exports are expected to decline to a 6-year low. District farmland 
values fell again in the first quarter, by 6 percent, and were off a 
third from the 1981 peak, led by a decline of over 40 percent in 
Iowa. Payments under new government farm programs, with high 
enrollments in the District and the nation, will ease financial 
strains for crop farmers.
