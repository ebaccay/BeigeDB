      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District was growing slightly in 
February, according to reports from business contacts in the region. 
Manufacturers continued to post gains in shipments and orders. 
Retailers generally said sales were running even with or above the 
year-ago pace. Bankers noted recent increases in commercial and 
industrial lending, and rising mortgage loan volumes as February 
drew to a close. Consumer lending was generally flat, due to 
seasonal factors according to bankers. Realtors reported increasing 
demand for industrial space while demand for office space remained 
weak. Home sales eased in January and February following an increase 
in the fourth quarter of 1992, but realtors said the slowdown may be 
largely seasonal.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook remains positive in the Third District business 
community. Manufacturers forecast continued improvement and indicate 
they may step up hiring somewhat and increase capital spending. 
Retailers expect sales to improve through the first half of the 
year. Bankers anticipate continued gains in commercial and 
industrial lending and growing strength in consumer loan demand, but 
they expect real estate lending to ease. Realtors have a more 
optimistic view; they look for renewed growth in residential sales 
in the spring but they do not expect healthier commercial real 
estate markets this year. Builders expect some growth in residential
and public construction by spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported continuing expansion, on 
balance, in February. About half said they were stepping up 
shipments and posting increases in orders while about a third said 
shipments and orders were running at a steady pace. Improvement was 
noted in all major industries in the region except textiles and 
transportation equipment. Firms in these industries noted some 
slippage in orders during February. Among all manufacturers 
employment and working hours were virtually steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District manufacturers generally forecast 
continued improvement. Nearly two-thirds of those contacted for this 
report expect further gains in shipments and orders over the next 
six months, and almost one-third expect order backlogs to rise. 
While most plan to maintain steady employment, one-fourth intend to 
step up hiring. About a third of the area firms polled indicated 
they will increase capital spending during the next six months while 
only a few said they might cut back.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District retailers contacted in late February said 
sales for the month were running at or above the year-ago pace. 
However, some said that snowstorms during the month had held down 
customer traffic and sales. Merchants remarked that February is a 
seasonally slow month, but several said they were encouraged by the 
fact that sales of spring merchandise were getting off to a healthy 
start.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the merchants interviewed expect sales to improve gradually 
through the first half of the year with modest gains, in real terms, 
for most merchandise lines. Some said they expect sales of home 
furnishings to pick up soon in the wake of the increase in home 
sales in the letter half of last year. Most store executives 
continued to describe the competitive situation as tight, with 
increasing competition in the region from discount chains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers gave mixed reports on lending activity, but 
overall, total loan volume appeared to be on a modest rise in late 
February. Some bankers noted a recent pickup in commercial and 
industrial loans booked while others described business lending as 
steady or down slightly. On balance, it appeared that commercial and 
industrial loan volume outstanding at major banks in the Third 
District was rising moderately as February neared a close. Most 
bankers said total consumer lending was about flat despite seasonal 
paydowns on credit card loans. Most also said that they were 
continuing to make net additions to residential mortgage loans 
outstanding but that applications were still easing. Although some 
noted that refinancing applications had picked up lately, they said 
the increase was not as great as was reported on the national level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, bankers generally expect commercial and industrial 
lending to follow an upward trend, and they expect consumer lending 
to move up as well. They do not expect real estate lending to remain 
as strong as it has been in the past several months even if mortgage 
rates fell a bit farther.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Realtors in the Third District described commercial markets as flat 
but said there was some strengthening in industrial markets. Demand 
for office space remains low, according to realtors, but they say 
the decline in property values and rental rates may be near an end, 
especially in view of the absence of current or planned construction 
activity in regional office markets. Demand for industrial space 
appeared to be picking up, and some realtors noted recent increases 
in leasing and acquisitions. Reports on residential markets were 
mixed. Realtors said the increase in homes sales in the latter half 
of last year appeared to be at a pause, although sales remained 
strong in some parts of the region. Realtors also noted that January 
and February are seasonally slow months and that the inventory of 
homes for sale is not increasing. Consequently, most are fairly 
optimistic that sales will resume an upward trend in the spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the construction industry generally expect activity to 
move up through the year. They look for gains primarily in 
residential and public construction. Some caution, however, that 
rising lumber prices are boosting construction costs, and resulting 
higher house prices may dampen sales, especially in the lower-priced 
range.
