      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6,  1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Important economic sectors of the southeastern economy strengthened 
in the first quarter. However, the adverse employment impact of 
declining oil prices on Louisiana's economy and that of other 
energy-producing parts of the region has masked current and expected 
improvements. With few exceptions, construction activity is strong, 
and the activity and outlook for tourism has improved. Consumer 
spending increased in March following a lull in the beginning months 
of the year. In agriculture, dry weather has slowed the progress of 
crops thus tar this growing season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's unemployment rate edged upward from January to 
February, and available state estimates hint at a further slight 
rise in March. Weakness in the energy sector has pushed Louisiana's 
oil-based economy to the highest unemployment rate in the nation 
with little prospect for improvement in the foreseeable future. 
Mississippi and Alabama also are suffering from the drop in 
petroleum prices, with a refinery In Mississippi temporarily closed 
in reaction to falling oil prices. Florida and Georgia continue to 
post unemployment rates significantly below that of the nation, 
while Tennessee's rate is about on a par with the nation's.
     </p>
     <p>
      More job losses are expected as a result or falling oil prices. The 
rig count for Louisiana has dropped to the lowest level since 1975, 
resulting in further layoffs by companies that service the dwindling 
number of offshore oil platforms. The offshore rig utilization rate 
has dropped to 40 percent from 79 percent in early December, with 
exploration at a standstill.
     </p>
     <p>
      More positively, some small towns in the region have been able to 
attract new industry and diversify their economies out of textiles 
by taking advantage of the labor pool of workers displaced by 
imports or automation. Furniture producers are starting to note 
moderate backlogs and some overtime work. They, along with lumber 
producers, are optimistic that falling interest rates will continue 
to stimulate their industry but are concerned by growing low-cost 
imports. Several leading furniture manufacturers are discontinuing 
production of certain items and are instead importing them for 
resale. The defense-related aerospace industry continues to bolster 
many local economies throughout the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's year-over-year retail sales growth in January-
February 1986 was slightly below that of the nation. March and early 
April retail sales were compared favorably to year-ago levels by 
merchants in all District states except Louisiana, where weak 
activity continues. Retailers attributed improving sales in March to 
Easter season apparel purchases. In March, Louisiana and Mississippi 
were the only states in the region that mirrored the nation's 
depressed sales of non-auto durable goods. Through mid-April, 1986 
car sales remained weak throughout the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the major exceptions of New Orleans and Jackson, construction 
and sales of single-family home are above last year's levels 
throughout the Southeast. Lower mortgage rates are stimulating sales 
to both first-time buyers and families upgrading their housing; 
favorable weather for building has reinforced the positive interest 
rate impact. however, apartment markets in many metropolitan areas 
are experiencing softening rents, and condominium prices continue to 
fall in south Florida. Southeastern industrial space construction is 
beginning to accelerate, while low interest rates are said to be 
triggering some "high risk" office, retail, and hotel construction. 
Office vacancy rates are high and rising in all major cities except 
Birmingham, with suburban rates generally higher than those in 
downtown areas. Available retail space and lodging vacancy rates 
also are rising as a result of rapid increases in supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan growth at large District banks continued its year-long 
slide in February and March. Real estate lending exhibits stronger 
growth than either consumer or business loans, but its growth rate 
also has been declining steadily. The Mississippi legislature has 
passed and sent a bill to the Governor that would allow interstate 
banking after a period for statewide expansions anti consolidations. 
In Louisiana, the remaining state in the region that prohibits 
interstate banking, enabling legislation is expected to be 
introduced in the current legislative session. After more than a 
year of active interstate banking in the District, merger and 
acquisition activity has enabled seven bank holding companies based 
in the region-up from five a year ago—to rank among the nation's 
40 largest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Figures for visitor registrations and national park attendance 
through February show strength across the District. Most states are 
experiencing double-digit growth over last year for both of these 
measures. Some of this increase in activity has been attributed to 
already lower gas prices, and there is widespread expectation that 
summer tourism will grow at an even faster clip. In Florida, 
attendance records were set at major attractions in March, and 
expectations for the remainder of the year are very high. Lower 
airfares have stimulated passenger traffic through most airports 
compared to a year ago, with double-digit growth experienced by most 
major airports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A prolonged period of dry weather has severely limited growth of 
forage for beef and dairy animals and has retarded the progress of 
spring-planted crops. Rainfall deficiencies also threaten water 
supplies that are likely to be needed for intensive irrigation 
during the summer. Prices received by farmers remain well below 
year-ago levels, with orange, vegetable, grain, and peanut crops 
showing especially large declines. At the same time, poultry 
producers are reaping favorable returns with market prices comparing 
favorably with year-ago levels, and feed costs have been declining.
