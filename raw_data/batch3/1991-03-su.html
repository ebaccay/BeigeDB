      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity remained soft in much of the nation but there were 
some indications that the decline may be slowing. The pattern of 
retail sales varied among districts with the majority reporting 
either sluggishness or results below planned levels. Retail 
inventories appear to be at satisfactory levels, except for some 
excess auto stocks. Manufacturing was sluggish in most of the 
country though several districts noted either a slight improvement 
or an easing of the downward trend. While construction activity 
continued weak, realtors and homebuilders reported an increase in 
buyer interest and, in some areas, purchases in recent weeks. The 
pickup was attributed to lower mortgage interest rates and more 
attractive home prices. Loan demand remained soft although mortgage 
refinancings have increased. Farm income prospects and mining output 
were mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of retail sales varied among districts with the majority 
reporting either sluggishness or results below planned levels. In 
several areas such as Atlanta, Cleveland and San Francisco, sales 
fell sharply after the Persian Gulf war began and then recovered to 
varying degrees. In some other areas such as Richmond and New York, 
sales remained slow. Some districts with generally sluggish sales 
noted pockets of strength. Thus, in Dallas and Atlanta discount 
stores exhibited strength as did specialty stores in Philadelphia. 
Most districts reported that auto sales declined though Dallas and 
Atlanta noted some recent improvement. With the exception of some 
excess auto stocks, retail inventories generally appear to be at 
satisfactory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in most districts were hopeful that sales would improve 
with the cessation of hostilities in the Gulf but most did not 
anticipate strong gains until the economy rebounds and consumer 
confidence returns.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity was sluggish in most of the nation though 
several districts noted either a slight improvement or an easing of 
the downward trend. Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia and 
St. Louis stated that strength in the export sector was offsetting a 
part of the weak domestic demand and Atlanta and San Francisco noted 
that some manufacturers' orders had increased as a result of the 
Gulf war. Of the six districts reporting on manufacturing 
inventories, four mentioned excess levels and the need for further 
trimming while in the remaining two, stocks were generally 
satisfactory. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis 
described a slowdown in motor vehicle production, and, related to 
this, Chicago and Cleveland noted a decline in steel production as 
well. Other industries in which activity slowed were textiles, 
furniture and construction-related products. On the other hand, 
Cleveland noted that capital goods output was holding up fairly 
well, though in Chicago the picture was mixed, and Atlanta and St. 
Louis noted strength among food processors. Dallas described the 
production of oil field equipment as growing strongly. With regard 
to the outlook, contacts in Boston and Philadelphia anticipate an 
improvement in three to six months and manufacturers in the Richmond 
district are optimistic about the future for the first time in 
several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While construction activity continued weak in most of the nation, 
eight districts noted that realtors and homebuilders have reported 
an increase in buyer interest and, in some areas, purchases in 
recent weeks. The pickup is attributed to lower mortgage interest 
rates and more attractive home prices. Despite the pickup, however, 
most districts report that homebuilding activity remains slow and 
participants are only cautiously optimistic that some improvement 
over last year's slow pace will occur. Nonresidential construction 
also remained weak and with vacancy rates continuing to rise on 
office and retail space, contacts in most districts do not 
anticipate a turnaround. However, Dallas noted that several large 
commercial projects have begun and that petrochemical plant 
construction is robust.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand continued soft in the nine districts reporting on 
financial developments although mortgage refinancing has increased 
with the decline in mortgage interest rates. Both consumer and 
business loan demand are weak and lenders do not anticipate a 
rebound until overall economic conditions improve. Consumers are 
reportedly reluctant to add new debt given the uncertainties about 
the employment situation, and firms are maintaining low inventories 
and reducing capital spending. However, St. Louis noted that some 
companies that normally obtain funding in the commercial paper 
market have been inquiring about bank financing. Meanwhile, lenders 
in some districts have tightened terms for borrowers particularly in 
the construction and real estate sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dallas reported that agricultural income prospects improved due to 
good cotton, rice and peanut harvests and continuing strong beef 
prices. Kansas City noted that weak grain prices limited the income 
of crop producers but that the income of livestock producers was 
bolstered by low feed prices and continued strength in cattle and 
hog prices. The Minnesota index of prices received by farmers fell 
for the ninth consecutive month to the lowest level since 1988. San 
Francisco noted that the fifth year of drought in California will 
result in reduced production of field crops and increased production 
costs. Moreover, higher feed prices and a lack of adequate grazing 
land will force cattle into feedlots early, thereby lowering 
livestock prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lower oil prices and uncertainty about the future have caused 
drilling activity in Kansas City to subside though the rig count is 
still about 3 percent above a year ago. Energy sector activity 
remained strong in Dallas where oil companies expect demand for 
their services to increase as Kuwait rebuilds its oil fields. Oil 
production in the Atlanta district was stable. San Francisco and St. 
Louis report that the wood products industry has weakened in 
response to slow overall economic activity. Mining industry 
conditions have been fairly good in Minneapolis with 1990 iron ore 
production up 5 percent, but coal production in St. Louis has 
declined.
