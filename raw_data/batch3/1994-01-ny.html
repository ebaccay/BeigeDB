      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 19, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District economic developments seemed somewhat more 
favorable in recent weeks. Most retail contacts reported December 
sales results that were above expectations. homebuilders in several 
areas noted an unanticipated pickup in traffic and contracts at 
year-end. and nonfarm employment figures showed some further 
improvement. Unfavorable developments included subdued office 
leasing activity in Manhattan in recent weeks and additional 
announcements of large, planned layoffs by District employers. In 
the banking sector, most senior loan officers at small and midsized 
banks indicated no change in their willingness to lend over the last 
two months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retail contacts reported December sales results that 
were above plan following generally lower-than-expected sales in 
November. After a rather unenthusiastic start to the holiday season, 
shoppers became more responsive towards the end of the period, and 
many retailers found the weeks just before and after Christmas to be 
the strongest of the season. The environment was very competitive, 
however, with additional promotions and extensive price-cutting, 
particularly on apparel. Several contacts remarked that shoppers 
were especially value-conscious this holiday season, holding back 
purchasing until items were discounted As a result, profit margins 
are expected to have suffered.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales changes ranged from -2 percent to +15 percent in 
November and from flat to + 12 percent in December. The annual 
survey of the Retail Council of New York State found that sales 
gains throughout the state averaged 6 to 8 percent above the 1992 
level for the post-Thanksgiving through the post-Christmas period. A 
wide variety of merchandise sold well during the months of November 
and December, with the best sellers including practical items such 
as home furnishings, electronics and cold weather clothing. Fashion 
apparel seems to have fared poorly for many retailers, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in several parts of the District reported an 
unanticipated pickup in traffic and contracts as 1993 drew to a 
close. Partly as a result of this, a majority of respondents now 
believe that 1993 housing starts in their area either equaled or 
were somewhat above the levels in 1992. Some builders attributed the 
year-end improvement to a fear, on the part of previously hesitant 
buyers, that a recent rise in mortgage rates might be the start of 
an uptrend. Others, however, said they were unable to account for 
the increased activity. Several contacts stated that high and rising 
lumber prices are a problem which could result in higher home prices 
in the months ahead. Nonetheless, most builders were optimistic that 
residential construction activity in 1994 would surpass the 1993 
level, but probably by only a modest amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity in Manhattan was somewhat subdued in recent 
weeks, particularly in the downtown area where the primary vacancy 
rate rose. Leasing activity showed a modest gain in midtown, 
however, and the vacancy rate moved somewhat lower. While vacancy 
rates remain high in both mid- and downtown Manhattan, they are down 
in both areas by close to a percentage point from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonfarm employment showed some improvement in the District as both 
New York and New Jersey sustained irregularly higher growth since 
August. However. unemployment rates continued to be volatile, with 
both states registering increases an December following decreases in 
November. New York's unemployment rate now stands at 7.6 percent and 
New Jerseys at 7. 1 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to the employment outlook, recent announcements have 
mainly been negative. Miller Brewing Company plans to close its 
Syracuse-area plant by October eliminating 700 jobs in addition to 
200 currently unfilled positions. The first 300 layoffs are 
scheduled for January. Two other District manufacturers, Xerox and 
Bristol-Myers, have also announced additional layoffs without any 
details regarding location. Xerox, whose largest manufacturing 
facility is in Rochester, intends to cut more than 10,000 jobs over 
the next three years, and Bristol-Myers, headquartered in New York 
City, plans a 5000 job reduction over the next two years. A positive 
note is that Bethlehem Steel is selling an idle, modernized mill in 
an arrangement that is expected to result in the recall of 250 
former workers in the Buffalo area.
     </p>
     <p>
      The November surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
showed little change in current conditions. A slightly smaller 
percentage of Buffalo managers reported increased production, while 
a slightly larger percentage of Rochester managers noted an 
improvement in business conditions. However, there was a large 
increase in the percentage of Rochester managers anticipating a 
deterioration of general business conditions over the next three 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District indicated that they were as willing to lend as 
they were two months earlier. While a few officers mentioned an 
increased willingness to lend, none reported easing standards, and a 
few reported tightening them. Lending rates were mixed with a slight 
upward bias. For the first time in over two years, more than one out 
of every four respondents reported raising rates. a larger 
proportion than respondents lowering rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pattern of overall loan demand was mixed. The demand for 
commercial and industrial loans remained sluggish, while the demand 
for nonresidential mortgages weakened further. In addition, 
residential mortgage demand declined considerably, due both to 
seasonal factors and to a significant slowdown in refinancing 
activity. However, the demand for consumer loans, continued to show 
some signs of improvement. The majority of respondents reported 
either stable or lower delinquency rates during the preceding two 
months.
