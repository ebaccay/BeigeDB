     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 22, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong growth is evident in the Ninth Federal Reserve District. 
Automobile sales are booming, general merchandise sales continue to 
increase, and summer tourism appears off to a strong start. Both 
commercial and residential construction remain strong. Manufacturing 
output apparently continues to grow. Iron ore shipments are up, and 
prospects for other metal mining have improved. Crops are in 
excellent condition across most of the district, while livestock 
numbers remain high. Employment levels continue about 2 percent to 3 
percent above year-earlier levels, while unemployment rates have 
dropped from one-half to one full percentage point in the same 
period. Despite this strong growth, there is little evidence of 
significant upward movement in wages or prices. Employers in certain 
areas continue to report problems in securing qualified new 
employees, some manufacturers report difficulty in obtaining steel, 
and price increases are reported for industrial metals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A North Dakota auto dealer's comment, "My inventory has never been 
so low," characterizes the strong pace of vehicle sales across the 
district. Dealers' association spokespersons echo this sentiment and 
note that some popular models are in very short supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      General merchandise sales continue to strengthen. "Traffic has been 
very good," reports a North Dakota mall manager. Another mall 
manager in North Dakota commented that sales of appliances and 
electronics seemed particularly strong but that virtually all stores 
in his facility had good business. Regional department store chains 
also report very good sales, and a Minneapolis Fed poll of district 
business leaders disclosed that nearly half expected consumer 
spending to be up in coming months. Only 4 percent expected it to 
drop.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 1994 tourist season is apparently off to a strong start. Visits 
at several South Dakota sites since January 1 were up as much as 19 
percent over year-earlier levels and tourism officials in that state 
predict an excellent season. Their counterparts in Minnesota and 
Montana express similar optimism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial construction continues strong in all 
states of the Ninth District. New housing permits in Minnesota for 
April were 13 percent above 1993 levels, which already reflected a 
fast-pace. Virtually all of the increase over 1993 was in 
multifamily construction. In the rest of the district, residential 
construction reportedly is active in most regional centers, 
including Sioux Falls and Rapid City, S.D.; Billings, Bozeman and 
Missoula, Mont.; Grand Forks and Fargo, N.D.; and La Crosse and Eau 
Claire, Wis.
     </p>
     <p>
      The strong pace of commercial and heavy construction set last year 
continues in the 1994 season. In Minnesota and the Dakotas, 
contracts through April were down about 1 percent from 1993's very 
active levels but still 22 percent above 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strength in this sector is indicated in April construction 
employment, which is up nearly 6 percent in Minnesota, 7 percent in 
South Dakota, 16 percent in North Dakota and 18 percent in Montana 
compared to year-earlier figures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District directors note growing business for manufacturers. One 
reported that a small plastic components producer was running three 
shifts seven days a week. Electricity sales to industry by one large 
Minnesota and South Dakota utility is growing at twice the five-year 
trend rate. Some of the increase is attributable to a major 
expansion at a petroleum refinery, but sales to machinery 
manufacturers increased at nearly three times the overall trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are some positive notes in natural resource industries. Copper 
prices have increased over 25 percent in recent weeks, allaying 
fears of possible mine closings. Strong demand from the steel 
industry has buttressed iron ore shipments from Lake Superior ports. 
And substantial new drilling for gas is under way in Montana. 
However, petroleum production continues to drop in North Dakota and 
Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In spite of localized problems with hail and topsoil dryness, 1994 
crops are reported good or excellent in virtually all farming areas. 
Moisture levels are adequate in most areas, and very little land in 
the Ninth District suffers any of the lasting damage from the 1993 
floods that is reported in downstream states. Development of all 
major crops was generally equal to or ahead of five-year avenges in 
all district states. Yields on the first cutting of hay in Minnesota 
and Wisconsin are reportedly down slightly from 1993 but quality is 
excellent.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the livestock sector both cattle and hog numbers remain high in 
comparison to historic levels. Hog slaughter levels are largely 
unchanged in spite of sharp price declines in recent weeks. Cattle 
slaughter is down slightly from year-earlier figures, but industry 
observers continue to expect hog and cattle numbers to grow modestly 
through the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Strength in the Ninth District economy is demonstrated in tightening 
labor markets. Employment shows increasing growth. April non-farm 
employment numbers across the district are 2 percent to 3 percent 
above year-earlier levels. Unemployment rates have dropped from 
April 1993 levels in all areas of the district. Drops range from 0.6 
percent in the Dakotas to 1.1 percent in Minnesota. Excepting 
Montana and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, unemployment levels 
throughout the Ninth District are about two points below the 
national average. Directors and other sources report that many firms 
have difficulty in attracting qualified new hires, but wage 
increases remain modest. One Minnesota computer manufacturer did 
announce a 200-worker reduction, largely through early retirements, 
and the reassignment of an additional 300 workers in a cost 
reduction move.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite indications of strong economic growth there is little 
evidence of generally increasing prices. However, raw materials are 
one area with some evidence of price pressures. Prices of steel, 
copper and aluminum have increased and several firms report delays 
in securing steel, particularly in specialty grades. Wood particle 
board for manufacturing remains difficult to procure. Lumber prices 
remain higher than a year ago. Petroleum fuels, however, continue 3 
to 10 cents per gallon below early 1993 levels.
