     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 2, 1988
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District economy continued to expand through the first half of 
July but apparently at a slower pace than earlier this summer. 
Retail sales were generally firm but auto sales were weaker. 
Manufacturers reported moderate growth in activity, although some 
softening was noted in the demand for textiles and furniture. 
Producers continued to report shortages of raw materials and upward 
pressure on prices. Export activity was strong and import activity 
was mixed at District ports. Depository institution executives 
reported generally firm loan demand and increases in deposits. They 
expect interest rates to be flat to rising in coming months. 
District farmers welcomed the recent rainfall which has provided 
some relief to many drought-stressed crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers responding to our regular mail survey reported 
higher sales in the first two weeks of July compared with the 
preceding two weeks. About half of the retailers reported increases 
in sales while 34 percent reported declines. Increased sales were 
reported at department stores and furniture stores while most car 
dealers reported a decrease.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among department stores, sales of big ticket items were unchanged 
according to about 50 percent of the respondents while one reported 
an increase. Half of the department stores said their inventories 
declined compared with one-third who said their inventories were 
unchanged. Nearly 80 percent of the department store respondents 
expect sales to increase in the next six months, while none expect 
sales to decline. In comparison, in our May survey, 36 percent 
expected sales to increase and 11 percent expected declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the exception of West Virginia, states in the District report 
that summer tourist and convention activity have been higher than a 
year ago. West Virginia's activity is reported to be unchanged from 
year-earlier levels. All states expect their tourist business to 
continue to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Coal
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity expanded in the first three weeks of July, 
according to our regular mall survey, although not as sharply as 
reported in our last survey. Thirty-eight percent of the respondents 
reported increased shipments, compared with 46 percent in the 
previous survey. Reports of reduced shipments increased to 23 
percent from 12 percent. New orders, backlogs of orders, employment, 
and the length of the workweek increased, although at a slower pace. 
About three-fifths of our respondents reported no change in 
inventories of finished goods and materials, and about one-fourth 
reported increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of inputs and finished goods continued to rise at about the 
same pace as reported in our previous survey. About one-third of the 
District manufacturers said they had raised the prices of their 
finished products, and two-thirds reported higher prices for raw 
materials. Almost half of our respondents reported difficulties in 
obtaining raw materials--especially steel and chemicals.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers expect their businesses to expand further in 
the next six months. About 40 percent of the respondents believe 
their shipments and new orders will rise, compared with about 15 
percent who anticipate declines. The majority of producers do not 
plan to change their inventory levels in the next six months. One-
third of the respondents, compared to about one-fourth in our 
previous survey, expect to increase capital expenditures in the next 
six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      District coal production for the first half of the year is up about 
two percent from the first half of last year. Industry analysts say 
the decline in the value of the dollar and increased steel 
production has increased demand for West Virginia coal. These 
analysts foresee little effect of a decline in oil prices on coal 
demand because only a small number of domestic coal-fired electric 
power generators can be converted to oil.
     </p>
     <p>
      In conversations with us, executives from several major Fifth 
District financial institutions indicated continued strength in 
their sector. Most institutions posted large increases in deposits 
in July. Generally institutions experienced modest increases in 
consumer and real estate loan activity through mid-July. The 
executives reported little change in loans for commercial 
construction, but the volume of these loans would have risen, they 
said, had their institutions not become more conservative in their 
lending policies. Bankers and thrift executives expect interest 
rates to hold steady or increase slightly over the next three to 
four months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District housing market remains strong according to a telephone 
survey of realtors and builders and according to reports from our 
directors. Most of our contacts are optimistic about market 
conditions for single-family homes in the coming months. However, 
one realtor said the current surge in sales may reflect buyer 
anticipation of higher mortgage rates in coming months, which could 
leave the market depressed this fall. On a down note, market 
activity in multi-family units is almost nonexistent according to 
our survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ports
Representatives from the three major District portsâ€”Hampton Roads 
(Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimoreâ€”noted general increases in 
export shipments for June over May. The import picture was mixed, 
however, with shipments reported to be lower at Hampton Roads, 
higher at Baltimore and unchanged at Charleston. All ports expect 
strong export activity to continue during the next six months. 
Compared to a year ago, export activity was outpacing that of 
imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rainfall across District states has brought some relief to 
crops, but more rain is needed, especially in the western portions 
of the states. Analysts believe the drought has reduced District 
corn yields, but expect most other crops to show only minimal damage 
if rainfall is normal for the rest of the growing season. The South 
Carolina peach crop, for example, is said to be one of the best on 
record. Hay conditions are poor, but as yet, District livestock 
liquidations do not appear to be above normal. Agricultural banks 
responding to our quarterly survey indicate that, as of June 30, 
demand for farm loans in the District were at normal levels and farm 
loan repayment rates were above average.
