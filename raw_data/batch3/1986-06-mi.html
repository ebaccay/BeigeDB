     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 24, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ninth District conditions appear to have improved somewhat during 
the second quarter. Some employment indicators moved favorably in 
April. Some components of consumer spending may have softened a bit 
during May, but big-ticket durables remained strong. Some hard-
pressed non-metro areas are being helped by increased tourist 
spending. Resource-related industry performance remained mixed: 
extractive sectors suffered while wood products sectors prospered. 
And while both crop and export conditions improved in the 
agriculture sector, little else did.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market indicators picked up a bit in April. The district's 
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent in April, 
from 6.6 percent in March. The Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan 
area experienced a larger-than-seasonal decline in its unemployment 
rate, too. Unadjusted figures from state employment services show 
large, albeit partially seasonal, employment gains and unemployment 
rate declines in all district states. Only the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan exhibited little improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some good news is finally evident in the manufacturing sector. Both 
of the Dakotas logged small increases in manufacturing employment 
during April. And while one computer company announced another 
layoff in Minnesota, it was more than compensated for by a callback 
issued by another computer firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales of general merchandise may have softened a bit between 
April and May, according to two large district retailers. Still, one 
of them recorded a 9 percent year-over-year increase this May and 
notes that the falling dollar is helping to stimulate substitution 
of American-made goods for Japanese goods. A spate of home sales has 
stimulated heavy purchasing of home items. A chain of department 
stores reports that Father's Day sales of menswear were good. 
Another chain reports that neither its inventories nor its credit 
sales are excessive. Bank directors again note the slack retail 
conditions in small cities and towns, particularly in western 
agricultural and energy-producing regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales appear to have improved in May. One large domestic 
manufacturer has had particular success selling trucks in this 
district. Its truck sales were 13 percent higher this May than last. 
Currently, neither its truck nor its car inventories are excessive, 
and the firm is optimistic about third quarter sales. As in the case 
of retail sales, Bank directors note slack auto sales in some non-
metro areas, including Miles City, Montana, and parts of western 
Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of North Dakota and Montana, housing activity appears to 
have stayed fairly strong. In both Minneapolis and St. Paul, home 
sales during April and May were way above their levels a year 
earlier. Low interest rates, economic growth, and good weather have 
all helped there. Realtors in South Dakota also have found much 
buyer interest, particularly in the eastern half of the state and 
its Sioux Falls metro area. New homebuilding is down from last year 
in Fargo, North Dakota. Residential construction in the oil and gas 
producing western part of the state has declined substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many non-metro areas in this district are hoping that more summer 
tourism will help stimulate their economies. Early reports indicate 
that this is happening. A branch Bank director from Montana says 
that reservations at Yellowstone Park are already up 20 percent from 
last year. Campgrounds overflowed during the fishing opener in the 
Indianhead region of northwestern Wisconsin, where inquiries about 
summer travel are running far ahead of last year's pace. In 
anticipation of a good season, there has been a lot of resort 
expansion in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where inquiries are 
also up from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Performance in large resource-related sectors has continued to be 
mixed. Wood productsâ€”including pulp, paper, and lumber are all 
fairly strong. The new paper mill at Quinnesec, in Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula, is very busy. The high level of building activity 
nationwide has created demand for lumber and other building 
products, such as waferboard. A director does report timber industry 
concerns about a Forest Service plan to restrict the allowable 
harvest in northwestern Montana, though. Falling energy prices have 
greatly reduced prospects for oil and gas exploration in Montana and 
western North Dakota. A Bank director notes that only 9 rigs are 
operating in Montana now, whereas 23 were operating last yearâ€”and 
that was way below the peak number. Coal prices and production are 
not being helped by low oil prices. One bright mining spot is noted, 
though: A platinum mine is opening in Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent news in the agricultural sector has been mixed. The Minnesota 
farm price index rose 3 percent between April and May, yet was still 
6 percent below its level a year earlier. The fall of both farm 
prices and the U.S. dollar should help stimulate export sales; 
soybean exports are already up over last year. Exports are 
particularly important to Minnesota and North Dakota, which ranked 
seventh and eighth, respectively, among farm exporting states last 
year. Good weather has allowed timely planting and development of 
District crops. Ground moisture levels in Montana were the best in 
five years. Overall field conditions are noted as above average in 
both Montana and North Dakota. The much-publicized dairy herd buyout 
program has yet to cut milk production much. Cattle producers are 
reported to be displeased with the buyout's attendant herd 
slaughter, which is believed to have put downward pressure or 
already low cattle prices. Previously declining dairy land values 
are said to be likely to have bottomed out.
