     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy is expanding slowly. Growth rates in the 
strongest sectors have been slowing somewhat, while some of the 
weaker sectors are strengthening. The overall pace of expansion 
appears to have changed very little. Manufacturing growth continues, 
but at a milder rate than late last year. Retail sales are 
accelerating, while auto sales are climbing at a steadier and more 
modest pace. After a protracted period of decline, construction 
activity has lately remained level. Oil and gas drilling activity is 
unchanged at low levels, in the wake of a falloff that commenced 
last year. Recent increases in beef prices have raised profits in 
the District's important cattle industry, but low soil moisture is 
an ongoing concern for both farmers and ranchers in much of the 
region.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturing continues to expand overall, but growth in 
orders appears to have slowed recently. Several firms said they had 
managed to keep growing by seeking out new geographic markets. The 
only serious weaknesses in manufacturing have been in energy 
extraction-related and construction-related manufacturing. Oilfield 
equipment sales have declined absolutely in recent months. Orders to 
construction-related manufacturers - including lumber and wood and 
stone, clay and glass producers - are weak in most of the District, 
but some Houston-area producers cite growth. Reports by electronics 
manufacturers vary a good deal, but sales have generally expanded 
somewhat in 1989, following a sluggish fourth quarter. Personal 
computer orders are said to be expanding strongly. Primary and 
fabricated metals industries continue to show some expansion, but 
last year's rapid growth in fabricated metals appears to have 
slowed. Demand for paper is still strong compared to year earlier, 
but some recent slippage in export markets has been cited. In the 
chemical industry, sales remain well above a year ago, but rates of 
increase have slowed. A number of chemical plant expansions are 
underway but, currently, capacity constraints remain a problem for 
some producers. Apparel industry orders are said to have increased 
markedly in 1989, and producers say they have been automating in 
order to compete against foreign firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales growth varies considerably among regions but, on 
average, it is accelerating. Sales in Austin, Houston, Dallas/Ft. 
Worth, San Antonio, and on the Mexican border are all expanding at 
an increased rate, after adjustment for seasonality. Sales in west 
Texas, however, are weak and show little evidence of growth. Much of 
the overall acceleration is in apparel sales. Retailers are 
optimistic about prospects for further growth in revenues in 1989. A 
number of respondents have lately expressed concern about proposed 
changes in rules covering workers' compensation, minimum wage, and 
employee benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      District auto sales have lately been mixed, but modest overall, with 
strong year-over-year January gains in Houston offsetting declines 
in Dallas/Ft. Worth. Cold February weather was said to have led to 
more widespread sales weakness in that month.
     </p>
     <p>
      District construction contracting activity is weak, but it has 
lately remained essentially level. In 1988, a midyear surge 
subsequently reversed course, and dollar values of contract issuance 
remain below a year earlier. Construction employment is still 
slipping, in response to past reductions in contracting. Recent 
declines in nonresidential building and nonbuilding construction 
have been largely offset by growth in residential activity, which is 
now above year-earlier levels. The upturn in residential building is 
chiefly due to single-family home construction. Multifamily 
residential construction has changed little and remains at very low 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      After a protracted period of decline, District oil and gas drilling 
activity has begun to level off. The rotary rig count remains near 
its lowest level of the decade, but the large monthly declines that 
characterized the second half of 1988 have at least temporarily 
ceased. The leading indicators of drilling, including well permits 
issued and the seismic crew count, also appear to be stabilizing. 
According to some respondents, the recent leveling off of drilling 
activity is a result of persistent relative strength in oil prices. 
This strength has caused drillers to revise expectations about 
future oil prices. West Texas Intermediate oil prices have remained 
above $16 per barrel for each of the last three months, after 
averaging under $16 in every month from July through November. A 
seasonal decline of about $1 per barrel is expected this summer, but 
It is not anticipated to change drilling activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite recent rains in some areas, the chief current concern in 
District agriculture is continued low soil moisture. Although 
dryness is still said to be a problem in South Texas, February rains 
improved soil conditions there. In the Texas panhandle, however, 
drought conditions have been worsening and the winter wheat crop has 
already been damaged as a result of scarce rainfall. On average, 
both crop and livestock prices received by Texas farmers remain well 
above a year earlier, and prices of both crops and livestock rose in 
January over December's levels. The overall increase was 1.9 
percent, compared to a 1.5 percent increase for the nation.
