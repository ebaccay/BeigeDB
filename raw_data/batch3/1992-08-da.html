      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District economic activity is increasing slowly. Most beige book 
contacts remain cautiously optimistic that growth will continue, 
although many respondents express uncertainty surrounding the 
presidential election and its impact on economic conditions. 
Overall, respondents indicate very little upward pressure on prices. 
Manufacturing activity continues to increase slowly. Service sector 
activity is weak but growing. Retail sales have increased 
moderately, and auto sales are rebounding strongly. Construction and 
real estate markets are slow with the exception of residential home 
construction which has picked up again. The oil and gas industry 
continues to contract. Financial institutions report stable loan 
demand, but many respondents are disappointed with the level of loan
demand from quality borrowers. Some service sector, retail and auto 
respondents note an increase in cash purchases. Agricultural 
producers report good crop development although most commodity 
prices have declined slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity continues to increase slowly. Apparel 
production has risen with particularly heavy demand for denim 
products. Demand for electrical and electronic machinery is up 
slightly, helping to reduce inventories which remain too large. 
Fabricated metal producers report increasing sales, with demand 
strongest from the petroleum and petrochemical market. Prices are 
rising because of increases in the price of raw steel. Demand and 
prices for primary metal are unchanged overall, although demand 
remains weak for products related to oil exploration. Chemical 
producers report a slight decline in the demand for industrial 
chemicals but demand remains strong for pharmaceutical chemicals and 
chemicals containing freon. Environmental restrictions have 
increased chemical production costs, and some producers have moved 
production outside the U.S. to avoid these regulations. Demand for 
paper products is unchanged. Stiff competition has held prices 
stable despite rising pulp prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for lumber has risen 
  slightly, mostly for producers who sell within the District. Demand 
  is strongest for residential home construction and remodeling. 
  Lumber prices have declined, however. Stone, clay and glass 
  production has increased. Demand is strongest from single-family 
  homebuilding and highway construction. Inventories of concrete rock 
  are low and selling prices have increased. Domestic demand for oil 
  field equipment has been weaker than expected because of the weak 
  natural gas market. Producers are optimistic about future strength 
  in the domestic market, however. International demand for oil field 
  equipment has declined and producers are expecting continued 
  weakness. Petroleum refining producers report weaker than expected 
  demand. Prices have increased but costs are rising faster. Demand 
  for food and kindred products is generally stable. Several food 
  wholesalers report strong vegetable sales. Okra and peanuts, 
  however, face strong global competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Service sector activity is increasing very slowly. Accounting, 
legal, advertising, consulting and temporary service respondents 
report slight increases in sales. Contacts are optimistic but not 
enthusiastic about future activity. Overall, prices are generally 
stable. Several respondents note that most transactions are 
occurring without the use of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales are increasing moderately. Respondents say that they 
are becoming more confident that sales will continue to increase, 
although at a slower than desired pace. Retailers report little or 
no price increases, and are continuing to reduce costs. Auto sales 
are rebounding strongly. Dealers note an increase in cash purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate markets are slow with the exception of 
residential home construction. Residential construction picked up in 
June and July after a brief slowdown in May. Inventories are tight, 
and selling prices have increased in high demand areas. One 
respondent noted that homebuilding is not doing as well as might be 
expected given such low interest rates. Existing homes sales have 
fallen. Multi-family rental demand remains steady but below 
expectations. Office rental demand is steady at low levels. Office 
sales have picked up, but prices are 50 percent of construction 
costs. The industrial market is unchanged with moderate demand at 
low prices. Nonbuilding construction has increased recently because 
of increased highway construction which is expected to continue 
rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crude oil prices have been averaging between $21 and $22 per barrel, 
depending upon the latest news from Iraq. The rig count has improved 
somewhat from an all-time-low in June. The all and gas industry 
continues to contract, however. A survey of oil companies shows that 
they are cutting domestic exploration spending. A very cold spring 
and a heat wave in the South have kept natural gas prices moving 
upward. January futures prices have climbed to above $2.00 per 
million Btu, about a 69 percent increase from the January 1992 
average spot wellhead price.
     </p>
     <p>
      District financial institutions report stable loan demand. Many 
respondents, however, are disappointed with the level of loan demand 
from quality borrowers. The residential real estate market, however, 
has been supporting good loan demand from new loans and 
refinancings. Liquidity remains plentiful. Loan demand is expected 
to remain flat over the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      District agricultural conditions have improved. Producers report 
good crop development, with particularly good peach, orange and 
vegetable production. Most commodity prices continue to decline. 
Livestock prices have remained stable for the past month but are 
well below last year's prices. Severe weather conditions earlier in 
the year have delayed production and raised costs in some areas.
