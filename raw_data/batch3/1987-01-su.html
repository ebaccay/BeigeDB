      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity appears to have quickened slightly at 
year-end, according to this month's commentaries on regional 
economic conditions. Retailers in most Districts enjoyed moderate 
year-over-year sales increases, in line with expectations. Auto 
sales were very strong in December, although the loss of the sales 
tax deduction in 1987 is widely regarded as the reason for this 
strength. Manufacturing employment increased in several Districts. 
The improvement was spotty, however, with an industry expanding in 
one District but not in another. Residential construction activity 
remains strong in some Districts, but has slowed in others. The rate 
of nonresidential construction also varies considerably from one 
part of the country to another. Oil and gas drilling is gradually 
increasing from very depressed levels. The agricultural situation is 
improving. While agricultural prices remain weak, higher production 
levels and lower prices for petroleum-based inputs are positive 
factors. Banks in most Districts experienced very strong commercial 
and real estate loan demand in December. Some of this strength is 
attributed to efforts to complete transactions before the new tax 
laws are in effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Christmas sales in most Districts were described as moderately ahead 
of year-ago levels and consistent with retailers' expectations. The 
most notable exceptions were the Boston and New York Districts, 
where retail respondents reported strong sales increases ranging 
from 5 to 25 percent over year-ago levels, and the Dallas District, 
where sales were said to be below year-ago levels although still 
consistent with expectations. Sales were generally slow in the early 
part of December but strengthened as Christmas drew closer. January 
sales were reported as healthy in the Philadelphia District and weak 
in Richmond.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories at the end of the Christmas season were said to 
be at comfortable levels and, in two or three Districts, lower 
relative to sales than in past years. For the most part, changes in 
exchange rates have not had much effect on retail prices, although 
merchants in several Districts expect rising import prices to show 
up more in 1987. Retailers are generally optimistic about future 
sales, but there is some concern that the first quarter will be soft 
as consumers start paying for the cars and other large items 
purchased late in 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of motor vehicle sales were all the same. Sales were very 
strong in December; dealers are generally satisfied with current 
inventory levels; sales are expected to be slow for at least the 
first several months of 1987. Most reports attribute the strength in 
December and the weakness projected for early 1987 to consumers' 
shifting purchases from 1987 to 1986 in order to take advantage of 
the deductibility of the sales tax. In this regard, San Francisco 
notes that in Oregon, where there is no sales tax, sales did not 
pick up appreciably.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of residential construction were mixed across the Districts. 
Activity has been particularly strong in the New York, Chicago and 
St. Louis Districts. Mild weather was said to have contributed to 
the strength in New York. Where home building has slowed, 
overbuilding, overpricing and a shortage of suitable land were cited 
as the primary causes. In the San Francisco District, multifamily 
construction has slowed but single-family building is doing well; 
the new tax laws are thought to have made multifamily units less 
attractive for investment purposes, whereas they are expected to 
have little effect on the single-family unit. Home sales are strong, 
according to most reports, and are expected to remain so into 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction levels vary from busy in Minneapolis and 
Chicago to slow in San Francisco. About half the Districts mentioned 
that some office markets face an oversupply of space; absorption 
rates are said to be strong in many areas, however. Similarly, in 
areas with newly constructed retail space, occupancy rates are 
improving. Construction for retail buildings has continued at a 
healthy rate in Atlanta, in part because of net in-migration. 
Substantial growth in nonresidential construction was reported in 
parts of the Chicago and St. Louis Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity appears to have picked up slightly in the 
last months of 1986. Several Districts reported modest increases in 
employment, and in the Dallas District, where manufacturing activity 
had been declining, "Manufacturers are noting more positive signs 
than at any time in the last two years." The industries cited as 
responsible for this improvement varied from District to District: 
in the Dallas District orders are bottoming out for energy-related 
durable goods; San Francisco reported that commercial aerospace is 
gaining strength; employment increases occurred in glass and general 
industrial machinery in the Cleveland District, in textiles and 
electrical equipment in St. Louis and in printing and publishing and 
textiles in Atlanta. Several Districts mentioned increasing defense 
activity. For many industries, however, there appears to have been 
no improvement. San Francisco noted that the electronic, and 
semiconductor industries continue to suffer from fierce competition 
and low prices. Boston and Chicago both reported that reduced 
capital spending by domestic auto manufacturers is hurting the 
machinery and metalworking industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers in different Districts vary considerably in their 
views of the future. Those in the Philadelphia and Richmond 
Districts think that business will improve over the next six months, 
those in Boston foresee little change, and those in Cleveland expect 
the first quarter of 1987 to be very poor and are uncertain whether 
the national expansion will continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of oil and gas drilling rigs in operation increased in 
December in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, but remains far 
below the number a year ago. Drilling in Atlanta was at its highest 
level since last spring. Coal production increased over the year in 
the Richmond District but decreased in Atlanta. Gold mining in the 
Minneapolis District is reported to be doing fairly well and the San 
Francisco District's copper industry is hiring after an extended 
period of layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The situation in agriculture shows some signs of improvement. 
Agricultural prices remain generally weak, but low grain prices have 
helped livestock producers, especially those raising poultry. Lower 
prices for petroleum-based inputs such as fuel and fertilizer are 
also a positive factor. Prices rose slightly in December for wheat, 
corn and soybeans in the Minneapolis District and farm crops in 
Texas, but most prices remain below year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm incomes are not as weak as farm prices in all cases, since 
production levels are higher. Good weather contributed to a 
bountiful vegetable and citrus harvest in Florida, more calves were 
held over the winter in the Kansas City District, and crop 
production in the Richmond District should be higher than this 
year's drought-reduced levels. On the down side, a significant 
decline in Texas cotton production projected for 1986 means lower 
incomes in already distressed areas of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most Districts, commercial and real estate lending increased 
strongly in December, although in the Dallas District business loans 
were far below year-ago levels. Banks in the New York, Philadelphia 
and San Francisco Districts attributed some of December's strength 
to tax changes and the desire to complete transactions before year-
end. In the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts consumer loan growth 
has slowed and in San Francisco construction loans dropped off 
sharply in the last months of the year. Home equity lending is 
increasing, according to several reports.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the St. Louis District agricultural lending by banks continues to 
decline as a result of reductions in the costs of inputs and land, 
on the one hand, and more rigorous scrutiny by lenders, on the 
other. In the Kansas City District loan paydowns are reported to 
have improved over last year.
