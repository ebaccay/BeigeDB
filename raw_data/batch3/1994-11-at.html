      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The southeast's economic expansion held steady in early fall, 
according to business contacts. Retailers reported mixed results, 
but with strength in men's and women's apparel. Holiday sales are 
generally expected to be strong, although merchants generally expect 
pressures to grow on prices. Business travel and tourism remain 
robust in most of the region, and positive reports of advance winter 
bookings in south Florida may signal improvement there. While 
factory activity may have slowed a little since the previous report, 
contacts have become more optimistic about the near-term outlook. 
Home sales and building have slowed somewhat in most of be region, 
while rising rental rates and occupancies have boosted the 
multifamily market, and commercial real estate markets are reported 
to be tightening somewhat. Overall loan demand is said to be 
increasing modestly. Contacts report labor market tightness in a few 
parts of the region, and wages generally remain stable. Reports of 
pressures on prices of inputs continue to mount.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from retailers were mixed, with some contacts noting double-
digit growth and others saying that unseasonably warm weather slowed 
sales in the last half of September. Back-to-school sales were 
characterized as fair, with denim items continuing to be strong 
sellers. Generally, women's apparel sales are said to be improving 
while those for men's wear maintain a strong pace. Retailers note 
that traditional apparel lines are selling better than faddish ones. 
Merchants generally anticipate a strong holiday selling season. 
Currently, prices are remaining stable, but pressures are reported 
to be growing, and many retailers expect vendors to raise prices in 
the near future. Auto dealers report that sales are brisk, although
many dealers continue to complain about inventory shortages of 
popular models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's manufacturing sector continued to expand, although 
most contacts said the pace of activity had slowed a bit from a 
month before. Although several reported higher inventories of 
finished goods, most factory contacts were more optimistic about 
future prospects than before. Firms producing paper, pulp, 
chemicals, forest products, textiles, and aluminum products are 
currently increasing production at their plants. Shipbuilding and 
repair facilities report strengthening activity. Producers of heavy-
duty trucks are running at capacity levels. Other sectors, however, 
are not so vibrant. The region's important apparel manufacturing 
sector continues to shrink with new layoff announcements, which 
producers attribute to foreign competition, corporate efficiency 
measures, and soft demand for certain products. Uncertainties 
surrounding the ongoing downsizing of defense manufacturers and 
cutbacks in the space industry are continuing to adversely affect 
central Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There are reports of signs of a turnaround along Florida's southeast 
coast. Advance winter bookings at major resorts are said to be up, 
and interest from Canadian and Latin American tourists has been 
increasing. Tourist, convention, and business travel is well above 
1993 levels, according to reports from the rest of the region, and 
is providing an especially strong boost to the economies of New 
Orleans and Atlanta.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      September home sales have moved below last year's strong level, 
according to District realtors. The fall-off in sales is attributed 
to rising mortgage rates which have squeezed some buyers out of the 
market and prompted others to wait and see. Even though home prices 
appear to have stabilized in most areas of the District, most 
realtors report that the market continues to be tight. Residential 
construction has slowed in much of the District with the exception 
of flood damaged areas that are experiencing a surge in 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report 
improving market conditions. Both occupancy and rental rates 
continue to rise within the multifamily market. New apartment 
developments are currently under construction in several cities 
whose markets are said to be tight enough to easily absorb the new 
space. Commercial realtors continue to report falling vacancy rates 
and rising rental rates. Increasing demand for space in some areas 
is said to be bringing about some speculative building.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks noted flattening commercial loan demand, especially from 
larger companies, but healthy demand from small and medium-size 
companies. Commercial real estate lending was also strong and some 
felt there was too much money chasing deals in that area. Consumer 
loan demand was described as either flat or up modestly by most 
contacts. Auto lending is mixed, with some banks reporting demand as 
flat, and others noting a modest uptick. Home mortgage lending 
continues to slow in most areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in some local area labor markets say that they are 
tightening, making it difficult for firms in the retail, service, 
and light industrial sectors to attract and retain employees. 
Reports of rising wages are becoming more numerous but are still 
limited to only a few parts of the region. The number of reports of 
price pressures continues to mount. A growing number of factory 
contacts expect finished goods prices to increase in the coming 
months. Price increases for lumber, paper, and other raw materials 
were reported.
