      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 19, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      As 1993 ended, most economic sectors in the Ninth Federal Reserve 
District showed signs of growth. Commercial and residential 
construction is very active in virtually all areas of the district. 
Manufacturing, particularly in small and midsize firms, continues to 
grow. Refinery production is up, demand for construction-related 
forest products remains high and prospects for iron mining are 
positive. Conditions are unchanged in agriculture, which ended 1993 
with much lower grain stocks than a year earlier and essentially 
stable livestock output. Consumer spending through the holiday 
season continued improving at the pace set earlier in the fall. 
After a slow start, winter recreation enterprises report good 
business. Unemployment rates remain substantially below those of the 
United States as a whole and employment is up from year-earlier 
levels. There is little evidence of upward pressure on wages or 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      One city building inspector in Minnesota characterized 1993 as "a 
year that is nothing short of phenomenal." Construction was the 
strongest sector of the economy across the Ninth District throughout 
1993, with no apparent slackening as the year ended. News media, 
district directors and other sources reported continued strong 
residential construction across the district and active commercial 
building in many areas. Residential construction is booming in 
western Montana, Sioux Falls, S.D., and Rapid City, S.D. 1993 was 
also a record year for construction in Fargo, N. D., and Moorhead, 
Minn. Construction of new retail facilities continued in the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan. Publicly bid commercial and heavy 
construction in Minnesota and the Dakotas for the year through 
November was 12 percent ahead of year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing continues to grow. "Many firms reported strong third-quarter growth and the fourth quarter was even better," said one 
director, speaking of manufacturers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
area. He also noted that most manufacturing firms were now running 
at 85 percent of capacity, up substantially from a year ago and that 
small and medium firms had the most growth in orders. Moreover, a 
director from South Dakota reported an increase in the establishment 
of small and midsize manufacturing facilities in that state. Growth 
in industrial electricity use continues above the five-year trend 
rate in Minnesota and South Dakota. Manufacturers of builders 
hardware, residential heating equipment controls and other 
construction-related products report excellent sales. Responding to 
continuing high demand for building materials, a Canadian firm 
reportedly plans to establish a building-board plant in North Dakota 
that will use wheat straw and other crop residues as raw material.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Natural resource industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Refinery output in December was up from year-earlier levels, largely 
due to 1993 capacity expansions in Minnesota and Montana. Crude 
petroleum production was marginally below year-earlier levels, 
reflecting aging of producing wells, and drilling activity was 
essentially unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Production of oriented-strand board and other wood-based plywood and 
lumber substitutes is very strong in Minnesota, Wisconsin and 
Michigan. But the forest products industry's outlook continues to 
vary by product and location. A recent timber sale in Montana set a 
record for stumpage prices in that state, reflecting generally 
declining quantities of timber offered for sale. The paper industry 
continues to experience overcapacity and low prices, but output is 
essentially stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Mine operators are generally optimistic about 1994 and expect 
output to exceed levels of the previous three years," said one iron 
ore industry spokesperson. This is in spite of a slight output 
decline in 1993 relative to 1992, largely related to a strike-
related closing of one mine. Other mining is essentially stable. 
Copper and gold output is unchanged from earlier in the year. Copper 
prices have recovered slightly from lows set earlier in the year, 
allaying fears of possible mine closings.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agriculture showed little change in the final weeks of 1993. Grain 
prices were generally high, reflecting low stocks due to adverse 
growing conditions earlier in the year. Fall tillage in corn and 
soybean growing areas was completed at near normal levels prior to 
freeze-up, in spite of wet conditions earlier in the year. In 
northwestern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota, though, these 
tillage operations lagged considerably, which may retard spring 1994 
planting operations. Cattle, hog and sheep slaughter numbers are 
essentially the same as a year ago, while prices continue to trend 
slightly downward. While prices for feeder cattle have declined 
somewhat from earlier in 1993, they remain high relative to other 
recent years, apparently reflecting confidence in farmer and feeder 
expectations of continued profitability.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer spending and tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from a broad range of sources including directors, advisory 
council members, news media, mall managers, vehicle dealers 
associations and company representatives reaffirmed earlier reports 
that consumer confidence has rebounded from earlier in 1993 and that 
consumer spending is growing. In late 1993, passenger vehicle sales 
were strong across the district and several sources noted that 
pickups and sport utility vehicle sales were particularly strong. 
Retail reports on holiday season sales of general merchandise are 
largely positive. The manager at a large Minneapolis-area mall 
reported very strong sales as did counterparts in Sioux Falls, S. 
D., and in Grand Forks and Fargo, N. D. And a director from Montana 
reported that holiday season sales in that state were very good and 
generally well above 1992 levels. But a few firms reported a 
disappointing holiday season; one major retailer had December 
department store sales that were essentially flat from a year 
earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the closing weeks of 1993 the winter tourism and recreation 
season picked up momentum, particularly in Montana. Lack of snow in 
several ski areas had retarded activity in November and early 
December, but snowfalls just before Christmas improved business 
considerably. Ski resorts in Montana report strong holiday seasons 
that helped recovery from the slow start, although decreased traffic 
from Canada continues to hamper resorts near the border. One source 
reported that snowmobile rental companies at Bozeman, Mont., and 
near Yellowstone National Park were booked through March. 
Snowmobilers and skiers were traveling to the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan and northern Wisconsin at slightly higher than year-earlier 
rates at the end of December and in early January. Tourist traffic 
to the Black Hills was steady in South Dakota.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment. prices and wages
       </strong>
       <br/>
       With unemployment rates below 4.5 percent in Minnesota and the 
Dakotas,  Ninth District labor markets continue substantially better 
than the national average. These three states contain over 80 
percent of the Ninth District labor force. In November, employment 
numbers in all district states stood 1 percent to 3 percent above 
year-earlier levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors, industry sources and news media report virtually no 
upward price movements except for those grains where 1993 production 
was curtailed by flooding. In the last weeks of 1993, retail 
gasoline prices stood 5 to 7 cents below 1992 levels in Minneapolis-
St. Paul and even sharper drops were reported in some other areas. 
District and branch directors report very limited wage increases for 
both private and public sector workers, in some cases limited to 
maintenance of health insurance coverage in the face of premium 
increases.
