      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of economic activity in the District remain more subdued 
than last year. Growth of employment in District states since late 
1988 has trailed the nation. Manufacturing employment declined from 
early 1989 levels, but rose in August. Reports from contacts with 
manufacturers generally show slower gains in business volume or 
declines, in some cases from high levels. Farm equipment sales, in 
contrast, are registering large gains. Many large industrial 
investment projects reportedly remain on the agenda. But slower 
growth in various industries raises concern that increases may 
continue to taper off, leading to downturns in these industries and 
at suppliers. Construction activity continues relatively strong in 
the region. General merchandise sales are rising, albeit slowly, and 
credit delinquencies do not signal deterioration, overall, in 
ability to pay. The District's fall harvest, aided by ideal weather 
conditions, is generating "better than expected" crop yields.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The trend for most manufacturers contacted was toward slower growth 
in orders and sales, with some noting declines. A producer of 
electrical controls and power supplies sold to machinery markets has 
seen a small further rise in orders this year following strong 
increases last year. Orders for electrical equipment from metals 
producers have been slightly lower following very large orders last 
year. Electrical equipment prices were little changed. A 
manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types, 
including defense equipment, petroleum equipment, food packaging 
machinery, and material handling equipment. A diversified producer 
of consumer products and of supplies widely used in industry 
reported a further tapering off of growth in its sales. A slowdown 
in communications equipment demand appears to have bottomed. 
Shipments of corrugated containers are estimated to have continued 
to expand slowly through September; investments, mostly incremental 
enhancements of existing facilities, are bringing capacity on-line 
more rapidly than growth of sales, exerting downward pressures on 
prices. Sales of large farm tractors and combines continue well 
above year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shipments of steel were expected to be below a year earlier in the 
second half, after being higher in the first half of 1989. 
Industrial procurement of steel has peaked, as a large number of 
large projects moved off of drawing boards to the procurement stage 
in 1988 and early 1989. There are now fewer big projects being 
started, but numerous smaller ones. This has resulted in a peaking 
and subsequent easing of pressures on available capacity, but many 
projects remain underway, and this backlog will tend to support 
activity in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for steel also reflects an expectation that automakers 
will produce close to announced schedules for the rest of this year. 
Contacts in the auto industry were optimistic about maintaining 
reduced assembly schedules. These production cuts are being 
reflected at parts plants in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity is holding up well in much of the District. 
Shipments of Portland cement to the Midwest have been relatively 
strong, with metropolitan areas where building picked up earlier, 
such as Chicago, remaining at high levels but not growing as before, 
while less heavily populated areas have been catching up. Michigan, 
however, is slowing. Shipments of gypsum board to District states 
have registered larger gains from a year ago than nationwide. 
Strength in gypsum board shipments reflects not only finishing work 
on new construction projects but also the continued high level of 
renovation activity. Construction activity on downtown Chicago 
commercial buildings is still at a high level and is expected to 
remain vigorous, based on building plans and demolition activity. 
Building of light industrial structures continues at a good pace in 
Chicago suburbs. Highway work has been strong in the metro area this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on residential sales are mixed. Some realtors indicate 
relatively good volumes of business following declines in mortgage 
interest rates from peaks last spring, but others view sales as 
sluggish. There are indications of weakening in housing prices. Some 
realtors regard property sales as soft partly because sellers have 
exaggerated views of what their properties are worth. Affordability 
is a problem for many would-be buyers. On the other hand, houses 
that are selling include numerous larger and more expensive 
properties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise retail sales in early October, on a comparable-
selling-days basis, were having modest gains from a year earlier, 
according to a contact with a large chain. Some durable goods were 
selling well, including washers and dryers, refrigerators, home 
electronics, and computers. Sales of other product lines, including 
home improvements and some fashions were weak. Children's apparel 
was selling well. Credit sales continued strong, with no 
deterioration in delinquencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ideal weather conditions the past three weeks have helped to dry 
crops and speed up both the fall harvest and the planting of winter 
wheat. The corn and soybean harvest, as of October 15, ranged from 
two-thirds complete in Illinois and Iowa to one-third complete in 
Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Despite frost damage in some 
areas, numerous reports note "better-than-expected" yields, 
especially in Iowa.
