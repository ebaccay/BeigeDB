      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 19, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District respondents expect that the economic expansion will 
be sustained at least through the final quarter of 1991, despite 
short-run effects of the oil-price shock. The worst of the inflation 
bubble is expected to occur next quarter. The oil-price shock is 
expected to weaken consumer spending further, but District retailers 
generally report their August sales turned out to be better than 
expected. Manufacturers are cautious about short-term prospects for 
output, but generally acknowledge that effects of the oil-price 
shock so far have been relatively minimal. Lending activity by banks 
and thrifts appears to have slowed further in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The National Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District respondents generally expect that the expansion will be 
sustained at least through 1991, despite short-term dampening 
effects of the oil-price shock. A panel of 21 Fourth District 
economists expects that growth in real GNP will slow to about 1% 
between 1989:IVQ and 1990:IVQ, which is about one-half the increase 
they expected last May. Only a handful expect a two to three quarter 
contraction in real GNP, of 1% to 3% at annual rates, beginning 
either in 1990:IIIQ or 1990:IVQ, and extending into 1991.IQ. For 
1991, the panel expects slow but steadily rising growth in output 
from the first quarter through the fourth quarter. The median 
forecast of real GNP shows growth of 1.9% for the year, somewhat 
less then they expected last May. There are no recession forecasts 
for 1991.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recent jump in crude oil prices is generally expected to have 
temporary effects on inflation. An inflation bubble is expected 
between 1990:IIIQ and 1991:IQ, with the worst of inflation expected 
to be at nearly a 5% annual rate next quarter. Thereafter, inflation 
is expected to revert to a 4% rate through the balance of the 1991. 
While most of the panel of 21 forecasters expects a temporary burst 
in prices at slightly below a 5% rate, several expect that the GNP 
implicit-price deflator will rise between a 5% and 9.5% rate into 
early 1991 before moderating.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The oil-price shock has weakened the near-term outlook for real 
consumer spending, according to the Fourth District panel of 
forecasters. They now believe that real consumer spending between 
1990:IIQ and 1990:IVQ will increase by about 1% instead of the 2% 
they expected last May. Nevertheless, sales reported by retailers 
and producers of consumer goods in August were generally as good as, 
or better than, sales in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Department store retailers in this District are less optimistic 
about sales prospects for the fall season. Most report, however, 
that sales in August rose from July, but that increases were smaller 
than in the previous month. Retailers generally expect that price 
promotions will be necessary to sustain sales over the next few 
months. Retailers in Cleveland report that their back-to-school 
sales in August were as good as, or better than, sales last year. 
Auto retailers report August sales were about as expected, and, in 
some cases, better than in July. Some report a step-up in consumer 
interest in fuel-efficient cars, and most dealers report buyers are 
still leaning toward more expensive rather than mid-priced cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to some auto producers, car sales in August were better 
than they expected in their pre-oil-shock forecasts. Some believe 
that the timing of the consumer confidence surveys may have biased 
the survey results, and expect future surveys to show some recovery 
in consumer confidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District respondents in manufacturing and utilities are typically 
cautious about short-term prospects for production and profits 
because of uncertainties over the oil situation. They report no 
unusual deferments or cancellations of orders or spending in 
response to the oil-price shock. They emphasize a lessened 
dependence on oil, a more efficient capital stock that has been 
installed in anticipation of even higher real prices for oil than at 
present, and the relatively small price increase in crude oil now 
compared with episodes in the 1970s.
     </p>
     <p>
      The steel industry is still operating at close to effective 
capacity, and producers report a strong third quarter for orders and 
production. A producer reports that orders for October are being 
booked at a good pace. There is a tone of less confidence over the 
short-term outlook because of uncertainty about the effects of the 
oil situation on the auto and appliance industries. Steel producers 
point out that their industry is more energy efficient now than even 
five years ago. Crude-oil costs are a relatively small part of 
production costs, but the added fuel cost will hurt already squeezed 
profit margins because additional costs cannot be passed through to 
steel consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some capital-goods producers are less optimistic about short-term 
output and spending plans, because they expect that the uncertainty 
over the oil situation will temporarily erode business confidence. 
Some expect that there could be a temporary deferring, or 
postponing, of short-lead-time equipment from this year into early 
next year. They also emphasize that capital stock additions in 
recent years anticipated real oil prices even higher than at present 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto production next quarter will likely exceed new car sales, 
barring work stoppages, but dealers caution about holding 
inventories and deterioration in consumer confidence are likely to 
be constraints on auto output plans. Light truck output will be 
hampered by a 100-day inventory. Heavy-duty truck output is reviving 
slowly from a trough in late 1989 and early 1990, and output this 
quarter will likely be the best so far this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major electric power utility in Ohio believes that the effect of 
the oil-price shock is minimal because their facilities have become 
marginal users of crude oil. Also, more efficient energy use by the 
utility's industrial accounts have sharply reduced the effects of 
oil price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some banks and thrifts report a further slowing in lending activity 
in recent weeks. Mortgage interest rate increases of at least one-
half point on fixed-rate mortgages since early August have dulled 
mortgage lending. Some lenders also state that concerns about rising 
delinquencies and increasing nonperforming loans that are reported 
nationally are contributing to more cautious lending policies. While 
some expect near-term cutbacks in consumer spending, they also 
believe that consumers will not curtail spending as much as most 
forecasters expect.
     </p>
     <p>
      High office and retail vacancy rates in many metropolitan centers, 
coupled with tightened lending terms, have moved some developers to 
shift their operations into other kinds of construction. A large 
shopping mall developer, for example, will increasingly focus on 
construction of residential communities. Another developer has been 
moving into apartment construction from office building.
