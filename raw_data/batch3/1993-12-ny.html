      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic developments seemed slightly more positive in recent weeks. 
A majority of District retail respondents reported that October 
sales were on or above plan. Homebuilders noted little change in the 
residential construction market in recent weeks though a few saw 
signs of some increased buyer interest.  Office vacancy rates moved 
lower in downtown Manhattan, and some analysts believe that, if the 
trend continues, this could be the first year since the mid-80s that 
a net absorption of commercial space occurred downtown. The latest 
nonfarm employment figures showed some improvement in the region, 
but the state unemployment rates continued to be quite volatile. 
Looking to the future, most of our manufacturing contacts expect 
sales to increase over the next six months, and virtually all 
reported intense price competition. Most senior loan officers at 
small and midsized banks indicated no change in their willingness to 
lend over the last quarter though a few mentioned an increased 
willingness.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A majority of District retail respondents reported that October 
sales were on or above plan. Some retailers, however, said that 
October sales were somewhat disappointing, due in part to 
unseasonably warm weather. In the first half of November, a pickup 
in activity was noted at most stores and retailers were cautiously 
optimistic about the holiday season ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over-the-year sales results ranged widely in October, from -6.8 
percent to +13 percent. Retailers reported varying experience even 
with comparable product lines. For example, some retailers noted 
strong demand for most kinds of apparel, but weakness in items for 
the home, while others reported opposite trends and attributed weak 
fall apparel sales to unusually warm weather. As compared with the 
relatively strong gains last year, they anticipate somewhat smaller 
year-to-year increases this Christmas. With one exception, all 
respondents stated that inventories were in good shape going into 
the holiday season, with some describing them as "lean".
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders noted little change in the residential construction 
market in recent weeks though a few saw signs of some increased 
buyer interest. Respondents were still fairly evenly divided between 
those anticipating higher and lower housing starts this year 
compared with last. Low mortgage rates, steady home prices and a 
reduced inventory of resales were cited as factors behind increased 
activity where it exists, but uncertainty about jobs and impending 
layoffs continue to contribute to buyer reluctance in many areas. 
One respondent noted that many builders were supplementing their 
income with remodeling work while another said that subcontractors 
were becoming hard to find in his area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office vacancy rates moved lower in downtown Manhattan, and some 
analysts noted that if the trend continues, this could be the first 
year since the mid-80s that net absorption of commercial space 
occurred in the downtown area. Vacancy rates rose somewhat in mid-
Manhattan, however, as several firms added small amounts of excess 
office space to the supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The latest nonfarm employment figures showed some improvement in the 
region. New York's September-to-October gain was the largest since 
1987, while New Jersey posted its largest manufacturing job increase 
in over ten years during September. However, unemployment rates 
continued to be volatile, with New York's October rate rising to 7.9 
percent from 7.1 percent in September and New Jersey's falling to 
6.5 percent from 7.7 percent in September. With regard to the 
outlook, recent developments concerning employment have been mixed. 
On the positive side, ground was recently broken in Newark for the 
$150 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, scheduled to open in 
1996, which is expected to create some 625 construction jobs and 470 
permanent positions. On central Long Island, the Fairchild 
Corporation plans to demolish its abandoned 80-acre aircraft plant 
and erect a shopping mail with three major retailers and scores of 
specialty shops. Upstate, Crouse-Hinds announced that it will stay 
in the Syracuse area, retaining some 1200 jobs, and GM will add 
nearly 600 jobs at its engine plant in Tonawanda. KeyCorp's merger 
with Society Corp. could also result in 300 jobs being moved to 
Albany from outside the District. On the other hand, Delta plans to 
close its New York reservations office, affecting 400 positions, and 
Werner-Lambert intends to cut more than 1400 additional jobs in the 
U.S. In addition, Dun and Bradstreet announced that it will cut 
several thousand jobs worldwide over the next two years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of our manufacturing contacts expect sales to increase over the 
next six months, with several projecting gains of 5 percent or more. 
Most firms report intense price competition, and anticipate flat-to-
lower prices. Those planning price increases generally acknowledge 
that they are not sure they can make the prices stick. The majority 
of the firms expect capital spending in the next six months to equal 
or exceed spending in the first half of 1993, and most expect wage 
gains to be moderate and less than in 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in 
the Second District indicated that they were as willing to lend as 
they were two months ago, and a few mentioned an increased 
willingness to lend. The pattern of overall loan demand was mixed. 
The demand for commercial and industrial loans remained weak, with 
only a few officers noting improvement. In contrast, residential 
mortgage demand continued to be strong, largely due to the fast pace 
of refinancing activity. The demand for consumer loans exhibited 
considerable strength, which several officers attributed to lower 
rates and increased marketing efforts. In addition, almost all 
respondents reported either stable or lower delinquency rates during 
the preceding two months.
