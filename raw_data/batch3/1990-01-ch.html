      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 24, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Seventh District is showing signs of 
an auto-related slowdown, while other sectors of the District's 
economy continue to make slight improvements. Retailers report a 
high volume of sales in December, particularly in the final week. 
Auto sales improved nationally throughout December and into early 
January, as renewed promotional activity finally began to influence 
buyer decisions. Steel producers cited a stretching out of orders 
from the auto industry, but most other markets remain firm. Several 
reports from equipment producers cite a slowdown in shipments, with 
growth expected to remain positive. Although unseasonably cold 
weather slowed construction activity in December, backlogs remain 
relatively strong in the District. A consensus outlook of 24 
business economists shows steady improvement in the economy this 
year, after a weak fourth quarter last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise sales in the District grew slightly faster than 
the national average during December, according to several reports. 
Sales among discount chains were hampered by heavy discounting at 
conventional department stores during the last few weeks of the 
Christmas shopping season. However, sales at discount chains 
rebounded sharply in the week after Christmas. Sales volume at one 
discount chain was reported to be better than expected, up slightly 
from 1988's growth pace. Sales growth was concentrated in urban 
areas of the District. Earlier concerns of excess inventories going 
into 1990 have been eased by strong sales last month, but 
inventories are high in some areas, notably apparel and household 
goods. Better-than-expected sales overall in early January, along 
with order reductions in problem areas, are expected to be 
sufficient to ease inventory problems early in the first quarter, 
according to one industry contact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total auto sales nationally hit a 10 million unit annual rate in the 
last ten days of December, according to an industry economist, as 
sales promotions finally began to boost dealership traffic. Early 
reports for the first ten days of January suggest a continuation of 
sales at near a 10 million unit pace. If this sales pace continues 
through January, one industry economist expects that production 
cutbacks already announced should be sufficient to eliminate the 
industry's inventory overhang. The effects of worker layoffs in 
January will have a sizable impact on District employment, with over 
half of an expected 115,000 layoffs concentrated in the District. In 
addition, a Michigan utility reports that during December electrical 
power consumption by industrial customers, led by auto producers, 
dropped sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The steel industry shipped 20 million tons of steel in the fourth 
quarter of last year, according to an industry economist, pushing 
shipments for the year about 1 percent above 1988. However, 
shipments were sliding throughout the fourth quarter, reflecting 
primarily a slowing of shipments to the auto industry. Orders for 
the first quarter of this year indicate a reversal of this pattern, 
with shipments starting weak and gradually improving. According to 
one respondent, the auto industry has not cut orders, but has spread 
existing orders over January and February. Demand for steel from 
other markets, including machinery, construction, and steel service 
centers, is reported to be doing well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers of business equipment generally reported continued slowing 
in activity, with some segments showing signs of bottoming out last 
month. A producer of heavy equipment reports that sales of 
construction equipment continue to weaken and sales of mining 
equipment have started to slow, with the notable exception of coal 
mining equipment. Strength in exports is helping to offset a slowing 
in domestic demand for some types of heavy equipment. A producer of 
communications equipment reports that orders at the end of 1989 
indicate a turnaround from the steadily slowing growth of shipments 
occurring in first quarter of 1990. Recovery to trend growth rates 
is expected to take most of this year, reaching trend growth by 
early 1991. A maker of electrical controls and supplies sold to 
other producers of industrial equipment, however, reports steady 
growth in sales to its industrial markets and expects demand for its 
products to continue to be strong in 1990.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several reports indicate that on average construction activity in 
the District continues to be stronger than the nation. While demand 
for concrete in the Chicago area slumped in December due to 
unseasonably cold weather, backlogs were up substantially from year 
ago levels, according to one supplier. Gypsum board shipments to 
District states have been rising at twice the national pace, 
although Michigan continues to lag other District states. A supplier 
to the residential construction market reports that contract awards 
in the year-to-date through November of last year increased 5 
percent in the District states, compared to a 3 percent decline 
nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consensus Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A group of 24 business economists from the Midwest met at the Bank 
in mid-December to discuss the economic outlook for 1990. After an 
expected flat fourth quarter in 1989, their median forecast shows 
real GNP rising 1.7 percent in 1990, on a year-over-year basis. 
Their industrial production forecast shows a 1.2 percent decline for 
the fourth quarter of 1989 and only 1.1 percent growth in 1990. 
However, both forecasted series show marked improvement over the 
course of the year, led by consumer spending. In line with the 
consensus outlook, the December survey of Chicago purchasing agents 
showed expanding activity. Finally, the median forecast for the GNP 
implicit price deflator indicated an easing in inflationary 
pressures, dropping from 4.2 percent in 1989 to 3.9 percent in 1990.
