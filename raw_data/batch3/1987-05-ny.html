      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the Second District economy registered a modest 
improvement since the last report. Retailers had better-than-
expected sales gains during March and the homebuilding season has 
gotten underway with a good start. Office leasing was reported to be 
good and general business conditions were described as stable to 
improved. On the financial side, small and mid-sized banks report 
that growth in consumer lending has been weak since the beginning of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      March sales at Second District department stores were reported as 
good despite the fact that Easter did not occur until mid-April this 
year. Over-the-year gains ranged from 6 to 9 percent and were 
generally above plan since March 1986 had included the Easter 
holiday. (Because of the shifting of Easter between March and April, 
many retailers look at the two-month period as one combined selling 
season.) Demand was favorable for goods such as furniture, home 
furnishings and housewares, though sale of apparel and accessories 
were relatively weak in March and stores specializing In these did 
not fare as well. Interest in apparel and accessories, items 
traditionally associated with Easter shopping, picked up 
substantially as the holiday grew near, and District respondents 
anticipate a good showing for the month of April as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      With March sales ranging 1 to 3 percent above goals that were 
described as "aggressive", inventories have generally been 
maintained at or below desired levels. One chain with higher-than-intended stocks indicated that paring its inventories is a major 
objective in the weeks immediately ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The improved tone in the District's economy continued in recent 
weeks. Eighty percent or more of the Rochester and Buffalo 
purchasing managers reporting in the March surveys described general 
business conditions as stable or better than in February and a 
modest buildup in inventories was not viewed as unfavorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates edged lower in both New York and New Jersey 
during March to 4.7 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively. As 
nonmanufacturing employment expanded further, unemployment rates 
remained at their lowest levels in 17 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the termination of the Air Force training plane contract with 
Fairchild Republic in March, the long-feared closing of that 
company's Long Island plant is now underway. Some 1,800 of its 3,500 
employees have already been dismissed and the plant is scheduled to 
close by year-end. A group of former employees is attempting to 
purchase the facility and resume aircraft production, but the 
success of this plan is seen as unlikely. More positive news in 
recent weeks was Eastman Kodak's announcement that it will build a 
new $200 million color film plant at its manufacturing complex in 
Rochester, consolidating technology it has been developing around 
the world.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As the homebuilding season gets underway, District contacts report 
that the market continues to look very good and demand for new 
housing remains strong. The recent sharp increase in mortgage rates 
has apparently had little dampening impact as the level of rates 
remains relatively low. However, shortages of available and 
affordable land are increasingly cited as major problems and 
possible deterrents to much additional homebuilding in some areas. 
For 1987, though, builders are expected to be quite busy and the 
level of activity to equal or be minimally below the 1986 pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity in the Second District has been good 
recently but not substantial enough to reduce vacancy rates in areas 
of oversupply. Rates in northern New Jersey and Fairfield and 
Westchester counties, e.g., remain in the 20 to 25 percent range and 
projects already in the pipeline continue under construction. With 
an overall official vacancy rate of about 8 percent, New York City 
is still one of the healthiest markets in the country. While it is 
generally expected that midtown will show some improvement in 1987, 
opinion is divided about the vacancy rate in lower Manhattan, where 
about 7 million square feet of new office space is scheduled to come 
on line.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small and mid-sized banks in the Second District report that growth 
in consumer lending has been weak since the beginning of 1987. Most 
banks indicated that originations of consumer installment 1oans, 
primary mortgages, and agricultural loans have slowed while demand 
for other types of loans, such as automobile loans, remains almost 
negligible. High consumer indebtedness, housing shortages, problems 
in the farm and dairy businesses, and competition from auto finance 
companies were cited as reasons for the weakness. Some bank officers 
reported that their applications for mortgage loans had picked up 
recently as other banks announced increased lending rates and 
consumers rushed to borrow prior to further rate increases. However, 
the banks which experienced the surge of activity are now raising 
their own mortgage rates or plan to do so in the near future. 
Therefore, the demand for such loans is expected to drop off at 
these banks and in the aggregate to fall below the usual level for 
this time of year. Lending officers believe that increases in home 
equity and unsecured personal loans will not be enough to compensate 
for the weakness in other forms of consumer lending.
