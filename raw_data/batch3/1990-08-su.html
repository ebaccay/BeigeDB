      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business and banking contacts in the Reserve Districts generally 
report continued economic growth, though most noted that the pace 
was slow or had slackened recently. Among those Districts whose 
respondents commented on costs or prices, wages were reported as 
rising in a range of 3 to 5 percent, in most cases excluding 
benefits. Reports on prices did not display as much consensus, with 
some reporting widespread increases and others noting difficulty in 
passing on cost increases and attendant pressures on margins. Retail 
sales were generally described as a little better than a year ago or 
soft, with weaker-than-expected demand for big ticket items cited 
most often. In some Districts retailers indicated they had become 
less optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year, though 
in others they were anticipating a slight pickup in sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity is said to be flat, on balance, though 
healthy growth in tradable goods is seen in a number of regions. 
Reports on real estate construction and sales suggest, for the most 
part, that activity is remaining below levels seen in 1989, largely 
because of continuing high inventories. Credit is said to be tight 
in some areas. However, little uniformity of opinion about the 
reasons for this was evident in the reports. Contacts in the 
agriculture and natural resource sectors indicate a pretty good 
outlook at this point, reflecting better weather conditions in major 
crop and livestock producing areas and an improved energy sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales activity is described as soft to a little higher than a 
year ago, though contacts in Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas 
noted strength in some areas. Retailers in New York City are less 
optimistic about the outlook given the continuing layoffs at banks 
and brokerage firms, while those in St. Louis expressed similar 
views in light of anticipated defense cutbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several Districts reported that demand for women's apparel in recent 
months was described as strong, while that for men's was weak. A few 
noted that sales activity in July had fallen off, though retailers 
in the Philadelphia District indicated that this was seasonal. Those 
in New York and Minneapolis remarked that an influx of Canadian 
shoppers was adding to sales in their Districts, while Dallas 
reported that retail activity in Houston and areas near the Mexican 
border was doing well. Reports on sales of home furnishings and 
appliances more frequently cited weakness, though there were 
exceptions to this. Vehicular sales were generally said to be flat 
or below year-ago levels, though contacts in Atlanta and San 
Francisco reported strong demand for used models.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of Districts that inquired about inventories, five cited indications 
that they were higher than retail respondents desired, while four 
noted that they were at levels acceptable to them. Kansas City added 
that financing for inventories is adequate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts at manufacturing firms suggest that overall activity is 
flat, though responses varied considerably from industry to 
industry. Strength was reported in demand for products that are 
exported, and Richmond added that producers are looking to these 
markets for sales gains. Demand for domestic steel was also said to 
be stronger, and respondents in Dallas and Cleveland said that this 
reflected the reduced availability of imports given healthy demand 
in Europe. Current levels of auto production were also cited as a 
reason for the better demand for steel. Chicago noted that orders 
for liner board were stronger than contacts had expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of steel and commercial aircraft, backlogs and 
lead times were said to be working down. St. Louis, Minneapolis, and 
San Francisco noted that weakness was described as pronounced in 
defense-related activities. Dallas, Richmond, and Atlanta contacts 
saw weakness in textiles and furniture production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of Districts reporting on employment and price trends, most 
respondents indicated that labor utilization was either flat or 
likely to weaken based on announced layoffs. Wage increases appeared 
clustered in a 3-5 percent range, though two Districts noted that 
the benefit costs were rising faster, and two mentioned shortages of 
entry-level workers. Reports on materials prices were mixed, with 
stability to slight increases noted by some contacts and flat to 
slight declines mentioned by others. Cleveland, Richmond, and St. 
Louis said costs and prices were generally rising, and contacts in 
the latter put the cost increases in a 3-5 percent range.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on residential real estate construction and sales generally 
suggest that activity was below the pace of a year ago. High 
inventories of housing were said to be causing weakness in 
construction and in many cases causing downward pressure on prices. 
Cleveland, however, noted a mixed picture for sales, adding that 
prices were up in some cities by 6-8 percent over the last six 
months. St. Louis reported good demand for starter homes in the 
Memphis area. New York and Chicago realtors suggested that high-
priced hones were the most difficult to sell. Respondents in San 
Francisco noted that a cooling of activity in coastal California 
dominated statistics for that District. Those in Boston indicated 
that the widespread media attention given to weakness in the 
District may be hurting real estate sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Five Districts reported asking about nonresidential construction, 
and most respondents saw weak or slackening activity in their 
regions due to large inventories of space. Some in New York added 
that, while rent concessions had increased leasing activity in 
Manhattan, corporate relocations had led to a rise in vacancy rates 
anyway, in contrast to stable or declining ones elsewhere in the 
District. Firms polled by Dallas indicated that construction of 
petrochemical plants remains at a high level, and Atlanta 
respondents viewed public infrastructure as a bright spot.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several Districts report that the pace of commercial loan growth has 
recently slowed, and some indicate that its levels are below those 
of a year ago. Lending to consumers appears to have decelerated by a 
smaller margin in most Districts that reported on this, with current 
growth attributable largely to credit card and home equity lending. 
Respondents in several Districts indicate that new credit is more 
difficult to obtain for construction projects, though their remarks 
suggest some divergence of view as to the causes of this. In New 
York, the glut of homes for sale is said to be the major deterrent 
to building, even though the shortage of finance for acquisition and 
construction loans appears to be spreading. Regulatory restrictions 
on S&amp;Ls; are said to be affecting small builders in Chicago, though 
Cleveland notes that a shift from thrifts has caused real estate 
lending to rise at banks. They also add that while increased 
borrower scrutiny is reported, there are few known outright 
cancellations.
     </p>
     <p>
      About half the respondents in Boston saw the availability of bank 
credit as problematical for their own or other businesses. San 
Francisco notes similar views by a few respondents, though 
businesses and bankers in the District disagree about the extent of 
tighter standards and its impact on lending activity. Businesses in 
the Atlanta and Philadelphia Districts report problems with 
collecting on receivables.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports suggest that the outlook for agricultural 
production generally appears good at this point, though poor weather 
conditions are hurting crops in some areas. Kansas City indicates 
that wheat production in Kansas, the largest producing state, is the 
highest on record and more than twice last year's output. Prices are 
down sharply. St. Louis reports that wheat yields are lower by 12 to 
26 percent due to disease. Chicago said that heavy rains earlier in 
the year had delayed planting. While Richmond said that rain brought 
relief to earlier drought conditions, Atlanta reported that hot and 
dry weather is reducing corn, soybean, and forage production by as 
much as 25 percent. Dallas also said that District crops, including 
cotton, corn and grains, were adversely affected by the heat and 
that prices in June averaged 6 percent above those a year earlier. 
Minneapolis noted that production costs for corn and soybeans were 
up 6-10 percent from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Districts reporting on meat production said output and prices 
were both strong, and Atlanta described robust conditions for 
poultry with export sales especially healthy. Minneapolis indicated 
that forest products were doing well. San Francisco, in contrast, 
said that a widely expected deterioration in logging and lumber had 
emerged due to weaker housing construction and environmental 
concerns. Kansas City and Dallas noted that oil production was up 
from a year ago.
