      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 16, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some recent slight improvement in Tenth District economic activity 
appears evident. While the energy sector remains weak, retail sales 
continue to improve somewhat and inventories are regarded as lean 
but satisfactory. Price increases remain moderate, both at retail 
and for materials inputs. Housing starts are up somewhat, but the 
demand for mortgage funds is somewhat weak and rates have softened a 
bit in some areas. Loan demand at district commercial banks is down 
slightly, while deposits are up. Credit conditions for farm 
borrowers vary widely.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District retailers report that sales are generally unchanged 
to slightly above year-earlier levels, depending partly on type of 
stare and geographic location, Sales have shown some further 
improvement during the last three months. Price increases have been 
moderate, and prices are expected to remain relatively stable to 
slightly higher. Inventories are reported to be at satisfactory 
levels after some recent trimming. Retailers are optimistic that 
sales will be solid during 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto dealers report that February auto sales were generally down 
from previous months, partly due to the elimination of the sales tax 
deduction. Most dealers have been trimming their inventories, and 
are not overly optimistic about the outlook for future sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents generally report slightly to moderately higher 
prices for major inputs but expect little additional change in the 
period ahead. Materials supplies have been somewhat difficult to 
maintain in some industries, with a few firms experiencing longer 
lead times. Inventories have been kept lean deliberately and are 
generally regarded as satisfactory. None of the respondents report 
any production bottlenecks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's energy industry remains weak. Uncertainty about the 
ability of OPEC members to adhere to an agreement to restrict output 
and fix prices has caused oil prices to remain somewhat volatile. As 
a result, exploration and development activity in the district 
remains generally depressed. The average weekly number of operating 
drilling rigs in the Tenth District decreased from 272 in January to 
226 in February, slightly more than half the number recorded a year 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area homebuilders report that housing starts are mixed compared to 
year-earlier levels but have strengthened somewhat over the past 
month. Multi-family housing construction is weak throughout the 
District, while single-family housing construction is somewhat 
stronger. Builders expect overall housing starts in 1987 to match 
those of 1986. Sales of new homes remain good, with prices generally 
stable to up slightly. Builders report no problems with either the 
availability or delivery of housing materials, and materials prices 
are stable. However, the U.S. induced export duty on Canadian 
shingles and lumber leads most builders to anticipate a jump in 
materials prices in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most savings institutions report weak inflows or moderate outflows 
of savings over the last twelve months, but with some improvement in 
the last month. Most respondents expect some further improvement in 
the near future. Demand for mortgage funds is fairly weak, and 
opinions vary about future demand. Mortgage interest rates have 
softened a bit in some areas, but respondents generally expect 
slight increases in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand fell slightly at tenth District banks during the 
past month, while total deposits rose. Demand weakened for 
agricultural, commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate 
loans, but was constant for residential real estate and consumer 
loans. All respondents report that their prime rate did not change 
and that they did not expect it to change in the near future. 
Consumer loan rates were generally constant and no changes are 
expected in the near-term. Balances in conventional NOW's, Super-
NOW's, MMDA's, IRA's, and passbook savings accounts tended to 
increase. Demand deposits and large CD's tended to decrease, and 
small time deposits remained constant.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial lenders in the district are in the midst of annual credit 
reviews for their farm borrowers. Some bankers expect to approve 
credit for all their farm borrowers, although some borrowers may not 
receive all that they request. Other agricultural lenders expect a 
smaller proportion of their borrowers to be denied credit this year 
than last year. A number of bankers, however, expect that up to 15 
percent of their farm borrowers will be denied credit this spring, a 
proportion as high or higher than a year ago. These mixed results 
suggest that while some agricultural lenders have successfully rid 
their portfolios of problem loans, others have not.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Farmers' Home Administration's (FmHA) loan guarantee program has 
also met with mixed results. Some agricultural lenders are using few 
or no guarantees, because of the additional paperwork and past 
difficulties in securing FmHA approval. Other bankers are gradually 
increasing their use of FmHA loan guarantees, while still others are 
enthusiastically using the loan guarantee program for as many as 20 
percent of their borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most bankers have acquired farm real estate through foreclosures, 
and are handling the acquired property in a variety of ways. A few 
lenders are selling farmland as soon as possible after foreclosure, 
with little regard for price. In most cases, however, lenders note 
that most properties are not selling due to a lack of interested 
buyers. In the meantime, acquired farmland is being leased out by 
lendersâ€”in some cases for the third consecutive year.
