      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1993
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Third District business contacts in April suggest that 
economic activity in the region was continuing to move up at a very 
modest pace. Manufacturers generally indicated that shipments and 
orders were increasing while inventories remained steady. Retailers 
were posting slight gains, on balance, for April compared to the 
same month a year ago. Auto and truck dealers also reported year-over-year increases. Most bankers, however, indicated that loan 
volume was flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus forecast among those contacted for this report calls 
for slow growth. Manufacturers believe that business will continue 
to move up, but their level of optimism has declined since the 
beginning of the year. Retailers expect consumer spending to gain 
slowly during the rest of the year. Bankers anticipate that business 
lending may pick up soon, amid strong competition among banks for 
commercial loans. They have mixed views on the course of personal 
lending in the near future: some foresee a slight increase but 
others expect loan volume to remain flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District manufacturers indicated that activity 
remained on an upward trend, on balance. While just under half said 
business was steady, firms making gains outnumbered those 
experiencing decreases by two-to-one. Overall, both new orders and 
shipments were rising, and inventories were holding steady. Business 
continued to improve for nearly all major manufacturing sectors in 
the District; the exceptions were furniture and lumber--where 
conditions were steady--and food processors, whose business had 
slipped from March. Employment appeared to be steady, on the whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District manufacturers remains positive 
although the level of optimism has declined from the first months of 
the year. Nonetheless, around half of those contacted in April said 
they expect business to continue moving up while fewer than one-in-five expect a decline. On balance, the view is that orders and 
shipments will rise in tandem over the next six months keeping 
inventories under control. The outlook for employment is modestly 
positive: one-fourth of the firms polled for this report plan to add 
workers over the next six months while, twice the number who plan 
cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers surveyed in the second half of April 
generally indicated that sales were increasing although the rate of 
gain was slow. Many said that the March snowstorm had significantly 
curtailed results for the month but consumer spending had rebounded 
since. Still, according to most of the merchants queried, the April 
sales rate was not exceeding expectations they had formed prior to 
the March storm.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the most part, forecasts by Third District merchants are that 
sales will continue to move up during the year. Bad weather in both 
February and March is blamed for a poor start and store executives 
said that, consequently, the fourth quarter will have more than its 
usual significance for their full-year results. Most expect 
continuing improvement in overall economic activity, and they expect 
retail sales to share in that improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers lost sales in March due to the storm, 
but reports in April indicated that sales were on the rise. Dealers 
selling domestic cars appeared to be making greater gains than 
foreign auto dealers. Truck dealers said sales of both light and 
heavy-duty trucks were on an upward path, and several reported 
substantial increases over the year-ago sales rate. In general, 
Third District auto dealers expressed optimism that sales will 
continue to improve through the spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Comments from Third District bankers indicated that loan activity 
had been flat in recent weeks. While some banks reported increases 
in consumer and mortgage lending, these gains appeared to have bean 
offset by declines at other banks, leaving loan volume for these 
credit categories in the District virtually unchanged. Most of the 
bankers contacted for this report said commercial and industrial 
lending was steady although there were a few reports that lending to 
small businesses had picked up recently. All bankers described loan 
markets as very competitive and said net interest margins were 
decreasing as a result of more aggressive loan pricing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the slackness in lending in April, several bankers said they 
were receiving an increasing number of inquiries and applications 
from potential business borrowers. In general, bankers who reported 
this interest expected to see growth in commercial and industrial 
loans booked in the near future. The outlook for consumer lending is 
not as clear. Some bankers said consumers would continue to 
consolidate and reduce debt, but others indicated that personal 
lending at their institutions appeared to be taking a slight upward 
trend.
