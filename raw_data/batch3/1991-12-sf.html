      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity remains slow in most parts of the Twelfth 
District, and the economic expectations of District business leaders 
deteriorated further in November. Continued sluggish sales have kept 
most wage and price increases modest, and concern about the holiday 
shopping is widespread. Weakness in District manufacturing activity 
continues. Agricultural conditions remain satisfactory overall, 
despise several problems including the recent whitefly invasion. 
Construction and real estate activity remains slow in most parts of 
the District. With the exception of mortgage refinancing, lending is 
still weak in most parts of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic expectations of business leaders in the Twelfth 
District deteriorated in November. Eighty-nine percent of business 
leaders now foresee GNP growth of less than 2.5 percent during the 
next four quarters, with 25 percent expecting recession. The share 
of business leaders expecting recession has increased from 7 percent 
in September and 17 percent in October. The majority of western 
business leaders now foresee weaker business investment and 
increasing unemployment during the next four quarters. Expectations 
of consumer spending also have worsened, with 31 percent of business 
leaders now projecting improved spending, down from 50 percent in 
September and 37 percent in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wages and prices are reported stable or increasing only modestly in 
most parts of the District. Continued sluggish consumer demand is 
keeping downward pressure on soft goods prices. Prices of many food 
products are reported below year earlier levels, but the whitefly 
infestation has led to higher prices for several winter crops, 
including lettuce, broccoli, and cauliflower. Consumer prices in 
southern California in October were up 3 percent from a year ago. 
Wage increases for District firms duster in the 3 to 4 1/2 percent 
range, with several firms reporting that wage increases will be 
lower in l992 than they were in l991. Benefits costs continue to 
rise faster than wages, led by increases in health care plan 
premiums of 10 to 25 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in the District remains sluggish. Department store 
retailers report continued slow sales. Concern about the holiday 
shopping season is widespread, although some western retailers feel 
that the worst is behind them. New-car sales also are reported weak, 
with little enthusiasm for 1992 models. In contrast, used car sales 
continue strong, and prices are holding up well. Most retailers 
report tightly controlled inventories, but a few firms note that 
sluggish sales have caused some recent increases in inventories. 
Slow economic activity also is reported at law firms, newspapers, 
state and local governments, and research and development 
laboratories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakness in District manufacturing activity continues. Layoffs and 
cutbacks continue at some Oregon high-tech and metals manufacturers. 
Aluminum manufacturers continue to face low prices and over-
capacity. Despite reports of high aluminum inventories, one 
manufacturer reports that his inventories are "manageable" At 
Boeing, commercial aircraft production continues strong, but the 
pace of new orders has slowed considerably from last year. 
Previously announced layoffs at Boeing in response to Stealth Bomber 
cutbacks probably will be avoided.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural conditions are generally satisfactory. In 
Washington, apple production fell 5 percent from last year, but 
prices currently are up 20 percent from a year ago. Prices for 
potatoes and soybeans are down from a year ago, but wheat prices 
have strengthened recently in response to the extension of rain 
credits to Russia. However, beef and dairy prices and demand remain 
low. In addition, the whitefly infestation in southern California is 
taking a toll on farmers already hurting from last winter's freeze 
and the ongoing drought. The poinsettia whitefly has destroyed a 
large part of the winter vegetable crop, pushing up prices for 
vegetables such as lettuce, broccoli, and cauliflower.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in other resource industries are mixed. Sawmills and 
plywood plants continue to close in Oregon, reflecting the 
persistent weakness in the lumber industry. Orders for some pulp and 
paper products remain relatively strong, however. Oil and gas 
drilling activity in the District is still depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate markets remain slow in most parts of 
the District. In southern California, both residential and 
commercial activity is weak. House values and home sales are down in 
Silicon Valley, with particular weakness reported at the upper end 
of the marks. Home prices in Washington are reported flat to down 
slightly, while the volume of sales is rising slowly after dropping 
off earlier this year. Housing starts in Washington are down 25 
percent from last year. Commercial construction in San Francisco 
remains flat. Several respondents cite tight credit conditions as a 
reason for the slow construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions at District financial institutions remain mixed. Banks 
report relatively healthy conditions in Idaho and Utah and, to a 
lesser extent, in the Pacific Northwest. Demand for home loans in 
Utah is strong and delinquency rues have fallen to their lowest 
levels in years. Mortgage refinancings account for a large share of 
lending activity throughout the District. Commercial construction 
loan balances at some California banks continue to shrink as 
existing loans are written off and few new loans are originated.
