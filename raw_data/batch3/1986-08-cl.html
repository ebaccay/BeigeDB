      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Fourth District economy continues its pattern of slow growth 
with a sluggish manufacturing sector, depressed energy production, 
and a strong housing sector. Retail sales growth continues to be 
quite good. Unemployment rose in June and the unemployment rate 
remains above the national and year-ago levels. Manufacturing 
activity remains on its flat path and the energy industry is in the 
doldrums. Steel supplies may be disrupted by strikes against the two 
largest steel producers. Crops are growing well, and housing 
construction and sales remain robust. Commercial bank lending growth 
is strong for real estate, moderate for consumer installment credit, 
and slow for business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in this District appears to have improved 
recently. Major retailers report that sales steadily increased 
throughout the second quarter and into the first half of July. Year-
to-date current-dollar sales increases range from 4 percent to 10 
percent and July may be even better. Only one major chain reported 
higher inventories, and all of the retailers felt that inventory 
levels were satisfactory. Delinquent charge accounts continued their 
gradual rise, but none of the major chains indicated any great 
concern.
     </p>
     <p>
      District auto dealers are showing satisfactory but relatively flat 
sales of domestic new cars. Domestic dealers' inventories continued 
to be slightly higher than desired, but no reason for concern. 
Several domestic auto dealers asserted that low interest rate 
financing incentives are too costly and no longer very effective. On 
the other hand, demand for imported cars continues to outstrip 
supply. One dealer reported that sales have been good despite an 
approximately 10% price increase in the 1986 model-year imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unemployment rate for Ohio rose in June as employment fell and 
unemployment rose. At 8.9 percent (sa), the unemployment rate is 0.2 
percentage points above its year-ago level. In the last twelve 
months employment grew slower in Ohio than in the nation (2.1 
percent vs. 2.9 percent) and unemployment grew faster (4.5 percent 
vs. 0.2 percent). Within the District, the unemployment rate is very 
high in counties that rely on coal mining.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in this District continues to be sluggish. 
Production increased slightly recently but new orders declined 
slightly and several firms indicated they expect order declines to 
continue for the next month or two. Employment continues about flat 
as order backlogs decline. Prices of purchased commodities are flat 
but prices manufacturers pay for services and equipment are rising 
slowly. Firms continue to trim inventories of raw materials and 
supplies, while finished goods inventories are flat. On balance, 
manufacturers expect very slow growth in the second half of 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel customers apparently have been diverting orders from USX 
(formerly U.S. Steel) to other suppliers, Including LTV, because of 
a possible strike against USX widely expected to begin at the end of 
July. USX recently announced a layoff of 1,400 workers from its 
Lorain (Cleveland) works because the threat of a strike has caused a 
sharp drop in orders for that mill. Ironically, production at the 
LTV East Chicago, Indiana plant has been halted by a strike in 
response to termination of health and life insurance benefits for 
retirees. LTV, the nation's second largest steel producer that 
recently filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is also being threatened by 
work stoppages if they ask the bankruptcy court for wage concessions
beyond those in the labor contract negotiated just last spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crops in Ohio, one of the largest agricultural-producing states, are 
doing better than average this year and corn especially is 
flourishing in response to ample moisture and warm weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity remains strong in this District. Housing market 
firms are surprised that the housing market remains strong so late 
into a business expansion but the consensus is that house building 
and house buying will continue strong throughout 1986. However, some 
firms are cautious in their planning for 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing starts have slowed recently, but builders view that as a 
temporary result of the unusual delays in obtaining mortgage loan 
approvals. In recent months, processing times had reached 90 to 120 
days as the volume of applications surged. Few mortgage lenders 
expected the high volume to persist and thus virtually no lender 
added permanent staff. Real estate closing cancellations had begun 
to rise as mortgage rates rose and few lenders would guarantee the 
lending rate beyond 60 days. However, real estate brokers report 
that mortgage loan processing times are now approaching the normal 
60 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are spotty signs that savings and loan institutions in this 
District are reducing their interest rates on new adjustable rate 
mortgages to increase their attractiveness relative to the fixed-
rate mortgage loans the buyers seem to strongly prefer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall loan demand is picking-up somewhat at District banks. Loans 
outstanding in all major categories at large banks increased over 
the past six weeks. The largest gain was in real estate loans, 
reflecting the continued robust demand for mortgage loans. Consumer 
installment credit continues to grow but at a pace substantially 
lower than a year ago. Commercial and industrial loans registered 
the smallest increase, but the growth indicates some improvement in 
business loan demand since April and May. Contacts expect moderate 
business loan growth over the rest of the year.
