      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 3, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District was edging up in July, 
according to reports from businesses in the region. Manufacturers 
indicated that shipments and orders were moving up modestly, 
although employment was steady. Auto dealers were seeing renewed 
growth in sales in July after a brief pause in June. General 
merchandise retailers, however, generally reported somewhat softer 
sales in July compared with June, especially for apparel. Bankers 
said consumer lending continued to move up and commercial lending 
was rising also, albeit slightly. Real estate loan volume has been 
flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, business contacts in the District expect growth to 
continue, but at a somewhat more subdued pace than in the first half 
of the year. Manufacturers anticipate further gains in new orders 
and shipments, but they do not expect order backlogs to increase. 
Auto dealers forecast sales for the year as a whole to exceed sales 
for last year. Retailers expect a boost from back-to-school 
shopping, but they anticipate only a slight increase for the second 
half of this year compared with the same period last year. Bankers 
predict that slower economic growth in the second half will restrain 
the growth of loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District manufacturers in July indicated that 
activity remained on a moderate upward trend. About one-third of the 
industrial firms contacted said they were posting gains in both 
shipments and new orders while about half said shipments and orders 
were running at a steady pace. Conditions varied by sector, however: 
improvement was reported among makers of paper products; chemicals; 
electrical machinery; transportation equipment; and stone, clay, and 
glass products; declining activity was noted by makers of textiles, 
primary metals, and nonelectrical machinery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment at Third District manufacturing plants was steady in 
July, according to reporting firms, with both employee numbers and 
hours level. On balance, area industrial firms were allowing 
inventories to fall slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, about 40 percent of the firms contacted for this 
report expect business to continue to improve during the next six 
months. They anticipate gains in shipments and orders, but they do 
not expect demand for their products to be strong enough to push 
order backlogs up or to require extending hours or adding workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      While half of the firms surveyed reported that prices for inputs 
were steady in July, about 40 percent noted increases for at least 
some of the goods they purchase. About two-thirds of the firms were 
holding the line on prices of the products they make, but nearly 
one-fourth were implementing price increases. Nearly two-thirds of 
the manufacturers commenting on price expectations said they 
anticipate higher input costs over the next six months, and two-
fifths plan to charge more for the products they make.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers indicated that sales in July ran somewhat 
below the levels of the spring months. While some said that normal 
seasonal factors could be the cause of the slowdown, several noted 
that sales of clothing, especially woman's apparel, remained weak as 
spring and summer fashions failed to attract consumers' interest. 
Despite slower than expected sales, most of the merchants contacted 
for this report said their inventories were not significantly higher 
than planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers generally expect the pace of sales to accelerate with the 
fall hack-to-school shopping period. Some expressed the opinion that 
clothing sales will bounce back once fall styles are in the stores. 
Most area merchants predict just small gains in overall sales, 
however, as they expect economic growth to begin slowing in the 
second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers said sales slipped a bit in late June 
but appeared to be picking up again in late July. In general, 
dealers still expect sales for the year as a whole to be good, and 
to exceed last year's level by a modest amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers generally reported moderate loan growth in 
July. Most of those contacted said consumer lending for both credit 
cards and installment loans continued to expand. Commercial lending 
has been moving up slightly, according to bankers. With the decline 
in mortgage refinancing, residential real estate lending activity 
has dropped at banks in the District and mortgage loan volume 
outstanding has been level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the bankers surveyed in July foresee some slowing of 
economic activity in the second half of the year, and they expect a 
consequent slowdown in the rate of loan growth. Also, comments from 
some bankers indicate that they may become more cautious in consumer 
lending in response to rising ratios of consumer debt to income. 
This restraint may take the form of reduced credit lines and greater 
collateral coverage for secured debt such as auto loans and home 
equity loans.
