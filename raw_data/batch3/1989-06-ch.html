      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of overall business activity in the District are giving 
mixed signals. Payroll employment in the five states, through April, 
trended upward from late 1988 at a somewhat slower rate than last 
year, about in line with the nation. However, employment measured in 
the household survey for Illinois and Michigan fell in May for the 
third straight month. Chicago-area purchasing managers reporting 
increased production in May continued to outnumber those noting 
declines, but by a smaller margin than since early 1987, and orders 
and backlogs slipped. Motor vehicle sales below last year's pace, 
despite attractive buyer incentives, have prompted limited 
production cuts. Markets for many types of industrial machinery 
still appear strong, though weakening has been reported in some 
equipment markets, including light construction equipment, 
communications equipment, and some other electronic types. 
Industrial construction is strong in the region. Office construction 
continues at a brisk pace in downtown Chicago. Recent rains have 
improved crop prospects in most District states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand continues vigorous in many industrial equipment markets. 
Orders for industrial diesels, for applications other than in large 
trucks, are described as strong in domestic markets and for export, 
except from manufacturers of light construction equipment, 
reflecting the slowdown in housing construction. Demand at producers 
of highway construction equipment was characterized as very strong. 
Robust orders have been reported recently at foundries, metal 
fabricators, and machinery builders. Incoming orders for machine 
tools have slipped, particularly from foreign buyers, but backlogs 
remain far above year-earlier levels. One large machine tool builder 
expects its order backlog to support continued increases in 
shipments in this year's second half. Orders have weakened for 
communications equipment and some other electronic types.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of construction in the District continue to show a 
relatively robust pace of activity. For example, year-over-year 
increases in shipments of cement and gypsum board to District states 
have been larger than nationwide (though this partly reflects the 
mild January weather in the region). Strong demand for downtown 
Chicago office space and relatively few completions of new buildings 
this year have lowered the vacancy rate (as defined in two recent 
surveys) to less than 10%, encouraging plans for additional 
buildings. The market for Chicago-area industrial property is also 
strong. In Detroit, ground was broken recently for a $1 billion auto 
assembly plant, a replacement for an aging plant. Preliminary site 
work is very strong for office buildings and industrial facilities 
in the Milwaukee area. Construction activity on houses is said to be 
holding up well around Chicago but sales of existing homes slipped 
this spring as mortgage interest rates climbed above 11 percent. 
Rates typically offered on 30-year fixed-rate loans have since 
fallen to a 10 percent to 10-1/4 percent range, and below 10 percent 
at some area lenders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of motor vehicles continue to trail year-ago levels despite 
recently enhanced incentives which a contact described as the most 
attractive for buyers in at least 2-1/2 years. Extended model 
changeover shutdowns have been announced for some District assembly 
plants; another plant was recently shut for one week to control 
inventories; and a planned start-up of a second shift at a car 
assembly plant was cancelled. But overall production cutbacks have 
been modest. Heavy truck plants have been running close to effective 
capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel demand continues strong. A Chicago-area integrated mill is 
hiring summer help, for the first time in about a decade, to cut 
excess overtime of regular employees. However, there have also been 
reports recently of some slippage in orders, perhaps only seasonal. 
Steelmakers have announced additional large investments, including 
another new plant to be built in Indiana and major upgrading of an 
existing facility in that state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A contact described retail sales recently as satisfactory, but 
generally less so than earlier this year. Cooler weather may have 
deterred some retail sales in the Midwest in May. This retailer 
viewed consumer spending as supported by good income gains this 
year, but indicated concern about surveys showing increased consumer 
pessimism regarding inflation, interest rates, and home buying 
prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Early season crop prospects over most of the District have benefited 
considerably from recent rains. In Indiana, however, the rains have 
further delayed the wind-down of the planting season and stressed 
some early-planted crops. Late spring frosts apparently caused some 
fruit and vegetable losses in Michigan. While no official 
tabulations have been made, some observers characterize the losses 
as "less than expected."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor market conditions show considerable diversity. 
Unemployment has declined in the District, as utilization of labor 
resources has pressed against available supply in many areas. 
Unskilled industrial labor, for example, is in tight supply in 
Chicago's western suburbs, and pay levels have been pushed upward, 
squeezing profits of employers competing with firms in lower labor-
cost areas. The seemingly chronic shortage of some industrial 
skills, such as experienced welders and machinists, may have been 
exacerbated by the industrial upturn of the past 2 years. Employers 
in local areas where labor is tight—parts of Indiana, for example—are advertising for skilled workers in areas where there were 
sizable lay-offs a few years ago. Job-hopping in pursuit of higher 
pay reportedly has increased. But employers in some industries 
continue to press for concessions, indicating a willingness to shut 
facilities or replace striking workers in order to bring down labor 
costs, in some cases citing costs at competitors. Industries in the 
District in which this has been taking place include auto parts 
manufacturing, grocery stores, and truck transport. Jobs remain hard 
to find in some white-collar occupations. Staffing cutbacks or 
curtailments on hiring continue in response to, or to stave off the 
threat of, corporate reorganizations.
