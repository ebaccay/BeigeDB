      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 16, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy showed some gains since the last 
report. January retail sales were mixed, but a decided improvement 
was noted in February. While residential construction was seasonally 
slack, a pick-up in office leasing was noted in several areas. Some 
improvement also occurred in District business activity. Most small 
and mid-sized banks report a noticeable slowdown in IRA deposits for 
this time of year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of sales at District department stores was mixed during 
January as consumer spending ranged from somewhat below to 
considerably above retailers' expectations. However, a decided 
improvement was noted in February by those stores reporting early 
results, and one respondent characterized the month as "unbelievably 
good".
     </p>
     <p>
      Foreign visitors utilizing their stronger currencies are still 
mentioned as one factor bolstering District spending; another factor 
is the health of its economy relative to areas with oil and farm 
debt problems. Items for which there was good demand during January 
were most types of apparel, jewelry and accessories; February's 
sales gains resulted from consumer buying across a wide spectrum of 
merchandise. As a result of both the recent strength in sales and a 
conscious effort to monitor stocks, retailers report inventories 
ranging from well below desired levels to on plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some improvement occurred in the District's economic expansion in 
recent weeks. More than one-third of the purchasing managers in the 
Buffalo and Rochester surveys reported that general business 
conditions were better in January, up from 25 percent in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall employment has grown in the District, though the 
manufacturing sector continues to decline. The February unemployment 
rates of 4.1 percent in New Jersey and 4.9 percent in New York were 
the lowest since the early '70s and are well below the national 
average. Moreover, the over-the-year reduction in the New York and 
New Jersey rates was three times the national decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent announcements point to a mixed impact on the District's 
economy. On the one hand, G.M.'s decision to produce its new mini-vans in Westchester County will secure several thousand jobs there 
for a number of years. On the other hand, several other long-established firms plan to curtail or phase out operations with a 
resultant loss of many jobs. In addition, while central New York 
will gain hundreds of jobs as the result of a recent merger, Buffalo 
and northern New Jersey will lose at least the same number due to 
that same consolidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction has been seasonally slack, but homebuilders 
in most areas continue to anticipate considerable demand for new 
homes in 1987. Plans for several new types of housing development 
have been announced in recent weeks. In downtown Stamford, 
Connecticut, where until now only new office building has been 
undertaken, construction of the first high-rise condominium is to 
begin this summer. In Newark, New Jersey the mayor recently signed a 
contract for the construction of 650 moderately-priced townhouses, 
the largest addition to that city's housing stock in decades. 
Finally, in New York City several programs are planned or underway 
to provide new middle and low income housing. Since a shortage of 
affordable housing is increasingly being mentioned as a deterrent to 
further economic growth in the New York metropolitan area, these new 
undertakings should help in this regard.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pick-up in office leasing activity was noted in several parts of 
the District during recent weeks, and with the continued slowdown in 
new construction projects, lower vacancy rates are anticipated in a 
number of areas. Westchester, for example, reports strong demand for 
both large and small blocks of space in its new buildings, while in 
Manhattan some observers expect the office vacancy rate to decline 
to 9 or 10 percent in 1987 from its 10 to 13 percent range last 
year. Elsewhere in the District, industrial space is reported in 
short supply in northern New Jersey, particularly in areas near New 
York City or major highways, and prices of land and buildings have 
risen sharply. Upstate New York expects 1987 to be a busy year for 
nonresidential construction as the result of congressional 
appropriations for extensive expansion and renovation of three 
military bases in the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most small and mid-sized banks in the Second District report that 
there has been a noticeable slowdown in IRA deposits from the usual 
inflow at this time of year. Most of the banks surveyed indicated 
that the decline stems from confusion concerning the impact of the 
new tax law, and the low interest earned on IRA deposits. Many bank 
customers are unaware that there is still time to make an IRA 
deposit and claim a deduction for the 1986 tax year. In addition, 
others have reservations about making the investment because of 
concerns about the future impact of the tax law on money already 
placed in IRAs. One of the banks indicated that some of its own 
officers were not well informed about the implications of the tax 
reform, and were reluctant to suggest IRAs as an investment. Most 
banks added that these problems have been compounded by the current 
low interest rates available on IRA deposits and restrictions 
concerning withdrawal of these funds. All of the banks indicated 
that uncertainty concerning the tax law and the low level of 
interest rates would have an even more striking impact on the surge 
of activity which usually occurs as the April 15 deadline nears.
