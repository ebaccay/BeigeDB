      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 22, 1992
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Tenth District economy still appears to be growing slowly but 
unevenly. Retail sales are up modestly, with Christmas sales 
apparently somewhat better than a year ago. Housing activity also 
continues to improve. But signals from the manufacturing sector are 
mixed, auto sales are down, and energy activity is slackening. 
Moreover, the farm sector has retreated somewhat from its recent 
peak performances. Prices generally remain steady both at retail and 
for many manufacturers' inputs. Most retailers are satisfied with 
current inventory levels, while manufacturers are striving to reduce 
their inventories of materials and other inputs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have improved slightly over the past month, with 
apparel sales accounting for much of the improvement. Sales were 
generally weak, however, with Christmas sales up only modestly from 
last year. Just a slight improvement in sales is anticipated this 
year. Retailers report stable prices over the past month and expect 
small price increases in 1992. Most retailers are satisfied with 
current inventory levels and expect little change in the coming 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales declined slightly in the district over the last month. 
Some potential buyers still find it difficult to get loans due to 
tighter credit standards. While automobile dealers expect sales to 
begin picking up in the next few months, most of them are still 
trimming inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report mixed price changes. The prices of metals 
and fuel have fallen, while the prices of some manufactured 
components have increased. Agents expect prices to remain stable for 
the next few months. Materials are readily available. Most firms 
have been trimming inventories and plan further reductions. Plants 
are generally operating below capacity. Exports have risen in recent 
months, especially for firms with markets in Mexico and South 
America.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity in the district has weakened recently due mainly to 
falling oil prices and an outlook for soft prices throughout the 
year ahead. The average number of operating drilling rigs in 
district states decreased from 237 in November to 228 in December. 
The December rig count was 33 percent below its year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing starts in most areas of the district increased somewhat from 
the previous month and were much higher than a year ago. Builders 
expect starts to increase further in the first quarter of l992 and 
in the year as a whole. The prices of some building materials, 
especially lumber, have increased. Sales of new homes are higher 
than a year ago, with prices higher in some district areas but 
unchanged in others. According to most survey participants, 
inventories of new homes are below normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most district thrift institutions report deposit outflows during 
recent months. Respondents expect outflows to continue at a steady 
pace over coming months because of low rates on deposits. Mortgage 
rates have dropped at least 100 basis points over the past three 
months but are expected to level off in coming months. Mortgage 
demand and commitments are strong due largely to refinancing. 
Respondents expect mortgage demand to remain strong during coming 
months, due to both refinancing and new home purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Changes in total loan demand were mixed last month, with half of the 
respondents reporting no change and equal numbers of the remaining 
respondents reporting increases and decreases. Demand for home 
mortgages rose, while demand for consumer loans, construction loans, 
and commercial real estate loans were flat to down. Loan-to-deposit 
ratios were generally unchanged from the previous month but lower 
than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      All respondents reduced their prime rates last month and almost all 
expect to leave these rates unchanged in the near future. More than 
half of the respondents also reduced their consumer lending rates 
last month, and a few expect to lower rates further in the near 
future. Lending standards were unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposits increased at most reporting banks. Increases in demand 
deposits, NOW accounts, and MMDAs outweighed decreases in large CDs 
and small time deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After a poor start, the winter wheat crop has improved due to recent 
widespread precipitation. The crop's condition is now average to 
above average in most areas. More moisture is needed to ensure 
further crop development due to dry subsoil conditions in parts of 
the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Yearend credit reviews for district farm borrowers showed little 
change from a year ago in the number of problem loans. But credit 
reviews did reveal a growing disparity between livestock and crop 
borrowers. Bankers report that some livestock producers struggled to 
repay loans as cattle and hog prices slumped in the last half of 
1991, while crop farmers benefited from rising wheat prices. Bankers 
expect the divergence in crop and livestock incomes to continue in 
1992. Nevertheless, bankers expect only a slight increase in problem 
loans overall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers expect farm loan demand to be steady in 1992. Demand for 
livestock loans may fall, while demand for wheat operating loans may 
edge up as farmers take advantage of higher wheat prices. A few 
banks report increased demand for real estate loans as nonfarm 
investors move funds our of certificates of deposits to purchase 
farmland.
