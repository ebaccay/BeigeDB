      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's economy continues to be soft and uneven. The 
unemployment rate remains high and manufacturing employment shows no 
improvement. Retail sales increases are moderate. Auto dealers 
report a recent sales surge from cut rate financing but overall see 
some downtrend in sales volume. Manufacturing activity is strong in 
auto- and defense-related sectors but generally weak elsewhere. 
Current strength in housing activity is expected to wane as the year 
progresses. Bank loan demand has softened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment remains high and manufacturing employment remains soft. 
Ohio's civilian unemployment rate fell 0.8 percentage points in 
August but is still 9.1 percent. The employment-to-population ratio 
rose. In manufacturing, almost as many firms report layoffs as 
report callbacks and new hires.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retailers express satisfaction and little surprise 
in July-August sales. Major department stores report that sales of 
almost all goods continue to increase moderately along expected 
trends. Back-to-school sales have been slightly stronger than usual, 
helping to boost otherwise sluggish sales of nondurables. After some 
mid-summer weakness, durables sales have strengthened in the 
District, with appliance sales described as the firmest component. 
With nearly optimal inventories, retailers do not expect to engage 
in extraordinary discounting during the remainder of the year. They 
expect demand to continue at or near present growth rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers report a surge of sales in response to reduced 
financing rates, but looking at a longer period they see sales on a 
slight downtrend. This held especially for domestic dealers who say 
that Japanese competition is becoming a more important factor. Some 
domestic dealers express concern over high inventories and may 
significantly reduce factory orders for the rest of 1985. Some 
Japanese-make dealers are actually low on inventories, although they 
too have noticed a slowdown in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues to be sluggish. On balance, 
contacts indicate production and new orders are increasing very 
slowly. Inventories of raw materials and finished goods are being 
cut. Most manufacturers continue to report that import competition 
is making it very difficult to impose price increases. None of our 
contacts have yet seen any impact on their business from the 
depreciation of the dollar. A producer of road-building materials 
reports orders are strong and are expected to remain so because fuel 
tax increases are financing extensive road repairs. Contacts report 
sales of chemicals are soft. A producer of parts for heavy trucks 
reports production cutbacks because of order weakness, which the 
firm expects to continue into 1986. The weakness reflects slackening 
of capital spending rather than import competition. Parts demand for 
light trucks, which are more consumer- than business-oriented, 
continues to do well. Firms associated with the auto industry assert 
that the recent new car sales spurt is borrowing from future sales 
and the producers are unlikely to increase their production 
schedules. Some suppliers believe that auto production may be cut 
back later this year unless the major producers offer sales 
incentives again later in the year. A tire producer reports sales at 
replacement tires continue to run below year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major 
  steel producer reports orders are getting weaker in the third 
  quarter and bookings for the quarter are especially weak. Steel 
  price pressures are intensifying as domestic producers compete 
  aggressively to regain market shares. Steel users are cutting 
  inventories because the economic outlook is uncertain and because 
  low capacity utilization by steel producers assures customers at 
  rapid delivery. A machine tool producer reports sales are up from a 
  year ago but by only a half to a third as much as is usually 
  associated with this stage at an economic expansion. The firm says 
  its machine tool orders are still less than half of the peak level 
  reached in 1979. Machine tool orders are strong from the auto and 
  defense industries and weak elsewhere.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Market participants agree that housing activity will deteriorate as 
the year progresses. They attribute the current strength of housing 
and mortgage markets to the lagged effects of lower mortgage rates 
and Ohio-subsidized mortgage funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       A regional builder in the District reports a third consecutive month 
of strong ordering and heavy traffic by potential buyers. Most 
builders refuse to take the risk of speculative building because 
they are uncertain about the economy's direction. One builder 
asserts home buyers are not responding to lower mortgage rates 
because they are increasingly uncertain about whether the current 
economic expansion will continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       A large mortgage lender reports exceptionally strong closings in 
August. The firm attributes most of the higher loan volume to 
availability of Ohio-subsidized mortgage funds. Some lenders find 
customers are considering only fixed-rate mortgages because of the 
small gap between fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages and because 
of view that fixed rates may have reached a low point.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Loan demand appears to have weakened at District banks in recent 
weeks. Total loans outstanding at large banks fell slightly over the 
past month due largely to a decline in commercial and industrial 
loans. Contacts generally acknowledge the weakness in business 
lending and they anticipate continued flatness in business loan 
demand. On the consumer side, installment loans outstanding are 
rising at a rapid pace but slower than in previous months. Contacts 
expect consumer loan demand to remain quite good.
