      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 27, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity continues to expand in the Seventh District, 
restrained by the slowdown in the auto industry. Chicago purchasing 
managers report vigorous growth in September, accompanied by further 
price increases, and are optimistic about the outlook for business 
activity over the next six months. Milwaukee purchasers see further 
strengthening, particularly in orders and backlogs, with some hedge 
buying thought to be taking place to beat rising raw materials 
prices. The impact of auto production cuts, in response to slow 
sales, has been particularly sharp in southeast Michigan, and 
further cutbacks are planned by year-end. Nonresidential 
construction has remained relatively strong in the District. 
Residential building in the District is also outpacing the national 
demand for steel has shown the most broadly based strength since 
1981. Consumer spending reports are mixed. The District's corn and 
soybean harvests are ahead of the usual pace. Pork production is 
expected to rise through 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The strike at Chrysler Canada, settled after 6 days, halted 
production at one District plant and reduced output at another for 
one to two weeks. However, agreements were reached on contracts at 
Ford in the U.S. and Canada and at GM in the U.S. with no 
interruption of output. Although third quarter sales incentives and 
production cuts brought car inventories down substantially, the 
restrained response of buyers to the incentives is a source of 
concern for the fourth quarter. Truck sales continue strong, but the 
District's share of U.S. truck assemblies is considerably smaller 
than its share of cars. In September, a southeast Michigan truck 
assembly plant eliminated its second shift, indefinitely laying off 
2,000. Closings of two motor vehicle plants in southeast Michigan 
are planned by year-end. In contrast, a Japanese car assembly plant 
began production in September in that area. Two more assembly plants 
are being constructed in Illinois and Indiana. Heavy truck sales 
remain well above last year's pace, and also well above long-run 
replacement needs according to an industry analyst. Further small 
increases in sales of medium and heavy trucks are projected for 
1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of nonresidential construction continues relatively 
vigorous in the District. Contracts for nonresidential buildings, in 
square feet, were 10 percent above a year earlier in the District 
states during this year's first 8 months. Contracts for construction 
projects other than buildings, in dollars, were 15 percent higher. 
Construction activity continues at a high level in downtown Chicago. 
Additional large office buildings have recently been announced. 
Office construction has slowed in Chicago suburbs but remains at a 
high level, and light industrial building has picked up. Plans for 
auto parts plants have been announced for Illinois and Michigan to 
supply new Japanese assembly plants. Paving activity is expected to 
be strong in parts of the District this fall. Sections of the large 
construction project at O'Hare Airport are being pushed to 
completion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The strength in steel demand is described as the most broadly based, 
in terms of product types, since 1981. Steel buyers and service 
centers reportedly are trying without success to add to stocks, 
reflecting demand for some types of steel near production capacity, 
and uneconomic mills not reopened or being renovated. Prices have 
been raised for most types of finished steel. Sharply higher prices 
for steel scrap reflect shortages at Chicago-area mills which have 
been buying scrap from other steel districts. Steel imports are 
expected to decline. Mills producing for the auto industry are 
booked to year-end and running behind schedule.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Markets have improved considerably for abrasives and other "low-
tech" products widely used in industry. Demand in the Midwest 
continues strong for paperboard. A box price increase went into 
effect in September with little resistance. Reflecting relatively 
good construction markets in the Midwest, cement shipments to 
District states have shown stronger gains from a year ago than the 
nation. Shipments of electrical equipment for installation in 
nonresidential buildings are expected to be strong in the fourth 
quarter. Export markets for large construction equipment remain 
restrained by the limited number of big projects around the world. A 
home appliance maker and a producer of ball bearings are shifting 
production out of the District to plants in other states with lower 
labor costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Sales and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential building permits in District states during the first 8 
months of 1987 were about even with a year earlier, but have been 
below last year since April. Contacts reported an upturn in Chicago-
area home buying and loan applications in August, prior to the 
September round of mortgage interest rate increases which appears to 
have pushed activity down again. The August rise was attributed to 
action by former "fence sitters" who had delayed buying and 
financing decisions following the spring upturn in mortgage interest 
rates. Mortgage interest rate volatility is viewed as more of a 
problem than somewhat higher but stable interest rates, because 
interest rate uncertainty causes would-be buyers and sellers to 
wait. Chicago-area mortgage interest rates have risen further over 
the past month, with 30-year fixed-rate loans commonly quoted at 
rates of 11 percent or higher. Sources also report an upturn in the 
number of Chicago-area mortgage bankers looking for jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A large retail chain reports that sales in Illinois and Michigan 
remain fairly high, up from earlier this year. Iowa, which had been 
weak, continues to show improvement. Another large retailer located 
in the District indicated sizable sales gains from low year-ago 
levels, but not much strength in the seasonally adjusted trend in 
recent months. Gains from a year ago in apparel sales reflect in 
part the sharp rise in prices of imported clothing. Appliance sales 
were reported strong in September at this retailer, after showing 
less strength in July and August, but have tailed off in early 
October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The fall harvest continues at a rapid pace in District states. Some 
63 percent of the soybean acreage and 43 percent of the corn acreage 
had been harvested as of October 4, two to three times the normal 
progress for that date. Pork production which turned above year-
earlier levels in the third quarter, will likely record sizable 
gains throughout 1988. Hog numbers in the ten major producing states 
are up 9 percent from a year ago and producer intentions point to an 
8 percent rise in farrowings over the next six months. Somewhat 
larger increases are reported for Iowa, but the gains for Illinois 
and Indiana are smaller than elsewhere.
