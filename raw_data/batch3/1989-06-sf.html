      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of growth in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District continues 
to be healthy, with mixed signals regarding a possible slowing rate 
of growth. Despite the relatively good condition of the District's 
economy, two thirds of the business leaders contacted expect 
weakening national growth during the next four quarters. Consumer 
spending growth is reported to be healthy overall, despite weakness 
in sales of "big ticket" items such as cars, furniture, and home 
electronics. Manufacturing activity continues to be robust, with 
bottlenecks and tight raw materials supplies reported in several 
sectors. However, some early signs of falling export orders have 
emerged. Agricultural activity also is strong overall, despite 
rising prices for many inputs. Lumber production is falling as log 
supplies continue to tighten, but capacity continues tight at many 
paper mills. Real estate markets are strong in the coastal states, 
although a few respondents note heightened concerns or slowing 
activity associated with relatively high interest rates. In Arizona, 
however, commercial and residential real estate markets continue to 
languish. Most western banks report solid loan demand, while many 
banks are raising rates on certificates of deposit to attract 
sufficient funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Two thirds of the western business leaders contacted expect GNP 
growth to be weaker than its historical average during the next four 
quarters, although very few anticipate a recession. Most of the 
remaining third expect GNP growth close to its average pace. 
District business leaders still expect performance in the business 
investment and home-building sectors to weaken slightly during the 
next year, although they are more upbeat about these sectors than 
they were in the previous survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continues to grow at a healthy pace. Nevertheless, 
several respondents report a moderating rate of growth, which they 
attribute primarily to relative weakness in sales of such "big 
ticket" items as furniture and home electronics. Some retailers have 
expressed concern that inventories have gotten too heavy, while 
others report no inventory problems. Prices and wages are reported 
to be relatively stable, with prices held down in part by the recent 
increase in the value of the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many respondents report weak car sales, although sales in some parts 
of the District are strong. No upward price pressure is evident, as 
incentives are required to keep sales volumes up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bottlenecks continue in the commercial aircraft industry. Supplies 
are difficult to obtain, skilled labor is in short supply, and 
commercial aircraft ordered today cannot be delivered for about four 
years. Industry participants assert that these bottlenecks are 
putting upward pressure on Seattle-area wages and on materials 
prices. One aerospace executive reports that his firm's contracts 
with European and Japanese suppliers are priced in those nations' 
currencies, so the recent increase in the dollar's value has reduced 
his costs. In contrast, the cutbacks in defense spending are 
beginning to affect some California firms. One firm recently 
announced layoffs, and the competition for engineers reportedly has 
diminished.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heavy machinery is selling well, with reports of increases in sales 
volumes of 10 to 15 percent above last year's levels. Some 
manufacturers report that material costs have risen 5 to 12 percent, 
due primarily to higher costs for aluminum, stainless steel and 
brass. One respondent notes persistent shortages of titanium dioxide 
and ethylene glycol, important raw materials for paints and 
coatings. List prices for paints and coatings have increased about 5 
percent, but price increases negotiated for large projects are 
closer to 1 or 2 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      A California banker reports that some customers in Japan are 
starting to cancel orders for U.S.-made manufactured goods. Some of 
these customers have been faced with price increases of about 21 
percent (5 percent reflecting US inflation and 16 percent due to 
currency changes). Other Japanese customers are asking for price 
reductions, but because most American companies' profit margins are 
too small to make sizable price concessions, they are opting to 
forgo some export business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture generally continues healthy, although the costs of 
interest, machinery, fuel, fertilizer, and feed grains remain 
relatively high. Few changes in exports due to the higher dollar 
have been noted as yet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Environmental and legal issues are combining with strong log exports 
to restrict log supplies and reduce lumber production. Capacity 
continues tight at most paper mills. However, new newsprint 
production capacity and soft newsprint demand have forced producers 
to back down from planned price increases this year, and one 
negotiated discount reduced the effective price by 3.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reports suggest that California's real estate markets continue 
strong. Smaller California cities have not seen the 20 percent 
increases in home prices common in larger cities, but construction 
activity continues strong. However, relatively high interest rates 
reportedly have caused builders to become more cautious about 
committing to new projects. The limited supply of commercial 
buildings in the San Francisco Bay Area is causing values to 
escalate at about a 5 percent annual rate. In Southern California, a 
developer reports that commercial construction activity continues at 
a strong pace, although leasing activity has slowed during the past 
year. Most reports from Washington and Oregon indicate that real 
estate markets in the Northwest also are strong. Home prices are 
reported up, with strong construction activity as well. In contrast, 
reports from Arizona indicate that land values there continue to 
drop, and sales of commercial real estate are deeply discounted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most western banks report strong profits, with solid loan demand 
despite relatively high interest rates. Some bankers report 
increased demand for commercial loans. Several bankers report 
reduced balances held in checking accounts, passbook savings, and 
money market deposit accounts. The combination of strong loan demand 
and reduced deposits is leading banks to raise rates on certificates 
of deposit in order to attract sufficient funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only a few respondents report that high interest rates have limited 
borrowing activity. In Oregon, for example, small businesses 
reportedly are borrowing less or not at all, choosing to postpone 
capital equipment purchases or expensive acquisitions rather than 
pay the high rates.
