      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1991
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District respondents believe that the recession in both the nation 
and the Fourth District is about over, although they still expect a 
slow recovery. Auto and nonautomotive retailers note a strengthening 
in sales during May, but are still cautious about near-term sales 
prospects. Manufacturing output also appears to have bottomed, and 
respondents are generally more optimistic about second-half 
prospects than they were earlier this year. Demand for and 
construction of new housing appears to be increasing slowly this 
spring. There are only scattered signs of a step-up in commercial 
loans, and banks generally report that mortgage loans, excluding 
refinancings, have been increasing only slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       National Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A panel of Fourth District economists expects that recession will 
end in the second quarter. They expect virtually no change in real 
GNP from last quarter, with growth at about a 2.5% annual rate in 
the second half of 1991 and about 3.5% between 1991:IVQ and 
1992:IVQ.
     </p>
     <p>
      These economists are less optimistic about prospects for inflation 
now than they were in January. Overall prices are expected to 
increase at an annual rate of 3.7% in the second half of 1991, and 
at nearly that rate through the end of 1992. These forecasts are 
about half a percentage point higher than the panel had anticipated 
in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Economy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There are mixed signs of recovery from the brief contraction in the 
District. In May, employment in Ohio rose slightly for the third 
straight month, and the unemployment rate fell below the national 
average for the first time since February. Also, manufacturing 
production declined only slightly more in Ohio than in the nation 
last quarter, after having outperformed the nation throughout 1990. 
Much of the decline was in auto and auto-related industries. 
District respondents expect that auto output will gradually 
strengthen by late this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers remain cautious about prospects despite the generally 
improved level of sales in May. Although most report weather-related 
increases in sales, they are skeptical that this represents a rising 
trend because there was no pickup in household furnishings. Despite 
a mixed pattern of sales so far this year, retailers believe that 
inventories are at about desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automakers and dealers expect only a gradual improvement in sales 
throughout the balance of this year, despite the May increase in 
sales. Although inventories are lower than usual for this time of 
year, orders and production schedules for 1992 model cars are being 
held close to actual sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District panelists are more optimistic about prospects for 
recovery in production than they were earlier in the year. They now 
expect a second-half rebound in production at about a 4.5% annual 
rate, led especially by a swing in inventories between the first 
quarter and fourth quarter of this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto analysts, however, believe that most of that industry's 
contribution to overall output growth will likely occur in the 
second quarter. Inventories of trucks are still reported to be 
excessive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel respondents also expect little change in production from the 
recent 70% operating rate. Some expect a gradual improvement in 
domestic steel markets to be offset by softening in export markets. 
Correction of steel inventories is said to be nearly complete, and 
warehouse centers are apparently beginning to step up orders, but 
are hesitant to restock because prices might continue to slide. Some 
respondents note an erratic but small pickup in orders from auto and 
appliance producers, but not much change from capital goods 
producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods respondents expect that most of those industries are 
close to a trough at present. Orders for heavy-duty trucks 
apparently have emerged from a first-quarter slump, according to a 
supplier, with successive monthly increases in April and May. Orders 
for industrial controls show signs of bottoming. An industrial 
equipment supplier reports that his order decline has also leveled 
out, but no signs of a pickup are yet apparent. An office and 
machinery equipment producer cites a significant upturn in 
electronic components, although office computer machinery is still 
in recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The flurry of mortgage loan activity and housing sales earlier this 
year subsided in May for some mortgage lenders, but continued strong 
for others. Some report that demand for refinancing also slowed 
after an unusually strong first quarter. Mortgage lending terms have 
been relatively unchanged for the past several months. A major 
lender in the Cleveland market, however, states that May was one of 
its best months for mortgage loans, in part because of increases in 
market share for single-family home loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several lenders report more activity for existing home sales than 
for new homes. In some parts of the District, lack of demand and 
builder caution have dampened a rise in new home starts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers generally report that commercial and industrial loans have 
remained flat or have risen only slightly since the beginning of 
spring. In some areas, however, small business loans have picked up 
in recent weeks. Mortgage loans have continued to strengthen, but 
some banks report that at least half of the loans have been for 
refinancing, and that the spring pickup for new loans so far has not 
been strong. Consumer installment loans continue to increase 
irregularly. Bankers report no important changes in lending terms or 
in lending standards in recent weeks, and generally assert that 
there are ample funds available for creditworthy borrowers and projects.
