      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District was adversely affected by 
weather in February, as it was in late January, but business 
contacts generally retained positive opinions about underlying 
conditions. Despite interrupted production schedules, industrial 
firms reported an increase in shipments. Retailers, however, 
suffered significantly; many merchants and auto dealers indicated 
that sales for January were off as much as 20 percent from the prior 
year, and that results in February were not much better. Bankers 
generally reported declines in outstanding loan volumes for both 
business and consumer lending, although several said this was 
largely seasonal. Realtors indicated that the demand for homes seems 
to be on the rise, although recent bad weather had seriously 
hampered sales. The weather also delayed construction, but the 
recent trend was reported to be rising somewhat for homes but flat 
for most types of commercial buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, most of the contacts surveyed for this report have 
positive views. Manufacturers predict further gains in shipments and 
orders in the next six months. Retailers and auto dealers believe 
sales will resume an upward trend as spring approaches. Bankers look 
for a pickup in consumer lending and modest gains In business 
lending. Realtors are optimistic that home sales will continue to 
increase. They look for further growth in demand for industrial 
space but very little improvement, overall, in office markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported in February that activity 
continued to move up, on balance. Half of those surveyed said 
business was steady, while nearly four-in-ten said business was 
increasing. Positive reports predominated in most of the major 
industrial sectors in the region, with the exceptions of food 
processing and apparel. More firms in those sectors reported 
declines in orders or shipments than reported increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Winter storms in January and February affected many of the region's 
manufacturing firms. The inability of employees to get to work on 
several days restricted production. Also, although shipments by area 
firms rose, many reported transportation delays that prevented some 
shipments of their products and their ability to receive some 
inputs. Consequently, many firms were unable to meet production 
goals and they had unplanned buildups of finished goods inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, manufacturers of durable goods expect to make up the 
lost production. Conversely, some makers of consumer nondurables 
think that sales lost at retail outlets during the period of bad 
weather will not be recouped. Looking further ahead, around half of 
the manufacturers contacted for this report forecast increases in 
orders and shipments over the next six months while only one-in-ten 
anticipate decreases. On balance, area industrial firms expect the 
increase in shipments to reduce inventories. Their employment plans, 
however, call for keeping work forces at current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District retailers contacted in late February said 
sales for the months of January and February were adversely affected 
by winter storms and persistent difficult driving conditions that 
forced store closings and hampered shoppers getting to stores when 
they were open. Many merchants estimated that their sales for 
January were off as much as 20 percent from the sane month a year 
ago and that sales were down in February also. Auto dealers reported 
similar results. As a result of the falloff in sales, store 
executives said inventories were above desired levels, although most 
merchants said the overstocking was not extreme.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District merchants are generally optimistic that sales will 
pick up for all lines of merchandise as spring approaches. Several 
said they believe a trend to higher levels of purchasing by 
consumers is underway and that retail sales will move up when 
extreme winter weather abates. Auto dealers also believe the basic 
sales trend is upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers reported in February that loan volumes 
outstanding had declined from the beginning of the year, which they 
attributed mainly to seasonal factors. Both outstanding commercial 
and consumer loan volumes were declining in February as payoffs 
exceeded new lending. Residential real estate lending was somewhat 
more stable as purchase mortgages were rising while refinancings 
were falling.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several bankers noted that new business lending was poised to rise 
as the number of loan agreements being written by their banks was 
picking up, but they believe the increase in outstanding commercial 
and industrial loan volume will be modest. Some bankers also expect 
consumer lending to rise as the post-Christmas payoff period comes 
to an end and consumer spending picks up again. They pointed to 
recent increases in auto financing as an indication of this trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District realtors reported that homes sales in January and 
February were off substantially from the same months a year ago, due 
to heavy snowfalls and icy road conditions that hampered sales 
efforts. Otherwise, realtors generally said the sales trend has been 
strong since the fall, and that inquiries from prospective buyers 
continued without interruption during the periods of bad weather. 
Several realtors noted that there is a growing demand for homes in 
the higher price ranges and that "move-up" buyers are joining first-
time home buyers in boosting overall demand. Nonetheless, realtors 
also indicated that the inventory of homes for sale, while down from 
last year, is still relatively high. end they expect this situation 
to restrain increases in home prices during most of 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors active in office markets indicated that demand for space 
was flat in central Philadelphia but up slightly in most suburban 
areas. According to surveys by area realtors, the office vacancy 
rate in central Philadelphia has been steady at approximately 16 
percent while vacancy rates in the suburbs have been edging down and 
ranged from 13 to 25 percent as 1994 began. Effective rental rates 
have been easing in Philadelphia but are nearly steady in the 
suburbs. Realtors said many companies in central Philadelphia have 
under-used space as a result of past downsizing and will not be in 
the market for more space soon. In the suburbs, realtors said, there 
could be an increase in demand for space by year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity of all kinds was interrupted by the weather 
throughout the Third District in January and February. The trend in 
commercial construction remains weak, but some homebuilders have 
seen recent increases in contracts for new homes. Commercial 
realtors note that the growing demand for industrial space could 
lead to some new construction and renovation work toward the end of 
the year, and they say that demand for office space in some suburban 
markets might result in the beginning of some new buildings later in 
the year as well.
