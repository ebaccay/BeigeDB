      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1989
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall economic conditions in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District 
continue healthy, although the pace of growth appears to have slowed 
from that seen earlier this year. Retail sales growth is 
satisfactory but not robust, with weakness in "big-ticket" items 
including automobiles. Manufacturing activity continues healthy, 
with strength in commercial aircraft and relatively slow growth in 
electronics. Most western fruit and vegetable producers are having a 
good year, although concerns about food safety have hurt sales of 
apples and table grapes. Log shortages in the Pacific Northwest have 
resulted in higher prices for lumber and wood chips. Construction 
and real estate activity continue healthy in most parts of the 
District, with some cooling noted in California, while the market is 
heating up in the Seattle area. Western bankers report strong loan 
demand, but slow deposit growth and stiff competition for deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District business leaders polled during July expect the 
economy's growth rate to slow during the next year. Almost three 
quarters of those questioned expect GNP to grow more slowly during 
the next year than its 2 1/2 to 3 percent historical rate. A 
majority of respondents foresee weakness during the next four 
quarters in consumer spending, business investment, and housing 
starts. Over half expect the inflation rate to fall during the next 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales at most department stores are reported to be satisfactory, not 
especially strong but strong enough that retailers are not 
particularly concerned. However, uncertainty about the future of 
southern Oregon's lumber industry has caused a slump in retail sales 
there. In recent months, District sales of women's apparel have 
improved, but the men's clothing market has weakened. Weak sales 
continue for "big-ticket" items, such as electronics, furniture, and 
appliances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales continue weak in most parts of the District, as rebate 
programs have not yet reduced excessive inventories to acceptable 
levels. One banker notes that many customers attracted by the 
discount programs cannot obtain financing due to their poor credit 
histories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage trends in the trade and service industries are mixed. Retailers 
report some wage pressures, particularly at the low end, although 
one notes that these pressures are "manageable." A transportation 
services firm recently negotiated a new four-year contract that 
includes annual wage hikes of only 3 percent. However, wage 
pressures are intense in the health services. Nurses in several 
parts of the District are seeking double-digit wage increases in 
their new contracts, and strikes have begun at some hospitals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bottlenecks in the commercial aircraft industry seem to have 
stabilized, as gradual progress is being made on increased output. A 
Seattle-area avionics subcontractor reports "extensive" pressure on 
wages, while in southern California, the downturn in defense 
spending is releasing workers and making them available to support 
commercial production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some softness in orders for electronic components is reported. One 
manufacturer reports that his sales grew by 15 to 25 percent in each 
of the past three years, but growth currently is running at only a 3 
percent pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most western fruit and vegetable producers are having profitable 
years. Pacific Northwest food processors report that they have 
already booked 1989 orders that exceed 1988 totals. Most frozen 
fruits and vegetables are now in short supply, with inventories of 
frozen peas, green beans, and sweet corn the lowest in ten years. 
Prices of most processed vegetables have jumped 15 percent or more 
in the past year. Wet weather on the East Coast has hurt tomato 
production there, which has boosted California sales. However, grape 
and apple producers report declining sales which they attribute to 
concerns about safety. The inventory of unsold apples currently 
stands at a record 6.7 million boxes, double the amount a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Limited log supplies have boosted the prices of Northwest lumber 
products dramatically in recent months, despite reduced lumber 
demand. The price of a Northwest two-by-four rose 14 percent between 
the second quarter of 1988 and the second quarter of 1989. The 
reduced supply of timber also has doubled the price of wood chips, a 
key input to pulp and paper manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity continue strong in most parts 
of the Twelfth District. In California, the frenetic pace of the 
past year appears to have cooled somewhat, as fewer sales involve 
bidding wars. As a result, homes are staying on the market longer 
and prices are rising more slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the same time, Seattle's real estate market has taken off, with 
reports of double-digit annual price increases. Construction 
activity also is booming, and some contractors are so busy that they 
are declining opportunities to bid for new work.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most western bankers report strong loan demand and slow deposit 
growth. Many institutions report that their profits have risen in 
recent months. However, several bankers note that stiff competition 
for deposits is forcing them to raise deposit rates, so they expect 
profit margins to fall.
