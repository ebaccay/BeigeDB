      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Mixed signals have recently been received from key indicators of the 
Ninth District economy. While labor market conditions have continued 
to improve generally, most of the improvement has been seasonal. 
Some slackening of the pace of consumer spending has been noted 
throughout the district, although car sales and housing activity 
rose in some parts. The wood products sector is the only resource-
related industry reporting good news, while bad news is still the 
norm for agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions have continued to show improvement, although 
most improvement has been seasonal. The Ninth District's seasonally 
adjusted unemployment rate fell a bit in April to just under 6 
percent, despite a slight drop in seasonally adjusted employment. 
Also, the increase in April employment was less than normal in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. But April's unemployment rate in 
the Twin Cities dropped a little more than seasonally to only 4.2 
percent, and teenage unemployment there, at around 10 percent, is 
about as low as in any metro area in the nation. Normal seasonal 
employment increases were noted in South Dakota, dropping the 
state's unemployment rate to 5.1 percent and the Sioux Falls MSA's 
rate to 4.4 percent. This April's unemployment rate in North Dakota 
remained unchanged from last April's, at 6.4 percent. A Bank 
director notes that North Dakota's stagnation was primarily in the 
state's western part, which has been adversely affected by a 
curtailment of energy production projects. Bank directors report 
that Montana has been suffering from deteriorating conditions in its 
agricultural and resource-related sectors; the state's unemployment 
fell between March and April at less than the seasonal norm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some softening in the district's consumer purchases of general 
merchandise was noted in May and early June. One large retailer, 
noting that its April sales were better than expected, speculated 
that some of its normal May business may have instead come in April 
this year. By May's end, the retailer's year-to-date sales were up 
10 percent over last year's. Another large retailer found that large 
discounts were the only way to keep business brisk in May, curbing 
store profits. Furthermore, this retailer's inventories are still 
high and will have to be brought back in line by more discounts. 
Recreational clothing—particularly jogging togs—has been an 
excellent seller thanks to the unusually warm weather in the 
district's population centers. Bank directors concur that retail 
sales are generally flat-to-slowing throughout the district, with 
the possible exception of eastern South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Low-cost financing deals have propped up car sales into June. Two 
large domestic manufacturers have been left with low current 
inventories of trucks and cars. Both manufacturers have experienced 
year-to-date vehicle sales-especially truck sales-in excess of last 
year's good results. Sales were off in Montana, though, and also 
slowed in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Aided by falling interest rates, housing activity generally has 
grown. Sales of Minneapolis homes are up a whopping 31 percent this 
April, compared with last April. A major home builder association 
reports that its members had a record number of homes in the 
planning and building stages. Apartment construction has also taken 
off in the Twin Cities metro area, due to a combination of low 
interest and vacancy rates as well as to attempts to beat the 
possible enactment of federal tax laws unfavorable to real estate 
investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Early reports from tourist centers indicate that the pace of tourist 
spending—an important contributor to the district's economy in 
summer—is above last year's level in several spots in Minnesota. 
But tourist spending in North Dakota and Montana has been slowed by 
the strong U.S. dollar, which has kept Canadian visitors away.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District Bank directors report mixed conditions across several key 
resource sectors. Imports, input substitution, and scrap iron 
processing have all hurt the iron ore business in northeastern 
Minnesota. As a result, extended shutdowns in ore processing later 
this summer have been announced. Oil and gas exploration is way down 
in North Dakota and Montana, with the recent cut in British oil 
prices boding ill for future exploration in these states. Indicative 
of this, a Bank director notes that only 30 rigs were operating in 
North Dakota last month, compared with 70 in operation a year 
earlier. In contrast, high demand for housing and paper is spurring 
the wood products sector. A Bank director reports that a new wood-
products plant is opening in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bad news continues to crop up in the district's agriculture sector. 
Farm prices continue to fall: The Minnesota farm price index was 
down 14 percent in mid-May from its level a year earlier. Crop 
prices declined even more precipitously than livestock prices did. 
In Minnesota, the average price for all milk was the lowest in 
almost five years. While warm, wet weather has aided crop 
development in Minnesota and North Dakota, crop development in 
western South Dakota and Montana has been hurt by a lack of 
moisture.
