      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of business and financial conditions in the District 
suggested that economic activity declined in early November. Retail 
sales were weak through the first half of the month but showed 
strength after Thanksgiving. Manufacturing activity fell. Loan 
demand softened, and a more conservative approach characterized all 
bank lending. Funds for new commercial construction and speculative 
residential building were particularly tight. Exports continued to 
rise faster than imports, and agricultural conditions remained 
generally favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses to a pre-Thanksgiving mail survey of retailers indicated 
that retail activity softened in early November from October. Some 
retailers blamed unseasonably warm weather for the slow sales, while 
others pointed to reduced consumer confidence and purchasing power. 
Overall declines were recorded in sales of big ticket items as well 
as in total sales, shopper traffic, and employment. Business at 
department stores was especially poor and not expected to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the weakness in sales, inventories also apparently declined 
over the survey period. There was some indication that suppliers 
were requiring earlier payment for delivered goods. Retail and 
wholesale prices were reported steady to higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers reported unexpectedly strong sales in most major District 
metropolitan areas during the three days following Thanksgiving. 
Surveys by the local newspapers in these areas indicated that 
shopper traffic was very heavy and that business was brisk. Lines of 
shoppers were reported at some stores that had advertised discounted 
merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our regular mail survey suggested that District manufacturing 
activity declined slightly in early November. Respondents indicated 
that shipments, orders, and employment declined, but that 
inventories of raw materials and finished goods changed little. Most 
manufacturers felt that poor sales were their biggest problem, and 
manufacturers of furniture, textiles and apparel said their 
industries were definitely in recessions. Some manufacturers said 
that customers were increasingly reluctant to order very far ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Raw materials prices rose, but most manufacturers apparently held 
finished product prices steady. Even firms that use petroleum-based 
inputs like chemicals and plastics said that they had absorbed sharp 
increases in their raw material costs and had not increased prices 
of their finished goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers saw weakness in current economic conditions, but they 
were somewhat less pessimistic than a month ago about prospects for 
business next year. Most respondents believed that economic activity 
weakened in their local areas and in the nation in early November, 
and about half expected further weakening in the months ahead. A 
significantly larger number of respondents in November than in 
October, however, expected activity to pick up in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Officials at District portsâ€”Baltimore, Charleston, and Hampton 
Roads (Norfolk)â€”indicated that, seasonally adjusted, exports rose 
in October from September and imports were generally unchanged. 
Compared with a year ago, export activity was higher and import 
activity was mixed. All port representatives expected exports would 
continue to increase faster than imports during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The declining dollar evidently gave a modest boost to some exports. 
West Virginia's timber industry, for example, enjoyed strong export 
sales, and exports of coal to overseas markets apparently rose.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of financial institutions and conversations with 
other business people suggested that total credit volume shrank in 
the first three weeks of November. Decreases in loan demand and in 
credit availability were cited as reasons for the decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      The volume of outstanding commercial and industrial loans evidently 
declined in early November. Lenders reported that the demand for new 
commercial loans decreased and that borrowers were reluctant to use 
existing lines of credit. Bankers attributed the weaker demand to 
the sluggish economy and to the uncertainty resulting from Mideast 
tensions. Some lenders also indicated that they were taking extra 
care to ensure that potential borrowers were creditworthy. Nearly 
all lenders reported no change in their loan rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers said they were analyzing loans for new ventures and business 
expansions more carefully. They indicated, however, that quality 
customers with sound management and sufficient documentation should 
find adequate credit available. Even so, some small businesses and 
real estate developers with strong past repayment records reported 
that they had not been able to find adequate funds. In some 
metropolitan areas, loans for real estate development were reported 
to have dried up and construction activity was described as deeply 
depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After falling behind earlier this autumn, harvest and planting 
activity progressed at a rapid pace in recent weeks due to a lack of 
rainfall. As of mid-November, the harvests of corn, soybeans, 
peanuts, and apples were at normal to above-normal levels. The 
planting of small grains was on schedule, and above-normal 
temperatures accelerated the germination and emergence of these 
grains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most livestock producers received relatively high prices and 
benefited from relatively low feed prices. High production, however, 
held down lamb prices.
