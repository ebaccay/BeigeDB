      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1986
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District appears to be generally 
sluggish. Significant weakness continues in the energy and 
agricultural sectors, but housing activity is strong. Retail sales 
are reported to be below year-earlier levels. Both retail 
inventories and manufacturers' inventories of materials inputs are 
being trimmed, an action expected to continue through the year. Loan 
demand at commercial banks is mixed as consumer and agricultural 
loan demand is down while residential real estate loan demand is up. 
Wheat yields were somewhat above average, and a large corn crop is 
expected that will put further downward pressure on corn prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report year-to-date sales slightly below levels 
established last year. Sales are expected to increase seasonally 
through the rest of the year due to upcoming back-to-school and 
Christmas buying activity. Prices, which have been stable the past 
three months, are expected to increase slightly. Retailers generally 
are trimming inventories slightly and expect to do so through the 
rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales are down slightly from last year, but dealers expect this 
small sales slump to bottom out in the near future. Good credit 
conditions exist, but they are helping sales only slightly. Most 
dealers are trying to trim inventory levels, now viewed as a little 
high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, purchasing agents report slightly lower input prices, 
high inventory levels, and adequate availability of materials. Most 
purchasing agents surveyed report input prices somewhat lower than a 
year ago. However, they also report that prices have stabilized or 
risen slightly in the last three months. Expectations are mixed 
regarding price changes for the rest of the year. Most firms have 
been trimming inventories and expect to continue to trim throughout 
1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area homebuilders report that starts of single family dwellings have 
increased sharply over the year ago period, while multifamily starts 
have increased to a lesser extent. Most homebuilders expect housing 
starts to remain strong during the remainder of the year. Sales of 
new homes are near year ago levels, and new home prices have 
remained steady. Builders also report good availability and steady 
prices of materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan institutions have generally experienced slightly 
lower savings inflows this year compared with a year ago. Most 
expect savings inflows through 1986 to remain flat or fall slightly. 
Mortgage activity continues to be strong, but is not dominated by 
demand for refinancing to the extent that it was earlier this year. 
Mortgage interest rates have been steady and are expected to remain 
stable at current levels for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The substantial drop in oil prices in early 1986 and recent price 
volatility continue to plague the District's energy industry. 
Exploration and development activity remain depressed. The average 
weekly number of operating drilling rigs in the Tenth District was 
200 in June, compared with 550 in January and 221 in May. Further 
declines in drilling and production are likely in the near term if 
oil prices remain soft, as expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The wheat harvest is completed in the Tenth District except in 
Wyoming and Nebraska. Yields reported were average to above average 
in most of the district. Growers are expected to place much of this 
year's wheat crop in storage under Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC) loans. Storage space for the crop is reported to be generally 
adequate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ample rainfall points to excellent crops of corn, milo, and cotton. 
The corn crop is approximately two weeks ahead of schedule in the 
district. A burdensome inventory of corn from previous crops and 
expectations of an exceptionally large crop in the making have 
forced the price of corn to life-of-contract lows on the Chicago 
Board of Trade. Of increasing concern to corn growers and their 
lenders is a critical shortage of storage space for the current 
crop. In some cases, grower efforts to place corn in storage under 
CCC loan may be thwarted by a lack of available storage space, 
forcing the sale of the grain at low harvest-time prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rural communities remain under strain in the district. Bankers 
report that the pace of farm acquisition through foreclosure was the 
same or higher than a year ago. In addition, business conditions for 
local merchants are generally described as depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at Tenth District banks was mixed during the past month, 
with nearly equal numbers of surveyed banks reporting increased loan 
demand, lower loan demand, and unchanged loan demand. Among loan 
categories, demand for consumer loans and demand for agricultural 
loans were down, while demand for residential real estate loans was 
up. Demand for commercial and industrial loans and demand for 
commercial real estate loans were higher at some respondent banks, 
and lower at others, Most banks lowered their prime rate one-half 
percentage point; the rest expect to do so shortly. Most banks also 
lowered their consumer lending rates. Most banks report either 
increased or unchanged deposit activity. Demand deposits, NOW's, 
MMDA's, and passbook savings accounts increased. Large CD's and 
small time deposits were down almost uniformly.
