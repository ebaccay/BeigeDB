      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business contacts report that Southeastern economic activity 
continued to expand at a moderate pace in February, and their 
expectations about the near-term outlook remain positive. The recent 
severe weather only affected some areas in the District. Merchants 
generally reported that retail sales are above year-ago levels and 
that factory activity is increasing for industrial equipment and 
sectors associated with residential construction and automobiles. 
However, the energy and defense industries are described as still 
contracting. Residential housing demand remains strong, commercial 
real estate markets continue to improve, and, on balance, bankers 
report stronger than expected loan demand thus far in the first 
quarter. There have been no reports of increased wage pressures, and 
while prices of finished goods remain stable, a few contacts again 
noted rising raw materials prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some retailers reported that sales were hurt by bad weather in 
February. Many stores in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama lost 
several shopping days in mid-month when severe weather caused power 
outages which closed the stores. Some of the affected retailers 
reported that activity has increased since then, but few believe 
they will be able to recover all the lost sales. In the states not 
affected by the severe winter weather, most retailers noted sales 
were up over January and year-ago levels. Women's apparel sales are 
still slow, but the early Easter holiday is expected to help boost 
sales of other spring merchandise. Durable goods are still selling 
well, but activity has slowed slightly from the hectic pace seen at 
the end of last year. Sales of autos continue to build from last 
quarter, and most dealers around the Southeast report year-over-year 
sales gains. In addition, there have been sporadic reports of supply 
constraints slowing sales, especially for some makes of trucks and 
sport-utility vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on manufacturing activity indicated that it continued to 
expand, despite temporary problems caused by the ice storms in parts 
of the region. Overall, factory contacts note moderate increases in 
production and new orders in most sectors as well as optimistic 
expectations about future activity. Pent up demand for new cars is 
reportedly stimulating new orders and shipments at automotive 
suppliers. Some industrial equipment producers are adding to 
employment rolls anticipating strengthening sales of capital goods 
in the near future, and building products producers say they are 
beginning to reach capacity constraints as a result of strong 
residential markets. There are also reports that producers of home 
textiles are expanding or opening new facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some industrial representatives, however, still note sluggish 
business activity. Apparel producers comment that in addition to 
foreign competition, spending on autos and home products is reducing 
domestic apparel demand. Lower oil prices and stiffened 
environmental regulations are reportedly adversely impacting energy 
companies in the southwest part of the District, while manufacturers 
of defense goods continue to announce layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family home sales remain strong throughout the Sixth 
District. Most realtors reported February sales were up from January 
and year-ago levels. Inventories are still tight in many areas, and 
more and more real estate agents are reporting rising home prices. 
Demand remains strongest for new homes. However, builders in several 
states have reported unseasonably poor weather has slowed 
construction of new homes. Nonetheless, most builders remain 
confident that with improving weather they will be able to increase 
their building activity and take advantage of an expected strong 
market this spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commercial and multifamily real estate markets continue to 
report signs of slow but steady improvement. Vacancy rates are 
gradually declining, and many areas are experiencing modest 
increases in effective rental rates, as almost all concessions are 
gone. While commercial property values are still said to be low, 
they are rising in many areas, and distress sales have all but 
disappeared. Additionally, contacts reported some small speculative 
office projects were underway, and new multifamily projects are 
currently under construction in several cities in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers around the region reported that loan demand was steady or up 
modestly in January and early February. Several bankers reported 
increased commercial refinancing activity, and residential mortgage 
loan demand remained strong. Refinancings combined with a relatively 
healthy new home market to keep most residential lending pipelines 
near capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There were no reports of increased wage pressures, and most 
manufacturers continue to report that prices for finished products 
and raw materials remain unchanged. Producers of building products 
and furniture, however, continue to note increasing raw material 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Weather
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A severe ice storm in the second week of February, characterized by 
T.V.A. officials as the worst in decades, knocked out power for 
thousands of residences and businesses in Alabama, Tennessee, 
Mississippi, and northern Louisiana. Over 100,000 homes and 
businesses in Mississippi and Tennessee were without power, and 
about 60,000 residents and businesses in Alabama and nearly that 
many in northern Louisiana also reported extended power outages. 
Agricultural experts say that Mississippi's pecan industry was dealt 
a setback as many trees were damaged by the ice. The state's timber 
industry also could have a significant amount of damage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although many small businesses closed because of lack of power, most 
major industrial plants reportedly kept their doors open. For 
example, the Nissan and Saturn plants in Tennessee kept building 
vehicles, and Bridgestone and Firestone continued making tires.
