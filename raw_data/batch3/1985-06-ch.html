       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Observers of economic developments in the Seventh District generally 
view the current situation and outlook with caution. No recession is 
anticipated, but neither does an upturn appear in prospect from the 
sluggish overall trend, and weakening manufacturing sector, of 
recent months. Construction or office buildings and stores, 
rehabilitation of older structures, and highway and bridge work 
continue vigorous. Residential sales and building are rising in 
response to lower mortgage interest rates. Auto and truck sales are 
at high levels, and a large rise in auto output over last year is 
planned for the third quarter. Major home appliance sales are at 
record levels, but the recent rise is centered in microwave ovens, 
many imported. Other areas of consumer spending for goods have 
flattened or declined. Consumer debt levels are high, and 
delinquencies are up significantly for some lenders. Manufacturing 
jobs in the Seventh District have declined since January, adjusted 
for seasonal patterns. Employers trying to force down labor costs in 
air transport, auto production, trucking, and food retailing have 
been met with work stoppages and costly litigation. Most District 
capital goods producers have experienced only limited recovery, at 
best, from reduced operating rates of 1982. Some lines, including 
heavy construction equipment, railcars, and farm machinery, have 
remained at very low levels, with numerous plant closings. Steel 
orders are rising, chiefly due to auto industry buying, but demand 
and pricing remain short of satisfactory levels, and vigorous cost 
cutting continues. The recent weakening in personal computers and 
semiconductors has had relatively little impact in this region. 
Continued declines in agricultural commodity prices have added to 
strains on farmers, suppliers, and rural communities. Strains on 
farm lenders apparently have also intensified. Business executives 
are studying and commenting on the Administration's tax reform plan, 
with mixed reactions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tax Plan Reduction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District executives recognize the merits of the 
Administration's goal of simplifying the federal income tax system 
and reducing marginal rates. However, equipment producers strongly 
oppose elimination of the investment tax credit, and many are 
concerned about the effect on future cash flow of tighter 
depreciation rules and "recapture" of so-called windfalls from past 
accelerated depreciation. Builders decry the proposal to end tax 
credits on renovations of older commercial structures, which have 
been accounting for a substantial share of current construction 
activity. There is also concern over the proposed requirement that 
equipment and buildings must be in service on January 1, 1986, to 
qualify for existing incentives. However, many believe that the 
abrupt cutoff will be modified to permit a more gradual transition. 
Home builders will strongly oppose elimination of deductibility on 
personal returns of state and local taxes and interest on second 
homes. Attitudes of state and local governments on deductibility of 
taxes are mixed. In Illinois, there is sentiment that existing rules 
comprise a subsidy to other states with heavier taxes. Despite these 
apprehensions, the proposed tax legislation does not play a large 
role in projections of demand or profits for the remainder of 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Import Competition
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Heavy import competition, attributable largely to the strong dollar 
and lower labor costs abroad, is gradually squeezing down 
manufacturing activity in the District in a broad variety of 
industries. It is widely believed that the growth of imports is 
understated because of lags in "documentation" at ports of entry. 
Meanwhile, more and more operations are being shifted abroad--to 
Europe, Latin America (especially Mexico), and the Far East. 
Examples include electrical apparatus, auto parts, household 
appliances, and farm and construction equipment. Pressures to seek 
lower costs abroad are so strong that changes in tax laws, or even 
significant weakening of the dollar, are unlikely to arrest the 
trend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District capital equipment producers continue to be battered 
by the strong dollar. A more sluggish domestic economy apparently 
also has cut growth of capital spending plans and reduced orders. 
Demand is generally weak for various types of heavy capital 
equipment. Railcar orders are down from very low levels last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of cars and trucks continued strong through May, helped by 
cut-rate financing, dealer incentive programs, and easing of 
shortages. However, inventories of some models are still tight. 
Planned third quarter auto production would be highest for the 
quarter since 1977, and 16 percent above year ago. Truck sales in 
May were highest ever for the month. Sales of medium and heavy 
trucks are expected to rise 3-5 percent in 1985, with only small 
gains in the second half. Truck trailer orders and shipments have 
fallen substantially, following the surge in production of larger 
and tandem trailers last year in response to changed Federal 
regulations. A small Midwestern auto producer has given notice that 
it plans to end car production in the U.S. unless labor agrees to 
sizable concessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel production at Chicago area mills has declined somewhat since 
spring, but output has increased in the Detroit area. Third quarter 
bookings indicate a smaller than seasonal decline in output, mainly 
because of auto industry needs. Construction fabricators' backlogs 
are rising, especially for bridges and commercial buildings. Demand 
for steel remains very weak for heavy industrial projects, oil and 
gas, and farm and construction equipment. With continued losses, 
steel companies are still drastically cutting costs, eliminating 
marginal facilities and workers and contracting out additional 
functions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Office and retail construction, renovation, and highway work 
continue vigorous in the Chicago area. The market for large blocks 
of office space in and near the Loop is tight, but a substantial 
amount of space is available in smaller blocks. A large volume of 
new space will hit the market in Chicago next year and may cause a 
serious glut. A record volume of highway contracts will be let by 
the State of Illinois in June. No shortages of materials are 
anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mortgage Rates
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lower interest rates are boosting housing sales and construction. 
Residential building has strengthened, with midrise suburban rental 
apartments up strongly, perhaps in part to "grandfather" current tax 
treatment. Home resales have also improved. Fixed-rate 30-year 
mortgages are being quoted by Chicago area lenders at contract rates 
as low as 11.5 percent. First-year rates on adjustable rate loans 
are quoted by numerous lenders at rates under 10 percent, with some 
being offered at 9 percent or less. Lower rates are encouraging a 
shift toward fixed-rate loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major chain stores in the Seventh District report weaker sales 
growth in recent months, for both durables and nondurables. 
Distribution of delayed tax refunds did not discernibly boost 
spending, according to a large retailer. Consumer buying on credit 
has been heavy, and delinquencies have been rising. With inventories 
somewhat heavy, retailers have been scaling back orders. Total 
shipments of major home appliances have been at an all-time high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Low commodity prices continue to plague District corn and soybean 
farmers. Average farm commodity prices fell further in May, to 11 
percent below a year earlier and lowest for the month since 1980. 
Unexpected weakness in livestock prices has paced the decline in 
recent months. Hog prices are down 14 percent from a year ago, in 
part reflecting large increases in competing supplies of poultry and 
escalating imports from Canada. Crop plantings progressed well ahead 
of normal. Early plantings usually enhance yield prospects. Without 
a large rise in crop exports, not now anticipated, a big harvest 
would add to stocks and hold prices at support levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent developments are reportedly adding to the pressure on the 
cooperative Farm Credit System. Stock requirements of several PCAs 
in Iowa were frozen. In addition, the Omaha FLB raised its farm 
mortgage rates 75 basis points. These developments reportedly 
triggered a "flight" of good borrowers from PCAs and FLBs to other 
lenders. In some cases, the flight has been encouraged by heavy 
advertising of lower rate loans on the part of competitive lenders.
