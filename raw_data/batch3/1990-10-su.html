     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 31, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity appears to have grown slowly in most Federal 
Reserve districts since early August, but seems to have declined 
somewhat in others. Many districts reported a weakening in business 
and consumer confidence. Retail sales, including new car sales, were 
sluggish or down in most of the country. Indicators of manufacturing 
activity were mixed to weaker. Commercial and residential 
construction declined, although sales of homes rose in some areas. 
Total loan demand at commercial banks was lackluster, and business 
lending decreased across the nation. In agriculture, crop yields and 
livestock prices were generally strong, although various factors 
detracted from farm sector conditions in some areas. With respect to 
energy, higher oil prices appeared to be stimulating oil drilling, 
although some shortages of skilled workers were reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity apparently weakened in most of the nation. All 
districts except Chicago reported that sales grew more slowly or 
declined. Many noted slower sales of durable goods, particularly 
autos, and some indicated that retailers had laid off workers. 
Retailers generally believed their inventories were at satisfactory 
levels, although some had begun to trim their stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts reported that retailers were generally pessimistic 
about their sales prospects in coming months. The retailers blamed 
lower consumer confidence brought on by greater uncertainty and 
higher fuel prices for the current and expected weakness in their 
sales. Some worried that they would have to discount prices 
significantly to move merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the manufacturing sector apparently weakened somewhat. 
Chicago reported relatively strong activity, but most other 
districts gave mixed reports or indicated declines. Weakness was 
evident across most industries, although several districts reported 
boosts in energy- or defense-related production. Reports received 
from six districts indicated that, on balance, manufacturing 
employment declined. No district indicated serious manufacturer 
concern over inventory levels, although Philadelphia and Kansas City 
noted that producers were reducing inventories. Exports from the 
Richmond and Cleveland Districts rose but those from the Chicago and 
Boston Districts fell. Scattered reports on producer prices 
suggested that prices of raw materials rose while finished goods 
prices were relatively stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers in several districts were concerned about their 
business prospects in the coming months. Some planned further 
reductions in employment and were cautious about their capital 
spending plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts reported slower construction activity. Scarce 
financing and earlier overbuilding were associated with abrupt 
declines in starts of commercial buildings and residential 
developments in several metropolitan areas. New York observed that 
reduced commercial construction was expected to help ease the 
vacancy rate in midtown Manhattan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing starts were reported to be down in most districts, but home 
sales registered increases in several. Six districts noted general 
weakness in residential construction, although multi-family activity 
was higher in the Dallas district. Home sales rose in at least parts 
of five districts, but Atlanta and San Francisco reported general 
declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some districts commented on home prices. Atlanta and San Francisco 
indicated that the median home price had declined from a year ago. 
New York attributed unsold homes to unrealistic pricing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the financial sector was generally softer. Several 
districts reported that sane financial institutions had tightened 
their lending standards, especially for real estate loans, because 
of uncertain economic prospects or higher capital requirements. 
Total loan demand was unchanged to lower in most districts. The 
demand for commercial and industrial loans was weak across the 
nation, while the demand for consumer loans was mixed. Many 
districts indicated that loans to commercial real estate developers 
were down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural sector was generally strong across the country. 
Several districts noted that yields of most crops are expected to be 
good, and Minneapolis and Kansas City indicated that higher 
livestock prices and low feed costs would help support farm income. 
In the St. Louis and Richmond Districts, recent rains and cold 
weather caused some delays in harvest activity and damaged soybeans 
somewhat. Also, several districts reported that low crop prices or 
higher production costs might limit the incomes of some farmers in 
their areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three districts reported on farm lending activity. Kansas City 
reported that the demand for agricultural loans rose, and Chicago 
and Richmond reported a good pace of repayments on agricultural 
loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several districts reported on energy-related developments. Kansas 
City noted increased oil drilling activity, and Dallas and San 
Francisco expected an increase soon. Atlanta and San Francisco 
indicated shortages of skilled labor in their oil-producing regions. 
St. Louis observed that higher fuel prices were being blamed for 
cutbacks in the transportation sector, and Boston and Chicago noted 
transportation surcharges resulting from these higher prices. 
Richmond and St. Louis indicated that coal production was up, 
although coal prices were mostly unchanged.
