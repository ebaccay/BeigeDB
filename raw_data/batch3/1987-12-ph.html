      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 1987
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy was showing signs of moderate expansion 
in the first half of November. Manufacturing activity was up for the 
eighth month in a row and factory employment increased for the fifth 
consecutive month. Retailers reported sales running above last 
year's pace in October and the first two weeks of November, although 
the year-to-year increase fell below their expectations. Auto 
dealers say sales have slipped in the last two months, following a 
good third quarter. Bankers note slowing growth in business and 
consumer lending, but say real estate lending, primarily for 
residential construction, is still strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      While contacts in the region's business community express concern 
about the effects of the October stock market drop, they have not 
altered their expectations significantly. Manufacturers say the 
outlook is more uncertain than it was before the drop. Nevertheless, 
they anticipate continued growth, although possibly at a slower pace 
than in recent months. Area retailers generally agree with the 
industry consensus that sales in this year's last fiscal quarter 
will be around 4 percent above the same period last year. They say 
that if a broad slowdown does develop, they would not expect to see 
it dampen sales until the spring of 1988. Auto dealers expect to 
maintain their current rate of sales through the end of the year. 
Bankers note that growth in business and personal lending has been 
slowing for several months, and they expect this trend to continue; 
they do not foresee a sharp drop in loan demand in these categories 
resulting from recent volatility in the financial markets. Lending 
officers say demand for real estate loans will remain strong, but 
that lending for development is growing riskier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's industrial sector posted its eighth consecutive month 
of expansion in November, according to the Business Outlook Survey. 
Local manufacturers' overall assessment of current economic 
conditions indicates continuing moderate growth. Measures of new 
orders, shipments, and employment moved up in November, while order 
backlogs were unchanged. Manufacturers of nondurable goods are 
making gains, on balance, while producers of durable goods are 
operating at a steady pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices, both paid and received, are stable for a majority 
of respondents. Some upward pressure is apparent, however, as it has 
been for the past few months: from October to November, input costs 
rose at about 40 percent of the plants polled, and prices for goods 
sold were up at about 20 percent of the plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stock market's sharp decline in October appears to have prompted 
some concern for the future among survey respondents. While positive 
views still edge out pessimistic expectations in the November 
survey, the overall level of optimism is off from recent months. 
Also, several survey participants say the uneasiness of the 
financial markets in late October has increased the uncertainty of 
their own short-term forecasts of business conditions. Nevertheless, 
on balance, managers at area firms are planning to go ahead with 
capital spending plans; 61 percent of the companies polled in 
November plan to continue current levels of capital spending, and 25 
percent plan higher outlays for plant and equipment over the next 
six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in mid-November described sales 
as running somewhat below plan, but "comfortably above" the rate at 
this time last year. Stores in the Third District generally have not 
resorted to unplanned discounting, and results of scheduled 
promotions have met or exceeded expectations. Most product lines are 
selling satisfactorily, but some weakness has developed in womens' 
apparel. Merchants say this may be due to rising prices for imported 
clothing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Store executives are cautious in their forecasts of Christmas sales, 
although regional department stores that have mailed Christmas 
catalogs to customers say the response so far has been good. 
Retailers say the industry consensus is that sales will be up about 
4 percent from last year, in dollar terms, and they have built up 
stocks for the holiday season consistent with this estimate. Thus, 
inventory buildup was moderate even before the stock market decline 
in October prompted concern about consumer spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers say their third quarter sales were above those of the 
same period a year ago, but that sales declined during September and 
have been running at a slower rate since then. They say 
manufacturers' incentives for over-stocked models will probably be 
introduced by all domestic companies by the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in 
October was 7 percent higher than in October 1986. Real estate 
lending has been on a strong upswing since the year began, but 
growth in other loan categories has been slackening since June. 
Bankers contacted in mid-November said these trends are continuing. 
Several described commercial and industrial loan volume as "flat" 
over the past two months. Lending officers said growth in consumer 
credit has been slowing regularly for months; none observed sharp or 
unanticipated declines following the October stock market drop.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial bankers expect business and consumer lending to grow 
slowly in the months ahead. Lending officers say there is no 
indication of resurgent growth in business loan demand despite signs 
of a pickup in manufacturing activity, and most believe consumer 
credit card lending will continue to grow slowly while other 
personal loan categories will remain virtually flat. The October 
turmoil in financial markets is not expected to put any additional 
drag on lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers expect real estate lending to remain strong. They say the 
region's residential real estate markets are still healthy. However, 
financing reeds of developersâ€”for land acquisition, site 
development, and model home construction are rising as demand for 
more expensive homes increases. As a result, builders' borrowing 
needs are growing in relation to their capital. Bankers say up-front 
lending to developers is therefore becoming more risky, and that 
some banks may begin to limit their exposure in construction 
lending.
