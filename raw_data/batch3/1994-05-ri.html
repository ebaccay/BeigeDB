      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 4, 1994
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continued economic growth was indicated by increased activity in 
manufacturing, real estate, agriculture, and in the service-
producing sectors, including ports and tourism. Trends in the 
financial sector were less certain; mortgage refinancings declined, 
but consumer and commercial loan demand remained fairly strong. 
Upward pressures on prices were reported for manufacturers' inputs 
and for building materials. Wages rose in the service-producing 
sectors, and commercial rents increased in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in all District states reported improved business in 
March. Employment changed little, but most other indicators were up. 
Retailers expected consumer demand to increase in the next six 
months. Respondents reported a 0.4 percent increase in retail prices 
in March, and they expected prices to rise 1.1 percent during the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our mail survey of manufacturers indicated increased District 
factory activity in March. Shipments, new orders, and backlogs grew, 
but employment changed little. Raw materials prices rose by less 
than the general rate of inflation; finished goods prices were 
steady. Several contacts doubted that production cost increases 
could be passed along to purchasers. While most producers agreed 
that cost increases were limited so far to raw materials, one 
manufacturer noted that "price pressures were no longer dormant." 
Manufacturers expected higher shipments and prices over the next six 
months but little change in employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service-Producing Sectors
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our mail survey of District service-producing firms showed increased 
activity in March. All sectors reported increased revenues, and 
respondents expected stronger demand in the next six months. All 
sectors except wholesale trade reported higher wages. The real 
estate and health services sectors reported increased employment; 
all other sectors indicated no change. Respondents reported a 0.2 
percent price increase during March, and they expected prices to 
rise 1.0 percent during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at the District ports of Baltimore, Charleston, and 
Hampton Roads (Norfolk) indicated that exports were generally higher 
in March than in February, while imports were unchanged. Compared 
with a year ago, imports were higher and exports remained about the 
same. All three ports expected exports to increase faster than 
imports during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity at District hotels, motels, and resorts was higher 
in the first three weeks of April than in March or in April 1993. 
Myrtle Beach noted that group bookings rose because of the increased 
interest in golfing packages offered in that area. Almost all of the 
respondents indicated that spring bookings were higher than a year 
ago, and most respondents expected tourist activity to improve 
further relative to year-earlier figures during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions indicated that credit conditions 
were mixed during the last six weeks. Interest rates on commercial 
loans increased faster than did rates on consumer loans. Loan demand 
remained fairly strong. Some commercial lenders noted that a few 
businesses were delaying new projects because of interest rate 
uncertainty, but most commercial and consumer lenders were 
optimistic that demand would remain relatively strong, given current 
rates. Mortgage originations were steady, but refinancing activity 
fell substantially as residential mortgage rates rose. Mortgage 
lenders were cautious about future loan demand because of their 
fears of further rate increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our contacts reported that District residential real estate activity 
remained strong in late February and March. Improved home sales were 
attributed to an improving economy. Most real estate agents 
indicated no discernible negative effect on sales from recent 
mortgage rate increases, though they observed heightened uncertainty 
among buyers. Most homebuilders indicated that housing starts were 
slightly fewer than expected during the period, and some attributed 
the slower pace to higher mortgage rates. Home prices changed 
little, and lumber prices rose only slightly, although prices of 
other building materials increased sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate contacts reported declining vacancy rates 
throughout the District. Demand for space was especially strong in 
North Carolina, and contacts in Charlotte and Raleigh indicated that 
shortages of space might occur soon. Contacts reported little new 
construction in most areas, although some speculative warehouse 
construction was underway in the Carolinas. Rental rates increased 
in North Carolina and in parts of West Virginia, while rents in 
other states remained unchanged. Charlotte contacts predicted larger 
rental rate increases in 1995; some Raleigh contacts, however, 
speculated that rent increases might end in 1995 with the addition 
of new space. Large discount retailers continued to dominate retail 
leasing except in Charlotte, where contacts noted increased leasing 
by smaller shops.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State governments' March revenues suggested reasonably strong 
economic growth across the District. North Carolina's revenue growth 
remained strongest; the District of Columbia's was weakest, though 
inflation-adjusted revenue growth there was no longer negative. 
Several states reported very strong retail sales, particularly of 
automobiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Generally favorable weather assisted farmers with their spring field 
work. Corn planting progressed at an above-normal pace across the 
District. Field preparation for soybean, tobacco, and peanut 
planting was also reported to be ahead of schedule. Cattle had been 
put into pastures, which were in generally good condition. Farmers 
were optimistic that the hay crop would be sufficient to replenish 
the stock depleted as a result of last winter's severe weather. The 
peach crop was in fair-to-poor condition. On a pessimistic note, dry 
weather was reported in eastern South Carolina.
