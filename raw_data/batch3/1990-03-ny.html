      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1990
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments continued to be mixed in the Second District in recent 
weeks. January retail sales results varied widely and conditions in 
the District's commercial real estate market were mixed. Residential 
construction slowed throughout the District in 1989 and most 
observers do not anticipate much of a pickup in 1990. However, 
January surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
showed an improvement in general business conditions and District 
unemployment rates fell below the national average. Following the 
lead of major banks, small and medium-sized banks in the District 
dropped their prime lending rate in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pattern of retail sales varied widely in the District during 
January. Over-the-year changes ranges from -7% to +22% and from 
"decidedly below" to "very much above plan." The Campeau bankruptcy 
was cited as a factor explaining the divergent results. Consumer 
uncertainty about the future of the Campeau stores and the 
reluctance of some suppliers to ship merchandise to them may have 
led to a shift in sales elsewhere. With an increasing number of 
manufacturers resuming shipments and growing consumer perception 
that the Campeau stores will remain open, respondents anticipate a 
less varied pattern of sales results in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel and sportswear remained best-sellers during January and 
household items were also popular at some stores. However, big 
ticket items moved slowly, particularly at stores whose viability 
and ability to provide service were in question. In general, 
District department store contacts reported inventories to be on or 
below target.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction slowed throughout the District in 1989 and 
most observers do not anticipate much of a pickup in 1990. While 
homebuilding activity was considerably more brisk in areas such as 
Buffalo and Syracuse than in the New York metropolitan region, the 
"boom" has apparently subsided everywhere. Factors most commonly 
cited are the continuing high prices of existing homes on the 
market, a lack of reasonably priced, developable land, and the 
satisfaction of much pentup demand. The need for "affordable" 
housing remains strong, however, and a number of communities are 
grappling with the problem in part because it is seen as a deterrent 
to future business development.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the commercial real estate market have recently been 
mixed. Office leasing activity was quite strong in midtown Manhattan 
and, in Stamford, Connecticut overall leasing activity surpassed the 
addition to the market of new or existing space for the first time 
in several years. In Westchester County a sharp cutback in new 
construction is credited for the probable bottoming out of office 
rental rates and an expected decline in vacancy rates. However, the 
office market is described as soft in some other parts of the 
District such as Buffalo and downtown Manhattan, where financial 
firms have been retrenching, and in northern New Jersey as well. 
While a slowdown in new office building is expected to stabilize or 
lower vacancy rates in some of these areas, many observers expect 
Manhattan's rates to rise because of the lame number or buildings 
nearing completion and ongoing downsizing at brokerage firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      January surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester 
showed an improvement in general business conditions, new orders and 
production. None of the  Rochester managers reported a worsening of 
conditions and in Buffalo, the percentage reporting a decline in 
orders tell to 7 percent from 42 percent in December. A sizable 
majority in both surveys noted stable input prices. With regard to 
the outlook, 90 percent of Rochester respondents expect 1990 to 
equal or surpass business conditions in 1989 and 82 percent foresee 
capital expenditures either equal to or greater than investment in 
1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      District unemployment rates continued moving erratically in January 
as New York's rate fell .8 percentage point to 4.7 percent while New 
Jersey's rate rose 0.9 percentage point to 4.6 percent. As was true 
nationally, New York's rate declined slightly from a year earlier, 
but New Jersey's rate rose. Recent developments in the brokerage 
industry could result in an increase in District unemployment levels 
in the months ahead. The unexpected liquidation of Drexel Burnham 
and the employment cutbacks recently announced by Shearson Lehman 
and Merrill Lynch could entail the layoff of about 10,000 and some 
observers anticipate additional restructuring in the industry. In 
addition, Fisher-Price will close a toy factory in upstate New York, 
and G.E. Aerospace announced plans to lay off 5600 workers at its 
east coast plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fiscal problems are now plaguing all three states in the District as 
tax revenues fall increasingly short of projections. New Jersey 
expects a $550 million deficit in the current fiscal year while New 
York faces a $1 billion deficit in the year ending March 31 and 
sizable deficits over the next few years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Following the lead of major banks, small and medium-sized banks in 
the Second District dropped their prime lending rate by one-half 
percentage point in January. The majority of the surveyed banks 
reported a general decrease in lending rates across the board. 
Almost all bankers noted that other business loan rates have fallen 
since they are usually tied to the prime. Most mortgage rates also 
dropped, reflecting the tying of many adjustable rate mortgages to 
the prime. Rates on consumer loans, however, were generally steady. 
Nearly all of the bankers noted that the change in the prime had no 
effect on general loan demand. Loan demand today is lower than a 
year ago and many bankers spoke of a particular weakness in the real 
estate market. One banker stated that demand for primary mortgages 
was especially slow. Most bankers see no basic improvement in this 
situation unless a significant decline in interest rates occurs.
