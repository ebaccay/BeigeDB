      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent reports on Seventh District economic activity suggest neither 
an overall pickup nor a pronounced weakening—except for the growing 
woes of cornbelt agriculture. Total employment in District states 
has been about flat since spring, and manufacturing has weakened 
since January. Mergers and "restructurings" of large enterprises 
have been accompanied by layoffs and close reins on new hires. Auto 
production, commercial and residential construction, and highway 
building arc strong compared to the levels of the early l980s. Many 
lines of capital goods important in the District remain weak. Steel 
production continues at depressed and unprofitable levels. However, 
the reported drop in steel imports in July raises hopes for higher 
output in the remainder of the year. General merchandise sales at 
major District retailers continue lackluster. Large prospective corn 
and soybean crops and weak export demand translate into downward 
price pressures and severe financial stress, particularly in Iowa 
and Illinois.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Teachers' Strikes
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tentative settlement was reached in a two-day strike by 28,000 
teachers and about 12,000 other school employees in the huge Chicago 
district. Agreement to end the strike, the third in as many years, 
came after intervention by the governor of Illinois. The 2-year pact 
calls for a 6 percent first-year pay raise, with a further 3 percent 
pay increase in the second year contingent on additional state aid. 
Teachers also will get normal longevity increases. Teachers' strikes 
continue in some other public schools districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Planned production of domestic cars and trucks remains vigorous 
through year-end. Cut-rate financing programs, along with improved 
availability following the carhauler's strike are stimulating strong 
sales gains. Inventory imbalances resulting from the strike are 
being eased quickly, though stocks of popular ear models, 
particularly imports, are tight. Many haulers have worked extended 
hours to clear bloated inventories of cars and trucks awaiting 
transport at plants, ports, and railheads. Auto output was not 
curtailed by the strike. Domestic auto makers have relied 
increasingly on railroads to haul vehicles in recent years. In 1984,
57 percent of domestic autos were moved from factories by rail, up 
from about 50 percent in 1979. In contrast, importers rely on trucks 
for transport of 90 percent of cars from ports of entry. Because 
stocks of popular imported models had been tighter than stocks of 
domestics, the carhaulers walkout had a greater impact on sales of 
imports. Sales of small trucks, many bought for consumer use, have 
been setting records. Demand for medium and heavy trucks has 
softened since early this year. The mix has been shifting from 
heavies toward mediums. Production of truck trailers has slumped 
sharply following the surge in demand last year which had reflected 
regulatory changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for steel has been strong for construction and autos. 
Nonelectrical machinery, agriculture, and various other markets are 
weak. Steel shipments of domestic producers are expected to rise in 
the second half, seasonally adjusted, partly because of lower 
imports. The normal summer slowdown in steel production has been 
less pronounced than usual at major District centers. Sharply lower 
steel imports in July, to 22 percent of the U.S. market from 26 
percent in the first half of the year, apparently reflect partial 
success for the Administration's import restraint program. However, 
import data arc erratic, and delays in reporting have lengthened in 
the past year. Court approval was finally given for demolition of 
over half of U.S. Steel's huge South Works in South Chicago where 
employment is down to around 900 from as many as 10,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for many types of capital goods produced in the Seventh 
District remains very weak. Included are equipment for heavy 
construction, mining, the oil and gas industries, public utilities, 
and railroads. Machine tool orders arc weak except from defense 
contractors and the auto industry. Sales of large farm tractors and 
combines are off sharply from already low levels. Major farm 
equipment plants are expected to be closed for extended periods this 
fall. Foreign competition continues intense in most capital goods 
lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Building activity in the District continues well above recession 
levels, but generally far short of peaks reached in the late 1970's. 
Office, retail, and apartment construction are vigorous in downtown 
Chicago and certain suburban areas. Some new building and renovation 
work apparently is being pushed in anticipation of possible 
unfavorable changes in tax laws. However, bidding volume suggests 
that strength will carry into 1986. Residential and nonresidential 
building is up strongly in southern Michigan, helped by the 
resurgence in the auto industry in the past three years. Highway 
construction is also strong in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise sales of major District retailers on a "same 
store" basis, have been disappointing for several months. Following 
last year's inventory buildup, buying has been closely restricted, 
and stocks are under better control. Sales of durables are expected 
to strengthen in the second half because of the high level of 
residential sales. A large retailer headquartered in the Seventh 
District is eliminating its century-old catalog business, which 
employs 5,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Estimates of the fall harvest, likely to be revised upward, point to 
an 8 percent increase in the District's corn crop, and 11 percent 
increase for soybeans. Nationwide, the increase currently are 
forecast at 8 percent for corn and 5 percent for soybeans. Large 
prospective harvests and slumping exports have sharply depressed 
crop prices. In August, corn and soybean prices were down 10 percent 
from May, about 25 percent below last year, and the lowest since 
1982. Livestock prices also are very depressed, with overall meat 
animal prices down 11 percent from a year ago and, except for a two-
month period in 1983, the lowest since 1978. Low commodity prices 
and continuing declines in farm real estate values are further 
eroding precarious financial positions of many farmers and putting 
pressure on their lenders. Conditions are not expected to improve 
for a long time to come.
