      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity in 
the month of January is down, but hold some hope for improvement by 
July. Manufacturers report further slippage in the industrial 
sector, but are optimistic about the future, anticipating a general 
upswing in manufacturing activity by summer. Retailers say sales are 
down from a year ago, but write off the slowness to the cold 
weather. Third District bankers report C&amp;I loan volume up from last 
January, but consumer loans are off substantially. Contacts in the 
financial sector are forecasting modest increases in business loan 
volume as the economy picks up, but disagree on exactly where 
interest rates are heading.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers responding to the January Business Outlook Survey 
report further decline in area manufacturing activity, extending the 
slump in the industrial sector to four months. Thirty-nine percent 
of the executives polled indicate deterioration in the business 
climate while only 13 percent report improvement. In terms of 
specific indicators, new orders are off in January but not by as 
much as in November and December. Shipments, on the other hand, have 
held steady following two months of decline. Inventories have been 
trimmed slightly again in January. As for labor, payrolls continue 
to shrink while manufacturers report a further shortening of the 
workweek.
     </p>
     <p>
      The continued slowdown has not put a damper on manufacturers' 
forecasts, however, as approximately three-quarters of the survey 
participants anticipate improvement in general industrial activity 
within the next six months. Over two-thirds of the respondents 
expect new orders and shipments to take off between now and July, 
and, as production picks up, manufacturers foresee increases in 
payrolls along with longer working hours. Survey respondents 
continue to be cautious, however, and many plan to keep a lid on 
stock levels. Capital expenditures will be kept to a minimum in 
coming months as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the inflation front, industrial prices are up again in January 
but price hikes appear to be softening. Almost two-thirds of the 
survey participants report stable input costs in January, and nearly 
three-quarters say they've kept the prices on their finished 
products the same as in December. Prices are expected to climb over 
the next six months, though. Close to 8 out of 10 of those polled 
anticipate paying more for raw materials by July and about 6 out of 
10 plan price hikes for the goods they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The record cold weather that's been holding the Third District in 
its grip for several weeks now has put a freeze on area retail sales 
as well in January, according to local merchants. Reports of current 
sales volume indicate sales running 15 to 25 percent below year-ago 
figures, falling far short of retailers' expectations for this 
month. Suburban stores appear to be weathering the cold a bit better 
as sales are said to be off but to a lesser degree than at downtown 
facilities. Of the items being sold, weather-related goods, 
particularly heavy winter clothing, are making a better showing this 
month than other lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, area retailers expect sales to begin gaining momentum 
by the end of the second quarter, if a recovery gets underway, as 
they expect, but shopkeepers are planning cautiously. Contacts 
project sales over the next six months to run only slightly ahead of 
last year's levels, about 5 percent. Inventories remain in-line with 
no changes in stock levels planned as local retailers may be waiting 
for stronger signals on the economy before building inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area bankers report mixed loan activity in January. Commercial loan 
volume is up 8 to 10 percent over year-ago levels, but activity in 
the last two months has dropped off slightly. Consumer loans, on the 
other hand, are off as much as 20 percent from January '81 figures 
as most area bankers continue to shy away from retail marketing 
efforts they feel would be fruitless anyway. As for the future, 
Third District bankers expect little loan activity through the rest 
of the first quarter, but anticipate some pickup in the second, 
although nothing really robust. Projections are for C&amp;I loan volume 
to grow by 4 to 10 percent by July, but for consumer loans to remain 
flat for the most part, as the recession bottoms out.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of deposit flows indicate that demand deposits are mixed, 
running 8 percent below to 10 percent above January '81 levels. 
Local bankers say depositors continue to watch the rates closely 
waiting to shift their deposits to higher yielding accounts. Time 
and savings deposits are running 7 percent ahead of year-ago levels 
and are expected to continue climbing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 15 3/4 
percent. Projections of the prime over the next six months are 
mixed; some bankers predict a hike in the rate to over 16 percent, 
while others forecast the rate to drop by 175 to 275 basis points.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite aggressive marketing efforts by banks in the last few weeks, 
response to IRA offerings has been sluggish so far in the Third 
District. Currently, deposits average between $1,000 and $1,200 with 
30 to 50 percent of the deposits representing new money. Local 
bankers are optimistic, anticipating some pickup in IRA deposits 
over the next six months with the strongest thrust coming from 
corporate payroll deductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales in the Third District remain weak in January. New 
residential sales are virtually at a standstill this month, while 
resale volumes are off by as much as 50 percent compared to year-ago 
figures. In efforts to bolster sales, many real estate brokers 
report dropping prices, about 5 to 15 percent, but mortgage rates of 
17 to 18 percent have pretty much shut down the market in any case. 
Mortgage money is available if, as one contact put it, "you pay the 
piper." Area brokers say if mortgage rates drop to under 14 percent 
consumers would be given a psychological boost, and sales would 
improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the construction side, activity appears to be mixed. No new 
starts on detached single homes are reported, although contacts say 
new groundbreakings for condominiums in the Philadelphia area are 
picking up.
