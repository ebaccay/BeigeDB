      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 29, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions and the outlook in the Fourth District 
remain bleak. Unemployment is high. Survey results and leading 
indicators suggest continued sluggishness in economic activity. 
Capital goods production is unlikely to recover until next year. The 
steel industry remains in depression. Weakness continues in 
construction with few signs of improvement. Retailers are cautious, 
expecting slow sales gains. Municipal employment and 
creditworthiness have fallen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Unemployment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets in the District remain weak. 
Unemployment rates continue higher than the national rate, but are 
demonstrating no clear trend. In Ohio, the unemployment rate (s.a.) 
was 12.7 percent in August, up 0.3 percentage points since April. 
Among the District's eleven major SMSA's, unemployment rates 
(n.s.a.) in July ranged from 9.1 percent in Columbus to 18.2 percent 
in Youngstown, and most SMSAs had rates about 2 percentage points 
higher than the national rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continued sluggishness in District economic 
activity is suggested by leading indicators and our latest survey of 
manufacturers. An index of leading indicators for the Pittsburgh 
SMSA posted its fourteenth consecutive monthly decline in July. An 
index of leading indicators for the Cleveland SMSA rose in July but 
has declined in eight of the last twelve months. Results from our 
September survey of Fourth District manufacturers indicate District 
manufacturing activity has yet to trough. New orders and shipments 
are expected to expand, but at a slower rate than in August. 
Manufacturers continue to liquidate inventories at about the same 
rate as in August. Contractions in employment and hours worked are 
expected to be less severe than in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital goods production continues to weaken with no 
recovery seen until next year. A producer of recording instruments 
for the natural gas industry reports a sudden drop in orders. A 
large diversified capital goods producer reports his backlogs are 
low and there is "complete disarray" in capital goods markets with 
little prospect for recovery in the next six months. A major bank 
expects the lag between an upturn in economic activity and an upturn 
in real expenditures on capital goods will be longer than usual in 
this cycle and will not occur much before the second half of 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Current conditions and outlook in the steel industry remain 
dismal. Output remains extremely weak, with producers operating at 
about 40 percent of capacity. Workers continue to be furloughed. 
Republic Steel has cut exempt employee salaries 7 percent effective 
October 1 and is planning to layoff about 13 percent of currently 
working non-union employees in early autumn. One major producer 
reports that the steel market "is on hold," with no meaningful 
improvement expected until the fourth quarter. Another major firm 
reports that "near-term cutbacks in auto production and continued 
declines in capital goods production are depressing steel demand. A 
slowing of steel-user inventory liquidation should produce moderate 
improvement in fourth quarter steel demand. Steel mill inventories 
will be liquidated through year end and into early 1983." A medium 
size steel producer reports his orders fell 20 percent in August 
after some improvement in June and July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakness continues in construction with few signs of 
improvement. A builder describes industrial construction as being in 
the "depths of depression" and showing no signs of improving. He 
looks for industrial, commercial, and highway construction to start 
growing in second quarter 1983. A director reports several office 
building construction projects nearing completion have not yet been 
able to attract permanent financing. A home building executive 
reports strong customer interest but weak sales because of a wait-
and-see attitude toward interest rates. Fixed rates on mortgages in 
the Cleveland area have been lowered to about 15 percent and 
variable rates are in a 14 percent to 15 percent range but there is 
still very little consumer response. Some thrifts are not 
encouraging loan activity because of continued deposit losses and 
are worried that they will not be able to roll over the maturing All 
Savers Certificates, now 5 percent to 6 percent of total deposits, 
in light of intense competition. They expect little let-up in their 
earnings and net worth squeeze. Moreover, some point out they own 
the highest proportion of non-productive assets in years because of 
repossessed houses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales are weak but some growth is expected. A 
national retailer of general merchandise reports consumer outlays 
are slow, but a regional retailer of do-it-yourself building 
supplies says his sales are still holding up. A department store 
executive is cautiously optimistic about Christmas sales and has 
ordered more merchandise for fourth quarter this year than last. A 
banker observes that the saving rate has jumped but consumer debt 
has increased only slowly, so prospects for recovery in consumer 
outlays are promising. An economist with a national retail chain 
headquartered in this District still expects consumer spending to 
lead an economic recovery, but revival will be smaller and later 
than usual. He expects real PCE this quarter to increase only 0.5 
percent from last, but a larger increase in fourth quarter if the 
saving rate recedes to 6 percent, interest rates decline further, 
and retailers continue to price aggressively. An economist with an 
auto producer is also cautious about near-term prospects. He expects 
total new car sales in fourth quarter to increase only 6 percent 
from this quarter's dismal 7.8 million a.r., partly because high 
interest rates on installment loans remain a constraint on sales. He 
expects that dealer rebates will be sufficient to reduce inventories 
of 1982 models over the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Municipal Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tight fiscal conditions have reduced municipal 
employment and creditworthiness. Local governments in Ohio reduced 
employment by 1,600 non-school employees in August while public 
schools and colleges reduced employment by 2,700 workers. Cleveland 
expects to furlough about 100 workers soon. A municipal bond dealer 
reports that the market views municipal debt in Ohio as not as good 
as in many other areas of the country, and most issues have been 
downgraded a notch, reflecting general economic conditions and 
federal grant reductions. Nevertheless, he believes the quality of 
debt in Ohio is generally good, and the debt is being received 
favorably in the market. He knows of no local government that has 
had difficulty issuing or servicing its debt. In contrast, a major 
banker reports that weaknesses in the fiscal positions and financial 
information systems of some municipalities are hampering their 
access to capital markets.
