      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 6, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Twelfth District, the growth of the economy appears to be 
slowing as rising interest rates and the strong dollar adversely 
affect certain key sectors. Consumer spending appears to have grown 
at an accelerated rate in July, with both department stares and 
automobile dealerships experiencing strong sales. Nonresidential 
construction activity also continues to pick up. But rising mortgage 
interest rates have further reduced both the construction and sale 
of new homes. Employment in the manufacturing sector generally has 
been growing at a slower rate as the rising foreign exchange value 
of the dollar has increased imports of lumber and primary metals, 
forcing Western producers to curtail operations. In agriculture, the 
prospects for significant improvement in farm income in 1984 have 
deteriorated further as prices have weakened in response to overly 
abundant harvests and declining exports. In July, Twelfth District 
banks experienced a further large outflow of money market deposit 
accounts, without an offsetting pickup in large time deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      July was a very favorable month for retailers. Sales are reported to 
have grown at an accelerated rate, following some moderation in 
June. Throughout the District, major shopping malls and department 
stores experienced year-to-year sales gains ranging from 10 to 15 
percent. This occurred even in Oregon where the economic recovery 
generally has been faltering. While retailers are concerned that 
rising interest rates could dampen consumer spending, they are 
encouraged that thus far rapid gains in employment and income have 
been outweighing that negative influence. This is evidenced by 
continued strong demand for such discretionary durable goods as home 
entertainment electronics (video-recorders, televisions) along with 
strong sales of nondurable items, especially apparel. Auto sales 
also continue to be excellent and would be even higher were it not 
that dealer inventories are low. Consumer debt continues to grow at 
a record rate, but retailers do not consider this situation 
worrisome since consumers are keeping their payments current. The 
excess inventory situation that prevailed at department stores in 
June was corrected by July's strong sales pace. Despite the interest 
rate climate, most retailers are optimistic that they will 
experience a very robust fall and Christmas buying season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the important exception of California, the growth of 
manufacturing employment in most District states has slowed 
recently. Such basic materials industries as aluminum, copper, steel 
and lumber cut back production and employment sharply in July. The 
cutbacks in the primary metals industries have been attributable to 
the strength of the U.S. dollar which has been increasing the influx 
of lower- priced foreign imports and forcing domestic producers to 
reduce their prices. Layoffs have been most severe at copper mining 
and processing facilities in Utah and Arizona, but steel mills in 
Utah and aluminum plants in the Pacific Northwest also have been 
curtailing operations. Pacific Northwest lumber mills have been 
closing for extended vacations to reduce the heavy buildup of 
inventory that has occurred in response to the downtrend in national 
homebuilding activity and to increased Canadian imports. 
Fortunately, the paper segment of the forest products industry is 
operating at near full capacity. Rising federal expenditures for 
defense and space programs, as well as increased investment in 
aircraft by the world's airlines, continue to generate new jobs in 
the electronic equipment and aerospace industries. But consumer and 
business demand for some electronic equipment has leveled off 
recently, suggesting that the rapid employment growth that has been 
occurring in that industry could slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing starts in the West have continued to fall further below this 
year's peak reached in January, contrary to the recent increase 
nationally. Sales of new homes also are reported to have slowed 20-
30 percent in recent months. Bankers report that even rates on 
adjustable rate mortgages have reached the point where many more 
potential buyers are being priced out of the market. Similarly, even 
the increased offerings of "buy-down" programs by builders are no 
longer sufficient to prop up the housing market. In Southern 
California, the slowdown in home sales has caused some builders to 
cancel planned projects. In Oregon, residential foreclosures are 
increasing. Rising interest rates have not put a damper on the large 
number of nonresidential construction projects planned or under 
construction in the West however. Salt Lake City, Portland, Tucson 
and some other metropolitan areas are reported to be on the brink of 
a boom in construction of new shopping malls, office towers and 
hotels. Firms continue to be cautious about investing in new 
industrial structures, except for electronic equipment 
manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prospects for significant improvement in California net farm income 
in 1984 have become even dimmer recently due to the effects of hot 
weather in hurrying the harvest of many crops, flooding the market 
with excess supplies and reducing prices below the break-even point 
for many growers. Harvests of most tree fruit and nut crops have 
been anywhere from one-third higher to as much as double production 
levels of a year ago. The harvest of  vegetable crops also has 
been outstanding. But demand has lagged behind production, reducing 
prices for important vegetable crops to or below break-even levels.
Growers of raisin and vine grapes also are likely to experience 
depressed prices due to the huge carryover of raisins and the slow 
growth in overall wine sales and increased share of the market being 
supplied by foreign imports. The cotton crop is progressing well, 
but the strong U.S. dollar and prospect of record world production 
have been reducing prices. In the Pacific Northwest, the outlook for 
farm income is less favorable than in California due to the greater 
importance of grains in the crop mix.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In July, banks in the Twelfth District continued to experience the 
large outflows in money market deposit accounts that began late in 
the first quarter. The $2.6 billion drop in these deposits from 
their February level of $40.4 billion is due in part to the 
hesitancy of banks to offer rates competitive with those available 
through money market funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      In May and June, large time deposits picked up, helping to offset 
this outflow. But in the first three weeks of July, growth in those 
deposits slowed considerably. The sharp drop in business loans that 
occurred during this period, following two months of rapid growth, 
may be one reason banks were less aggressive in acquiring these 
funds. Consumer and real estate loans closed continued to grow at 
their trend rates for the year, with consumer loans showing 
remarkable growth. But bankers report a decline in residential 
mortgage loan applications, suggesting that the demand for those 
loans also is falling.
