      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economic recovery is continuing, but at a 
slower pace, due largely to the decline in residential construction 
and its ripple effects on such key industries as lumber. Apart from 
a shortage-induced decline in automobile sales, consumer spending 
remains strong, with department stores experiencing a widening year-
to-year gain in sales in August. Western homebuilding activity has 
been falling off moderately since June, however, and an even sharper 
decline in home sales suggests a further slowdown in starts in 
coming months. In the manufacturing sector, overall employment 
growth has clearly slowed. Some capital goods industries—especially electronic equipment—are experiencing increased order 
inflow, however. Consumer lending at Twelfth District banks has been 
especially strong due mainly to increased consumer spending but also 
due to banks' promotional efforts. Applications for mortgage loans 
have dropped dramatically.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents throughout the Twelfth District report that retail sales 
continue to rise at department stores and other outlets and that 
these stores experienced a widening year-to-year margin of gain in 
sales in August. Major department store chains in Southern 
California, for example, report that sales in August ran nearly 16 
percent above the year-earlier level. Double-digit increases also 
were recorded at major stores elsewhere. Retail outlets not only 
experienced strong sales of apparel and other back-to-school 
necessities but more costly personal luxury items and home 
furnishings. Respondents attribute these buoyant spending patterns 
mainly to pent-up demand, rising consumer incomes, and increased job 
security. Retailers have been increasing their inventory, but due to 
high real interest rates have held the buildup below the normal 
relationship to sales. Automobile sales declined in August, but 
respondents attributed the slowdown to a shortage of 1983-models 
rather than to a decline in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in both total employment and manufacturing employment has 
slowed recently. In some states—notably, California and Oregon—unemployment rates actually have risen. Part of the slowdown has 
been due to renewed weakness in residential construction activity 
and its adverse effects on the important lumber industry. Since 
June, prices for some key homebuilding lumber products have fallen 
as much as 25 percent, and lumber mills have been cutting 
production. Fortunately, the pulp and paper segment of the forest 
products industry has continued to experience further improvement in 
orders and employment. In the metal mining and manufacturing 
sectors, the Pacific Northwest aluminum industry has been raising 
its capacity utilization rate, but the copper industry in the 
Intermountain states has remained depressed as prices have continued 
to fall despite a labor strike against the nation's second largest 
producer. The West's major capital goods producing industries—including those that manufacture machinery, electronic equipment, 
trucks and aircraft—are experiencing a pickup in orders. Not only 
has consumer and defense demand for these goods increased, but 
business demand has risen, especially for electronic equipment. In 
the case of commercial transport planes increased orders have not 
translated into increased employment, however, due to an even 
greater increase in shipments and consequent decline in unfilled 
orders. Employment has stabilized but not yet increased in such 
energy industries as coal mining and oil production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although housing starts in the West have held up relatively well 
compared with the national pattern in recent months, the rise in 
mortgage interest rates has had a dampening effect on starts since 
June. Moreover, sales of new and older homes have dropped touch more 
dramatically, suggesting that the pace of homebuilding will fall 
further in the months ahead. In fact, in July, the West experienced 
a 14 percent decline in sales of new homes, and respondents report 
that sales slowed further in August. One large real estate firm in 
Southern California reports that it is doing 40 percent less 
business than it was doing two months ago. Another reports that 
sales of new and existing homes have fallen 25 percent in the last 
60 days. As a result, the inventory of unsold homes has risen 
sharply. The climb in mortgage rates has disqualified large numbers 
of buyers in the high-priced California market. Builders in Southern 
California report that cancellations of new tract-home sales are 
running at a 40-50 percent rate in August, twice the cancellation 
rate earlier in the year when FHA rates were in the 12 percent 
range. Some builders who had previously  committed to a "buy-down" 
arrangement to keep effective interest rates affordable are now 
facing a large number of discount points, thus shutting off this 
avenue of financing in the future. Most respondents feel that 
housing has clearly passed its cyclical peak for this year and that 
the recent drop in FHA and VA rates from 13.5 to 13 percent will 
only slow the rate of decline. In the nonresidential construction 
sector, activity continues to lag behind the year-earlier pace. 
Vacancy rates are declining for office and other commercial 
buildings, but no significant increase in construction is expected 
until 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unseasonable rains in Southern California caused damage to certain 
farm products in August, including alfalfa hay, cotton, tomatoes, 
grapes and almonds Nevertheless, net farm income is expected to be 
up in most District states this year, partly because the farm sector 
is expected to benefit greatly from the combined effects of the 
Federal payment-in-kind (PIK) program and the Midwestern drought in 
boosting prices for cotton and grains. The positive effects of the 
PIK program for California and Arizona cotton growers will be 
reduced by their need to put part of their 1983 crop on loan with 
the Commodity Credit Corporation, reducing the amount available for 
sale at higher prices. Nevertheless, these farmers still will
benefit significantly from the program, while farmers in Washington, 
Oregon and Idaho will benefit in general from higher grain prices. 
Livestock producers, on the other hand, will suffer rising feed 
costs and a further drop in already weak cattle prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The volume of consumer loans outstanding at large Twelfth District 
banks has grown at an annual rate of 12 percent over the past three 
months. Increased consumer spending resulting from rising real 
incomes, employment and confidence has been largely responsible for 
the increased borrowing. Households' purchasing power also has been 
enhanced by the effects of the stock market rally in increasing 
wealth. In addition, banks are actively promoting consumer lending, 
although this is taking place through new loan products and 
publicity about availability rather than by lowering rates 
significantly to meet competition from captive finance companies. 
Mortgage lending continued to increase through August on the basis 
of previous commitments, but it is likely to deteriorate in coming 
months as a result of higher rates. Bankers report a sharp drop in 
applications for new mortgage loans. Commercial lending activity 
remains very weak, partly because corporations are using increased 
profits to pay down short-term debt.
