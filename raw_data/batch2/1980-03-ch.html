      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 11, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the long awaited general recession still has not developed 
in the Seventh District, the automotive and housing industries 
remain seriously depressed with no promise of an early revival. 
Output of most types of capital goods is holding at high rates. 
Inventories are at very conservative levels, and a high level of new 
orders is necessary to maintain output and deliveries. Demand for 
workers has eased in most areas. Consumers have not reduced 
purchases of most types of goods and services. Price inflation has 
not moderated, and businesses have taken steps to protect their 
profit margins in anticipation of price controls. Credit markets are 
very tight with many smaller businesses complaining of the heavy 
burden of interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      A sharp contrast exists among the industries of the Seventh 
District. Autos, trucks, recreational equipment, the airlines, and 
housing all suffer from severely depressed demand. And there is no 
sign that the situation will improve in the near future. Most other 
types of capital equipment and consumer goods and services, however, 
remain relatively prosperous.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Chicago Purchasing Managers Survey for February, which covers 
200 companies, shows 45 percent reporting higher output in February, 
compared to 15 percent reporting a decline. This reverses the 
downward drift reported in recent months. Overall, the report 
suggests stability in employment, output, and inventories. The 
Milwaukee report is similar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Throughout the past year our contacts in manufacturing and retailing 
were telling us that their inventories were generally lean. These 
evaluations have been borne out by events. With final demand holding 
up for most items, there has been no room for substantial cutbacks 
in orders. Household appliances provide a dramatic example. 
Shipments had slowed in late 1979, but January showed a rebound with 
total unit shipments 11 percent above last year and close to an all-
time record. Washers, refrigerators, freezers, and microwave ovens 
were especially strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel orders had declined in late 1979 and early 1980, but recent 
months brought a revival. A major Chicago producer will be operating 
at capacity again in March and April. Demand for steel is vigorous 
from virtually all customer groups, except for autos and trucks. 
Strength in steel orders is not believed to be related to scheduled 
price increases. Customers are buying steel on a hand-to-mouth 
basis, and they "admit" their inventories are low—an unusual 
situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rebates are helping sales of less economical cars and light trucks 
somewhat, a temporary expedient that cannot be continued 
indefinitely. Even so, many 1979 models remain unsold. The market is 
extremely depressed for large cars, vans, pick-ups, four-wheel 
drives, and self-propelled recreational vehicles. Major parts' 
manufacturers have been notified of shifts in plans that will 
permanently reduce the use of frames, high horsepower engines, and 
related components. Sharply rising gasoline prices are influencing 
the pattern of demand for motor vehicles to a degree unforeseen only 
a few months ago. Because of a better product mix, General Motors 
has achieved a dominant position unparalleled in the past.
     </p>
     <p>
      The capital goods picture is mixed. Demand for heavy trucks and 
trailers and most types of construction equipment is weak, while 
orders for machine tools, electronics, and energy-related items are 
very strong. Orders for castings are "erratic," but one analyst 
believes that the pattern suggests that capital goods, in general, 
have passed a cyclical peak. Freight car order backlogs are large, 
but a wave of cancellations may have started.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction is threatened by a virtual drying up of 
new loan commitments. The office building boom is in high gear, and 
there is optimism that the new space will be absorbed rapidly. 
Important nuclear power projects in the district are moving ahead, 
but at a reduced pace. New regulations have drastically increased 
construction costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home mortgage lending had begun to revive in February, but the 
recent jump in rates dealt a severe blow. With quoted rates now 
passing 15 percent major lenders report that loan applications, both 
for new and used homes, have slowed to a trickle. Some home builders 
and mortgage bankers have decided to cease operations in the Chicago 
area. Very few new rental units are planned. Given current 
construction costs and interest rates, a one-room apartment would 
require a monthly rent in excess of $600.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending has held up well except for autos and tourism. 
Consumers respond well to sales and promotions. Credit delinquencies 
have increased significantly, but not, as yet, to an alarming 
degree.
     </p>
     <p>
      The International Harvester strike that started November 1 is still 
unresolved. Allis-Chalmers was struck last week. Chicago firemen 
returned to work after a three-week strike, in which the issues were 
the right to strike and inclusion of chiefs in the union. Building 
trades workers in the Chicago area plan to demand wage costs of at 
least 15 percent to "catch up."
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers are increasingly concerned about the effect of COLAs, both 
for union and non-union workers. COLAs often use local CPIs. While 
the national CPI was 13.9 percent above last year in January, the 
index was up 15.3 percent for Chicago, 15.7 percent for Detroit, and 
17.8 percent for Milwaukee—19.4 percent on the CPI-W!
     </p>
     <p>
      Rumors abound that price/wage controls, and/or selective credit 
controls, will be imposed, perhaps without advance notice. 
Anticipatory price increases are reported. Various steps are being 
taken to adjust pricing policies to protect profit margins if and 
when price controls are imposed. List prices may be raised and then 
discounted for the time being. Prices may be raised with temporary 
rebates. Coupons may be offered on food items, and then withdrawn at 
a later time.
     </p>
     <p>
      High interest rates and reduced availability of credit are beginning 
to "bite" to a degree unprecedented in this cycle. Usury is no 
longer a major factor in mortgage loans, because high rates 
eliminated many potential borrowers. Auto loan ceilings are cited as 
a factor reducing the availability of loans in some states. In 
Michigan, hearings are being held on a bill to raise the 12 percent 
ceiling on indirect auto loans, which has virtually cut off this 
type of lending. The UAQ is actively opposing the legislation. We 
are receiving numerous complaints from smaller businesses that loan 
rates of 18 percent or more are driving them to the wall. Vehicle 
dealers are among the most vociferous.
