      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some apparent slowing in economic activity is reported for the Tenth 
District, with only moderate growth expected for the rest of the 
year. While retail sales remain well above a year ago, gains have 
been mixed in recent months. Few significant inventory adjustments 
are expected in the months ahead, either for retail goods or 
materials inputs. With few exceptions, materials art readily 
available and lead times are stable. Price changes are expected to 
be minimal for the rest of the year, both at retail and for inputs. 
Housing starts are expected to be flat or down slightly through 
yearend, with demand down slightly due to higher interest rates. 
Loan demand at banks is slightly stronger than last month. A further 
rise in the prime rate is anticipated but consumer lending rates are 
expected to remain stable. Inadequate moisture last fall and too 
much rain this spring have contributed to mixed crop conditions, 
with row crop planting behind schedule. District bankers are 
concerned about the increase in farm bankruptcies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      About half of the purchasing agents contacted report that input 
prices have increased 3 percent or less since June of last year. 
Most of the remainder report increases of 5 or 6 percent. Few agents 
have seen significant price increases during the last three months. 
Input prices are expected to increase 4 to 6 percent during the 
remainder of the year. Materials inventories are generally reported 
to be at satisfactory levels. Inventory adjustment has been minimal 
in recent weeks and no significant changes are expected for the 
remainder of the year. With few exceptions, materials are readily 
available, lead times are stable, and bottlenecks in labor and 
capacity are not apparent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that year-to-date sales are up some 10 to 20 
percent over a year ago but that sales gains have been mixed in the 
past three months. Men's and women's apparel have been selling 
particularly well. Inventory levels are slightly high relative to 
near-term sales expectations, but no significant trimming is planned 
for the near future. Clearance sales are expected to follow a normal 
pattern. Prices are reported to be generally flat and are expected 
to remain so for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District report moderately 
to strongly improved sales in 1984 relative to last year. Sales of 
imports and large domestic cars have been particularly strong. 
Several dealers are concerned about the recent rise in interest 
rates, but all the dealers contacted report satisfactory credit 
conditions. Financing is available for floorplanning and buyers can 
get loans. Dealers have tried to expand their inventories but have 
been frustrated by a lack of availability. The new import quotas 
effective since April have provided little relief for the tight 
import market. The outlook for both domestic and imports sales 
through 1984 and into 1985 is still very good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders report that housing starts thus far in 1984 have 
exceeded year-ago levels, especially in the single- family category. 
Starts are expected to remain steady or fall somewhat for the rest 
of the year. Sales of new homes are below year-ago levels, and 
prices have increased or remained steady. Homebuilders report that 
materials are readily available at steady prices, except for 
increases for sheetrock and cement. Savings inflows at savings and 
loan associations are largely unchanged from last year and are 
expected to remain steady through 1984. Mortgage demand has fallen 
off in recent weeks because of rising interest rates. Steady or 
increasing interest rates are anticipated through 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at Tenth District banks has increased slightly over the 
past month, mostly due to increases in commercial and industrial 
loans and consumer loans. Some respondents note that the demand for 
auto loans is still quite strong. Residential and commercial real 
estate loan activity is quite variable, with the average level of 
loans unchanged. Agricultural loans decreased slightly. Total 
deposits have risen at the respondent banks. There was an increase 
in all types of deposits except for conventional NOW accounts, which 
remained at the previous month's level, and passbook savings 
accounts, which fell. The prime rate ranged between 12.5 percent and 
14.0 percent, with over half of the banks charging 12.5 percent and 
over 80 percent charging 13 percent or less. Although none of the 
respondents reported a change in the prime rate in the last month, 
all report an increase of at least 0.5 percent in the beginning of 
May. Two-thirds of the respondents expect a further rise in the 
prime, with the rest expecting no change. Consumer lending rates 
have risen slightly, with 60 percent of the respondents reporting no 
change. None of the respondents expect consumer lending rates to 
change in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions across the Tenth District are mixed. The winter 
wheat crop is rated from average to good. Some areas of the District 
received inadequate rainfall last fall, resulting in some wheat 
acreage being replanted this spring to barley or soybeans. 
Harvesting of wheat has begun in southern Oklahoma and will begin in 
the northern half of the state in about a week. Wheat harvesting is 
expected to begin in mid-July in the western part of the District. 
Planting of row crops is behind normal in most of the District 
because of heavy rainfall and some flooding. The corn crop is almost 
completely planted. More soybeans than usual have been planted due 
to a late spring and the plowing under of damaged wheat. District 
bankers express concern over the increasing number of farm 
bankruptcies that have occurred thus far this year and those 
anticipated next year.
