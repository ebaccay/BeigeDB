      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace 
according to recent reports from directors, business leaders and 
economists. Residential construction activity appears to be picking 
up, but respondents reported no evidence of speculative excesses. 
Retail sales continue to post solid gains, and inventories appeared 
to be at satisfactory levels. While many directors voiced concern 
that the uncertainty created by the proposed energy program would 
delay capital outlays, District industrialists report few revisions 
in spending plans. Employment growth remains sluggish, but directors 
heralded a step toward an improved business climate offered by a 
ruling against payment of unemployment insurance benefits to 
strikers.
      <p>
       Several respondents noted a recent improvement in residential 
  construction activity in the Second District. The president of a 
  leading New Jersey bank stated that the demand for residential 
  mortgages was the strongest in more than five years. The president 
  of a major telephone utility reported phone sales were running at 
  rates much higher than anticipated. For the most part, the strength 
  appears concentrated in single family and low-rise condominiums. 
  Construction of new apartment houses in this area continues to lag. 
  Boding well for continued regional growth, none of the respondents, 
  including the directors of the head office and Buffalo branch, saw 
  any indication of the speculative fever reported on the West Coast. 
  One banker noted that New York City apartment prices have improved
  tremendously in recent months, but there is nothing speculative 
  about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales have shown further gains in the New York metropolitan 
  area. An executive of one national chain reported a much brisker 
  pace here than in the country as a whole. For the third consecutive 
  month sales gains at several large New York City stores outpaced 
  gains at suburban counterparts. The president of one major 
  department store attributed much of his 's improvement to a recent, 
  large-scale refurbishing of its New York City site. The increase in 
  retail inventories generally was viewed as accompanying the rise in 
  sales. Merchants felt sales prospects remained bright.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most businesses remain cautious about inventory levels, expanding 
  stocks only in response to gains in sales. One business economist 
  noted that inventory building was quite low for this stage of an 
  economic recovery. Overall, inventories appeared to be in good 
  balance with sales. While some respondents reported inventories were 
  somewhat below desired levels, most firms felt inventories were at 
  generally satisfactory levels. A vice-president of a large capital 
  goods producing firm, which had been facing sluggish demand, 
  reported that with a good flow of new orders his firm could 
  establish a satisfactory level without having to curtail production. 
  The languishing demand for structural steel prompted one steel 
  producer to close one of its older, less efficient plants in western 
  New York. Steel inventories were somewhat higher than desired due in 
  part to less-than-anticipated hedge buying by customers prior to the 
  mid-June steel price rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The regional employment picture shows little near term improvement. 
  In addition to the steel plant closing, a major automobile 
  manufacturer announced a substantial reduction of New York City 
  personnel. More positively, the Buffalo branch and head office 
  directors cited the ruling against the payment of unemployment 
  benefits to strikers in New York as a step toward reestablishing a 
  healthy business climate. It was expected that employment costs 
  would only be marginally reduced, but the general impact toward 
  improving New York State's competitive position will be 
  considerable. Thus, while it would be unlikely to bring in new 
  industry, the motivation to leave should be reduced. One Buffalo 
  director felt it might lead firms to reconsider or alter decisions 
  not to expand New York facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the impact on capital spending of the President's energy 
  program, opinions were mixed. Spokesmen from industrial companies 
  stated that their current plans were unaffected either because they 
  comply with the proposal or are firmly fixed. On the other hand, the 
  chairman of a major New York City bank felt that on balance the 
  program appeared to be having a negative effect on capital spending. 
  The chairman of an international oil company said it could result in 
  lower investment by the petroleum industry. Several economists and 
  directors believe that longer term capital spending is likely to be 
  temporarily postponed until the uncertainty concerning the final 
  program is resolved. On the general outlook for capital spending, 
  one director noted that sharp increases in costs have clearly had a 
  major impact on capital spending and may keep the rise in spending 
  down even through 1978. Capital appropriations have been high, but 
  follow-up in terms of spending may be slow since many businesses do 
  not think they can pass on higher costs in terms of product prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the financial area, there are some indications that loan demand 
  is increasing in selected parts of the District. One of the 
  directors noted a quickening of demand in upstate New York while 
  another reported that business loans were up in the central part of 
  the state. A banking director from New Jersey noted that while 
  overall loan demand was still lagging, home improvement and 
  installment loans were strong. Business loan demand in New York City 
  shows little growth.
