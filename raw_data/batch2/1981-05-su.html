      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 13, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity remained mixed in April, according to 
the District reports. Sales at retail stores were up sharply in many 
areas. Manufacturing activity, however, was uneven although there 
were more positive signs this month than last. Loan demand generally 
was weak despite scattered strength in some sectors and in some 
geographic areas. While residential construction continued to be 
severely depressed, in a few Districts several large commercial and 
industrial projects were underway. Recent rains relieved drought 
conditions in many areas of the country, but Richmond, Atlanta, and 
Minneapolis still reported insufficient soil moisture. Economists 
boosted their forecasts for real GNP growth to the 2-3 percent
range, but high interest rates were still anticipated. There is 
little evidence that expectations for inflation have been altered.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales picked up sharply in April in many 
areas of the country although Boston, St. Louis and Atlanta were 
exceptions to this pattern. In several Districts this degree of 
selling strength was unexpected; Chicago reported its best increase 
in years. Although "big ticket" items continued weak in Philadelphia 
and Kansas City, they contributed significantly to sales growth in 
Richmond. Inventories were not a problem. In contrast to the marked 
improvement of retail store sales, the demand for automobiles 
decreased in most Districts after rebate promotions ended. 
Nevertheless, Minneapolis and Richmond experienced modest recoveries
after the post-rebate decline, and New York indicated some strength 
for foreign and high-priced domestic models. In Dallas some 
improvement in automobile sales was expected this month as the 
removal of state usury ceilings could make more loan money 
available.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While manufacturing activity continued to vary 
considerably from District to District and from industry to 
industry, a few new signs of strength have emerged. Cleveland, 
Richmond and Dallas reported growth in specific sectors; shipments 
in New York still were strong despite decreases in new orders. 
Energy-related industries continued to be a source of strength, and 
most steel plants were operating near capacity, with the exception 
of those supplying automobile manufacturers. However, overall 
activity in most Districts was generally flat, and levels remained 
especially depressed in Boston and Chicago. Further, demand for 
manufactured products by Japan and European countries was down in 
some areas, in part a result of the strong dollar and the slowdown 
in Europe.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction continued sluggish as a 
result of high interest rates. Kansas City reported that mortgage 
interest rates varied between 14 3/4 and 17 percent; several other 
Districts reported rates in the neighborhood of 16 percent. Housing 
starts weakened in Dallas and Chicago. Only Atlanta reported that 
homebuilding rebounded in March and April and even this recovery was 
attributed to mistaken expectations of lower interest rates. 
Philadelphia and Richmond indicated some pockets of residential 
demand, but housing construction generally remained at low levels. 
In contrast to the weakness in the residential sector, Richmond, St.
Louis, and Dallas reported strong nonresidential construction 
activity, each with large commercial and industrial projects 
boosting activity. Chicago's boom in downtown office construction, 
however, was believed to have peaked.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand in most Districts continued to 
languish in April. Consumer loans were generally weak; Philadelphia 
reported levels 16 percent below last year. In Chicago there was no 
evidence that the recent easing of variable rate mortgage 
regulations had any significant effect on the home loan market. Loan 
demand remained depressed in Minneapolis with banks there reporting 
increases in federal funds sales. Commercial and industrial loan 
activity, however, was strong in Kansas City for energy-related 
activities and was strengthened in Dallas by attempts to borrow in 
advance of the raising of the state's usury ceilings. In San 
Francisco, financial institutions were coping with volatile interest 
rates by making almost all loans on a variable rate basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Further rainfall has ended soil moisture problems in 
several Districts, but Richmond, Atlanta and Minneapolis still need 
more rain in some areas. In Minneapolis, agricultural prices are 
rising, but still lie below last year's levels. Given current price 
levels farmers will have trouble repaying loans according to the 
Kansas City and Dallas reports. San Francisco projects a 
continuation of ample food supplies that will provide low prices for 
consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The generally strong showing in the first quarter has 
prompted economists to boost their estimates for real GNP growth in 
1981 to the 2-3 percent range. Some weakening is anticipated in 
the second quarter, but growth is expected to resume by the end of 
the year. High interest rates have led some to fear further setbacks 
to housing demand, deferment of capital spending, and trimming of 
inventories. However, manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, and 
Richmond anticipate improvement in coming months. Although there are 
reports of some abatement of inflation, there is little evidence 
that expectations have changed. The impact of the United Mine 
Workers strike so far has been limited to railroads. Utilities in 
the Atlanta area reportedly hold large stockpiles, but those near 
Philadelphia have only a 60-day supply of coal.
