     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Ninth District were sluggish again in 
October, as they have been since mid-summer. Consumer spending on 
durable goods, homes, and autos continued to be weak. Industrial 
activity also continued to be weak, particularly in manufacturing, 
forest products, and taconite mining. Agricultural conditions once 
again were not favorable to farmers. Reflecting this sluggishness in 
the district's business activity, demand for loans at the district's 
banks remained at a low level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumers continued to be reluctant to spend on durable goods in 
October. Sales of nondurables were good, but the decline in durables 
dominated. In a recent survey, four major Minneapolis-St. Paul 
retailers indicated that their total sales declined slightly in 
October, continuing the slow drop-off that began in mid-summer. 
Despite this weakening in sales, the major Twin Cities retailers did 
not report any excessive buildup of inventories. Weakness in retail 
sales elsewhere in the district was reported by our directors. A 
Wisconsin director, for example, reported that several retailers in 
his community recently went out of business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers also continued to be very reluctant to purchase homes and 
autos in October. Home sales, as indicated by mortgage loan 
applications at Minneapolis-St. Paul S&amp;Ls, remained very depressed, 
as they have been since last spring. New car sales, according to 
regional sales managers for domestic automobile manufacturers, 
remained at September's very depressed level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Additional softening in the district's industrial activity occurred 
in October. Manufacturing orders, which were slow in September, were 
even slower in October. For instance, orders for building supplies 
and automobile parts, which were already depressed, fell further. 
One large Minneapolis-St. Paul manufacturer of building supplies 
indicated that its October new orders were 10 percent below the 
already depressed level that it had been forecasting. The general 
decline in orders for manufactured goods has spread to the 
district's high technology manufacturers, whose orders had been 
increasing until recently. According to local security analysts, the 
recent declines in new orders for computers and other high 
technology equipment were caused by sluggish capital spending and 
the high value of the dollar in foreign exchange. Despite the easing 
in orders, district manufacturers do not appear to be having any 
excessive inventory problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      As manufacturing activity declined, so did activity in the depressed 
forest products and iron mining industries. According to directors, 
layoffs occurred at taconite plants in northeastern Minnesota and 
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan during October. These layoffs were 
in addition to the layoffs that were announced in September. In 
Minnesota, almost 20 percent of the state's iron ore workers are now 
unemployed. The lumber mills in western Montana that were closed 
last month remained closed, and several lumber mills in northeastern 
Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were also closed in 
October, according to directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Confirming this slowdown in industrial activity was the recent rise 
in initial claims for unemployment insurance. Minnesota's initial 
claims, seasonally adjusted, increased 20 percent between September 
and October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural producers have been hampered by poor weather and 
declining prices. Minnesota's harvest, according to the Minnesota 
Agricultural Statistics Service, is about two weeks behind its 
normal schedule due to wet weather. In addition, farmers experienced 
another month of price declines. In South St. Paul, the cash prices 
for slaughter steers and hogs declined 5 percent between September 
and October, and feeder cattle prices dropped 1.3 percent. In 
Minneapolis, the cash prices for corn and soybeans decreased 5.3 and 
4.3 percent, respectively. Wheat prices, however, increased 1.7 
percent between September and October.
     </p>
     <p>
      One bright spot is that the district's farmers expect bumper crops. 
This year's corn harvest is estimated to be 22 percent larger than 
last year's, and the soybean crop is estimated to be 6 percent 
larger than it was last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending at district banks continued to reflect the sluggishness in 
the district's business activity. The amount of outstanding loans at 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area banks in October remained at the 
lackluster level it has been at since last spring. According to one 
Twin Cities banker, some of the demand for loans came from 
businesses that had to finance inventories that hadn't moved as fast 
as plannedâ€”if inventories had been moving, bank loans would have 
been even lower. Outside Minneapolis-St. Paul, bankers also 
continued to report weak loan demand in October.
