      <strong>
       December 6, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The tone of business and consumer sentiment in the Seventh District 
is much improved compared to the situation six to 12 months ago, but 
the firm confidence of several years ago has not returned. Gains in 
activity are widely expected to continue into 1984, with additional 
lagging sectors participating. Estimates of demand for most consumer 
durables have been raised periodically in the past several months, 
in contrast to downward revisions in 1982. Retailers anticipate the 
best Christmas in five years, but are stocking and hiring 
cautiously. The strength of demand for workers in the District 
continues to fall far short of the national experience, despite 
substantial recovery in the auto industry. The pickup in demand for 
heavy capital goods remains spotty. Inventories, generally, continue 
under close control. Shipments of household appliances and 
paperboard were at record levels in the third quarter, but volume of 
most durable goods industries remains far below earlier peaks, and 
is not expected to regain those peaks in the year ahead. Heavy 
inroads of foreign competition have intensified. Residential 
builders are entering the slow winter season with dampened spirits 
relative to last spring. Farmers are beginning to increase purchases 
of supplies and equipment slightly, reflecting improved income and 
expectations of larger plantings in 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Confidence Surveys
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Formal and informal surveys of executive and consumer attitudes in 
the District show substantial improvement compared with dismal 
reports early this year. Professional pollsters at the University of 
Michigan emphasize that indexes of sentiment reflect the direction 
rather than level of activity. Substantial gains in such measures in 
this region indicate more a feeling of relief that the long decline 
in activity has come to an end—and has been reversed in some 
sectors—rather than the old time ebullience.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most general merchandise retailers (not all) have reported improved 
sales and are counting on substantial increases in Christmas volume. 
Gains are projected in the 6-12 percent range over last year's 
results, which were disappointing. Most of the rise will be real 
because prices average only 1-3 percent higher. Merchants speak of 
"pent-up demand." Actual total sales volume may never be known 
accurately because of the growth of discounters, off-price specialty 
stores, and catalog houses that are not adequately tabulated. Credit 
use is up. Among the strongest lines are furniture, appliances 
(especially microwaves), some types of home computers, video 
recorders, some clothing, and various luxuries such as expensive 
dolls and cordless telephones. Merchants have been stocking 
cautiously for Christmas, preferring the chance of some stockouts to 
general excess. Hirings of temporary or part-time clerks are said to 
be much less frequent than in past years of rising sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In September, payroll employment in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and 
Wisconsin was still below a year earlier. It appears that little 
improvement occurred in October. Michigan showed a gain in 
employment from September 1982, reflecting motor industry recalls of 
workers. Despite lack of employment gains, all states reported 
substantial declines in estimated unemployment. In the 5-state area, 
employment was 25,000 below year-ago in September, while 
unemployment was estimated to be down 370,000. (Nationally, the gain 
in employment in this period was much larger than the decline in 
unemployment.) In Illinois, seasonally adjusted employment in 
October was the same as in December 1982. In this period the state's 
reported unemployment rate dropped from 12.8 to 9.7 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The dichotomy between stable employment and declining unemployment 
is explained as "outmigration", and "withdrawals from the labor 
force." In any case, job markets are still weak. Help-wanted ads and 
hiring intentions are up significantly, and lay-offs have been 
reduced, but these gains are offset by additional establishment 
closings and employment cutbacks, often through attrition. Some 
employers are offering generous incentives for early retirement to 
reduce "redundancies." Others are using overtime to handle increased 
output to such an extent that worker unrest has increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos and Appliances
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Both auto and appliance producers substantially underestimated 
demand for certain models in 1983, reversing the tendency to 
overestimate noted in earlier years. As a result, inventories are 
too low. Auto output will be 60 percent above last year in the 
fourth quarter, with strong pressure to build more large cars. 
Output has been restrained by a desire to avoid quality problems. 
First quarter auto output is scheduled to be up 50 percent above the 
year earlier total. Appliance shipments, in units, were up 34 
percent in the third quarter to a new all-time high. Industry 
analysts had projected appliance shipments to rise 7 percent in 
1983, but the actual gain is likely to exceed 15 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for capital equipment produced in the District has increased 
somewhat, but in a highly uneven manner. Output of replacement parts 
has increased on a fairly broad front. Machine tool orders are far 
above last year, but only 40 percent of the rate of early 1980. A 
diversified producer of capital goods reports bookings at only 50 
percent of a "good level." Demand for steel for capital goods and 
construction remains near the recession low. Orders for steel 
castings for equipment are at only 40 percent of capacity. 
Production of heavy trucks will rise in early 1984, but only to 50 
percent of the 1979 level. Truck trailers, almost unique among 
capital goods, are being produced at capacity because of increased 
size limits. Railroad equipment orders are few and small. Demand for 
construction equipment has picked up slightly. Farm equipment sales 
are expected to improve soon, but large inventories can accommodate 
most needs. Some District electric utilities have further slowed 
work on nuclear generating plants, partly because of soaring costs 
which may exceed original estimates ten-fold. A large number of 
District capital goods plants are closed or scheduled for closing, 
including plants producing rail cars, trucks, materials handling 
equipment, construction equipment, and farm equipment. In some cases 
companies headquartered here have alternative sources, either in 
other regions, especially the South, or abroad.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Foreign Competition
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The current plight of producers of capital goods partly reflects 
slow demand world-wide. However, they complain bitterly of the ever-
growing threat of foreign competition, which they attribute to the 
high value of the dollar, subsidies by foreign governments 
(including financing), and trade barriers abroad that hamper 
exports. Increasingly, capital goods producers are following the 
lead of the auto companies by arranging foreign sources for 
components including fasteners, castings, and engines, and complete 
products such as machine tools and construction equipment. In some 
cases this has resulted in the closing and dismantling of domestic 
plants.
