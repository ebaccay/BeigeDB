      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Our latest survey of Fifth District business conditions suggests a 
  marked slowing of activity over the past month. Manufacturers report 
  month-to-month declines in shipments, new orders, and order 
  backlogs, Inventories generally expanded both in absolute terms and 
  relative to desired levels. More than two manufacturing respondents 
  in five view current stocks as excessive. Retail sales showed little 
  change over the month, but a majority of our directors feel that 
  real sales are down slightly from a year ago. The directors 
  anticipate little change in sales over the remainder of the year. 
  Aggregate credit demand in the region continues to weaken, with 
  consumer nonmortgage credit leading the decline. Business borrowings 
  have been moderate in recent weeks. Our second quarter survey of 
  farm credit conditions, however, reflected strong demand for 
  agricultural loans, a continued rise in interest rates, and renewed 
  pressures on liquidity at some banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of manufacturers responding to our latest survey more than one-third 
  experienced a decline in the volume of new orders and nearly as many 
  had reduced levels of shipments during the past month. Backlogs of 
  orders declined moderately. Respondents also report significant 
  inventory accumulation during July. Over one-third indicate larger 
  stocks of finished goods now on hand and over one-fifth report 
  similar gains in materials inventories. Additionally, over 40 
  percent view current inventory levels as excessive while only six 
  percent consider them inadequate. Nonetheless, a large majority of 
  these manufacturers still feel current plant and equipment capacity 
  and current expansion plans are at or near desired levels. 
  Employment among District manufacturers declined slightly in recent 
  weeks, and reductions in the length of the work week were 
  widespread.
       </p>
       <p>
        The District retail sales experience has been mixed in recent weeks 
  although pervasive weakness in some consumer durables, notably 
  autos, has given the entire retail sector a negative tone. It is the 
  view of our directors that real retail sales are down only slightly 
  from year ago levels, and most of them cite automobiles as a 
  significant depressant. Weakness is also perceived in sales of 
  recreational vehicles, boats, and tourist related lines. 
  Recreational items for home use have shown some compensating 
  strength and department store sales continue to hold up well in some 
  areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pessimism has become pervasive among our manufacturing respondents. 
  More than ninety percent expect the general level of business 
  activity nationally to worsen over the next six months and nearly 
  two-thirds are anticipating further slowing of activity in their 
  respective market areas. Over one-third expect the level of 
  production in their own firms to decline over that period. There is 
  less agreement among retailers as to the outlook for the rest of the 
  year, but on balance they do not expect any improvement and seem to 
  be preparing for some further weakening of sales. Our directors 
  generally expect retail sales to be essentially unchanged for the 
  rest of the year. Price increases continue widespread as over three 
  quarters of all respondents report paying higher prices in the past 
  month. On a brighter note, survey responses suggest a possible 
  slowing of price increases in building materials lines.
       </p>
       <p>
        As noted, aggregate credit demand in the region continues to weaken. 
  It is in consumer lending that banks have noticed a clear softening 
  in the demand for credit. Installment lending in particular has 
  slowed as auto sales, and especially sales of recreational vehicles 
  and power boats, continue weak. Moreover, there are some reports 
  that consumer revolving credit is softening. At the same time, 
  second mortgage loans are doing well, with debt consolidation being 
  a major factor explaining demand for such credits. Home improvement 
  loans, however, are also fairly strong. The market for residential 
  mortgage loans is somewhat confused. Both banks and thrift 
  institutions report strong to moderate demand for residential 
  mortgages. At the present time banks appear more willing to extend 
  such credit than do the thrifts. In fact, real estate has been the
  strongest lending category at large District banks in recent weeks. 
  Commercial and industrial lending is moderate, with utilities, 
  construction related businesses, and both wholesale and retail trade 
  accounting for a major share of new loans at larger banks. Some 
  longer term loans for fixed investment are being made, but short-
  term lending predominates. Deposit flows are adequate to support the 
  current demand for funds, although recent changes in Regulation Q do 
  not appear to have significantly strengthened the deposit gathering 
  power of financial institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second quarter survey of farm credit conditions in the Fifth 
  District indicates that loan repayment rates and requests for 
  renewals were running about normal. Supplies of farm loan funds at 
  banks declined further, and there was a slight increase in the 
  proportion of lenders having difficulty meeting the credit needs of 
  their farm borrowers. Moreover, there was a fairly sizable decline 
  in the share of banks who were actively seeking new farm loan 
  accounts. Loan-to-deposit ratios of reporting banks rose to an 
  average of 68.1 percent, only fractionally below the record level a 
  year ago. Bankers who indicated they were requiring more collateral 
  than usual rose to a new high.
