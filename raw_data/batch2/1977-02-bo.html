      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The New England economy has been relatively unaffected by the cold 
  weather thus far. Production at the region's factories has been 
  almost completely unaffected and retailers report strong sales 
  increases. New England relies much more on oil than natural gas and 
  no important fuel shortages are anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      There have been no significant interruptions in New England's 
  production because of fuel shortages although the General Motors 
  assembly plant in Framingham closed for two days because of an 
  inability to get parts coming by rail through snow-bound Buffalo. A 
  survey of regional manufacturers indicates that most have sufficient 
  inventories to allow them to continue production for some time even 
  if transportation into the region is held up. A great deal of 
  industrial freight comes into New England through Buffalo and 
  continued problems there could have important secondary effects. New 
  England manufacturers generally are not worried about fuel supplies 
  and local utilities report they expect no significant problems. One 
  local electric utility is exporting substantial power to the Mid-Atlantic region and could produce even more except transmission 
  lines could not handle the additional power.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Chief Executive Office of a very large and diversified 
  manufacturing conglomerate reports that sales of consumer durables 
  are very strong but that capital goods sales have been 
  disappointing. However, one division which produces machine tools 
  for the automotive market reports strong sales as a result of 
  retooling. There has also been an increase in interest in long lead 
  time capital goods although orders have not picked up yet. A 
  supplier of alloys used in chemical processing equipment reported a 
  significant increase in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large tire manufacturer expects a very good sales year and 
  indicates that the cold weather has not had a significant impact on 
  their sales yet. If auto producers are forced to continue curtailing 
  operations this manufacturer believes it could effect their sales 
  although they expect most of the decline would be made up later. A 
  manufacturer of a chemical filler used in tires and many other 
  products indicated that sales to Mid-West companies are beginning to 
  slacken as a result of the weather. However, this producer has not 
  cut back on output but is building inventories instead. Overall they 
  expect a good year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although sales did slow down during January's snowstorms, regional 
  retailers report they have picked up very strongly and are expected 
  to remain high. However a major department store chain indicated 
  they are watching inventories especially carefully in case continued 
  cold weather and high fuel bills reduce consumers' discretionary 
  income.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large commercial bank president indicates that commercial loan 
  demand is still weak and has been off in January reflecting seasonal 
  patterns. Increase in consumer loan demand has resulted in large 
  part from pickups in automobile paper. Deposit inflows for this 
  Connecticut commercial bank continue to be hurt by NOW account 
  competition. The bank expects a general increase in interest rates 
  and is planning for a 100 basis point rise in their prime rate by 
  the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for parts shortages induced by transportation problems caused 
  by the weather, manufacturers contacted in the region report no 
  anticipated bottlenecks. Most are operating below desired capacity 
  and do not anticipate the need for plant expansion. Price 
  developments have been relatively modest and several companies noted 
  that the expected increase in steel prices was not able to stick. 
  One economic consulting firm expressed concern about international 
  commodities, particularly chromium from Rhodesia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, and Solow were available 
  for comment this month. Except for Houthakker, who opposes the 
  rebate and manpower portions of the Administration's fiscal package, 
  our academic correspondents "disagree with the Central Bank's view 
  of fiscal policy." Solow insists there is an important distinction 
  between the direction the economy would go without stimulus and 
  whether that outcome is a healthy one. While the pattern of real 
  final demand suggests there would be no recession, its very moderate 
  rate of growth, well below the stated policy goals, is insufficient. 
  Samuelson notes that a temporary, not a permanent, step-up in 
  spending would be the expected response to a one-shot tax rebate. He 
  argues this is the intended, desired response from the rebates. 
  Eckstein agrees with the size of the Carter program and insists, if 
  there are any doubts, they are whether the package is too small.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein, Samuelson, and Solow all warned that the cold weather 
  disruption cannot be viewed solely as a short-term supply 
  disruption. Although most of the hours worked will be made up later, 
  part of the effects can be viewed as the functional equivalent of an 
  energy price increase. Real incomes will be lower and will not be 
  recovered.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker continues to recommend money growth of 5 to 5 1/2 
  percent. Solow and Eckstein want no increase in the Federal funds 
  rate. Solow argues that with all the uncertainty and changes in 
  fiscal policy, it would be a mistake to base policy solely on money 
  growth. Eckstein warns against tightening policy when the inevitable 
  bulge in money balances occurs, as tax rebates are held initially in 
  consumer balances. During those weeks, all technical doubts should 
  be resolved on the side of ease. Samuelson fears that anything more 
  than a modest increase in short-term rates may be strongly 
  reinforced by the market.
