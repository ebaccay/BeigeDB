      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia

       March 25, 1981

      Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity for 
the month of March is sluggish to mixed. Area manufacturers say 
industrial activity is showing some signs of expansion in March but 
has remained basically unchanged for the third consecutive month. 
The continued stability in manufacturing activity may have put a 
halt, at least temporarily, to cuts in factory employment observed 
since last April. As for the future, manufacturers anticipate a 
sharp upswing within the next six months which may give labor a 
boost as well. Retail sales are up overall in March, but a mass 
transit strike in the Philadelphia metropolitan area has dropped 
sales in downtown stores 50 percent. Looking ahead, retailers are a 
bit more optimistic than they have been in recent months, 
anticipating increased sales by September. In the financial sector, 
area bankers report sluggish loan activity. Consumer loans are down 
from a year ago, while C&amp;I; loan volume is slightly better, but still 
not strong. In efforts to bolster business loan demand, many banks 
have increased below-prime lending activity and are offering fixed-
rate loans to businesses that want them. In the coal industry, the 
Third District will feel some impact should the United Mine Workers 
call a general strike on March 27, as planned. Area utility 
companies and manufacturers appear ready, however, having stockpiled 
supplies that would last one to three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area industrial activity is showing some signs of expansion in 
March, but has, according to the respondents to the latest Business 
Outlook Survey, remained basically unchanged for the third month in 
a row. With these results in, it appears that the first quarter of 
1981, in general, has been a period of little or no growth for Third 
District industry. In terms of specific indicators this month, new 
orders and shipments are up from February. Inventories, however, 
have held steady for the fifth consecutive month, as local 
manufacturers may be waiting for stronger signals on the economy 
before building their stock levels. As for labor, the continued 
stability in area manufacturing activity may have put a halt, at 
least temporarily, to the cuts in factory employment observed since 
last April. Survey participants report no real change in their 
payrolls or the average workweek over last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, respondents to the survey continue to be 
optimistic, anticipating a sharp upswing in general industrial 
activity within the next six months. Over one-half of the survey 
participants expect new orders and shipments to grow between now and 
September, and, as production pick ups, manufacturers plan to 
increase factory payrolls and lengthen the average workweek a bit. 
Higher expenditures on plant and equipment are also forecast.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the inflation front, industrial prices have jumped again in the 
Third District, as over one-half of the survey respondents report 
paying more for raw materials than they did last month, and about 
one-fifth say they are charging more for their finished products. 
Prices are expected to continue climbing, as 9 out of 10 of the 
survey participants anticipate higher input costs by September and 
nearly 8 out of 10 plan price hikes for the goods they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Philadelphia metropolitan area has been enduring a mass transit 
strike since March 15, as Transport Workers Union leaders and SEPTA 
(Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority) officials try 
to work out a new contract agreement. Downtown Philadelphia stores 
have been hit hard by the strike, with shopkeepers reporting daily 
sales down 50 percent from pre-strike levels. Spokesmen for major 
area retail chains estimate that their center city department stores 
account for only about 20 to 25 percent of their companies' total 
sales volume though, and that lost sales in center city have been 
made up for, in part, by increased volume in suburban stores. Many 
local merchants have reduced their evening hours for the duration of 
the strike. Although the strike will probably have only temporary 
effects on the retail community, some longer-term damage may be done 
as well. As a Director of this Bank notes, merchants "can't be sure 
if consumers will maintain the same willingness to spend" that they 
displayed a few weeks ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of the downtown area, March sales are up over last year's 
levels, about 7 to 10 percent, owing mainly to new spring lines and 
growing consumer confidence, according to area contacts. Sales of 
soft goods—apparel and small household items—continue to be strong, 
with big ticket items starting to pick-up as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the future, area retailers are a bit more optimistic about 
the second half of 1981 than they've been in recent months, 
expecting sales to run at least 3 percent above year-ago figures. 
According to some contacts, consumer confidence in the Reagan 
Administration is growing, as "they try to get a handle on 
inflation." Area retailers are keeping the lid on inventories, 
though, and plan no changes for stock levels, hoping to keep 
inventory-sales ratios healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area bankers report sluggish-to-mixed loan activity in March. 
Consumer loans are down 14 to 16 percent from a year ago, mainly 
because banks continue to take a restrictive posture towards retail 
lending. Business loan volume is better, but still not strong. 
Reports of C&amp;I loan activity range from 4 percent below to 6 percent 
above March 1980 levels, which is in-line with bankers' expectations 
for the most part.
     </p>
     <p>
      In an effort to bolster business loan demand, many banks have 
increased below-prime lending activity and are also offering fixed-
rate loans to businesses that want them. Takers for fixed-rate loans 
may be scarce, though. One reason cited for the weak loan demand was 
that many businesses have put off borrowing for six months or so, 
when they expect interest rates to be significantly lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 17 1/2 
percent. They, like area businessmen, expect the prime to continue 
to drop, leaving the rate 200 to 300 basis points below its current 
level by September.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two developments have occurred since the last Redbook in the Third 
District financial sector. The first took place in Delaware where 
Governor Pete du Pont signed into law the Financial Center 
Development Act, eliminating all usury ceilings in the state, 
allowing variable rate consumer loans to be made, allowing banks to 
charge fees for the use of credit cards, and giving tax breaks to 
banks establishing operations in Delaware. Two major New York banks 
have already set plans in motion to move credit card operations to 
the state, and, although no major Philadelphia banks have announced 
definite intentions to follow suit, they are carefully examining the 
costs and benefits of doing so.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also this month, in attempts to match the advantages offered to 
depositors by money market funds, a major mutual savings bank in 
Philadelphia started offering a six-month savings certificate with a 
floating rate that was to be tied to the six-month T- bill rate and 
change weekly. The $10,000 certificate was available to savers with 
at least $5,000, who could then borrow the balance from the bank. 
The certificate was pulled from the market after only one day, 
however, when the FDIC ruled that the terms violated a number of 
regulations. There were a few actual sales though, and those buyers 
were given a choice of converting to a conventional six-month money 
market certificate or taking a refund.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Coal
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Pennsylvania is a major coal-producing state, and the Third District 
will feel some impact should the United Mine Workers call a general 
strike March 27, as planned. Area utility companies and 
manufacturers appear ready, however. According to a survey polling 
local manufacturing executives, only about 14 percent of the 
respondents use coal directly in their businesses. About 5 percent 
of the survey participants report stockpiling coal in anticipation 
of a strike and have supplies that would last one to three months. 
As for utilities, a strike this month would not have an immediate 
impact. Electric utilities report having an 80- to 90-day stockpile 
of coal and, with the winter heating season coming to an end, power 
consumption will be falling off. Area utilities also have the 
capacity to produce electricity using oil-fired boilers, should the 
coal run out. Subsequently, they are not expecting to find it 
necessary to cut back power.
