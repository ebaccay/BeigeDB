     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 11, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Depressed steel operations and a slowdown in inventory investment 
have hindered economic expansion in the Fourth District. Retailers 
are more optimistic for this quarter's sales prospects as a result 
of a recent strengthening in sales. Capital spending continues to 
expand, although industrial and public works construction are still 
weak. Early indications are that natural gas and coal supplies will 
be adequate for this winter.
      <p>
       Perhaps the major District development in the past month concerns 
the well-publicized projected closing of a steel plant and the 
layoff of about 5,000 workers in the Youngstown area. This layoff 
would lower total nonagricultural employment by less than 0.5 
percent, but would account for about 2.5 percent of total employment 
in the Youngstown-Warren metropolitan area and an unemployment rate 
by year-end of about 9.3 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short-term prospects for steel again have been scaled downward by 
steel economists with the nation's largest producers. They expect an 
operating rate of between 75 percent and 80 percent of capacity, 
which is similar to last quarter. However, this is difficult to 
pinpoint because as much as 3-to-5 million tons of an estimated 160 
tons of capacity have been or are scheduled to become permanently 
retired. These economists expect cash flow, and especially profits, 
will be badly depressed again this quarter. One economist expressed 
the view that the break-even point in steel is even higher than 80 
percent of capacity because energy costs to produce a ton of steel 
have risen from $18 to $80 and have not been recovered in prices. 
Therefore, the industry could face further layoffs, closing of 
marginal facilities, dropping of unprofitable products, and perhaps 
shutdowns of some middle-sized producers.
      </p>
      <p>
       These steel economists have mixed views about the future for 
domestic steel producers. One believes that the domestic industry 
will continue to shrink because of its inability to operate 
profitably against Japanese competition, to finance new capacity, or 
to meet pollution abatement standards. He predicts that domestic 
producers will specialize in a few product lines and will diversify 
into non-steel products. Another economist contends that domestic 
producers are competitive with European steel but Japanese mills can 
produce steel for about $25 to $65 per ton below U.S. costs. When 
transportation, duties, and other charges are added to production 
costs, the cost of Japanese steel is higher than domestically 
produced steel. The current problem is triggered by a surge of 
imports that reflects a worldwide surplus of steel supply. Imports 
in the last few months have risen to about a 20-million-ton annual 
rate which amounts to about 22 percent of domestic shipments. The 
increase in imports was widespread, including not only EEC countries 
but Finland, South Africa, Canada, Korea, Mexico, Spain, and India.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strong September sales have prompted optimism about near-term sales 
among some retailers. However, executives and economists who were 
contacted suggest a mixed pattern of spending. Recent strength has 
been broadly based but especially marked in apparel. Retailers 
acknowledge that a step-up in sales promotions has been an important 
factor in the revival of sales. But some economists take a less 
sanguine view of consumer spending prospects. One associated with a 
major retail chain emphasizes that consumers have shifted from 
purchases of durable goods, especially automobiles, to nondurable 
ones. Recent sales gains have been registered mostly in general 
merchandise, especially apparel, which was soft earlier in the year. 
After seasonal adjustment, retail sales, excluding autos, probably 
were not much stronger in September than in August. He cautions that 
gains in October would not be as large as in recent months and that 
sales will continue to show monthly swings. Another economist with a 
major producer of personal and home-care products indicated a 
flattening in grocery store sales of their products in recent 
months, perhaps in response to unexpectedly rapid growth rates in 
late 1976 and early 1977. He expects consumer outlays for those 
products will be stepped up in line with historical growth rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital goods producers comment that demand continues to expand. 
Still, the pace is not accelerating nor is demand more broadly based 
than previously reported. Major machine tool builders report orders 
in August and September picked up sharply following a midsummer sag. 
Demand for business equipment, especially computer terminals and 
communications equipment, continued strong throughout the summer, in 
contrast to a usual slowing. Demand for overhead cranes and 
excavation machinery has been increasing steadily from a trough 
earlier this year. But one producer does not expect a strong pickup 
until accelerations of public works programs, such as construction 
of highways, bridges, sewers, and waterworks. Industrial 
construction is also recovering slowly. A major design and 
engineering firm reports its backlog has been flat for the last 
several months because of little demand from steel, nonferrous 
metals, chemicals, and oil refineries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supplies of natural gas are not expected to be as tight this winter 
as in 1976-77. The largest natural gas utility in northeast Ohio 
lifted all curtailments last June and expects to be able to take on 
new industrial and residential users for the first time in several 
years. The utility is prepared for a colder-than-normal winter but 
not one as severe as last year. The encouraging forecast is based on 
reduced demandâ€”stemming from the partial closing of a steel plant 
and conservation programs of industrial and residential usersâ€”and 
increased supplies as a result of self-help programs, imported 
natural gas, and an increase in the number of wells drilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officials with a major coal producer believe supplies should be 
adequate even if there is a coal strike which lasts as long as 45 
days. Nearly an 80-day supply of coal should be in inventory by the 
end of November. However, these officials hold that chances for a 
lengthy strike have diminished considerably because of a shift in 
key issues from the right of local unions to strike to a larger 
package of benefits for miners. It is unlikely that the entire 
industry would be affected by a strike since only 60 percent of 
Eastern mines are unionized and an even smaller percentage in the 
West. These officials maintain that the industry can produce 1.0 to 
1.2 billion tons of coal by 1985 even with existing environmental 
constraints. Still, producers are not stepping up expansion programs 
until an energy program is legislated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential and consumer loans continue strong, but business loan 
demand is still somewhat sluggish and below expectations. S&amp;Ls also 
indicate continued strong demand for mortgage loans, and some expect 
a record year for mortgage loans and commitments. There is also some 
softening in prices of existing homes, although an official with a 
large builders' association in Ohio expects that prices for new 
houses will continue to rise because of higher costs of insulation 
and shortages of skilled construction workers.
