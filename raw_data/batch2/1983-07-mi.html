      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy is still on the mend. Gains in sales of 
homes, general merchandise, and autos and increased interest in 
tourism suggest that consumer spending has continued to strengthen. 
Manufacturing and oil and gas exploration have been improving as 
well. But metal mining has remained in the doldrums, and signs of 
recovery have been mixed in agriculture. So far, the recovery has 
been strong enough to halt employment declines, but not strong 
enough to stimulate considerable hiring. Bank lending, however, has 
recently picked up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending has continued to show the most convincing signs of 
recovery. The most spectacular sign has been the continuing sharp 
resurgence in home building and sales. In Fargo, North Dakota, for 
example, building permits for 574 residences were issued in the two-month period April-May, more than five times as many as in that 
period last year. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, home sales in May were up 
35 percent from a year earlier. Improved home sales seem to have 
helped boost home furnishings sales at two large Twin Cities 
department stores this spring. These stores report that other items 
have been selling very well too and that many consumers are no 
longer waiting for sales to purchase. Outside Minneapolis-St. Paul, 
recent general merchandise sales have been good as well, according 
to Bank directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another sign of recovery is that the April rebound in auto sales has 
continued through May and early June. A sales manager for one of the 
nation's largest auto manufacturers, for example, says that his 
firm's auto sales in the district have in recent weeks been up about 
25 percent from a year ago. Verifying this gain are Bank directors' 
comments about strong auto sales this spring in their communities.
     </p>
     <p>
      A further sign of recovery is that district consumers appear to have 
become more willing to spend on travel and recreation. The number of 
tourism inquiries in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan this spring has 
been five times greater than normal. And the tourism association in 
northeastern Minnesota reports that it has distributed just about 
all its brochures; it had expected the supply to last through 
August. Businesses also have seemed more interested in travel and 
recreation lately. A major Minnesota resort reports that its recent 
reservations for business meetings have been up substantially from a 
year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District industrial production has been manifesting signs of 
recovery too. The pickup in homebuilding, according to our last 
report, accounted for much of the pickup in district manufacturing 
through early spring, but in May and early June, auto sales have 
been providing impetus to manufacturing as well. A radial tire 
factory in Wisconsin has been having trouble keeping up with orders, 
and an auto parts manufacturer in the Upper Peninsula recently 
recalled a substantial number of workers. The district's one auto 
assembly plant has been working two shifts and plans to hire 
additional workers this summer if sales remain at present levels.
Gas and oil exploration has also started to revive. In mid-June, 63 
rigs were active in Montana and North Dakota, compared to 47 in mid-March. A North Dakota director attributes this increase to a sizable 
drop in drilling costs. Some district industrial activities are 
still suffering, howeverâ€”particularly iron mining. The only 
Minnesota taconite plant to remain open throughout 1982 just 
announced that it is shutting down for two months and laying off 
1,000 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In agriculture, signs of recovery have been mixed. Bank directors 
continue to report that the Payment-In-Kind program is having a 
positive impact on agriculture, but several who are in the industry 
are concerned that excess worldwide supplies will put downward 
pressure on prices. This mixed outlook is perhaps reflected in the 
Minneapolis cash prices for corn, wheat, and soybeans; they remained 
essentially unchanged between April and May, after increasing 
markedly between January and April. Cold, damp weather in May and 
early June is another worry. The height of Minnesota corn in mid-
June averaged only 7 inches, which is 3 inches below normal, while 
soybeans averaged just half their normal 4-inch height.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recovery in consumer spending and industrial production seems to 
have arrested the decline in district employment. District wage and 
salary employment, seasonally adjusted, has been essentially 
unchanged since the fourth quarter, and in April it was 1.5 percent 
below its level a year earlier. (National wage and salary employment 
increased 0.4 percent between the fourth quarter and April and in 
that month was down 1.1 percent from a year ago.) District 
employment has stopped falling because employers have reduced the 
number of workers they have been laying off. Minnesota's initial 
claims for unemployment insurance in April and May were 20 percent 
below their year-ago level. But employment has not risen because 
most employers have yet to significantly step up their hiring. The 
Minnesota Job Service currently lists 2,891 job openings in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area, for example. Although this is up 
considerably from last year's 1,780 openings, it is down 
considerably from the approximately 8,000 openings listed in both 
1978 and 1979. Conversations with several large district employers 
corroborate these figures; none has done extensive hiring lately. 
The district's largest manufacturer has not added any workers 
nationwide for several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment conditions vary considerably among the district's four 
complete states, however. In Minnesota, wage and salary employment 
in April was down about 2 percent from a year ago, and this can be 
attributed largely to job declines of 4 percent in manufacturing and 
29 percent in mining. Montana had a comparable mining decline, along 
with a 17 percent decline in construction jobs. That state's wage 
and salary employment was down roughly 1.5 percent. In South Dakota, 
payroll employment was unchanged from a year ago, mostly because 
trade and services employment held steady. In North Dakota, wage and 
salary employment was up 1.5 percent from a year ago. This stemmed 
from a 26 percent increase in construction employment that can be 
attributed primarily to a huge coal gasification project.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As some industries have revived and employment declines have leveled 
off, bank lending has increased in the district. Between late April 
and mid-June, loans at country member banks rose 2 percent, the 
first rise in many months. This rise is confirmed by Bank directors' 
comments that loan demand has picked up in their areas. But 
directors also indicate that the quality of many recent loan 
applications has been poor.
