      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy appears to be on pretty solid footing despite a 
preponderance of strikes and continuing weakness in the farm sector. 
Consumer spending continues to advance. Lending activity is heavy; 
and deposit inflows have been moderate but slowing. Nonresidential 
construction shows spotty strength but the promise of strong gains. 
The tourist industry is flourishing in some unexpected areas.
      <p>
       At least 13,500 workers (in addition to the longshoremen) have been 
  striking major District employers, keeping hundreds of other 
  employees off the job as plants ceased operations. Lockheed-Georgia's 5,000 machinists joined California counterparts in a 
  walkout that closed the Marietta plant. A dispute over production 
  standards evolved into a 4,500-man strike at GM's Doraville, 
  Georgia, facility. The Port of New Orleans reopened in mid-October 
  as the general strike ended. Longshoremen are now working 
  conventional cargoes but still striking containerized vessels. Grain 
  exports have been caught in the bottleneck. The Savannah port, where 
  shipments were already sluggish, is operating at 40 percent of 
  capacity. Most Florida ports have been only slightly affected by the 
  strike because of the low proportion of containerized shipping. The 
  Tampa port, however, has been badly congested, largely because of 
  increased phosphate exports.
      </p>
      <p>
       As yet, disintermediation has not been significant at District 
  financial institutions. Savings and loans' net savings inflows are 
  off only slightly from near-record levels. Nonpassbook time deposit 
  inflows have slipped at member banks, but total deposits maintain 
  moderate growth. However, our Fiscal Agency Department notes 
  increasing security sales, a rising proportion of tenders of checks 
  drawn on savings and loans, and a jump in telephone inquiries about 
  rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan demand continues brisk. One Atlanta bank attributes rapid 
  growth of credit card loans to a voluntary willingness of consumers 
  to carry more credit card debt. In Tennessee, the most recent 
  reports from large commercial banks indicate that uncertainty over 
  usury enforcement has sharply reduced extensions of consumer 
  installment credit, particularly direct auto loans. But a heavier 
  volume of single-payment loans may be offsetting reduced installment 
  credit. An economist from the Atlanta Federal Home Loan Bank 
  expresses concern that high mortgage demand has caused associations 
  to overcommit, even on the basis of current inflows. A director 
  reports that some S&amp;Ls in southwest Florida have extended their 
  maximum allocations of commercial loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       A regional commercial developer points to backlogged demand as the 
  stimulus for heavy current and near-term leasing activity, 
  particularly of warehouses and offices. He notes keen competition 
  for rather scarce high-quality, developed, income-producing 
  properties, but expects only moderate commercial construction until 
  rents rise enough to produce adequate investment returns. An 
  increasing number of his customers for new developments are local 
  governments or private coalitions of investors interested in the 
  renewal of downtown areas. Office space is becoming scarcer in 
  Atlanta and Miami, two cities previously plagued with extensive 
  vacancies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for industrial investment, opinions of directors and other 
  business leaders about current activity and prospects are widely 
  mixed. A Tennessee director surmises that low stock price/earnings 
  multiples have made acquisition of small existing companies a more 
  economical means of expansion than investment in new facilities. One 
  large construction firm which specializes in pulp, paper, and energy 
  boasts a record backlog of contract work. The Southern Company, 
  which supplies about half of the District's electrical power, 
  complains of a lack of new industries but (reluctantly) plans 
  capital expansion of its own to help meet surging residential demand 
  and the more moderate additional requirements of expanded existing 
  industrial facilities. One director notes that small projects are 
  keeping many contractors busy in the Jacksonville area, but the 
  paucity of large projects threatens the existence of large-project 
  construction firms. In central Florida and Louisiana, announcements 
  for both new industries and expansions of current operations 
  continue very heavy. Plans for several huge electric-generating 
  plants have boosted District nonresidential construction contracts 
  to record levels three times this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most areas continue to enjoy strong retail sales, with auto sales 
  showing substantial year-ago increases and many dealers still 
  complaining of low inventories. Clothing sales have been quite good 
  in places. One director contrasts recent local increases in 
  television advertising volume with the apparent hesitance to make ad 
  commitments at the national level. Though we have seen no evidence 
  as yet of a slowing of the overall sales pace in Tennessee, the 
  credit slowdown has cut into used car sales rather sharply and 
  swelled dealer inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harvests have been nearly completed despite unfavorable damp 
  weather. Field losses have been large. Cotton quality has been 
  reduced and yields disappointing. But the tobacco marketing season 
  closed with huge volume and record price. Citrus processors have bid 
  up the price of the scanty Florida orange crop sharply in "panic 
  buying." Gains in the hog market continue to surpass expectations. 
  Wider profit margins are stimulating broiler and egg production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourist traffic has been lighter than usual in the off season of 
  Atlantic Coast beaches and only slightly heavier at central Florida 
  attractions, with little extra-seasonal gains expected this fall. 
  However, a rising stream of Latin American visitors has shored up 
  tourism and trade in some parts of the state, particularly downtown 
  Miami. On the Gulf Coast beaches, especially in Mississippi, and in 
  the inland areas of Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee, solid gains in 
  tourism have been reported. Upcoming conventions should boost this 
  industry's revenues in Miami, New Orleans, and Biloxi.
