      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Fierce winter weather and a natural gas shortage have materially 
  affected economic activity in the Second District, according to 
  businessmen, utility executives, and directors of the Buffalo Branch 
  who were contacted recently. The dislocations varied greatly across 
  the District—ranging from a virtual halt of business activity in 
  western New York State to scattered commercial and industrial 
  closings in metropolitan New York City. Most of these firms expected 
  to reopen within the current week because of an easing in the 
  shortage of natural gas. Notwithstanding the return to production, 
  businessmen remain concerned over the prospects of future shutdowns 
  should frigid temperatures reemerge. On the general outlook for the 
  national economy, business economists viewed the decline in
  production and employment as a temporary disruption that would be 
  largely made up in coming months. On the other hand, these 
  economists were less optimistic on the outlook for prices, 
  projecting a reacceleration in the rate of inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cutbacks in production and employment varied substantially across 
  the District. The most severe and widespread closedowns were in the 
  Buffalo area which was struck by a devastating winter storm in late 
  January. As a result of the adverse weather conditions and storm 
  aftermath, employees were unable to travel to work and tens of 
  thousands were idled. Outside of the Buffalo area, work stoppages 
  appeared to be largely the result of cutbacks in natural gas 
  supplies. Late in January, natural gas suppliers experienced a 
  drastic diminution of stocks due to increased consumption and 
  pipeline curtailments. Faced with the prospect of cutting back 
  service to residential customers, many upstate New York and northern 
  New Jersey utilities reduced commercial and industrial service to 
  levels that would only protect plant and equipment from freezing. 
  While many firms continued production by switching to alternative 
  fuels, numerous closings were reported. The Buffalo directors 
  estimated that approximately 6,000 Rochester area workers were laid 
  off due to a shortage of natural gas. Closer to New York City, 
  layoffs and production losses appear to have been relatively much 
  more limited with fewer natural gas curtailments of customers 
  without alternative fuel sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conservation measures, some moderation of temperatures, and 
  purchases of natural gas by utilities produced at least a temporary 
  easing in the natural gas shortages early in February. Natural gas 
  service was expected to be restored to most business customers 
  within the current week. Despite this encouraging development, firms 
  remained concerned that further service disruptions might occur if 
  adverse weather conditions reappear. A director of a major upstate 
  utility emphasized that prolonged cold could result in a major 
  natural gas crisis. Overall, respondents felt that energy shortages 
  were largely limited to natural gas. Despite this general consensus, 
  however, several respondents complained of an inability to receive 
  propane shipments due to weather-related transportation problems. A 
  few businessmen, who were able to obtain propane, complained of its 
  sharply higher price.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the restoration of natural gas service, most firms felt they 
  would be able to make up for the lost production. Exceptions were 
  two glass-makers who felt there was little room to make up for lost 
  production since they had already been operating their plants 24 
  hours a day. Another exception was in the auto industry where two 
  plants were expected to remain closed an additional week due to 
  shortages of parts and supplies that had been created by plant 
  closings in Buffalo. The disruptive effects of the extraordinarily 
  severe weather conditions were also reflected in retail activity in 
  the District. Through the first weeks of January merchants reported 
  that sales were generally good. However, in the wake of the brutal 
  climatic conditions sales plummeted over the remainder of the month. 
  Particularly hard hit were stores in the Buffalo area which were 
  forced to close for several days. In addition, many stores in 
  upstate New York, in an effort to conserve fuel, reduced their hours 
  by 20 to 30 percent. Even in New York City, which was relatively 
  less affected by the adverse weather, customer traffic fell below 
  normal as the temperature fell. In New Jersey, stores drastically 
  lowered thermostats or cut hours to meet the Governor's strict 
  conservation regulations. As a result of these various measures, 
  combined with the bad weather, sales toward the close of January and 
  in early February fell below year-earlier levels. Despite the 
  overall slowdown in sales, inventories were generally described as 
  in good shape. Merchants did not appear overly concerned by the 
  sluggishness in retail activity which they appeared to regard as 
  temporary and expect to be made up in coming months as the weather 
  returns to normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the implications of the severe winter for the general economy, 
  most business economists felt that it was premature to substantially 
  alter their projections of production for the year. An exception to 
  this view was the senior economist of a major appliance manufacturer 
  who was uneasy about describing the effect as similar to a strike. 
  He was concerned about the on-going production constraint posed by 
  natural gas shortages. In addition, he also felt that due to the 
  heightened sensitivity of consumers and the financial markets to 
  price changes, a reacceleration in inflation could have substantial 
  ramifications. All of the respondents expected at least a short-run 
  acceleration in the rate of inflation due to increased fuel and food 
  costs.
