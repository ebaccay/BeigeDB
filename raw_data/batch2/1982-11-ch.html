      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 16, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region of the Seventh District continues in a deep 
recession. The expected "turn" in general activity has not occurred. 
On the contrary, most indicators are still declining. However, 
morale has been boosted by recent strength in both the equity and 
debt capital markets. The election results are not expected to 
significantly affect the near-term economic outlook. Easier mortgage 
credit has increased sales of residential properties, but from a 
very low level. Nonresidential construction is heading down. Output 
of durable goods has declined further, but there are signs of a 
leveling in nondurables, such as paper. More plants are being 
closed, some permanently. Layoffs and terminations of workers are 
causing widespread distress. State and local governments are cutting 
programs, reflecting financial strain. Retail sales remain weak, but 
some merchants are encouraged by trends in recent weeks. Large 
harvests and weak demand for grain are placing additional downward 
pressure on crop prices and income. District farmland values 
declined 5 percent in the third quarter, and 16 percent in the past 
12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Managers Pessimistic
      </strong>
      <br/>
      October reports of purchasing 
managers associations in both Chicago and Milwaukee show further 
substantial declines in employment, output, new orders, and 
backlogs. Rapid deterioration was first evident in these reports in 
the fourth quarter of 1981. Since then the downtrend appeared to be 
losing momentum at times, thereby raising hopes for a turnaround. 
But recent months have shown no glimmer of improvement. Inventories 
continue to be reduced generally, but are still viewed as excessive 
in some companies. Order backlogs have virtually evaporated for 
many. Starting last February, prices paid have averaged lower every 
month, an unprecedented development since World War II. (A year ago
price increases substantially exceeded decreases.) An interesting 
but disturbing development in October was a moderate deterioration 
in vendor performance, attributed to suppliers that have contracted 
or closed operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Pressures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District manufacturers and retailers are 
reporting either reduced profits or losses for the third quarter. 
Losses are cutting deeply into net worth in some cases, and, along 
with heavy debts, are causing reductions in credit ratings, and 
associated increases in interest costs. Some companies are reporting 
losses and reducing dividends for the first time in decades—since 
the depths of the Great Depression in some cases. Managements 
stressing "survival strategy" are reducing corporate staff, and 
contracting operations by selling or closing divisions. The used 
equipment market has been hit by auctions of items from closed 
plants, especially in the farm and construction equipment sector. 
Capital expenditure programs commonly are being cut back, even when 
acquisitions would greatly increase efficiency—e.g. automated 
office systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Price Cutting
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Widespread price cutting prevails to an extent 
unknown since the 1930s. Discounting is especially "horrendous" in 
steel, nonferrous metals, and building materials. Railroads and 
truckers are engaged in "rate wars" now possible under deregulation. 
Retailers are offering sharp cuts from list on "designer" apparel, 
appliances, and current books. There are also numerous retail 
bankruptcy or "liquidation" sales, some of which seem to be on a 
sustaining basis. Meanwhile, costs of utility services, local taxes, 
insurance, and medical care continue to advance at a rapid pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      October auto sales declined substantially from 
September after seasonal adjustment. After several reductions in 
plans, fourth quarter auto output will be well below last year's 
poor level. Truck output will be about even. U.S. output is even 
weaker than sales because of increased net imports of "domestic" 
vehicles from Canada--about four times last year's rate. Independent 
suppliers of parts are in deep trouble. Major captive finance 
companies recently reduced finance charges substantially. Some banks 
also advertise lower charges, but most banks are not vigorously 
seeking auto loans. Although auto dealers attack high interest 
charges as the main impediment to sales, many potential customers 
are deterred by high prices and concern over reliability of new 
domestic models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's important capital goods industries are 
in a crisis. Some large, diversified firms are drastically 
contracting operations. Some have stopped making certain parts in 
favor of purchases from outside. Plant closings appear to be 
accelerating. Almost without exception, demand for capital goods is 
weak with no sign of improvement, not even for parts and operating 
supplies which usually signal the early stages of an uptrend. Some 
capital goods producers anticipate no significant change for the 
better until well into 1983—perhaps into 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for steel has declined further against normal seasonal 
trends. Chicago-area steel plants are operating at 50-55 percent of 
capacity compared to 38 percent for the industry. Chicago and 
Detroit have been producing 40 percent of the nation's new steel, up 
from 31 percent a year ago. Partly this reflects less import 
penetration in the Midwest, but also relatively more efficient 
plants. Motor vehicle demand for steel, counted upon earlier to 
boost total output in the current quarter, is being reduced further. 
Oil and gas industry demand, insatiable a year ago, is now the 
weakest sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home builders report an increase in both traffic and 
confirmed sales in the past six weeks. Mortgage rates have declined 
about three points since last spring. Because of cold weather 
housing starts in the District will not be helped by easier mortgage 
credit until next spring. The recent expansion of S&amp;L powers to make 
consumer installment loans and business loans may direct a 
substantial portion of any savings inflows away from housing. 
Officials of some very large S&amp;Ls have vowed never to get "into that 
fix again"—i.e. total reliance on long-term assets funded by short-
term liabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Progress of the District's large crop harvests varies 
widely. Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan harvesting is well ahead of 
normal. In Iowa and Wisconsin, however, harvesting is behind 
schedule. Crop prices are seriously depressed, reflecting the record 
harvest and reduced projections of both domestic utilization and 
export demand. Depressed conditions in agriculture continue to exert 
downward pressure on farmland values. District agricultural bankers 
report that farmland values declined 5 percent in the third quarter, 
and 16 percent in the year ending in September. Further declines are 
expected, in part reflecting financial pressures that are forcing 
some farmers to liquidate capital assets.
