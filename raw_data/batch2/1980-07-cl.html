      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Fourth District continued to decline 
sharply in June as the recession begins to affect business spending. 
Most respondents expect the recession to bottom out late this year, 
followed by a sluggish recovery in early 1981. The summer months 
will likely be marked by inventory liquidation. The worst of the 
decline in consumer spending appears over, but new car sales are 
expected to remain relatively flat until the introduction of new 
fuel-efficient models later this year. Loan demand, according to 
District bankers, continues to be weak across-the-board. Housing 
remains depressed, despite significant reductions in mortgage rates 
and improved deposit flows into S&amp;Ls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists who attended the Fourth District Economists Round Table 
meeting held at this Bank on June 13 have revised their forecasts of 
real GNP downward since the March meeting. Although virtually all of 
the 27 economists who attended the meeting forecast a sharp decline, 
only four expected an equally sharp recovery. The median forecast of 
the group shows a 7.3% annual rate of decline in real GNP in the 
second quarter, 4.3% decline in the third quarter, 1.6% decline in 
the fourth quarter, and a recovery at annual rates of 1.3% and 4.7% 
in the first and second quarters of 1981, respectively. Next 
quarter's anticipated reduction in real GNP is largely associated 
with a decline in inventory investment and a further contraction in 
residential construction. However, a higher level of consumer 
spending from the second quarter is anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Generally, most officials believe capital spending plans for 1980 
are unlikely to be adjusted downward unless cash flow weakens more 
than is now expected. Although several capital goods producers 
report no adjustment in spending plans, there is concern that a cash 
flow squeeze could result in some cutbacks in the period ahead. 
However, some firms directly affected by weakness in consumer 
spending have already begun to cut back capital spending because of 
poor operating rates and a poor profit outlook. A rubber and 
chemical producer reports that capital spending for 1980 is being 
cut to $200 million from $300 million because of poor earnings and 
projected sluggish growth for rubber products. A steel producer has 
announced another postponement of a $280 million project for its 
Ohio facility because of a poor profit outlook and is planning to 
trim a $400 million capital spending program for 1980 by $50 to $100 
million.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some liquidation of inventories is expected to get underway 
following a sudden step-up in inventory accumulation in recent 
months. Generally, most respondents believe that inventories are not 
nearly as out of line with desired levels as they were in 1974-1975. 
General merchandise inventories rose sharply between March and May, 
according to a major retailer, and inventories are now at least 6% 
higher than desired and will be promptly liquidated during the 
summer months. Adjustment of soft-goods inventories is expected to 
be completed by the end of summer, but will take longer for 
furniture and appliances. Passenger tire stocks are still considered 
lean at the plant and distributor level. One producer has offered 
dealer incentives to build stocks, but dealers have preferred to 
keep inventories low until sales pick up. Inventories of steel mill 
products are judged to be excessive and are already being worked 
down by capital goods as well as consumer goods users of steel. 
Energy stocks, especially petroleum products and coal, are judged to 
be more than ample. The buildup in crude oil and gasoline stocks 
until recent months was planned because of uncertainties in world 
oil markets, but large stocks will contribute to an easing in 
utilization rates to the low 70s through the balance of 1980.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending appears to have bottomed out. Sales of small 
appliances continue to show surprising strength in recent months, 
according to a consumer durables producer, while declines in major 
appliances have been quite sharp. Nondurable goods are experiencing 
a return to more traditional spending patterns, with a greater 
willingness among consumers to spend without the influence of price 
hedging. Although auto sales have remained very weak throughout 
June, a producer and some major auto dealers report that June sales 
will be higher than May. Recent improvements are partly attributed 
to lower installment lending rates on direct auto loans, but lending 
rates throughout the District have not fallen much from highs in 
March. Heavy discounting, except for slow-moving standard-size cars, 
have been avoided, according to an area dealer, because of the low 
volume of sales generally. Several auto dealers remark that sales 
will be flat until new model cars appear in the fall. Otherwise, 
recovery in sales will be delayed until spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for consumer and industrial loans remains very weak. Several 
bankers report that consumer credit demand continues to decline 
virtually across the board, despite some easing of credit terms. 
Installment rates have not been lowered very much thus far. One area 
banker states that lower auto loan rates could not be justified 
because they would not induce additional demand to offset the profit 
squeeze, and alternative investments offer better returns than auto 
loans. A Pennsylvania banker states that interest rates on consumer 
loans never rose much because of usury laws in that state, and when 
they were finally modified, demand had already begun to weaken. 
Although some borrowing to finance inventory may be occurring, a 
banker expects C&amp;I loans to remain soft for the rest of the year, as 
large corporations continue to issue commercial paper and small 
businesses fail to qualify for bank credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks and S&amp;Ls in the District uniformly report strong growth in 
savings and time deposits in June. With mortgage loan rates in the 
range of 11% to 13%, borrower demand has shown little improvement. A 
large S&amp;L in Cleveland recently introduced a 9 3/4% mortgage rate 
for a 1-year rollover mortgage. Lenders note an increase in 
inquiries in response to reduced mortgage rates, but not much pickup 
in commitments and loans, nor do they generally expect a significant 
pickup for the time being. However, one S&amp;L official reports loans 
are currently in a $6 to $8 million range compared with a more 
typical $25 to $30 million range, but hopes the recent pickup in 
inquiries and applications will lead to a $15 to $20 million loan 
month in the near future. An economist with a regional FHLB in this 
District asserts that some lenders are reluctant to make commitments 
and loans, and instead, they choose to rebuild liquidity and repay 
advances from the FHLB. Apparently, some associations are intent on 
reporting a profit as soon as possible following a disastrous first 
quarter and perhaps first half.
