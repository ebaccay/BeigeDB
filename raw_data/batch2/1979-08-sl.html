     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        According to Eighth District businessmen, sluggish economic 
  conditions continue in a number of important area industries. Real 
  consumer spending and manufacturing output remain unchanged from a 
  month ago. Sales of automobiles, appliances, and some chemicals 
  remain quite slow. On the other hand, capital goods manufacturing 
  and nonresidential construction continue strong. Some reports, 
  however, indicate a reduction in the growth of demand for capital 
  equipment. Although layoffs of industrial workers have occurred in 
  the automobile and certain durable goods industries, layoffs are not 
  generally contemplated by most businessmen at present.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumer spending remained relatively low in recent weeks. On 
  balance, July department store sales in real terms were about the 
  same as in June but down from July 1978. Department store 
  representatives noted that sales of big-ticket items were well off 
  their 1978 pace. Only selected items, such as products for home 
  repair, registered gains. A major retail chain representative noted 
  that sales at large conventional stores were holding up better than 
  at discount stores. Retail representatives also noted increased 
  difficulties in collecting accounts and a sharp rise in personal 
  bankruptcies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Automobile sales are down from year-ago levels, but reports from 
  some dealers indicate that sales improved somewhat in the past two 
  weeks. Sales increases at fast food establishments were also 
  reported to have slowed substantially in recent weeks. An industry 
  representative blamed this slowdown on the recent sharp increases in 
  their product prices rather than the gasoline problem. Spending on 
  tourism was also reported to be well below normal, having adverse 
  impacts on local areas largely dependent upon this business. Tight 
  gasoline supplies and consumer uncertainty over gasoline 
  availability are blamed for the decline. However, the gasoline 
  supply situation in the District has eased considerably in recent 
  weeks. Service station hours have increased and the long lines of a 
  few weeks ago have disappeared.
       </p>
       <p>
        Output in the manufacturing sector, on balance, appears to have 
  remained unchanged in recent weeks. Declines have occurred in 
  automobile and related industries, appliances, home furnishings, and 
  building products. But production of chemicals used by the oil 
  industry and agriculture and a number of home supplies remain 
  strong. One major chemical firm reported that the recent slowing in 
  sales probably indicates a recession. This firm is cutting back on 
  production schedules to avoid a buildup of inventories. A firm 
  manufacturing apparel for a major retail chain noted that orders 
  have been lower than expected and that production schedules have 
  been trimmed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods manufacturing activity is still quite strong and large 
  order backlogs remain unfilled. However, one large capital goods 
  firm noted that the outlook for this sector is not as favorable as 
  two or three months ago. Some manufacturing firms in the chemical 
  and appliance industries have trimmed their capital expenditures 
  budget in expectation of a sluggish economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        So far only a few industries have announced a layoff of workers. 
  Among the most affected by layoffs have been the automobile and 
  related industries. Scattered reports of layoffs were also reported 
  in the appliance and apparel industries. However, most firms with 
  sales declines apparently are coping with this situation by reducing 
  hours worked.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction activity continues at a high level in the District 
  despite sizable declines in residential housing. The volume of 
  nonresidential construction continues well above year-ago levels in 
  most of the District, although some weakness has apparently 
  developed in the St. Louis area. Here, nonresidential contracts let 
  in the second quarter were well below year-ago levels. 
  Representatives of the residential housing market noted that home 
  sales in recent weeks have also been well below year-ago levels. 
  Homebuilders report that current traffic looking for new homes is 
  very light, but that more of those looking are serious home buyers. 
  Housing permits issued in the St. Louis area so far this year are 
  down about one-fourth from a year ago. Carpenter hours worked were 
  reported to be down only about 10 percent from a year ago, which 
  indicates that builders are working on earlier orders.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the financial sector, some net savings inflows into financial 
  institutions occurred in July, but the rate of increase remains at a 
  much slower pace than a year ago. Savings and loan officials report 
  that money market certificates are the primary means of attracting 
  new funds. However, they have been less successful in attracting 
  these funds since the regulation change removed the differential 
  rate paid by S and Ls over similar instruments issued by banks. The 
  new usury law in Missouri, which was passed by the state legislature 
  in June and which permits higher interest rates on loans, became 
  effective in early July. Home mortgage rates in St. Louis have 
  subsequently increased to a range of 10-7/8 to 11-1/4% for 80 
  percent loans, in line with national rates. Subsequently, 
  availability of mortgage funds was reported to have improved and the 
  terms of loans relaxed somewhat.
