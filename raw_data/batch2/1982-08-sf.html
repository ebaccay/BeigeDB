      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy slipped deeper into recession during 
the past month and further near-term weakness appears to be in 
prospect. Consumer spending declined in July at both department 
stores and new car dealerships, and reports for early August suggest 
no improvement. Homebuilding continues to pick up gradually, but 
from an extremely depressed level. Moreover, the large inventory of 
unsold homes and recent Supreme Court ruling permitting Federally-
chartered S &amp; L's to enforce the due-on-sale clause on outstanding 
mortgages suggest that any further recovery this year will be 
negligible. Meanwhile, commercial construction is slowing. In the 
manufacturing and mining sectors, a number of industries cut back 
production further in July and announced further curtailments for 
August to reduce excess inventory. In the agricultural sector, the 
relationship between farm costs and prices continues to deteriorate. 
At Twelfth District banks, real estate loans outstanding continue to 
grow, but for reasons related to hardship among builders and 
households rather than strength in construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The long-expected consumer led recovery does not appear to have 
materialized in the Twelfth District. Respondents report that retail 
sales dropped in July and barely exceeded the year-ago level in 
nominal terms. The decline was noted for both department stores and 
automobile dealerships selling new cars. In fact, car dealers 
reported July sales activity as the worse yet during this recession. 
In the face of rising unemployment, high interest rates and an 
uncertain future outlook, consumers still appear to be exhibiting 
extremely cautious spending behavior. A slow tourist season also is 
adversely affecting retail business. Meanwhile, retail profits are 
depressed, bankruptcies are rising, and managers are scaling back 
plans for purchasing fall merchandise. Even grocery store sales are 
reported to be sliding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many basic Twelfth District manufacturing and mining industries cut 
back production and employment further in July. In the Pacific 
Northwest, the lumber industry sank deeper into depression as the 
renewed weakness in national housing starts further reduced orders 
and prices. The paper industry also experienced further weakness in 
orders, not only from domestic but foreign customers. The Boeing 
Company in Seattle continued to reduce its payrolls in response to 
order cancellations for commercial aircraft, also forcing further 
curtailments at Pacific Northwest aluminum plants. In the 
Intermountain states, cutbacks were especially severe in the copper 
industry where producers in Arizona and Utah reduced mine production 
to only about 55 percent of capacity. Efforts to arrest the 
worldwide accumulation of excess inventory have been unsuccessful 
due to rising foreign production and depressed demand from such 
industries as automobile manufacturing and construction. As a 
result, further curtailments are planned for August. In Californiaâ€”a state which traditionally outperforms the nationâ€”the 
unemployment rate reached an all-time high of 10.5 percent in July. 
Particularly notable has been another recent wave of layoffs in the 
semiconductor industry which once again is facing excess inventory 
due to depressed business capital spending for such products as 
computers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The slight improvement in Twelfth District homebuilding activity 
that began in the spring appears to be continuing. But residential 
construction activity in the region is still even more depressed 
relative to a year ago than activity nationally. Moreover, the 
recent pace of residential building permit activity virtually 
guarantees that any further improvement this year will be 
negligible. There are other factors that suggest this outcome. 
First, the inventory of new and old unsold homes has continued to 
rise. Second, a large proportion of sales in recent months has been 
through some form of creative financing, and the recent Supreme 
Court decision allowing Federally-chartered S&amp;L's to enforce the 
due-on-sale clause will end the assumption of mortgages originally 
issued by those institutions. Meanwhile, nonresidential construction 
expenditures are slowing dramatically as a result of rising vacancy 
rates and cutbacks in private and public capital spending. Vacancy 
rates in office buildings and shopping centers are reported to be 
rising. For example, in San Francisco, about 10 percent of the 
city's first class office space is vacant.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices for important Twelfth District agricultural crops and 
livestock products have shown mixed patterns recently. Prices for 
fruits and vegetables generally have increased, while prices for 
cattle and grains have moved lower. But, in general, the 
relationship between farm prices and costs has continued to 
deteriorate, both relative to earlier months in 1982 and a year 
earlier. Moreover, the outlook for improvement in net income later 
this year is not favorable, given the bumper crops in prospect. 
Adding to the industry's problems, the rising foreign exchange value 
of the dollar and slowdown in overseas economies have been acting to 
reduce agricultural exports. Due to declining net income, the 
industry's demand for credit has been increasing substantially while 
its creditworthiness has been deteriorating.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      July data show no significant change in total bankcredit from the 
month earlier. Real estate loans outstanding were the only major 
component to exhibit strength, although growth there was slower than 
a year ago. Growth in mortgage loans continues to reflect a lower 
rate of turnover of properties and consequent slower pace of 
repayments on outstanding loans, as well as the continued expansion 
of credit needs for commercial projects already in progress. Slow 
sales of new housing units and high long-term interest rates also 
are forcing builders to restructure existing debt and to turn 
increasingly to short-term bank borrowing. Residential loans 
outstanding also continue to grow because homeowners find home 
equity loans (seconds) attractive and because banks have been 
offering below-market financing on new homes to help move the excess 
inventory of builders to whom they have extended construction 
financing.
