      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor market conditions continue to improve but the 
unemployment rate remains high. Retail sales gains slowed in 
February and are expected to slow further in March. Manufacturing 
activity apparently increased less rapidly in February than in 
January. Purchasing agents report a few products in short supply, 
and firms in several key industries report some operations are at or 
near capacity limits. Nevertheless, many firms are reluctant to add 
to capacity. Lenders and builders report little increase in demand 
for mortgage loans and new houses. Commercial and industrial loan 
demand continues to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in this District improved further in 
January. The unemployment rate in Ohio fell to 9.3% (s.a.) in 
January from 10.4% in December. In the last year Ohio's unemployment 
rate fell 4.7 percentage points while the U.S. rate fell 2.2 
percentage points. Nevertheless, the Ohio unemployment rate is still 
1.3 percentage points above the national rate. Unemployment rates in 
eleven major SMSAs in the Fourth District in December ranged from 
8.1% (nsa) in Columbus to 13.3% in Youngstown.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An economist with a national retail chain reports year-over-year 
sales gains slowed in February, and March sales should slow further 
even after allowance for Easter being later this year than last. He 
forecasts consumer spending to grow slower next quarter than this.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to increase in February but at a 
somewhat slower pace than in January. Surveys of purchasing managers 
in the Cleveland and Cincinnati areas for February indicate 
production, new orders and backlogs rose from January. Employment 
rose from January but firms are increasing overtime, using temporary 
help, and only slowly recalling laid-off workers. Inventory levels 
for raw materials and supplies rose from January in Cleveland but 
fell in Cincinnati while finished goods inventories are unchanged. 
Respondents report lead times are lengthening for several products 
and suppliers are allocating inadequate supplies of integrated 
circuits, circuit breakers, coated paper, and stainless steel rod 
and wire. Buyers expect allocations to be imposed for shipping 
cartons and some fasteners.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capacity Utilization
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major firms in several key industries report operations approaching 
capacity but few plan to increase capacity or to bring marginal 
facilities into production. There is also a preference to use 
overtime or to subcontract rather than to recall workers. There is 
skepticism that the expansion will continue long enough to justify 
new capacity, and a reluctance to add capacity to meet peak demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two major tire producers report operating at capacity (running as 
many shifts per week as labor unions will agree to), and one is 
purchasing tires from competitors to meet customer demand. Capital 
spending is being used to improve efficiency. Some capacity is still 
available at other domestic tire producers, and growth of imports 
has restrained price increases. Nevertheless, prices have begun to 
firm and industry sources suggest that another price increase is 
likely in the months immediately ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      A paper box producer reports the industry's capacity utilization is 
in the mid-90s%. Some bottlenecks have appeared but the industry can 
increase production a little more before physical limits of output 
are reached.
     </p>
     <p>
      A chemical producer reports ample capacity in that industry, weak 
prices, and little interest in adding new capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The auto industry has plenty of additional capacity to produce some 
compact and subcompact cars but is operating close to capacity for 
mid- and standard-sized cars. The industry doesn't plan to reopen 
marginal plants because they expect demand to ease as the year 
progresses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Truck producers report light truck (particularly 4-wheel drive) 
production at capacity, and shortages of axles because supplier 
capacity was cut during the recession. Heavy-duty truck production 
is at 90% of capacity, but one parts producer expects demand to fall 
in the second half of the year after a special sales incentive has 
ended. Medium truck production is at 70% of capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aluminum smelting industry is operating at about 83% of physical 
capacity. Prices have been flat since September. Demand for aluminum 
is stronger than demand for steel because aluminum is used more 
extensively in consumer products.
     </p>
     <p>
      The steel industry is operating at 77% of capacity overall but 
production of flat-rolled steel, used in cars and major appliances, 
is at full capacity, and flat bar production is at full capacity at 
some mills. There is ample capacity to expand production of other 
steel items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Electrical equipment producers are experiencing weak demand because 
electric utilities have ample capacity and the machine tool 
industry, a major customer, is having a relatively mild recovery. 
Producers of electronics are experiencing very strong demand. 
Producers of electronic chips and chip-making equipment are 
operating near capacity and are planning capacity expansions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite the recent strength in housing activity nationwide, Fourth 
District lenders and home builders generally report little increase 
in demand for mortgage loans and new houses so far this year. 
Although the acceptance of adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) by 
consumers has increased (probably because the spread relative to 
conventional mortgage rates has increased to as much as 300 basis 
points at some lenders), speculation that government borrowing will 
increase interest rates has tempered demand for these instruments. 
Refinancing of existing mortgages appears to have slowed sharply 
from last year. First-time home-buyers appear to be seeking 
financing through builders that offer buydowns and below-market 
rates, while banks are servicing more of the move-up market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two commercial and industrial building contractors in the Cleveland 
area expressed optimism for 1984. Although the vacancy rate of newly 
constructed buildings is still relatively high, they expect that 
tile glut of space will be substantially reduced by yearend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial loan demand, 
continued to increase at banks in the Fourth District in recent 
weeks. Demand, savings and small time deposits have increased only 
moderately. Banks have funded loan demand by stepping up their 
issuance of large denomination negotiable CD's and by reducing their 
holdings of short term Treasury securities and sales of Federal 
Funds.
