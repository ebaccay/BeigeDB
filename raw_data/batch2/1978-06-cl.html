      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Fourth District economists who met recently at this Bank expect that 
  the expansion will continue at least into the first half of 1979 
  unless economic policies become restrictive. Auto producers remain 
  optimistic over sales prospects for that industry although some 
  retailers expect a sharp slowing in consumer spending next half. 
  Only scattered signs of bottlenecks and shortages are reported, 
  despite operating rates in some key industries approaching effective 
  capacity. Though bankers are satisfied with consumer response to the 
  six-month savings certificates, the bulk of certificates represents 
  a shift of funds from existing deposits rather than new money.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty-five economists attending the bank meeting on the economic 
  outlook slightly scaled down expectations for growth in output but 
  raised them for inflation this year. The median forecast of the 
  group indicated second-half gains in real GNP at about a 3.5 percent 
  annual rate, followed by a 2.5 percent annual rate of increase in 
  the first half of 1979. They expect the rate of inflation to 
  increase by about a 6.5 percent annual rate from the third quarter 
  of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 and moderate to 6.1 percent in 
  the second quarter of 1979. While the expansion is expected to 
  continue into 1979, one economist forecasts a mild decline for two 
  successive quarters during the first half of 1979 and three of the 
  group expect either no growth or a small decline in early 1979, 
  followed by a pickup the second quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expectations for consumer spending are mixed. An economist with a 
  major automotive producer expects that total auto sales this year 
  will amount to 11.3 million units and moderate to about a 10.8 
  million annual rate during the first half of 1979. He explained that 
  consumer installment repayments relative to disposable income are 
  not high by historical standards and that consumers have been using 
  capital gains in housing to help finance purchases. New car sales 
  have held up longer and at a higher rate than he expected in part 
  because of prebuying in anticipation of rising prices and the belief 
  that 1978 models represent the last of the big cars. A less 
  optimistic viewpoint was expressed by an economist with a major 
  national department store chain. He expects considerable slowing in
  the pace of consumer spending during the second half of 1978. A 
  further gradual pickup in the personal saving rate, continued high 
  rates of inflation at about a 7.5 percent annual rate by the end of 
  this year, and an expansion of consumer installment debt are 
  expected to contribute to a reduced rate of spending.
       </p>
       <p>
        Economists expect generally that the rate of increase in fixed 
  investment over the coming four quarters will be about the same as 
  in the past four quarters. Some pointed out that orders in their 
  industries, including heavy-duty trucks, printing and communication, 
  and electrical equipment, are no longer accelerating, even though 
  the volume of orders is well above a year earlier. Machine tool 
  orders this year are well above a year earlier but are not 
  accelerating. However, one economist expects larger gains in fixed 
  investment over the next four quarters because commercial and other 
  nonmanufacturing building contracts have been rising rapidly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Officials and economists report only scattered shortages of labor, 
  plant capacity, or materials, although operating rates are at or 
  near effective capacity in a number of key industries, including 
  primary metals, machine tools, building materials, and paper and 
  paperboard. While shortages are not widespread, backlogs have been 
  rising and delivery schedules have been lengthening in several 
  industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most shortages are in construction, particularly for insulating 
  materials and drywall. There are complaints of railcoal car 
  shortages. A capital goods producer complained about extended 
  delivery in machine tools hindered his company's expansion program. 
  Despite scattered shortages, several economists caution that demand 
  and price pressures can surface anywhere along a supply schedule and 
  not necessarily when operating rates are at capacity. Production of 
  paper is at capacity and paperboard operations are at about 98 
  percent of effective capacity, but no shortages of labor and 
  materials are reported. Some auto producers are operating above 
  capacity on popular models without bottlenecks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Others caution that effective productive capacity is often different 
  from published capacity. For the past month, steel has been 
  operating at about 92 percent of effective capacity, a level that 
  approaches full capacity because a higher operating rate would 
  require violation of environmental regulations. A major aluminum 
  producer also has been operating virtually at capacity. On the other 
  hand, a major producer of fiberglass insulation is operating at 105 
  percent of capacity and expects to operate at full capacity at least 
  until additional new capacity becomes available later this year. He 
  points out that the 600 additional suppliers of cellulose since the 
  end of 1977 are providing new capacity for insulating materials. But 
  the relevance of this capacity is unknown since government standards 
  on insulation are being tightened.
       </p>
       <p>
        Public response to the new savings certificates was rather mixed, 
  according to officials with major district banks. S&amp;Ls; appear to 
  have promoted the certificates more aggressively than the banks. 
  Generally, all ten banks contacted are offering six-month 
  certificates at maximum rates, with a few compounding daily and the 
  others compounding monthly or quarterly. All banks are offering 
  maximum rates on eight-year certificates. Some are compounding 
  quarterly for deposits of $5,000 or less and others monthly for 
  deposits exceeding $5,000. All but two of the banks described their 
  advertising as heavy, but some feel their programs are not as 
  aggressive as S&amp;Ls. Consumer response to the six-month certificate 
  is described as very good or favorable by most banks. On the other 
  hand, response to the eight-year certificate has been slow. Still, 
  one of the largest district banks reported that the eight-year CDs 
  made up about 20 percent of its total volume of certificates. 
  Bankers do not plan to change their promotional programs, except for 
  one bank that indicates that after the June 30 interest payment date 
  they will more aggressively promote six-month certificates. Only two 
  banks reported that the bulk of the certificate sales represented 
  new money. Some of the largest banks state that as much as 75 
  percent to 90 percent of funds obtained represented a shift from 
  existing deposits. Most bankers feel the new certificates will not 
  do much to improve the net flow of deposits over the next six 
  months.
