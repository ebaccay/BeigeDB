      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 14, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial officers and economists in the Fourth District generally 
are more optimistic than a month ago, although they are reluctant to 
increase forecasts of output. Retailers of general merchandise are 
cautiously optimistic that Christmas sales will show larger gains 
than a year ago, but softness in auto sales concerns suppliers. 
Capital-goods producers believe capital spending for the first half 
of 1978 will exceed latest estimates by the Department of Commerce. 
Steel operations are picking up gradually. Although material 
shortages are delaying new housing completions, mortgage loan demand 
remains strong.
      <p>
       Despite the recent spate of favorable business news, economists have 
  not revised upward their projections of output for either the first 
  half of 1978 or the entire year. Those who look for stronger gains 
  than 4 to 5 per cent annual rates of increase in real GNP feel that 
  the latest data corroborate their more optimistic projections. 
  Others, who are less optimistic, believe developments that would 
  accelerate consumer and business spending have not improved 
  sufficiently to justify scaling up their projections. Skepticism 
  centers on sales prospects for the auto industry and on acceleration 
  of fixed investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers view Christmas sales with cautious optimism. One 
  department store executive believes that sales gains this season 
  will exceed last year's increase. Prior to recent heavy snowfalls, 
  sales were strong. Unconcerned that consumer debt was burdensome, 
  this economist indicated that the retailer will continue to 
  encourage credit sales, which now make up about 58 per cent of total 
  sales. An economist with a major national chain of department stores 
  had expected November retail sales to fall from October levels 
  because of weakness in auto and general merchandise sales. He now 
  estimates that December sales will rise by 1 to 1.5 per cent over 
  November and that PCE will increase at an annual rate of 8.5 per 
  cent this quarter, not much more than last quarter's increase. 
  Growth in real sales is being limited because consumers are saving a 
  higher proportion of their disposable income. The strongest retail 
  gains have been in lumber and building materials, reflecting home 
  maintenance and remodeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto producers and auto suppliers view recent softening in auto 
  sales differently. An economist with a major producer still 
  forecasts a 9.3 million rate of sales for 1978. GMC officials 
  project domestic new car sales of 9.7 million, but one supplier 
  reported GMC recently has shaved its production schedules for the 
  first quarter 1978 by 21/2 per cent. Some suppliers, skeptical of 
  what they consider to be unrealistic sales forecasts of 
  producers, expect auto sales in 1978 at around 8.8 to 9.0 million 
  units. While suppliers of flat glass, tires, steel and body frames 
  report little or no cutbacks in orders from Ford, a major tire 
  producer reported that GMC has cut back orders for tires for 
  intermediate-size cars. Chrysler also has reduced tire orders as a 
  result of production cutbacks because of excessive new car 
  inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officials and economists associated with capital-goods industries 
  generally believe that real capital spending during the first half 
  of 1978 probably will increase more than the latest Department of 
  Commerce survey indicates. Although no one expects a boom in capital 
  spending, some contend that the Department of Commerce estimates are 
  too conservative for even the moderate growth in output expected 
  next year. Still others thought that the timing of the survey may 
  have affected business expectations. One producer who earlier 
  predicted a 6 to 7 per cent increase in real spending in 1978, now 
  believes only a sizable business tax reduction, enacted early in the 
  year, could bring about such increased spending. Some expect a 
  slower rate of gain in fixed investment next year because of a 
  moderated pace of spending by the utilities and petroleum and 
  automotive industries. A producer of transmissions and axles for 
  heavy-duty trucks looks for a slower rate of expansion in both 
  output and shipments next year, in spite of record orders. 
  Similarly, machine tool orders and shipments are not expected to 
  rise as rapidly in 1978 as this year. Others expect gains in 
  spending early next year to be at rates at least equal to or 
  stronger than 1977, especially in such nondurables as food, paper, 
  and chemicals and some nonmanufacturing, especially communication. 
  Lack of confidence and uncertainty are hindering fixed investment 
  and more rapid economic growth, according to one of this Bank's 
  directors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel sources remain more optimistic than just a few months ago. 
  Orders continue to strengthen, as indicated by a higher volume for 
  December deliveries than received for a comparable period in 
  November. January orders are also somewhat stronger than for a 
  comparable period in December. This quarter's steel shipments will 
  approximately match last quarter's, and shipments next quarter 
  should rise about 5 to 10 per cent from the fourth quarter, 
  according to one steel economist. Steel sources attribute 
  strengthening primarily to termination of steel inventory 
  liquidation and to a drop in imports, one that is partly seasonal 
  and partly because of the problems relating to recent charges of 
  dumping. One steel economist projects that production could rise to 
  as much as 85 per cent of capacity next quarter, compared with about 
  a 75 per cent operating rate this quarter. Some economists suggest 
  that domestic industry is being forced to accept the reference 
  pricing of steel as an alternative to enforcement of anti-dumping 
  laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventories are not judged to be excessive, but excess stocks of 
  some types of automobiles, chemical products and petroleum products 
  will likely restrain gain in output. One retailer estimates that 
  stocks of consumer goods are about 5 per cent higher than warranted 
  by sales, but he expects that aggressive pre-Christmas sales 
  promotions will help bring stocks into line with actual and 
  projected sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some coal producers appear less certain about the duration of the 
  coal strike than they did a month ago. One director of this Bank 
  expects a strike of at least two but not more than three months, at 
  which time union funds will be exhausted. The work stoppage is not 
  expected to affect users for at least two months, since half the 
  industry is unaffected by the strike and coal inventories are 
  adequate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers note continued strength in deposits, while S&amp;Ls still are 
  experiencing a reduced flow of deposits, especially for savings 
  accounts. Mortgage loan demand remains strong and has contributed to 
  firming in mortgage rates in some areas, according to one director. 
  Building materials shortages have hampered completion of new housing 
  starts, and one mortgage lender reported that builders have noted 
  easing in lumber prices from last summer's highs.
