      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Continuing attenuation of the economic recovery is evidenced in the 
  past month's reports. Despite some recent increases in soft goods 
  sales, merchants generally expect holiday gains no greater than a 
  normal seasonal advance. There is some feeling that the recent boost 
  may be the result of abnormally cold weather in combination with 
  price reductions rather than an upsurge of demand. Sales of 
  appliances and furniture differ in strength between regions, but 
  auto sales are generally good. Production declines have occurred in 
  several key industries, as efforts to realign inventories have 
  reduced demand. Some strengthening is discernible in capital 
  expenditures. Single-family housing continues to dominate 
  construction activity. Price reductions are occurring in those 
  industries seeking to reduce inventories, but other firms are 
  hedging against wage and price controls by raising prices. Credit 
  demand is generally flat, with certain exceptions reflecting special 
  conditions. The agricultural sector presents a picture of marked 
  contrasts in prosperity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The degree of optimism concerning consumer spending has diminished 
  somewhat. Most areas expect a normal seasonal gain during the 
  holiday season. Soft goods sales, which have been weak, were helped 
  by the arrival of colder weather and recent price markdowns. 
  Philadelphia notes that outerwear sales have risen in advance of 
  their normal seasonal upswing due to the cold weather. Dallas notes 
  some price resistance in men's clothing lines. Major appliance and 
  furniture sales are weak in the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis 
  Districts but have strengthened in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas 
  City regions. Merchants remain hopeful but uncertain about further 
  strengthening. Auto sales appear to be fairly strong, except for 
  smaller models; San Francisco and Cleveland note some signs of 
  weakness. Chicago views strongly increased consumer borrowing as a 
  confirmation of growing consumer confidence; similar trends are 
  noted by New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond. Dallas reports 
  lackluster consumer loan demand and, like San Francisco, interprets 
  high savings inflows as an indicator of consumer caution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production declines have taken place in several industries. Steel 
  output has been reduced to limit an inventory build-up; but 
  increasing orders for some types of steel are found by Chicago and 
  Richmond. Appliance production has been sharply reduced in the 
  Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland Districts. Declines are also noted 
  in output of paper and board, plastics, and aluminum. Orders are 
  down for lumber, apparel, chemicals, and furniture. Copper, lead, 
  and zinc output has risen in the western states. Lift truck 
  inventories have stabilized, and orders recently have been 
  increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increasing strength is detectable in capital expenditures. Boston, 
  Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis note increased orders for machine 
  tools. New York cites an increase in new orders for capital goods at 
  a number of firms, but Philadelphia finds a decrease in the 
  proportion of firms planning further increases in capital outlays. 
  New York mentions environmental and other government regulations, as 
  well as the threat of wage and price controls as deterrents to 
  capacity expansion. Atlanta and San Francisco report that capital 
  expenditures by paper companies will be very limited in the 
  foreseeable future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity continues to be strongest in the single-family 
  home category. Housing starts are at a high level in Texas, and 
  construction employment has expanded rapidly during the past year. 
  Home building in the St. Louis area is strong, but a decline has 
  occurred in Memphis, other parts of Tennessee, and Mississippi. In 
  the Los Angeles area, home construction is very strong, but average 
  monthly price increases of nearly 3 percent are now generating buyer 
  resistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price reductions are occurring in sectors where inventory 
  accumulations are excessive. In both steel and apparel, price 
  concessions are being made to stimulate demand. Lumber prices have 
  softened in the past two months. St. Louis states that chemical 
  prices should remain stable as a result of new capacity coming on-stream. Atlanta finds evidence that businesses are raising list 
  prices as a hedge against possible imposition of wage and price 
  controls. Shortages and bottlenecks are of little concern, partly as 
  a result of the economic slowdown. Some concern continues to be 
  expressed about natural gas shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for credit remains generally weak, with interesting regional 
  exceptions. Consumer loans provide an element of strength in several 
  areas. In the Southwest, lending for petroleum drilling is the sole 
  area of growth in loans. Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis report 
  that the demand for agricultural loans is rapidly increasing. Higher 
  costs and lower prices are forcing farmers and ranchers to seek 
  extensions of present loans. In wheat growing areas, many farmers 
  are withholding grain from the market to await higher prices. Dallas 
  notes that marginal farmers will find it difficult to obtain 
  operating capital unless Farmers' Home Administration or Small 
  Business Administration loan guarantees are granted. In contrast to 
  the general flatness reported in commercial and industrial loans, 
  San Francisco finds a modest increase in loan demand from small- and 
  medium-sized companies, and Richmond notes an increasing demand in 
  wholesale and retail trade.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agricultural sector presents a mixed impression. Farm cash 
  receipts in the Richmond region have benefited from sharp price 
  increases for flue-cured tobacco. Minneapolis reports that price 
  declines for corn, wheat, hogs, and cattle, as well as the effects 
  of drought on crop production, present a bleak prospect of lower 
  income, reduced spending, and increased borrowing. St. Louis and 
  Kansas City note that cattle ranchers and feeders remain in a loss 
  position, despite recent price increases. Land in the Southeast is 
  likely to be shifted from cattle production into other crops, with 
  the potential for an eventual beef shortage. San Francisco reports a 
  bountiful harvest; supplies of fruit, wheat, beans, and potatoes are 
  large, storage facilities are bulging, and prices have declined.
