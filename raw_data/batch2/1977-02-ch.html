     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Apart from the impact of severe weather, the stronger tone in 
  business activity that developed late last year in the district 
  continued in January. Retail sales were excellent in both December 
  and January. Inflation prospects have worsened, mainly because of 
  weather-related developments. The capital expenditure outlook 
  remains spotty, but some sectors report demand at high levels. 
  Construction forecasts have been increased. Farmland prices in the 
  district continue to rise at a rapid pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      One major result of the winter cold will be a new impetus to price 
  inflation. Production losses cover a wide range of goods, and uses 
  of alternative fuels and alternative transportation will increase 
  costs. One company has notified customers that an "emergency fuel 
  surcharge" will be added to the price of a product. Many special 
  deals to procure extra fuel supplies may not be fully reflected in 
  the usual price indexes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Natural gas curtailments have had their most serious impact in this 
  region in Indiana where the state labor service estimates that over 
  40,000 were out of work late last week. Motor vehicle assemblies in 
  Michigan have been reduced mainly because parts shipped from other 
  states were not available. Some layoffs have occurred in Wisconsin 
  when gas cutoffs were ordered at large firms. Many of these 
  companies have turned to alternate fuels which also are in short 
  supply, especially so in the case of propane.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers have been turning away from natural gas for several 
  years because of the high price as well as reduced availability. The 
  severity of the fuel problem varies by company rather than by 
  industry. For some the situation varies day by day. Some workers 
  laid off have been returned to work. Some gas curtailments have been 
  relaxed recently, at least for smaller customers. The steel industry 
  concentrated in Northern Indiana has been put on a "plant 
  protection" basis by gas utilities, probably through February. 
  (About 10 percent of the workforce has been laid off, but this could 
  worsen.) This was a surprise move after a partial cutback in 
  supplies. At one large plant there is no significant need for gas. 
  At other plants certain processes cannot be performed without gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fuel situation in this district is complicated by the fact that 
  waterways are frozen and barges carrying oil, coal, chemicals, salt, 
  and other products are either stopped or moving very slowly. The 
  problem has been helped in some cases by relaxing state regulations 
  on burning coal or oil with higher sulphur content. A large producer 
  of appliances in the Chicago area had indicated that it would be 
  forced to close if it were not allowed to burn a lower grade of oil.
     </p>
     <p>
      Railroads have been moving additional freight that normally moves by 
  barge. Also, piggyback traffic has increased. Rail movements have 
  been hampered by derailments and other cold-related developments. 
  Frozen coal in freight cars has prevented or slowed unloading.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales, both hard and soft goods, were strong in January, 
  following an excellent December. Weather-related items and auto 
  parts and supplies have been especially strong. For example, many 
  stores have sold out electric heaters, and do not expect new 
  shipments this season. Observers fear that big heating bills will 
  drain consumer purchasing power.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of cars slowed somewhat in late January, but this is expected 
  to be temporary. Stocks of small cars are excessive and a series of 
  cuts in production schedules have been necessary. Meanwhile, 
  overtime has been common for plants producing the most popular 
  standard-size and intermediate models. Sales of heavy trucks and 
  trailers have continued to improve and further gains are expected. 
  Machine tool producers expect to increase shipments substantially 
  this year, especially to the auto industry. Most industries expect 
  to increase capital expenditures this year. The tendency has been to 
  boost plans when adjustments are made. Orders for construction 
  equipment continue at a low level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasts of housing starts have been increased because of the large 
  supply of funds available in savings and loans and life insurance 
  companies. Many expect mortgage rates to decline this year even if 
  other rates rise. Some believe that single-family home construction 
  will be limited by supplies of building materials such as gypsum 
  board, insulation, and certain types of lumber. There are signs that 
  construction of commercial and manufacturing buildings will increase 
  also. Considerable repair and maintenance work will be required on 
  gas and water mains and other structures injured by frost.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farmland prices in the district increased by 6 percent in the fourth 
  quarter, according to our survey of bankers and were 28 percent 
  above year ago. The boom in prices started in late 1972 and has 
  accelerated. New classes of investors in farmland are helping to 
  boost prices.
