      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continues to slow from the 
vigorous levels earlier in the year, although many economic 
indicators remain above their levels of one year ago. Retail sales 
at major department stores remain healthy, but are at a flat or 
slightly slower pace than last month. Automobile sales have declined 
significantly since last month in certain parts of the region, but 
remain above 1983 levels. With the exception of California, most 
states in the District have experienced continued deterioration in 
residential building activity despite the moderation in mortgage 
rates. Non-residential construction activity, however, remains 
healthy. Increases in manufacturing employment have slowed and, in a 
few instances, unemployment rates are up from a month ago. The 
lumber and wood products industries in the Pacific Northwest remain 
particularly weak, with continued plant closures and activity levels 
in some products that remain below those in 1979. Weak foreign 
demand and large harvests has depressed significantly the prices for 
many agricultural products, threatening the income and solvency of 
western farms. Commercial loan demand remained cool but consumer 
loan demand appeared to be strong, leading some to anticipate strong 
holiday sales activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The rapid growth of retail sales experienced earlier in the year 
clearly has ceased, but sales volumes are healthy and most retailers 
are optimistic about the upcoming holiday buying season. The large 
department stores in Southern California, for example, experienced 
October sales volumes about 12 percent higher than a year earlier. 
Good weather in Oregon is credited with stimulating particularly 
strong retail sales and the Pacific Northwest generally reported 
increased retail sales volumes over last year. In Alaska, an 
actively promoted tourism program has provided stimulus to this 
consumer service sector. Retailers report that consumers are value 
conscious, but are attracted to large-ticket and luxury items, such 
as home video equipment and high fashion clothing. Most retailers 
anticipate strong holiday season sales but are following a cautious 
inventory strategy. The sales of both new and used cars appear to 
have slowed significantly throughout the District since last month 
but generally are above the levels of a year ago. Confirmation of 
the generally healthy state of consumer spending is provided by low 
consumer loan delinquencies, and steady levels of credit card usage 
and consumer borrowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With a few exceptions, manufacturing activity in the District 
remains healthy but with little evidence of rapid growth. The lumber 
and wood products industries in the Pacific Northwest appear to be 
the weakest in the District, with continued plant closures and 
production levels for some products remaining below those of five 
years ago. Hopes for this industry hinge on a recovery of home sales 
and some relief from costly timber contracts provided by a recently 
passed federal law. In Oregon, continued growth of the electronics 
manufacturing industry offers hope of offsetting the declines in 
wood products manufacturing. Plans for five new plants-offering two 
thousand additional jobs by 1986 or 1987â€”were recently announced by 
one U.S. and four foreign manufacturers. In California, recovery of 
the economy has slowed but large inflows of capital from the Far 
East and the strength of the aerospace and electronics industries in 
the state still generate optimism. In Arizona, growth continues in 
all nonagricultural sectors and in Tucson, Arizona, the unemployment 
rate is extremely low at 4.2 percent. Mining activity in the 
District remains sluggish as the result of strong foreign 
competition, and lower metals prices. However, a new silver 
discovery in Shoshone County in Idaho brightens prospects in that 
one part of the region. The decline in world oil prices has had a 
significant effect on western oil producers and states that rely on 
severance income. In Alaska, for example, each dollar decline in the 
price of a barrel of oil results in the loss of $150 million in 
revenue to the state. A major railroad reports generally steady or 
only slightly declining activity, confirming that despite the 
variations within the District and between industrial sectors, the 
economy of the District is in something of a holding pattern.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and sales activity in residential real estate appear to 
have slumped in recent months throughout the District. In Oregon, 
residential building permits are running below 1983 levels and in 
Washington, the home building industry is described as being 
completely "stalled." In California, the pace of homebuilding 
remains above that of 1983 and architects, contractors, and builders 
report an encouraging increase in prospects for new projects. The 
available home sales reports suggest a continued slowing despite 
declines in long-term interest rates and generally easier mortgage 
credit. The general weakness in demand is reflected by the modest 
increases in home prices experienced in California this year to 
date; prices generally have increased only at or even slightly below 
general rate of inflation. Nonresidential construction remains 
relatively stronger throughout the District and is extremely strong 
in Arizona. However, in Southern California, there is concern about 
oversupply of commercial real estate and that sector is experiencing 
a weakening in activity. In Oregon, the new entry of five 
electronics manufacturing firms and the expansion plans of several 
others are expected to stimulate construction activity significantly 
in the Portland region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural sector throughout the Twelfth District is having 
serious financial difficulties. These are brought about by a 
combination of accumulated debt, weak export demand, and large 
crops. In California, where the problems are particularly acute, the 
values of Central Valley farmland have fallen 20-40 percent below 
that of a year ago and thousands of acres are on the market unsold. 
Observers anticipate that many farmers will be unable to survive 
another year of similar conditions. Elsewhere in the region, 
problems are similar but complicated by local factors. In Oregon, 
for example, although crop yields have not been high, prices have 
been low and farm incomes depressed. Additional problems have been 
posed by a gypsy moth infestation in that state. Only the cattle, 
berry, and potato crops in Oregon offer a promising outlook. 
Similarly, although cotton crops in the District have not been 
unusually large, the world price remains low and cotton farmers are 
pressed seriously to repay previous debt. Only the intermountain 
region appears to have weathered this year's harvest with relative 
success; it is reported that farm cash receipts will increase in 
that region this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial banks in the Twelfth District experienced continued 
growth in assets in the third quarter of the yearâ€”at a 7 percent 
annual rate. Much of the increase was attributable to continued 
strength in consumer lending, as commercial, industrial and mortgage 
lending were generally flat during the third quarter. Funding 
occurred primarily through large denomination CDs and other time 
deposits. Money market deposit accounts and demand deposits in 
general did not register large inflows.
     </p>
     <p>
      A similar pattern of growth is observed in the savings and loan 
industry, although the financial problems of a large Association 
generated a large savings outflow for total deposits of the Eleventh 
Federal Home Loan Bank District in August and September. Mortgage 
loan commitments declined in September although total mortgage 
lending in 1984 to date exceeds the level achieved in 1983. There 
have been declines in profits for the savings and loan industry as a 
whole since 1983 as new lending increasingly has been financed by 
expensive. consumer time deposits.
