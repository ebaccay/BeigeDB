      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth of economic activity in this District appears to be slowing. 
Labor market conditions softened recently and price increases are 
slowing. Retail sales gains continue to shrink on a year-over-year 
basis. Manufacturing activity continues to expand, but at a slower 
pace than in early summer. Inventory trends are mixed but suggest 
slow growth of inventories. The downtrend in housing activity has 
been temporarily interrupted by funds from a special Ohio bond 
issue. Business loan demand is flat while consumer loan demand 
remains strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the District have softened. Employment 
fell and unemployment rose in Ohio in August, causing the 
unemployment rate to rise to 9.8% (s.a.), its highest level since 
May and only 1.5 percentage points below its level of a year 
earlier. Nevertheless, Ohio manufacturing employment continues to 
increase slowly while average weekly hours worked by manufacturing 
production workers continues to decline. The decline in overtime in 
manufacturing has been pulling down the average weekly earnings of 
manufacturing production workers in the last few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures are easing but concern about inflation 
continues. Purchasing managers report continued slowing in the rate 
of increase in prices paid for commodities. One group reports prices 
are increasing at the slowest rate in a year. The rates of increase 
for prices paid for services and equipment are higher than for 
commodities and are slowing only slightly. A survey of midwestern 
manufacturing firms reveals a smaller percentage of firms are 
raising prices now than were doing so earlier in the year. 
Nevertheless, contacts report there remains substantial concern 
about inflation and they believe that increases in the rate of 
inflation would cause a resurgence of inflationary expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major department store chains in this District report year-over-year 
sales gains continue to slow in most product lines. Nevertheless, 
unwanted inventories are not accumulating at the retail level. One 
major chain expects year-over-year gains will continue to shrink to 
8% in the fourth quarter of 1984 and 7% in the second quarter of 
1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cleveland area auto dealers report strong sales demand continued in 
August but in early September moderating consumer appetite and 
inventory problems have resulted in a mild sales slowdown. Dealers 
say an auto strike at the onset of the 1985 model year would sharply 
reduce fourth quarter domestic sales. Import dealer outlook for the 
fourth quarter is more positive because 1985-model deliveries are 
easing quota-induced shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues to expand. Purchasing agents report 
new orders continue to increase at a slower pace than recently in 
Cincinnati but more rapidly in Cleveland. Order backlogs remain 
flat, as production continued to increase steadily. Major steel 
producers report orders and shipments fell in June and July as 
customers reduced inventories, particularly in anticipation of an 
auto strike, and steel imports remained strong. Orders for steel 
improved slightly in August and steel producers expect further 
improvement in orders if there is an early labor settlement in the 
auto industry. A producer of consumable supplies used in mining 
reports a slowing of orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inventories show mixed trends. A survey of purchasing agents in the 
Cincinnati area indicates manufacturers' inventories of raw 
materials are being held constant, but purchasing agents in the 
Cleveland area indicate manufacturers raw materials inventories are 
being increased as a hedge against lengthening lead times. Both 
groups report continuing slow growth of finished goods inventories. 
Steel users, especially in the auto industry, and steel distributors 
continue to trim inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity in Ohio experienced an unexpected, one-time surge 
in August because of lower-cost financing made possible by state-
issued mortgage revenue bonds. Although the near-term outlook of 
market participants remains gloomy, optimism is surfacing that 
housing activity will improve by mid-1985. Most market participants 
expect 1984 to closely approach the sales pace and profits of 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      Builders remain cautious and, except for August, have been 
experiencing a steady dwindling of their order backlogs. Housing 
completions were strong during July and August and new orders, which 
typically are seasonally low, registered unexpected gains because of 
the bond monies. Also, as a result of bond monies, lenders recorded 
stronger-than-expected loan volume during August, but otherwise are 
experiencing a gradual slowing of mortgage originations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors report an unexpected surge of new contracts in August, 
principally from homebuyers using mortgage bond monies. Contract 
closings in August, which resulted from June's sales, also exceeded 
projected levels by a wide margin. According to realtors, the 
overall deceleration of housing activity will reverse in mid-1985 if 
interest rates fall and another dose of mortgage bond money becomes 
available.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business loan demand has been relatively flat recently at District 
banks, but consumer loans continue to grow at a strong pace. Bankers 
expect consumer loan demand to remain quite strong and business loan 
extensions to pick-up moderately in the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks appear to be funding new loans to a large extent by stepping 
up their issuance of large certificates of deposit and reducing the 
volume of federal funds sold. Although District banks registered 
increases in time and savings deposits, these gains were negated by 
declines in transaction deposits.
