      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, this District's economy is soft and uneven. Labor market 
conditions weakened in October. Department stare sales improved 
recently after being slow in the first two weeks of November. 
Automobile sales were strong throughout November. Manufacturing 
production has begun to expand again but orders are growing so 
slowly that backlogs are falling. Machine tool and steel producers 
continue to suffer from strong import competition. Inventories are 
high in several sectors. The housing market is showing moderate 
improvement. Commercial bank lending has been flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the District softened in October. 
Employment fell and unemployment rose in Ohio, increasing the 
unemployment rate to 9.5% (s.a.), 0.8 percentage points above its 
July level but 1.6 percentage points below its year-earlier level. 
Manufacturing employment is growing at a slower pace. An index of 
leading indicators of employment for the Pittsburgh area fell again 
in September to its level of February, suggesting that employment 
there has peaked.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales were relatively slow over the first two weeks of 
November but have since improved according to Fourth District 
department store representatives. One economist now estimates that 
November sales will show a 7-8 percent year-over-year increase. 
However, he and others noted that the November retail sales report 
period ended on the 24th, missing some of the late-month strength. 
As a result, reported November sales figures may be somewhat 
understated while those for December will be somewhat overstated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nevertheless, no one anticipates a return to double-digit gains for 
the two-month period. Further, part of the anticipated November-
December gain will likely be achieved through price reductions as 
retailers attempt to cut inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers report strong sales throughout November for both 
domestic and imported cars. One dealer, in particular, noted that 
his November sales were about even with the October level. 
Typically, his November sales run about 20% below the October 
volume. Car buyers apparently have not been deterred by reports of 
weakened economic activity or by anticipation of tax increases. A 
major auto producer believes that auto sales are still constrained 
by shortages of GMC cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District is growing slowly on balance. 
A survey of manufacturers in northeast Ohio indicates production is 
expanding once again after a recent brief contraction. New orders 
continue to grow at a slow pace. A survey of manufacturers in the 
Cincinnati area indicates production and new orders are rising very 
slowly, but order backlogs are falling for the first time since very 
early in the recovery. Other survey data indicate manufacturers 
expect backlogs to continue to decline. Manufacturers report prices 
paid for commodities and services are rising very slowly while 
prices paid for equipment are flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      A manufacturer of machine tools expects orders to be slightly higher 
this quarter than last, with slow growth continuing into 1985. 
Machine tool orders from the auto and defense industries remain 
strong while weakness persists in orders from producers of farm, 
construction, and oil field equipment. Imports remain a major drag 
on the domestic machine tool industry, and are absorbing about 40% 
of the market. Japanese producers are reported to be competing 
fiercely for sales of machining centers and numerically controlled 
lathes.
     </p>
     <p>
      A diversified producer of components for capital goods reports that 
automotive related orders remain solid. Orders for some electronic 
components have declined but the firm views this as a correction of 
earlier overbuilding of inventories rather than a decline in 
underlying demand. Space-related and defense-related orders continue 
to grow out less rapidly than their previous exceptional pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major steel producers report orders aid production remain sluggish 
because customers are reducing excessive inventories and imports 
remain strong. Order backlogs are expected to continue falling 
throughout this quarter. Capacity utilization in steel production is 
50 to 55 percent for integrated producers and 55 to 60 percent for 
the industry. Prices remain weak because of import competition. 
Producers expect market demand to be stable in 1985 and their 
shipments to increase slightly if quotas restrain imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Department stares report excessive inventory, while some auto dealer 
inventories are tight. Inventories of raw materials and finished 
goods are reported to be flat among Cincinnati area manufacturers 
and rising slowly among northeast Ohio manufacturers. Lead times for 
deliveries appear to be stable. Steel producers report customers are 
reducing inventories. Petroleum firms are resisting seasonal 
inventory growth because of expectations of price declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing market participants in this District report a reversal of 
the summer's general downward trend. Because of softening mortgage 
rates and prospects for even lower rates, there is a consensus among 
market participants that housing activity will improve mildly until 
at least mid-1985. The possibility of a strong housing rebound is 
generally considered to be remote.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result of a substantial recovery in listings and contract 
closings, realtors are reversing their previous plans to scale down 
operations. Realtors, who are the most optimistic among market 
participants, now expect that housing activity will improve 
throughout 1985. Builders expect the rebound may continue to mid-
1985 out are not reversing previous plans to reduce the size of 
their operations. Builders apparently would rather minimize down-
side risk and forego potential profits if the housing market rebound 
persists. In contrast, lenders expect the housing rebound to be weak 
and brief. Although inquiries are up slightly, mortgage volume has 
been only marginally increased by lower mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth was relatively flat at Fourth District banks during the 
past five weeks. A few bankers who reported fairly strong business 
loan demand in recent weeks expect the demand for business credit to 
weaken. Some contacts said that consumer loan demand has been good 
and should remain that way for the balance of the year. A few large 
banks report that consumer leading rates have not yet been adjusted 
downward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail deposit growth has been moderate at district banks in recent 
weeks. Banks have relied less on large certificates of deposit, but 
rare on the use of borrowed funds.
