      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 20, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and consumer spending continue to sustain economic 
recovery in the Southeast, and contacts are optimistic about 1984. 
Retailers enjoyed the best holiday sales in the last four years. 
Housing purchases remained strong through December despite rising 
mortgage rates and adverse weather. Strength in these sectors has 
prompted recalls of laid-off manufacturing workers and sharp 
increases in orders in construction-related industries. Lending 
activity slowed in December, but bank deposits advanced sharply. 
Unusually cold weather adversely affected tourism and agriculture. 
Losses of vegetable and citrus crops have pushed up prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industry contacts believe that labor market conditions continued to 
improve through December and gains will persist at least through the 
first quarter. In November, unemployment fell in four of the six 
District states. Manufacturing employment grew by over 85,000 from 
November 1982 after falling by 161,000 in the previous 12-month 
period. Vigorous auto sales led to the recall of 1,600 workers for a 
second shift at a large auto assembly plant near Atlanta. The 
scheduled mid-February reopening of a large Alabama sheet steel mill 
and the attendant recall of 2,500-3,000 workers bodes ongoing 
improvements in manufacturing employment. Contacts expect 1984 to be 
a good year for the timber industry as well. Boosted by renewed 
vigor in the housing industry, southeastern construction employment 
rose 38 percent in November above year-earlier levels. The American 
Plywood Association indicates that 1983 plywood production, nearly 
25 percent over 1982 levels, attained record highs, largely as a 
result of increased demand in the "do-it-yourself" market. A rig 
count increase from 282 in November to 321 during December betokens 
recovery in Louisiana's oil and gas exploration industry. Many 
chemical plants in Louisiana found themselves ill-equipped to cope 
with the unusual Christmas cold spell, but an industry spokesman 
believes the short-lived production halts may have helped stabilize 
falling prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers surveyed about December sales regard 1983 as the 
best year since 1979. New car sales sustained the momentum of recent 
months despite unusually cold weather. Department store merchants 
report double-digit increases over the previous year. Retailers cite 
apparel, big-ticket items, and jewelry as leading holiday sellers. 
These reports suggest a continuation of the healthy growth shown in 
November's state sales tax receipts Merchants perceive widespread 
consumer optimism about employment prospects. If this optimism is 
well-founded, retail spending should remain strong in 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      December's housing sales were slightly above normal despite 
unusually severe weather and rising conventional interest rates 
early in the month. Realtors report increases in the share of used 
homes sold and in the proportion of buyers "trading up." Improved 
employment opportunities and transfers account for much of the real 
estate activity in Nashville, Mobile, and Jacksonville. The sale of 
houses to retirees in Florida is strengthening as national economic 
improvements enable homeowners to sell their residences elsewhere. 
Builders who have moved from Houston's saturated market are 
stimulating residential construction in Orlando, and realtors expect 
this trend to continue. Area lenders say that the deregulation of 
the FHA mortgage rate has resulted in higher rates and lower 
discount points. Confusion over post-deregulation requirements for 
FHA loans made some lenders less willing to make EHA loans. In the 
opinion of those surveyed, FHA activity should increase as lenders 
become more familiar with the loans' new terms. However, some 
builders fear recent price increases in supplies will dampen the 
pace of residential building. In the last two months, the number of 
single-family building permits declined on a seasonally adjusted 
basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office space absorption and construction in Atlanta and Nashville 
continues at a brisk pace. Shopping center development is reviving 
throughout the Southeast. However, commercial construction in 
Orlando has slowed from its previously booming pace. Realtors fear 
that Orlando and several other cities may have excessive inventories 
of office and hotel accommodations on the market or under 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After maintaining strong growth for six months, 
loans at large banks advanced only slightly on a seasonally adjusted 
basis from November to December. The slow growth is attributable to 
a decline in real estate lending, flat demand for consumer loans, 
and a moderation in the recent strong growth of commercial loans. 
Bank contacts report that loan demand through early January 
increased over late last year, although the improvement in 
Mississippi has been modest. Respondents most often cite commercial 
lending as the fastest growing segment, but Florida and Atlanta 
contacts report that consumer lending is strong. S&amp;L; spokesmen 
indicate that loan applications are at least maintaining, if not 
surpassing, the rate of late last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposits at large banks ended 1983 with the strongest monthly 
showing since June. The strength is attributable to faster expansion 
of both demand and time deposit accounts and the continued strength 
of savings. Jumbo CDs contributed significantly to the spurt of 
deposits in December. Savings at thrifts grew slowly in December and 
early January. according to those surveyed. Contacts do not expect 
the January 1 elimination of the quarter point advantage formerly 
held by S&amp;Ls on regular savings accounts to trigger the sort of 
competitive struggle in the Southeast that attended the introduction 
of MMDAs a year ago; Competition is concentrated in higher rate 
accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cold weather weakened the performance of the tourism industry in 
December. Visitor center registrations declined relative to year-ago 
levels in three states, and attendance at most southeastern 
attractions fell. Hotel occupancy is still soft in most cities. Even 
in Orlando, occupancy fell 7 percent in November after 14 months of 
increases. Air travel continues to improve because of rising 
passenger volume and expanded carrier service at southeastern 
airports. The relatively small (1-2 percent) increases in revenue-
passenger miles reported in December by the major southeastern-based 
carriers are probably attributable to unusually high year-earlier 
volumes. Discounts triggered much of the year-ago increase. Since 
the proportion of passengers flying on discount has declined, 
present levels indicate healthy conditions despite the modest 
nominal growth. Renewed auto-train service from Virginia to Florida 
has generated strong demand. Most southbound routes are sold out, 
and advance bookings are reportedly heavy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unexpected freeze at Christmas inflicted substantial injury on 
Florida agriculture. Grower losses may exceed $500 million. 
Approximately 85 percent of the state's orange crop had not been 
harvested when the cold struck. The most recent USDA estimate 
projects a 23 percent loss in the orange crop with a concomitant 13 
percent decline in juice yield per box. By early January the 
wholesale price of orange juice had climbed 1 percent above its pre-
Christmas level. Imports of Brazilian orange juice should temper the 
impact on consumers somewhat, but Brazilians have increased prices 
18 percent from last season in anticipation of strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers will face much sharper price increases for fresh 
vegetables until new crops reach harvest. The wholesale price of 
lettuce has more than doubled since the freeze. Tomatoes, pepper, 
and squash also incurred extensive injury. Higher prices will 
partially offset citrus crop losses, but revenues for many growers 
will be below earlier expectations. Vegetable growers' annual 
revenue should decline because they have lost their most 
advantageous marketing period. The freeze has reduced employment 
except in south Florida, where many growers have undamaged fruit 
suitable for sales as fresh produce, and in portions of central 
Florida, where growers are rushing oranges to juice processors.
