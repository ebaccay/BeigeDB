      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 5, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The sentiment of several directors, officials, and economists in the 
  Fourth District is that business is at or near a peak. Most District 
  economists expect a recession beginning in the third quarter. Except 
  for automobile production, manufacturers continue to operate near 
  capacity, but expectations are for a let-up later this summer. 
  Capital goods producers, especially machine-tool builders, remain 
  optimistic over the near-term. Mortgage loan demand has eased but 
  apparently exceeds the availability of mortgage credit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Economic activity is close to a peak, according to the prevailing 
  view of a number of officials and economists in the District. Some 
  believe, however, that a peak in consumer spending has already been 
  past. One retailer expects real sales will decline through the 
  fourth quarter of 1979 and then turn up early next year in response 
  to a likely tax cut. He estimates that real retail sales this year 
  will decline by 1.5 percent, compared with a 3.5- percent increase 
  in 1978. A large producer of major appliances, who only recently 
  felt that a recession would not begin until the third quarter, now 
  feels that weakening in consumer spending has already triggered a 
  recession.
       </p>
       <p>
        The prevailing view seems to be that a recession will begin in 
  either the third or fourth quarter of 1979. Of the 28 economists who 
  attended the Fourth District economists round table meeting held at 
  this Bank on June 1, 13 expected real GNP would decline in the third 
  quarter and 12 expected real GNP would decline beginning in the 
  fourth quarter. Although the median forecast of the 28 showed a 
  decline in real GNP of less than 1 percent between the second 
  quarter of 1979 and the first quarter of 1980, a small group 
  anticipates about a 2-percent decline in real GNP. These forecasts 
  were not much changed from expectations last March, but the group 
  was more certain now of a recession than they were three months ago. 
  They pointed to contractions in consumer spending and in housing 
  already under way that would lead to a mild adjustment of 
  inventories beginning next quarter and continuing until early 1980. 
  A higher rate of inflation than previously expected, coupled with 
  growing uncertainty over the gasoline situation will prevent an 
  early comeback in consumer spending.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except for automobile production, manufacturing activity in the 
  District continues on a high level, although expectations are for a 
  let-up by late summer. The strike by independent truck haulers has 
  curtailed shipments in some industries. Neither shipments nor 
  production has been hampered by limited gasoline supplies. Steel 
  shipments in June were curtailed by as much as 15 percent for one 
  large steel producer, but steel production has held at about 
  effective capacity. Some steel officials feel orders peaked last 
  March (when orders exceeded capacity to ship by 30 percent) and are 
  now running at a rate below the last two months. One producer 
  reports relatively full order books for July and August, but some 
  openings exist for September delivery. At the moment, only a normal 
  seasonal slowdown in operating rates is expected for the third 
  quarter. Steel industry economists are skeptical over fourth- 
  quarter prospects. They uniformly expect a recession in the fourth 
  quarter will depress steel consumption and orders, especially from 
  the auto industry, and that the volume of imports, if sustained at 
  the May surge, would result in a sharp liquidation of inventories 
  and a serious downward adjustment in steel production. Tire 
  shipments have also been curtailed by the truckers' strike, and 
  operations in the industry have been cut to about 86 percent of 
  capacity since the strike settlement. Some industry economists 
  expect a weak fourth quarter because of sagging consumer demand for 
  autos and tire inventories that are judged relatively high. A major 
  glass supplier to both the auto and construction industries reports 
  some easing from capacity operations because of a cutback in glass 
  for new houses. They expect a larger-than-usual seasonal drop in 
  orders and production after September because of a further slowdown 
  in the auto and housing industries. Production of major appliances 
  is holding steady in response to a high level of housing 
  completions, according to one economist; however, as completions 
  fall, production will be cut back, probably over the next two 
  quarters. Sales to retailers have begun to weaken but are still 
  stronger than expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite widespread expectations of a recession, officials in the 
  District still expect fixed investment will provide some near-term 
  support to overall economic activity. Year-to-year increases in real 
  investment this year are still expected to about match last year. 
  Capital goods producers, especially those associated with machine 
  tools, transportation equipment, materials handling and 
  communications equipment, remain optimistic over shipment and 
  production prospects at least for the next few quarters. However, 
  irregular behavior in new orders in recent months leads one 
  economist to expect real investment to decline early next year. 
  Suppliers to the heavy-duty truck industry report their business has 
  peaked and expect production to be cut back later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some adjustment of inventories is expected over the next few months 
  by officials in a number of industries, including steel, food 
  processing, tires, and large and intermediate cars. Major appliance 
  stock held by retailers are reported to be above a year earlier 
  (which were regarded exceptionally low) but in balance with sales at 
  a manufacturing level. According to one producer, heavy-duty truck 
  producers expect a sizable adjustment of inventories later this 
  year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankers, S&amp;L officials, and realtors generally report some let-up in 
  demand for mortgage credit. S&amp;Ls consider demand is still stronger 
  than their ability to make mortgage credit available. Some lenders 
  have been shutting off loans while others continue to tighten terms. 
  Some expect to increase mortgage rates still further in the next few 
  weeks in order to curb demand. Mortgage rates are between 10.5 
  percent and 11 percent for a prime rate mortgage loan and as high as 
  12.5 percent for a 95-percent loan. S&amp;Ls expect to have difficulty 
  in their July roll-over of six-month certificates, and some are 
  aggressively issuing jumbo certificates to meet commitments. In 
  recent weeks, some lenders report loan applications have eased 
  because of heightened consumer uncertainty. An official with a 
  larger realty association in northern Ohio reports demand in June 
  was off considerably from a month earlier, especially because of the 
  energy problem. They note a change from a sellers to a buyers market 
  is possible.
