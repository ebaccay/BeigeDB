      <strong>
       December 16, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Seventh District deteriorated 
rapidly in the fourth quarter. Manufacturers of both consumer and 
producer durable goods are scheduling extended plant closings in 
December and January. Layoffs and short work weeks are increasing. 
Demand for workers is very weak. General merchandise and specialty 
stores have been trying to boost lagging sales with selective price 
discounts. Inflation has also slowed in wholesale markets. 
Complaints are widespread about slow payments by trade creditors, 
including governmental units. State and local governments are paring 
operations because of financial stringencies. The prolonged downturn 
in agricultural prices—especially corn, soybeans, and livestock—with no sign of a significant reversal, has raised increasing 
concern over the financial viability of farm entrepreneurs carrying 
substantial debt burdens. Construction activity is in a depressed 
state, except for large office buildings, but there is hope that 
lower interest rates next year will increase transactions. The list 
of sectors showing continued gains is limited to business services 
(especially law and accounting), and medical care and supplies. 
Recreational vehicles and mobile homes also have reported gains this 
year, but from a low base.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Confidence Ebbs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Important sectors in the Seventh District have had 
serious problems for two to three years. (The region had been 
reasonably prosperous until early 1979 when the gasoline shortage 
hit.) Not since 1929-33 has the region been afflicted by declines of 
more than a year or so, and, typically, downturns since World War II 
did not strike all sectors simultaneously. In recent months the 
malaise has broadened further. Now motor vehicles, most capital 
goods, recreational equipment, home appliances, furniture, 
agriculture, and government are all in a depressed state. Confidence 
has been further eroded by a series of incipient upturns all of 
which proved abortive, e.g. farm prices late last year, housing
activity in 1980 and again last spring, and auto sales in August. 
These experiences have drained the morale of many who now say they 
see "no light at the end of the tunnel". The slump in housing, 
building materials, motor vehicles, and farm and construction 
equipment is unprecedented since World War II in magnitude and 
duration. A growing number of older plants are being closed 
permanently. Many small businesses, retailers, distributors, and 
component suppliers associated with these depressed sectors are 
being pushed out of business or have cut back the scale of their 
operations. In short, confidence in the district has suffered a 
damaging below which will not be corrected in the short run. Most 
observers here expect demand to bottom out in the first half of 
1982, perhaps as early as February, but any subsequent upturn 
anticipated next year would leave the district far short of full 
prosperity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The proportion of purchasing managers reporting paying 
higher prices is down sharply from last year. Discounting is 
reported for steel, nonferrous metals, scrap iron, and building 
materials. Because inventories of materials and components are 
typically at very low levels, price cuts are expected to be reversed 
as demand revives. The big inflation issue for 1982 is the push by 
management for labor concessions on compensation and work rules, 
which so far has achieved only scattered success.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many district manufacturers normally shut down for a 
week between Christmas and New Year's Days. This year many plant 
closings will begin before Christmas and extend into January. Other 
firms are eliminating extra shifts or reducing work weeks. Plant 
closings are reported for farm and construction equipment, motor 
vehicles, home appliances, and tires. Some district companies that 
avoided layoffs in past downturns have been forced to follow the 
trend because of continued declines in orders. White collar staffs 
are also being reduced.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Large general merchandise chains reported poor 
sales in both October and November, with volume down 5 percent or 
more after inflation. This has led to a buildup in inventories, and 
a rash of pre-Christmas price cutting, to an extent not seen since 
late 1974. Consumers are especially cautious on purchases of big 
ticket items, and luxury services such as air travel, restaurant 
meals, and recreation. However, merchants have not given up on a 
late surge in Christmas sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Stocks of motor vehicles, appliances, farm and 
construction equipment, and most general merchandise are now 
excessive because of poor sales. Production cuts have been ordered. 
Oil industry inventories have been reduced to comfortable levels. 
Manufacturers' delivery times are very short, but most distributors 
are working on minimal stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Virtually all lines of business equipment produced in 
the district for farms, factories, offices, and transportation 
reported deteriorating demand in recent months. Components such as 
castings, forgings, engines, power transmission, and electrical 
controls are also affected. Auto companies and electric utilities 
have canceled additional major capital spending plans, because of 
reduced estimates of demand and financial pressures. On the brighter 
side, some large office buildings started in downtown Chicago 
earlier this year, but halted for lack of financing, have been given 
the green light.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for cars and trucks remained near the 
depressed October level in November. Fourth quarter output will be 
the lowest since 1959, and schedules for early 1982 have been 
reduced. Used car sales, which had been strong, dropped off 
recently. Cars at the "high end of the line" are selling best, often 
for cash.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for steel declined sharply in the fourth quarter. 
Operating rates dropped back to the severely depressed level of the 
third quarter of 1980. All products are now weak, including oil line 
pipe. Demand is expected to remain near the December level in 
January, with some rebound in February as customers' plants reopen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential activity is at a post-World War II low 
throughout the district. Effective prices are down 10-20 percent, 
threatening the equity of many owners. Few potential buyers accept 
the concept of variable rate mortgages, particularly if adjustments 
are frequent. Recent rate declines stimulated a few transactions. A 
drop in the conventional rate to 13-14 percent, analysts believe, 
would boost home construction substantially because the inventory of 
finished units is very small.
