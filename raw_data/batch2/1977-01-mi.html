      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic indicators are mixed as the Ninth District economy enters 
1977. Sources of encouragement are reports of good holiday spending 
and strong homebuilding activity. District employment resumed its 
advance in late 1976, and unemployment declined modestly. Also, 
livestock prices have recently gained strength. Nevertheless, the 
region continues to be troubled by a lack of growth in manufacturing 
and construction jobs. And in contrast to livestock prices, low 
grain prices are worrying district farmers. However, weather is 
probably the biggest source of concern to most people. The drought-induced reductions in last season's production will have their full 
impact on farm spending this year, and many farmers are disturbed 
about the additional consequences of inadequate moisture in 1977.
Cold weather is also straining the district's fuel supplies and 
curbing winter recreational activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Major retailers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generally report 
good holiday sales with December sales up about 10 percent from a 
year earlier. Furthermore, retailers' comments indicate that January 
is off to an encouraging start, and post-holiday sales are expected 
to be good. Also, the view is expressed that sales have been helped 
by the improvement in consumer confidence since the election. In 
addition, good holiday business has left retailers with no 
burdensome inventories.
       </p>
       <p>
        District auto sales have also been quite good, with sales gains 
about in line with the national gains. Large and intermediate models 
are selling very well; small and compact cars are moving more 
slowly. Inventories are in line with this sales pattern; that is, 
supplies of large and intermediate cars are tight and many 
dealerships have overstocks of smaller models.
       </p>
       <p>
        Homebuilding in the Ninth District was quite strong during the 
second half of 1976. District authorizations for new housing units 
were quite close to 1972's record levels; this is in contrast to a 
fairly large shortfall nationally. Most of the improved district 
housing activity was concentrated in the single-family sector, but 
some gains in multifamily authorizations occurred after midyear.
       </p>
       <p>
        The district's active homebuilding sector has been partly 
responsible for the impressive increase in mortgage loans made at 
district S&amp;Ls during the second half of 1976: up nearly 75 percent 
from a year earlier. This advance was much stronger than the 
national increase. However, part of the district's growth stems from 
a shifting of existing loans to S&amp;Ls from other lenders, since 
Minnesota's 8 percent usury ceiling on conventional loans was lifted 
last April. Outstanding loan commitments at S&amp;Ls also climbed 
impressively in 1976 and during the second half of the year were 
about 25 percent greater than in the first half.
       </p>
       <p>
        District labor markets in late 1976 were bolstered by employment 
gains. Additional jobs checked the rise in district unemployment 
which had occurred since last spring. These employment gains have 
occurred in the trade, service, and government sectors; 
manufacturing employment did not increase, and construction jobs 
were down from a year earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        These positive areas of district activity are in contrast to several 
weaker sectors. Weather is a source of particular concern to the 
district's agricultural sector. Not only are last season's drought-induced reductions in production expected to have their full impact 
on farm spending this year, but many are worried about this year's 
moisture conditions. Drought conditions have prevailed in the post-harvest months, and the long-range weather forecast predicts lower 
than normal precipitation for January. As a result, concern is 
mounting about moisture conditions in 1977. One tactic will likely 
be acreage diversion from corn to wheat, sunflowers, or other 
drought-resistant crops.
       </p>
       <p>
        Low farm prices resulting from record nationwide crops have 
adversely affected the district's farm economy. However, the cattle 
industry appears to be stabilizing, so increased beef prices are 
likely. Unfortunately, increased feed costs could offset this 
benefit. Since hog producers are planning higher farrowings, the pig 
crop should increase for the second year in a row. This potential 
supply would tend to depress hog prices again in 1977.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to affecting agricultural output, recent weather 
conditions have adversely affected district energy supplies. Much 
colder than normal temperatures have markedly increased natural gas 
curtailments in this region and have strained available fuel oil 
supplies. The fuel oil situation has been termed "quite serious," 
and current inventories are at the lowest point in five years. 
Consequently, if cold weather persists in January and February, it 
is possible that some district businesses would have to disrupt or 
alter usual activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Resort owners throughout the Midwest are suffering from the 
combination of a scarcity of snow and extreme cold. Despite 
snowmaking machines in most Minnesota ski resorts, cancellations are 
running high and business is poor. Lack of snow is also a problem 
for other businesses which depend on snowmobiling and cross-country 
skiing.
