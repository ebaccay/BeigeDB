      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the First District are much the same as they 
were last month. Retailers continue to experience relatively good 
sales growth and look forward to a "solid" Christmas season. Retail 
inventories are generally satisfactory. Among the manufacturers 
contacted, most of whom produce capital goods, orders are flat to 
down and no recovery is expected until the second half of 1983 or 
later. Firms are using combinations of wage freezes, reduced hours, 
plant shutdowns and layoffs to bring down costs. Among the few 
positive developments was a report that sales of hardware for new 
and remodeled homes have picked up. Also suggestive of a recovery in 
housing was a report by a banking director that his bank did more
mortgage business in the month of October than in any previous 
month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers contacted in the First District reported "high single 
digit" sales growth in November compared to a weak November last 
year. Those with branches or associated stores elsewhere in the 
nation said sales were much stronger in New England than in the 
Midwest or Sunbelt regions. In some local stores durables seem to be 
selling better than soft goods. The merchants expect solid but 
unspectacular Christmas sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the area's major department stores experienced a sales 
increase of 9.2 percent over November 1981. This growth was 
attributed to the strength of the New England economy and the 
store's moderate—upper income customer base. A discount chain with 
9.6 percent sales growth in New England encountered sales declines 
in their Midwest and Southeast stores. The growth in New England was 
especially strong in hard goods; kerosene heaters were very popular. 
Both chains claimed that unseasonably warm weather had reduced sales 
of cold weather-related goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the whole, inventories were reported to be at satisfactory 
levels. The two department store chains had "excessive" inventories 
last year; this year they are keeping stocks tighter but flexible. A 
mail order outdoor specialty firm and a pet store chain have 
increased inventories well above last year to improve customer 
service and encourage impulse holiday buying.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several of the merchants contacted said that sales results so far 
are consistent with the trend over the last few years for Christmas 
sales to occur closer and closer to the end of the month. They also 
expressed concern that heroic promotional efforts would be required 
once the snowballing effect of holiday purchasing ends.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For most of the manufacturers contacted, order rates are unchanged 
or declining. The Redbook group includes firms in such high 
technology industries as computers, telecommunications equipment and 
control instruments, as well as manufacturers of machine tools and 
specialized industrial machinery. Neither the high tech firms nor 
firms from more traditional capital goods industries expect a 
significant pickup in their own operations until the second half of 
1983 or the early part of 1984. However, one machine tool maker said 
that if present conditions persist for another six months, many 
firms will go out of business and the capacity of the domestic 
machine tool industry will be permanently reduced. This sentiment 
was repeated by a bearings manufacturer, who also pointed out that 
while book prices for bearings are rising, large buyers are 
negotiating discounts of 20-30 percent. All the firms contacted are 
trying to bring inventories and employment levels into line with 
current orders with combinations of layoffs, wage freezes, 
reductions in hours, and Christmas shutdowns. The high tech firms, 
which fared relatively well earlier in the recession, seem to be 
relying more on wage adjustments and Christmas shutdowns.
     </p>
     <p>
      While reports from the manufacturing sector were generally 
discouraging, there were a few positive developments. Orders were up 
for hardware used in building and remodeling residential housing. 
Orders were also up for machinery to make circuit boards. Products 
which save money, for example, energy efficient lighting, and which 
increase productivity, for example, office automation equipment, 
continue to sell well. The defense business is strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Samuelson, and Houthakker were available for 
comment this month. All agree that the economy is still weak and 
that the recovery is not yet assured. They all predict that some 
sort of recovery will begin soon. However, they differ in their 
assessment of the probability of recovery and what the Fed should do 
to help the economy turn the corner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein was the most pessimistic of the three. He believes that 
before it is over the slide in business fixed investment will be the 
worst since 1931. His confidence in a consumer-led recovery has 
diminished because he foresees no growth this quarter and little 
growth next quarter in real disposable income. His pessimism about 
next quarter is partially attributable to scheduled increases in 
excise taxes and the social security tax base and the proposed hike 
in gasoline taxes to finance public works. He also feels the 
inventory-sales ratio is too high for this stage of the business 
cycle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Given his uncertainty about the recovery, Eckstein strongly urges 
the Fed to do everything in its power to bring interest rates down 
at least to the point where the prime rate is 9 percent. When asked 
about the current search for a reliable aggregate he exclaimed 
"aggregates, shmagregates!" He'd like Congress to help out by 
accelerating the 1983 tax cut, but he doesn't think it is 
politically feasible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson believes that the economy will probably turn the corner if 
the Fed continues its "slight departure from narrow monetarism to 
ease nominal and real interest rates." In his opinion, such a policy 
would not regenerate inflationary expectations or damage the Fed's 
credibility. However, because he thinks that further increases in 
the 1983 deficit would rekindle such expectations, he is opposed to 
short-term temporary jobs programs at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker believes that, in light of recent improvements in housing 
and autos and the continued improvement in inflation, the economy 
will not deteriorate further and a recovery will take place in early 
1983. He urges the Fed not to "pump up" the money supply to 
accelerate this process. If it did, renewed inflation would push 
interest rates back up, plunging the economy back into a recession. 
He thinks that setting of growth targets for business loans is a 
promising idea that merits further consideration. He is encouraged 
by Secretary Regan's proposal for a new international monetary 
conference. He favors less flexibility in exchange rates and 
believes that many of our economic problems in the 1970s are 
attributable to the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement.
