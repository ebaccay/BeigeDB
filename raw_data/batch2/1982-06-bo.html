      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a sharp dichotomy between the recent experience of 
retailers in the First District and that of manufacturers. Retail 
sales in the past month have been good and compare favorably with 
sales a year ago. The firms contacted are looking forward to the 
widely predicted pickup in consumer spending in the second half of 
the year. Manufacturers, on the other hand, have become more 
pessimistic. Business continues to be very poor. The rate of decline 
seems to be slowing, but there are no signs yet of an upturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the First District have become more bullish. The firms 
contacted reported that, in spite of the recession, sales growth 
over the year exceeded the rate of inflation and either matched or 
exceeded the growth projected in their business plans. One firm, 
which had run an extra circular promotion, achieved an increase in 
New England Bales in May of 19 percent over May last year. Another 
experienced growth over the year "in the high single digits"; sales 
were particularly strong in New Hampshire and Rhode Island. 
Persistent rains have not hurt overall sales much, but have reduced 
sales of swimwear and other items traditionally sold at the
beginning of the summer. Most of the firms contacted are cautiously 
basing business plans on the widely reported forecast of a pickup in 
consumer spending in the second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      A representative of a major department store said that prices of 
purchased stock are becoming more attractive. Since the store 
maintains a constant markup, prices to the consumer will improve. 
Another retailer expects price increases to slow over the next 
several months, as earlier reductions in energy prices filter into 
the transportation component of retail costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Gloom pervades the manufacturing sector. The firms contacted were 
almost unanimous in describing business as very poor. Several 
expressed great concern about the deterioration in corporate balance 
sheets, with the chief economist of one large firm suggesting that 
today's high interest rates are justified to a significant degree by 
the decline in business coverage ratios and the resulting increased 
risk to the lender.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of decline in manufacturing appears to be slowing, however. 
In a May survey of New England purchasing managers the percentage of 
firms reporting decreases in orders and backlogs was lower and the 
percentage reporting no change was higher than in the March and 
April surveys. However, more firms still reported that orders and 
backlogs declined than reported increases. Among the firms contacted 
directly, a group including firms in the rubber, chemicals, 
appliance, electronics and aircraft industries, most thought that 
orders and shipments had stabilized. However, almost no one saw 
signs of a pickup and a few firms continued to suffer decreases. A 
designer and manufacturer of process industry control systems, which 
had not felt the recession as recently as March, has now seen a 
definite slowing in orders and a rise in cancellations. These 
systems reduce costs at existing facilities, rather than add to 
capacity, so the cancellations suggest that firms in the process 
industries are having difficulty justifying even cost-saving 
investments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of increased sales were very few and were usually 
contradicted. Thus, one manufacturer of specialized printing 
equipment and supplies reported a pickup in demand, while a firm in 
a closely related industry reported a decline. A third manufacturer 
of printing equipment said that there had been a slight upturn 
earlier but business was now leveling off, still well below plan. 
Also, one very large manufacturer of electrical equipment saw the 
beginnings of a recovery in Europe; however, another firm described 
Europe as "dead and getting deader". The defense business is the 
only area about which reports are consistently positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      The manufacturers contacted directly were generally satisfied with 
recent inventory levels. However, the survey of local purchasing 
managers showed a substantial fraction of firms planning to reduce 
inventories over the next three to six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Solow, Samuelson, and Houthakker were available 
for comment this month. They all believe that a weak recovery will 
begin soon, although Eckstein and Samuelson emphasized the downside 
risks to their forecasts. They differed, however, on whether the Fed 
should nurture the recovery by permitting the monetary aggregates to 
grow outside their target ranges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein and Solow both believe that the Fed should not apply the 
monetary brake because interest rates are remaining at unacceptably 
high levels. Eckstein emphasized that continued high interest rates 
could neutralize the stimulative effects of the July tax cut, 
thereby aborting the recovery and dragging the economy into a deeper 
recession. He is especially alarmed by the devastating impact of 
high rates on business fixed investment. In his view capital 
spending will be considerably weaker during the remainder of the 
year than indicated by the Commerce Department's most recent plant 
and equipment expenditure survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solow agrees that, given current economic conditions, the Board 
should "intelligently lean against the wind" by easing monetary 
policy. He cautioned that a decline in interest rates per se would 
not necessarily indicate that the appropriate degree of easing had 
taken place. Monetary policy could still be too tight if the decline 
in rates were caused merely by prolonged economic weakness. At the 
same time, he acknowledged that a dramatic return to rapid monetary 
expansion would risk rekindling inflationary expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson, although sympathetic to Eckstein's and Solow's position, 
nevertheless urged the Board to "make some semblance of an attempt" 
to attain the high end of its targets. He argued that "monetarists 
have so mesmerized Wall Street" that failure to do so would raise 
fears of a new round of inflation and therefore keep real interest 
rates from falling. Nevertheless, if economic conditions continue to 
deteriorate through the summer, which he believes is a distinct 
possibility, then he would consider abandoning the targets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker recommended that the Board stay at the upper limits of 
its target ranges in order to preserve its gains against inflation. 
However, he urged a cautious approach to the targets, given the 
probable weakness of the recovery and the randomness of movements in 
the aggregates. He believes that adherence to the targets would keep 
pressure on Congress to reduce proposed budget deficits. Solow 
believes that for political reasons "Congress has gone about as far 
as it can go" in trimming the deficit for fiscal year 1983.
