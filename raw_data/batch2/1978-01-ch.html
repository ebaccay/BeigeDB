      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Most economic sectors in the Seventh District still appear to be 
  expanding, and sentiment is generally favorable that growth will 
  continue into the second half of 1978. Production schedules for 
  autos and farm equipment have been reduced, however. Retail sales of 
  general merchandise have been very strong. Inventories are generally 
  on the slim side. The slow but steady uptrend in total capital 
  outlays is continuing. Favorable weather, until this week, has 
  permitted outdoor construction activity to continue later this 
  winter than last. Mortgage credit terms are tightening moderately.
       </p>
       <p>
        Virtually all general merchandise retailers report that sales 
  exceeded optimistic budgets, not only in the Christmas season, but 
  since Christmas as well. Inventories are "on the slim side. "January 
"clearance" sales have emphasized special purchases rather than 
  markdowns of regular stock. Sales of most lines have been at high 
  levels, with home furnishings, including appliances and furniture, 
  especially good. Consumers have used credit freely but "with 
  prudence." A University of Michigan survey showing consumer 
  confidence "at a two-year low" in December baffles local retail 
  analysts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Large retailers expect their selling prices to average somewhat more 
  than 4 percent higher in 1978, about the same as the rise in 1977, 
  with soft goods up more than hard goods. Purchasing managers for 
  industrial and commercial companies expect the prices they pay to 
  rise 6 to 7 percent on average in 1978, also about the same as in 
  1977. Prices of some commodities have been held down by stiff 
  competition. But utility rates are 10 percent or more above year ago 
  levels, while costs of insurance, transportation, and professional 
  services probably have increased even more.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto companies have been cutting production schedules for the first 
  quarter. Sales in December were a distinct disappointment, 
  particularly for the new down-sized intermediates. Sales of heavy 
  trucks also have slowed.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of layoffs have been announced in the district's important 
  farm equipment industry, with at least one tractor plant closed for 
  the whole month of January. Sales of farm equipment had been sharply 
  below year ago levels long before the widely publicized "farmers' 
  strike."
       </p>
       <p>
        The December survey of the Milwaukee purchasing managers shows that 
  46 percent expect their business to be better in the first quarter 
  than in the fourth quarter, as opposed to only 10 percent who expect 
  it to be worse. For the second half of 1978, 58 percent see business 
  better than in the first half, and only 5 percent expect it to be 
  worse. This is significant because of the heavy emphasis on capital 
  goods production in the Milwaukee area. Also, a high proportion 
  report that their companies' capital expenditures will be higher in 
  1978. Finally, the proportion reporting higher output and orders was 
  larger in December than in November. Inventories were reduced on 
  average in both months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for most types of capital goods has continued in a modest 
  uptrend. Foreign demand for US equipment has remained sluggish, 
  however. Among the most confident firms are producers of 
  sophisticated machine tools, often used in mass production 
  processes. The auto industry continues to dominate these orders, but 
  demand from other industries also has improved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel companies expect an improvement in their shipments in the 
  first quarter because of restrictions on imports, low user 
  inventories, and further gains in total usage. However, auto 
  producers probably will reduce their orders for steel. While total 
  steel imports into the US were up about one-third last year, imports 
  into the Great Lakes area rose by over three-fourths. Many of the 
  vessels waiting to exit the Seaway after the scheduled closing date 
  of December 15 had brought in European steel and had delayed their 
  sailings as they sought cargoes for the return voyage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Relatively favorable weather in December and early January permitted 
  private and public construction projects to continue in a period 
  when outside work had virtually ceased last winter because of severe 
  cold and strong winds. Four new office buildings totaling 3.8 
  million square feet are underway (or soon will be) in Chicago's 
  Loop, scheduled for completion in 1979. Over 5 million square feet 
  of office space is said to be vacant in the Loop, but large blocks 
  of top notch space are not available.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most housing experts believe that homebuilding will be strong again 
  this year. Prices are still rising at a 9 to 10 percent pace. 
  Shortages of materials, particularly insulation and sheetrock, are 
  not likely to be resolved in 1978. Limited availability of developed 
  lots, with sewer restrictions a large factor, has held back plans of 
  some builders. Some of the largest Chicago area S&amp;Ls recently raised 
  their basic rates on 80 percent home mortgages from 8.75 to 9 
  percent. Moderate further tightening of rates is expected. Opinions 
  vary as to whether availability of mortgage funds will limit 
  construction this year. The main question mark is the extent of 
  disintermediation, already noted by some lenders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Permits for apartment units in the Chicago area in 1977 were about 
  double the level of 1975. Nevertheless, apartments comprised only 34 
  percent of all units, compared to 58 percent in 1971 and 1972. 
  Suburbs reporting the largest increases in permits in 1977 are 
  generally 30 miles or more from the Loop, and often 6 to 7 miles 
  from public transportation.
