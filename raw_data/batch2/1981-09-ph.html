      Indications from the Third District point to mixed business activity 
for the month of September. Area manufacturers say industrial 
activity is showing some signs of expansion, for the second month in 
a row, which could signal the start of the upward trend they've been 
predicting for some months. As for the future, they project a strong 
boost in industrial activity by March. Local retail merchants report 
mixed sales volumes in September but look forward to a strong 
Christmas season this year. In the financial sector, District 
bankers indicate sluggish loan activity. Business loan volume is 
slightly ahead of year-ago figures, while consumer loans are said to 
be down sharply in September. Area bankers forecast little to no 
improvement in loan activity over the next six months. On the
residential construction side, sales have dropped off sharply, owing 
primarily to a tight mortgage market according to area real estate 
contacts. Some new groundbreakings for townhouses and condominiums 
are reported, but area contractors and developers are said to be 
holding off on starts for detached single homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area industrial activity is showing more signs of expansion in 
September. Manufacturers responding to the September Business 
Outlook Survey report, for the second consecutive month, a slight 
pickup in overall manufacturing activity. This could signal the 
start of the upward trend in business they've been predicting for 
some months. Reflecting the upturn in industrial activity in 
September, reports of rising new orders and shipments are more 
widespread than at any time since April 1977. On the employment 
front, the situation looks a little better as well this month. 
Manufacturers responding to the survey report lengthening the 
average workweek, marginally, for the first time in over two years. 
However, no real changes in payrolls are reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, survey participants continue to be optimistic 
as over one-half of the respondents are projecting a strong boost in 
industrial activity by March. New orders and shipments are expected 
to take off and producers' backlogs to swell by then also. The 
upbeat outlook may be good news for area labor as well, as survey 
participants plan to increase factory payrolls and add hours to the 
workweek within the next six months. Growing expenditures on plant 
and equipment are also forecast at 1 out of 3 firms polled.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local industrial prices are up again in September with over one-half 
of the survey participants paying more for raw materials than they 
did in August and about one-third charging more for their finished 
products. Area manufacturers expect inflation to continue over the 
next two quarters, as 9 out of 10 survey respondents anticipate 
higher input costs by March and nearly 8 out of 10 are planning 
price hikes for the goods they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although September is traditionally a big month for "back to school" 
business, overall retail activity remains mixed. Reports of current 
dollar sales range from 4 percent below to 10 percent above 
September '80 levels. Area retailers say sales of soft goods 
(apparel, shoes, and small household items) and luxury goods 
(electronic equipment and entertainment systems) are making a better 
showing than other lines this month. Credit card sales continue to 
be strong and collection is good.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the future, District retailers are optimistic about the next 
six months. Some area contacts say the October 1 tax cut may give 
sales an added boost, about 2 to 3 percent. Other merchants, on the 
other hand, fear the Administration's budget cuts will pinch 
household budgets even more, leaving retail sales volume lower by 
March. Nevertheless, a strong Christmas season is expected and 
retailers are beginning to build up their stock levels. Inventories 
remain in-line and inventory-sales ratios are reported to be 
healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers report mixed loan activity in September. C&amp;I; 
loan volume is up 5 to 10 percent over year-ago figures, with some 
bankers reporting below-prime lending which has boosted their 
volumes to the upper end of this range. Consumer loan activity, 
however, is down as much as 21 percent this month from a year ago 
and is well below budget. Business borrowing is in-line with area 
bankers' expectations, for the most part. Looking ahead to March, 
local bankers say they are not too optimistic about the next six 
months. Some contacts are projecting commercial loans to increase 
only modestly, about 2 to 3 percent, if at all, while others 
forecast a slight slippage, 5 to 6 percent, in business borrowing. 
No improvement in retail loan activity is expected over the next two 
quarters as area bankers expect consumer loans to slide further by 
March.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of deposit flows in the Third District indicate demand 
deposit levels to be mixed, running 11 percent below to 2 percent 
above last year's figures. Time and savings deposits, on the other 
hand, are up 4 to 11 percent and generally as planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local bankers in the Third District are currently quoting a prime 
rate of 19 1/2 percent. Area contacts are anticipating a slowdown in 
the economy over the next two quarters which, they say, will drop 
the prime to about 16 to 16 1/2 percent by March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing sales in the Third District are down sharply this month 
compared with year-ago levels, according to area brokers. New 
residential sales are reported down 50 to 75 percent from September 
'80 figures, while resales have fallen 25 to 50 percent. Prices are 
said to be softening by as much as 10 percent on new homes and by 
about 5 percent on resales. Mortgage rates of up to 18 1/4 percent 
have discouraged many buyers. Area brokers say if mortgage rates 
drop 4 to 6 points by next spring, their sales could increase by 25 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the construction scene, activity appears to be mixed. No new 
starts on detached single homes are reported, although contacts say 
new groundbreakings for townhouses and condominiums in downtown 
Philadelphia and the New Jersey shore are picking up.
