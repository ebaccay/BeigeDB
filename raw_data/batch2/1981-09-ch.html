      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District shows no signs of 
the revival that had been hoped for by this time. Orders for capital 
goods have slowed further. Inventories are being held at low levels, 
and reduced further. Retail sales of general merchandise slipped 
back in recent weeks. Employment prospects are bleak, but 
compensation continues to rise rapidly. The housing market dropped 
even lower in late summer. Excellent crop forecasts reduce farm 
income prospects. Financial markets are strained, but credit is 
available to qualified borrowers. Some important district companies 
are experiencing severe financial problems. Despite the generally 
gloomy outlook, we do not detect signs of a sudden sharp drop in 
total activity such as occurred in the fall of 1974 and the spring 
of 1980.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The tax act
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District executives are carefully examining the 
complicated Economic Recovery Tax Act to determine how it might 
affect demand for their products and their own investment plans. 
Faster depreciation, liberalized investment tax credits, and other 
tax reductions are expected to have a distinct positive impact on 
the demand for capital goods, but only after some easing of credit 
terms and clarification of uncertainties, here and abroad.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Attitudes
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys and public statements indicate that confidence of 
consumers, businessmen, farmers, and lenders eroded in the third 
quarter. For many this reflects a failure of the upturn to appear as 
predicted rather than a sharp decline in income and sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Companies in trouble
      <br/>
      Some large district corporations are hard-
pressed financially. Facilities are being closed or offered for 
sale, work staffs are being trimmed, payments delayed, and debts 
restructured.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital expenditures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Order backlogs of most capital goods producers 
are declining and further cuts in output are probable. Order 
cancellations have become more common. Included are equipment for 
agriculture, construction, railroads, trucklines, and various 
factory facilities. The motor industry has deferred various large 
projects for new products. A large nuclear power plant has been 
canceled and construction of other power plants is in doubt. On the 
other hand, some well-financed capital goods producers are going 
ahead on schedule with programs for new products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price discounting is reported for building materials, 
metals, gasoline, and some capital goods. However, most district 
companies are paying higher prices on average each month. Prices 
that are depressed currently could recover lost ground rapidly if 
demand strengthened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Stocks of steel, non-ferrous metals, building materials 
and various equipment components are below comfortable working 
levels. Nevertheless, an "inventory squeeze" is in progress under 
pressure from financial executives who wish to improve year-end 
balance sheets and reduce borrowing costs. Fortunately, low 
inventories reduce the chances of a cumulative recession, and 
improve prospects for an upturn after the turn of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District employment continues to lag the national 
performance. New layoffs have been announced in various industries, 
but the real problem is reduced hiring by both industry and 
government.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Compensation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Increases in compensation in the district have 
averaged close to 10 percent this year, despite substantial 
unemployment. Most employers are budgeting similar increases for 
1982. Some compensation increases have been much larger. 
Construction equipment operators recently accepted a 14 percent 
first-year increase after a long strike. Truckers and the steel and 
auto firms are pressing hard to moderate increases in compensation, 
especially COLA clauses, but strong union resistance is certain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise retailers report that sales 
weakened in the summer after showing strength in the spring. 
Weakness is "across-the-board", but has been most pronounced in big 
ticket items including appliances and furniture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of cars were stimulated artificially in August 
and early September by rebates and interest subsidies. Although 
inventories were reduced significantly, production schedules for 
both cars and trucks for the fourth quarter have been cut.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for steel has ebbed and, shipment estimates have been 
reduced. The main cause is lower demand from the auto industry, but 
inventory reductions are in progress in most industries. Leadtimes 
are very short.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of both new and used housing have sunk to an 
extremely low level. Many builders and subcontractors have gone out 
of business and others are expected to follow. Most builders are 
building only to order, and orders are few. An unusually high 
proportion of mortgage loan applications are being rejected because 
potential borrowers are unable to meet credit standards. The housing 
slump is expected to continue into next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most heavy construction in the Chicago 
area was halted by an equipment operators' strike that began July 20 
and lasted eight weeks. Many projects will be pushed ahead with long 
hours at overtime to make as much progress as possible before bad 
weather hampers operations. Contract data suggests a decline in 
nonresidential construction next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Abundant summer rains raised estimates of yields on 
principal crops. With the exception of Indiana, prospects for the 
district are especially good. Corn output in the district is 
expected to set a new record while soybeans are likely to match the 
1979 record. Depressed crop prices suggest very low earning for 
farmers for the second year in a row and analysts do not expect a 
significant improvement next year. This means continued depressed 
sales of equipment and other items to farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Extremely high interest rates continued to dampen 
activity in most sectors. But credit remains available to borrowers 
who can meet strict standards, in contrast to the situation in the 
spring of 1980. Hopes for an early, substantial decline in interest 
rates are fading. Local analysts complain that credit demands of the 
federal government and the energy sector crowd out many other 
borrowers. The new "All Savers" certificates are being promoted 
actively, but little benefit for housing is expected. A decline of 
three or four points in long-term rates, we are told, would 
stimulate a surge of demand for funds for home mortgages, 
corporations and municipalities.
