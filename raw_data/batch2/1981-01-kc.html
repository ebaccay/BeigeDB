      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions in the Tenth District continue to show 
little strength. Softness in retail sales is expected to continue 
for a while, and the short-term outlook for auto sales is viewed as 
poor. Inventories of retailers and manufacturers are higher than 
desired. The winter wheat crop is in some danger due to lack of 
moisture. Loan demand at commercial banks has weakened recently, 
with loans to the energy industry an exception.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales and Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Tenth District retailers indicate 
that total dollar sales in 1980 were 5-10 per cent greater than in 
1979. But sales in December 1980 and January 1981 have not shown 
that much strength in most areas of the District. Sales have been 
strongest in durable goods and higher priced items, primarily 
quality apparel. Most retailers expect the current softness of total 
sales to continue, at least through the first and second quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of retailers continue to report negligible merchandise 
cost increases in recent months are reducing upward pressure on 
retail prices. Most retailers note recent downward pressure on 
profit margins because of increases in advertising expenditures, 
utility bills, and other operational expenses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent weakness in total dollar sales leaves most retailers in 
the Tenth District with inventory levels that are slightly higher 
than desirable. However, none of the retailers report any plans for 
extra clearance sales in January or February. All retailers expect 
to continue past practices of tightly controlling inventory levels, 
through the first half of 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturers Inventories and Input Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Over half the purchasing 
agents contacted report that input prices are above their year-ago 
levels by 10 per cent or less, but with increases as great or 
greater in recent months than in most of 1980. Lead times on 
deliveries are satisfactory throughout the District. There has been 
some undesired accumulation of materials inventories, but most 
companies are satisfied with their inventory levels. New purchase 
orders for most companies are down or unchanged from last year. 
About one-half of the companies contacted report excess operating 
capacity and laid off workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District Automobile Dealers' Associations report 
very sluggish sales and a poor short-term outlook, with high 
interest rates a major factor. The automakers' finance companies, 
now charging about 15-1/2 per cent, are the primary source of 
customer financing. Excess inventories are causing problems for many 
dealers, especially since they must pay over 20 per cent interest to 
finance those inventories. Although few dealers have recently gone 
out of business, more closings are anticipated before spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Savings and Loan Association spokesmen report that 
savings inflows were somewhat higher in 1980 than in 1979. Most are 
mildly optimistic about inflows in the near future, mainly because 
of the introduction of NOW accounts. Demand for residential 
mortgages continues to be very depressed, and the outlook is bleak. 
Conventional mortgage rates are in the 14-15 per cent range, and are 
expected to remain there through early 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand weakened at most Tenth District 
banks contacted this month as borrowers reacted to the high level of 
interest rates. Only commercial and industrial loans exhibited 
strength, and much of this activity was concentrated in the energy 
industry in Oklahoma. Real estate, agriculture, and consumer loans 
are depressed across the District. Most large banks report a 20 per 
cent prime rate, up from 18 1/2 per cent in December. At the same 
time there were scattered reports of increased price competition in 
response to the weaker loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposits at Tenth District banks were generally up during the past 
month with much of the increase in interest bearing deposits. Money 
market certificates show strong growth in response to the rise in 
yields. At the same time, some of the larger banks are beginning to 
run off large CD's. All banks contacted began offering NOW's and 
most report consumer response equal to or greater than projected. 
Most bankers feel that the bulk of the increase in NOW's is coming 
from existing demand deposits and from conversion of ATS accounts. 
Little new money is being attracted to these accounts because of 
relatively high minimum balances and service charges. Banks report 
some net outflow of funds in those areas with strong competition 
from savings institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District winter wheat crop appears to be in 
reasonably good condition, despite a lack of snow cover which is 
needed to protect the wheat seedlings from wind damage and extreme 
temperatures during February and March. Additional moisture is 
necessary within the next month to prevent deterioration of the 
crop. Cattle producers in the Tenth District, many of whom only 
broke even during 1980, are having some difficulties repaying 
current loans. Area bankers are requesting that these producers seek 
partial or total funding for 1981 from the Farmers' Home 
Administration. Producers in Nebraska have been suffering the most 
because cattle prices there are lower than elsewhere in the 
District. Interest rates on short and intermediate term loans at 
agricultural banks in the District are in the 17 to 18 per cent 
range. As a result loan demand is presently lower than at any time 
since the start of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's 
agricultural credit survey in 1976.
