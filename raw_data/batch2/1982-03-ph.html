      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District in March are that the economic 
slump is bottoming out for some industries, and that the economy may 
be on the verge of a turnaround. District manufacturers say the pace 
of industrial activity held steady this month, bolstered mainly by 
nondurables. Retail merchants say things are just about where they 
were a year ago as well, but hope for a push as they enter the 
Spring selling season. Bankers report that business borrowing is 
flat. The only real sour note comes from the homebuilding industry 
where things are simply described as "worse-not better".
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District businessmen are reasonably optimistic, but not overly 
so. Manufacturers predict a pickup soon, but are a little less 
enthusiastic than they were a month ago. Retailers, likewise see 
some strength, but not a lot. Bankers anticipate little in the way 
of loan growth, but are forecasting healthy deposit flows and lower 
interest rates, at least for the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area homebuilders continue to suffer as high mortgage rates and 
other factors are keeping away buyers in droves. "Other factors," 
according to one contact in New Jersey, include uncertainty about 
interest rates, inflation, and jobs. Although traffic is up slightly 
through new homes, few people are buying. If January and February 
are any indication of things to come, New Jersey housing starts may 
fall below 10,000 in 1982, or less than half of the 1973-75 
recession level. There is some feeling that unless there is some 
improvement within 30 to 60 days, many subcontractors will have to 
fold.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to the most recent Business Outlook Survey say the six 
month slump in area industrial activity seems to be bottoming out. 
Although business in the durable goods industries continues to sag, 
a pickup in nondurables has given a rosier complexion to the overall 
industrial outlook. Specific indications of a leveling off of the 
downturn include higher levels of new orders and shipments, both of 
which have rebounded from their winter trough, and less prevalent 
reports of payroll cuts. Inventories, on the other hand, are still 
being drawn down, paced by sharp reductions in the durables sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, manufacturing executives polled this month are still 
optimistic, but, in spite of the apparent turnaround, their outlook 
has softened. While general business conditions are expected to 
improve by September at over 50 percent of the firms sampled, a 
small but significant number of respondents now foresee a drop in 
activity. Strong growth in new orders and shipments is still widely 
expected, although not as widely as in recent surveys. Producers 
remain very cautious, and are planning little expansion of either 
inventories or capital expenditures before late summer. Any 
increased demand for their goods will be satisfied by hiring new 
workers and lengthening hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial price hikes are more prevalent in March. Over one-third 
of the manufacturers responding to the survey this month report 
higher costs, and nearly one-fourth say they are charging more for 
the goods they sell. There are widespread expectations of further 
price inflation over the next six months as well. More than 75 
percent of those polled are predicting higher prices for raw 
materials by September, and over 50 percent are planning to raise 
the price of their finished goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      March department store sales are looking fairly grim at this point, 
especially so as they come on the heels of a disastrous January and 
barely adequate February. Sales volume is running just about even 
with year-ago levels. Sales analysts say consumers are now receiving 
their winter fuel bills, and are spending their money on oil, gas, 
and electricity rather than spring clothing. An early Easter this 
year should give a boost to sales in late March though, and the 
month could turn in an overall performance 6 to 7 percent better 
than a year ago. Retail inventories are a little heavy at some 
stores, but, in general, are pretty clean.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead to the next six months, retailers seem to be planning 
for a fairly tough second quarter and only a modest third quarter. 
Summer sales are expected to run 2 to 5 percent ahead of year-
earlier volume. Many merchants are less than optimistic simply 
because they see nothing in the near term to turn the consumer 
around.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District banking contacts say business loan volume is up 
between 3 and 10 percent from a year ago, but has flattened out in 
recent months. Consumer loans are off substantially, but mostly by 
design. As for the future, area bankers foresee continued steadiness 
for C&amp;I loans, now that inventories have been worked off in many 
industries. A change in the mix of funding over the next six months, 
away from bank loans and into bonds, could also keep the lid on 
business borrowing at banks. The outlook for consumer loans is 
actually a little brighter this month. Many Philadelphia banks are 
setting up card operations in Delaware, where usury laws were 
abolished last year. Those banks hope to pick up new retail business 
later this year, thereby giving consumer borrowing in this area a 
shot in the arm.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers are in agreement that a weak economy, 
dropping inflation, and a moderation of private credit demands will 
continue to draw interest rates down, with the prime rate, currently 
at 16 1/2 percent, dropping another 200 to 250 basis points. 
Estimates of the timing of a trough in interest rates range from 
June to September. As the economy turns the corner, rates are 
expected to start climbing again, unless a solution to the Federal 
budget dilemma becomes apparent. The recent bulge in Ml is expected 
to work itself out with little permanent effect on interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows at area banks have held up surprisingly well in 1982, 
despite weakness in the economy and market rates still running well 
above passbook and statement savings yields. Demand deposits have 
dropped only slightly from high year-end levels, while total time 
and savings have grown. The only explanation offered for the 
apparent insensitivity of savings to interest rates has been that 
the precautionary demand for money has increased in the last few 
months.
