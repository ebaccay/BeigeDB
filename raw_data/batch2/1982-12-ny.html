      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In recent weeks the Second District economy showed a few signs of 
improvement, but the manufacturing sector remained depressed. 
Promotions sparked early holiday shopping in the District and 
resulted in a further strengthening of retail sales. Declining 
mortgage rates produced a modest rise in home sales, and builders 
were cautiously optimistic about further growth. Recent developments 
in the nonresidential real estate market were mixed, but some 
improvement did occur on balance. In manufacturing, however, 
business leaders saw no pickup and reported increasing pessimism 
about the short-run outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Promotional efforts spurred early holiday shopping in the District, 
and pushed year-over-year gains in November above those of earlier 
months. This strength was expected to continue through the holiday 
season. The eastern region in general met or exceeded sales plans 
for those national retailers contacted, while sales in much of the 
rest of the country continued to lag behind. Apparel, cosmetics, 
housewares, and consumer electronics were all reported moving well. 
Seasonal increases in employment matched year ago levels for most 
stores, and inventories were generally in line with planned sales. 
Retailers who had experienced a poor fall season expected business 
to be difficult again in 1983, but those with better sales in 
September and October looked forward to further gains in the new 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential construction market showed additional signs of life 
during November though the rise in new home sales was modest. 
Moderately priced homes geared to first-time homebuyers sold well. 
The existing home market also experienced a pickup in sales 
activity. Declining mortgage rates were cited as a major factor in 
the sale of both new and existing homes. As a result of the renewed 
interest on the part of actual and potential buyers, builder 
optimism increased though some expressed concern that interest rates 
might rise again because of high credit demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      The nonresidential real estate market also improved but demand for 
space continued weak in many areas of the District. Activity and 
planning by office developers increased in midtown New York City 
even as the downtown market remained soft. The pattern was also 
mixed in the suburbs: leasing activity was up in New Jersey and new 
construction occurred in Westchester and Long Island, while in 
Connecticut the slow pace of previous months persisted. Industrial 
construction remained depressed throughout the District, although 
some pickup was reported on Long Island.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The manufacturing sector continued to be very weak except for the 
relatively healthy high technology and defense industries. Overall 
sales remained poor in industries ranging from metal fabricating to 
furniture. Many companies were finding it difficult to maintain 
steady production. At a few concerns, however, orders were bolstered 
by a unique product line or the closure of a competitor. Cost-
cutting measures continued, including layoffs and the spreading out 
of pay increases over longer periods of time. Shutdowns for 
Christmas were expected to be longer than usual. Scattered recalls 
of workers occurred only in response to specific orders and 
therefore were viewed as temporary. Although the recent drop in 
interest rates eased liquidity problems somewhat, several companies 
were thought to be bordering on insolvency and in need of buyers to 
bail them out. The nonmanufacturing sector still has not suffered a 
severe downturn, with some expansion continuing in the financial and 
service industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for retailing and construction brightened, but our 
manufacturing contacts reported a deepening pessimism about the 
future. When the rate of deterioration slowed in September, these 
same contacts expressed a "glimmer of hope" that an upturn would 
begin within a couple of months. Since then, the recovery has proven 
elusive and that glimmer has disappeared. If demand should pick up, 
however, companies will be able to increase production quickly since 
inventories, except for cars, have been reduced to very low levels. 
One of our respondents cited a lack of a coherent policy at the 
national level as the source of the pervasive gloom.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Donald Maude (Merrill Lynch), 
Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty Trust), and Francis Schott 
(Equitable Life Assurance Society): Their views of course are 
personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maude: A sustained economic recovery cannot get under way unless 
interest rates are brought down further. However, the Fed is running 
out of leeway for bringing down these rates by pushing down the 
funds rate and the discount rate. The credibility issue is growing 
and will become more real once the markets see signs of economic 
recovery. To bring rates down in a credible fashion, the Fed should 
quantify publicly to the markets the magnitude of precautionary 
balance building that has bloated M-l over the past year, go back to 
shift adjusting other checkable deposits and come up with 1983 M-l 
targets more realistic with trend changes in velocity and M-2 
targets that net out the bloating of interest-crediting to those 
components earning market rates of interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: There is a real danger that the specter of higher interest 
costs that may be incurred by banks in competing for deposits in new 
DIDC authorized accounts will slow banks' willingness to reduce 
lending rates. This in turn may delay the rebound in consumer 
spending that would be normal at this stage of the business cycle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: Signs of revival in housing and automobiles and improved 
cash flow at thrifts and life insurance companies raise the question 
whether the Fed has done enough to stimulate recovery. An evaluation 
period may be appropriate. Nevertheless the number and extent of 
trouble situations domestically and internationally suggest that the 
indirect assistance of a further easing of credit conditions may 
well be advisable.
