      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District in October are that the regional 
is expanding. Local manufacturing conditions have improved again, 
and retail sales have pushed even higher. In the financial sector, 
loan volume has improved recently, but it remains mixed. In 
addition, a dip in mortgage rates has halted the decline in activity 
in the local housing market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District contacts expect the expansion to continue over the 
next six months. More gains for area industry are expected and 
substantial consumer spending growth is projected. Loan activity is 
also likely to gain strength by April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate And Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the Third District housing market has held fairly steady 
since early September. Although sales are still better than a year 
ago, they remain disappointingly below the pace set this past 
spring. The steadying influence in current sales activity has been a 
slight dip in mortgage rates, but brokers indicate that many buyers 
are hesitant to commit now in anticipation of further declines in 
rates in the near future. Traffic through new and older homes is 
reported to be down, and, because of the earlier let up in sales, 
new starts are very slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers responding to the October Business Outlook Survey 
report that Third District industrial activity is entering the 
fourth quarter of 1983 with much the same strength as shown in the 
previous three quarters of the year. About 45 percent of 
participating executives indicate that overall business conditions 
have improved in October, and only a very small number of 
respondents report any drop-off since September. New orders and 
shipments continue to display widespread growth in October, and 
employment gains remain solid. Many manufacturers say they have 
added to factory payrolls or lengthened working hours since 
September. Local producers do, however, report another marginal 
decline in inventories this month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, general manufacturing activity in the Third District 
is expected to continue to expand over the next six months, but, as 
in September, respondents' forecasts seem to predict a moderation of 
the recovery. Roughly two thirds of the businessmen polled forecast 
better conditions within six months; that is about the same as a 
month ago, but noticeably less than earlier in the year. 
Nevertheless, strong gains in new orders and shipments are likely to 
continue and some inventory growth is projected. Manufacturers are 
planning to bite more workers and to expand the average workweek, 
but their expenditures for plant and equipment are expected to 
remain relatively weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices continue to reflect the rapid expansion of 
manufacturing activity. The prices of both inputs and final products 
have risen again in October, and further escalation is projected 
over the next six months. More than three quarters of the 
participating manufacturers foresee higher raw materials costs by 
next spring and one half expect to up their own products' prices 
over that time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Department store sales in the Third District have expanded more 
rapidly in the last six weeks than merchants had anticipated. 
According to local retailers, buoyant consumer attitudes, very 
favorable weather conditions and heavy promotional activity have 
pushed year-over-year sales gains even higher, reaching the mid-teens at most area stores. Merchants say apparel, home furnishings 
and personal computers are among the big movers in October. In spite 
of such hefty sales growth at a low inflation rate, however, many 
store owners report that profit margins have remained very slim. 
They attribute the squeeze to the costs associated with heavy 
reliance on promotional activity in generating current sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of the current surge in activity, local retailers have 
become less cautious about. business in the next six months. They 
are now forecasting gains of between 6 percent and 9 percent over 
healthy year-earlier levels for spring 1984. If, as expected, prices 
rise only slightly, substantial real gains for area merchants are 
likely.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for consumer spending is apparently robust enough to 
warrant further accumulation of retail inventories. Stocks of 
consumer goods, which have grown in recent weeks to levels about 10 
percent higher than a year ago, are expected to swell even more by 
April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan activity at Third District banks has been on the upswing in 
October. Local bankers report that C&amp;I loan demand is finally 
showing some signs of breaking out of its slump. They indicate, 
however, that further improvement in the cash flow of many area 
businesses has again limited the growth of commercial demand. The 
result is that, while slightly better than a month ago, business 
loan volume, now ranging from 8 percent below to 20 percent above a 
year ago, remains mixed. On the other hand, area banks are still 
reaping the benefits of their expanded push in retail lending. 
Lenders say that, with interest rates relatively steady and the 
general economy improving rapidly, consumer credit demands have 
responded very positively to new marketing efforts As a result, 
retail loan volume in October is between 14 percent and 30 percent 
ahead on a year-over-year basis, according to contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers are projecting even better business for the 
next six months. By April, more substantial gains in C&amp;I lending are 
anticipated as businesses begin to look mote aid more toward 
external sources for new financing. Bankers also plan to keep the 
push on consumer loans and expect to see further growth by spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate at major banks in the Third District is unchanged at 
11 percent in October. Financial contacts do not foresee any 
substantial pressures pushing rates either up or down in the next 
six months. They expect that Fed policy will counterbalance 
expanding private credit demands aid keep interest rates flat into 
early 1984. Contacts noted, however, that there is still a lot of 
uncertainty over the international debt situation, and that poses a 
threat to continued stability in rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows have turned mixed in October, according to local 
bankers. Demand deposits have slipped below year-earlier levels for 
the first time in quite awhile, but time deposits remain strong. 
Although growth in the deregulated accounts has settled down, time 
and savings balances are now as much as 32 percent ahead of a year 
ago.
