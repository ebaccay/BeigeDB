      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 16, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity remained sluggish in the Second District during 
November, with some further softening evident. Retail activity 
unexpectedly slowed before Thanksgiving but has since recovered 
somewhat. Poor conditions persisted in manufacturing and additional 
weakening in capital goods orders was observed. Residential 
construction continued to be depressed, but a falloff in 
nonresidential construction contracts was believed to be temporary. 
Business economists now expect sizable declines in real GNP during 
the fourth quarter and no real pickup until the second quarter or 
half of 1982. On the financial side, mergers, acquisitions, and cash 
shortages pushed up the demand for business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity virtually stopped growing in early November, with 
some department stores experiencing a drop in business. The pace has 
quickened since Thanksgiving, but most retailers are still slightly 
below plan. Since the bulk of Christmas buying has been occurring 
later in the season in recent years, merchants are hopeful that the 
pickup in sales will continue, producing a reasonably good holiday 
season overall. Many stores are depending on heavy promotions and 
price markdowns to spur sales. All respondents expressed serious 
concern about January and beyond.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained depressed during November, with 
further weakening reported by some firms. After appearing to bottom 
out during September and October, new orders received by capital 
goods producers declined again. Although one capital goods supplier 
maintained output by depleting its backlog, all others cut 
production levels. Workforces have been reduced through layoffs or 
attrition. One establishment, however, preferred to retain highly 
skilled employees and to add the excess output to its inventories. 
Capital spending by many of these producers of durable equipment has 
been lowered, and, in one instance, stopped altogether.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other manufacturers also experienced flat or slightly lower sales. 
Even the previously strong demand for data processing equipment has 
slipped. The only increase in business was reported by a company 
whose aerospace division received a large quantity of new defense 
contracts. Businesses are adjusting to the bleak situation with 
stringent cost controls, the elimination of internal inefficiencies, 
and in one case, a restructuring of pricing policies to curtail 
price cutting competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Home Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity continues to be very low in the residential 
sector and strong in the nonresidential sector. Home sales are down 
from October's poor level. High financing costs are blamed for the 
sluggish activity in the residential area. Recent declines in 
interest rates have not yet improved conditions. Any gains that do 
occur are expected to be modest and temporary. As for nonresidential 
construction, a drop in the value of contracts let in New York City 
is viewed as only temporary. Major projects such as Battery Park 
City are scheduled to begin soon, and the new work should be 
sufficient to sustain a high rate of office construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business economists have revised their forecasts of economic growth 
sharply downward. A dismal fourth quarter is expected to yield a 
real GNP decline as large as 7 percent, followed by negligible 
growth at best during the first quarter of 1982. Manufacturers 
generally agree with this outlook, anticipating no significant 
upswing in business until the second quarter or later. Overall 
growth for next year is estimated to be one percent or lower by all 
but one economist. The prime rate is projected to average 14 percent 
during the coming year. The 1982 inflation outlook is unchanged from 
the 8 to 9 percent level forecast last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending officers at commercial banks report that there have been 
moderate to significant increases in demands for business loans 
during recent weeks. Mergers and acquisitions were an important 
source of the increased demand, as was the greater-than-expected 
deterioration of corporate cash flows. A related source of the 
strength in loan demands has been the need to finance unintended 
inventory accumulations. While demands for bank loans have been 
strong, the growth of commercial paper outstanding has been 
sluggish. Although rates on commercial paper are appreciably below 
the posted prime rate, bank borrowing demands have remained strong 
because of the flexibility of such borrowing arrangements and the 
widespread use of below-prime lending facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Francis Schott (Equitable Life 
Assurance), Robert Stone (Irving Trust) and Albert Wojnilower (First 
Boston Corporation):
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: Institutional money flows are beginning to improve under the 
influence of lower interest rates. But demand for long-term funds is 
very heavy, partly in order to improve liquidity ratios and partly 
to finance investment projects, especially in energy. Therefore, 
long rates may stay relatively high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial markets are less concerned with fiscal 82 Federal deficit 
than with the grim prospects for fiscal 83 and 84. Money growth 
targets and fiscal prospects are viewed as clashing, with the 
private sector the likely victim.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stone: By letting borrowings get so low the Fed has effectively 
severed the connection between the discount rate and the Federal 
funds rate. The funds rate will nevertheless hold up in December, if 
only because of the seasonal strength in short term credit demands. 
But when these demands subside in January, for seasonal and perhaps 
for cyclical reasons as well, short term rates could fall sharply. 
Such a drop in rates could well be followed by a surge in the 
aggregates at what might be a most unpropitious time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent increases in aggregates should push required reserves up, and 
I believe the Fed should respond by letting enough borrowings emerge 
to reestablish the connection between the discount rate and the 
funds rate. "Enough" borrowing for this purpose are $500-600 million 
exclusive of seasonal borrowings and extended credit. Once that 
connection is reestablished the Fed can again do what it did so 
effectively over the past two or three months—lead the rate 
structure downward at its own pace by periodic reductions in the 
discount rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      By this means the Fed is most likely to achieve the objective of 
lowering interest rates while minimizing the risk of a serious 
overshoot in the aggregate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: Such indications as I am able to gather from business 
contacts support the view that the business decline may soon slow 
materially. This prospect, coupled with apparent acceleration of 
monetary growth, is roiling the bond market. Severe securities 
market repercussions are to be expected if average Federal funds 
rates were to rise.
