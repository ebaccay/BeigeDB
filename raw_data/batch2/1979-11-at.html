      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        A serious downturn in the District economy has not occurred, but 
  weaknesses are becoming increasingly evident. Generally, retail 
  sales have remained steady; however, auto sales declined. In many 
  areas, new home construction decelerated abruptly. Presently, 
  commercial building is propping up the construction industry, but 
  record interest rates will likely have a severe dampening effect on 
  future projects. Across the board, inventories are expected to 
  remain low because of nearly prohibitive financing charges. 
  Delinquencies on consumer credit are rising, but unemployment 
  remains relatively low.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales gains were moderate, but retailers are becoming less 
  optimistic about future prospects. Retailers at a major mid-
  Tennessee shopping mall report that sales are not meeting 
  expectations. In south Alabama, most soft goods merchants report 
  very slow sales, while a major Birmingham retailer indicates 
  extremely strong sales in the first half but weak sales in the 
  second half of October. Comments from Florida were still upbeat; 
  however, two south Florida directors see signs of sluggishness. As 
  with automobiles, the pleasure boat business has turned sharply 
  downward because of abruptly increased financing costs. Also, high 
  financing costs for retailers' inventories will keep these 
  inventories to a minimum. Many contacts report that consumers are 
  becoming very price and quality conscious and that credit buying is 
  being curbed. Consumer credit delinquencies continue to increase at 
  many banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the expiration of Chrysler's initial rebate program and the 
  jump in auto loan rates in October, auto sales turned down. 
  Increasingly strict credit requirements by lenders for auto loans 
  are further dampening sales. Dealers are keeping inventories to a 
  minimum because of drastically increased floor plan expenses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The two GM plants in the Atlanta area, which heretofore have not 
  experienced large-scale, indefinite layoffs, recently announced that 
  the entire Doraville night shift of 2,200 workers and the truck 
  assembly line of 650 employees at Lakewood will be laid off near the 
  end of November.
       </p>
       <p>
        Declines in residential construction are prevalent throughout the 
  District except in Florida, which so far has experienced unchanging 
  resiliency. Comments from northeast and central Florida indicate 
  continued buoyancy. Housing starts in Nashville and Knoxville are 
  down sharply. In northern Alabama, one contact reports that very few 
  starts are expected for the rest of 1979, while another says new 
  construction activity is at a "virtual standstill." Residential 
  mortgage funds in most of the District are becoming scarce. 
  Nonetheless, some S&amp;L's report adequate funds, together with 
  drastically reduced demand and a dearth of qualified applicants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial and industrial construction continues to prop up local 
  economies throughout the District. However, contacts caution that 
  ongoing projects were funded long ago. Present commercial 
  construction levels are providing relief for some building materials 
  suppliers who would otherwise be faced with declining orders 
  resulting from a drop-off in residential construction. Record 
  interest rates and decreased availability of funds do not augur well 
  for a continuation of healthy nonresidential construction activity. 
  Additionally, a northern Alabama contact reports that new orders at 
  architectural firms, the initial step of a construction project, 
  have slowed markedly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sharp spurt in interest rates has had pervasive repercussions. 
  The sophistication of savers is evidenced by a noticeable flow of 
  funds from banks to higher-yielding money market instruments. For 
  most District banks, loan demand is down, and an increasingly 
  cautious attitude is being taken regarding borrowers and liquidity. 
  One commercial banker reports he is making loans to preferred 
  customers in the interest of goodwill. An Atlanta credit union has 
  stopped loans entirely for furniture, appliances, and furnishings. 
  It is their intent to seriously curtail all lending activities, but 
  they have not forbidden all loans because of a concern for customer 
  relations. In Tennessee, it is reported that large institutional 
  investors, such as Prudential and Metropolitan Life, have taken 
  their money out of the long-term market and placed it in short-term 
  commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        District-wide, employment remains firm. Unemployment is expected to 
  nudge steadily upward in coming months. However, contacts from 
  localities with a diversified, service-oriented economic base 
  repeatedly express confidence regarding the ability of their area to 
  perform better than the nation in the event of adverse economic 
  developments. Atlanta, New Orleans, Nashville, and most metropolitan 
  areas of Florida are the most noteworthy examples.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to construct a coal 
  gasification complex valued in excess of one billion dollars in 
  eastern Tennessee or northern Alabama. This facility is projected to 
  supply one-third of the TVA region's energy needs by the mid-1980s, 
  and will be the world's second largest coal-gas plant. The 
  diversified paper products firm, Kimberly-Clark, which recently 
  divulged plans to construct a division headquarters and research 
  facilities near Atlanta, announced an initial construction 
  commitment of $300 million for a manufacturing plant and 
  distribution center in the Augusta area. This commitment is the 
  largest ever in Georgia. In another forest-industry development, the 
  United Furniture Workers of America made public a plan to relocate 
  its headquarters from New York City to Nashville. The movement of 
  most of the furniture industry to the South and lack of unionization 
  of southern furniture workers are the primary reasons.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sharply higher feed costs and very low market prices for broilers 
  and hogs are significantly widening loss margins for most producers. 
  These losses are causing hog farmers to cut back planned production, 
  and the number of eggs incubated for broiler chick placements has 
  declined dramatically. Soybean yields are up this season. Prices 
  have dropped from early summer levels, but compare favorably with 
  prior harvests.
