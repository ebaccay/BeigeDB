      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      High interest rates continue to undermine seriously the financial 
stability for a number of Sixth District businesses. The home 
building sector remains depressed and the forest products industry 
is on the brink of a major phase-down. Economic problems have caused 
an acceleration in savings and loan mergers. Positive developments 
are spotty, with an uptick in retail sales and expansion in the 
high-technology industries notable bright spots.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have strengthened 
recently compared with last year. Gains appear to be spread 
uniformly along product lines. Back-to-school sales were 
particularly healthy. Perhaps characteristic of the consumer's mood 
was the observation of one retailer that video tape recorders 
(clearly a luxury item) were his hottest sellers. He thinks that, 
since housing and auto sales have been stalled by high interest 
rates, more consumer dollars are being spent on retail items. 
Inventories were reported as being under control, but "profits have 
been cut back due to high carrying costs," according to several 
merchants. Credit card use has picked up. Retailers contacted were 
generally optimistic-expecting strong sales through December.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers say that promotions offering below market financing 
rates have stimulated new domestic car sales somewhat. 
Nonparticipating agencies reported declines in sales. All dealers 
contacted expressed a belief that conditions were unlikely to 
improve over the next three to six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home buying and building have been 
reduced to a trickle by high mortgage interest rates. A spokesman 
for one of Atlanta's largest savings and loans characterized 
construction lending as "substantially terminated." At this time of 
year, builders are usually restocking their inventory before winter, 
he added. The only people still buying homes are those who don't 
have a choice such as transferees. Homes that are being sold require 
some type of owner financing and/or second mortgage arrangement. In 
northern Alabama, banks report a large overhang of unsold houses 
which were financed by construction loans to builders.
     </p>
     <p>
      One response to the high cost of funds and weak loan demand has been 
an increase in savings and loan mergers in the District as across 
the country. In Georgia, a Gainesville savings and loan and one in 
Savannah formed a holding company that plans to expand statewide. 
One of Georgia's largest associations also plans to merge with three 
others in the state to reach combined assets approaching $1.4 
billion. A Miami-based association will combine with one in New York 
and California to form the largest savings and loan association in 
the nation. In an attempt to maintain their loan volume, some 
District financial institutions are seeking loans outside their 
immediate lending area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Brisk activity in office and industrial construction continues 
throughout most of the District; however, softness in the rental 
market for office space is anticipated in a number of areas as 
buildings that were just starting up when interest rates began to 
soar reach completion. This softness is expected to be only 
temporary.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The home building dilemma has seriously 
affected the forest products industry. Due to lack of demand for 
lumber and plywood, mills are on the brink of a major phase-down. 
Large companies have all the inventory they can handle and small 
companies cannot afford to borrow at high interest rates to stay in 
operation. Significant layoffs have occurred as a result of mill 
closings and curtailments of operations. Mills in the District are 
concentrated in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. Building supply 
outlet sales to residential builders have declined noticeably, a 
reflection of the decreased building activity. There seems little 
hope for a quick turnaround, since there is always less demand for 
building materials during the fall and winter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism traffic in Florida appears to have fallen far short of 
expectations. The southwest region of the state had its slowest 
season in ten years, off almost 25 percent from last year. At the 
Port of Miami, cancellations of cruise reservations are growing and 
attendance at major central Florida attractions has been down 
significantly from year-ago figures. Business lenders hope that the 
recently completed $300 million futuristic Orlando Airport will help 
boost the central Florida tourist industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      On a brighter note, clusters of high-technology companies are 
emerging in the District. Expansion has been rapid in southern 
Florida with its economic ties to the Kennedy Space Center and at 
Huntsville, Alabama, site of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center. Technology Park in 
Atlanta has attracted more than 40 high-tech firms to the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Atlanta-area employers predict an improved employment outlook for 
the next three months, according to a recent survey by a temporary 
help firm. Openings are expected mostly in the service industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop production prospects are much improved from 1980's 
level because farmers planted more acres of most crops and 1981's 
weather has been a good deal more favorable. Projected yields for 
most crops are up one-fifth or more from 1980's level; however, 
lingering dry weather in some areas has prevented a return to 
normal. Cattle producers are somewhat encouraged by the prospective 
abundance of feed crops, but calf prices remain 22 percent below the 
year-ago level. The poultry industry has also suffered with lower 
prices and high production costs. A strong dollar overseas has 
curtailed egg exports.
     </p>
     <p>
      Quick action in Florida on the Medfly problem now appears to have 
averted damage to the state's crops.
