      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic growth is slowing in the Southeast. Labor 
markets continue to strengthen largely because of ongoing expansion 
in the industrial sector. However, most manufacturers, fearful that 
the recovery is near its peak, are not initiating plant expansions 
and are monitoring inventories carefully. Growth in consumer 
spending has decelerated, but retailers are satisfied with current 
inventory levels. Rising interest rates contributed to a decline in 
residential construction in the early spring, but commercial 
building remains on the rise. Consumer and mortgage lending has 
slackened. Even the growth rate of business lending, which was 
strong throughout the first quarter, fell in April. Southeastern 
thrifts are avoiding sharply discounted adjustable-rate mortgages. 
Conditions in the travel industry are healthy despite rapid 
expansion of lodging facilities and the lingering effects of intense 
airfare competition last year. Pork supplies should not fall as 
drastically in the Southeast as in the nation, and the outlook for 
profitability in this segment of the agricultural sector is 
positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unemployment rate in March fell on a seasonally adjusted basis 
in five District states. Defense contracts, tourism, and 
construction are boosting employment in Florida. Florida's 5.5 
percent jobless rate was the lowest in nearly a decade. 
Manufacturing is sustaining much of the employment growth rates of 
recent months. Steel and aluminum production in Alabama recently 
increased. The forest products industry is operating near capacity, 
according to a trade association spokesman. Recent unfavorable 
weather conditions have hampered some timber harvesting, causing 
mills to struggle to meet surging demand. However, lumber industry 
representatives are concerned about the effect of rising interest 
rates on demand for wood products. Strong backlogs reported by 
contacts with oil surveying crews and seismic operations in 
Louisiana portend renewed drilling activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in most industries stress that greater utilization of 
present facilities is a top priority; plant expansions are 
infrequent at this time. Many producers, fearing that the recent 
surge in economic growth cannot be sustained, are maintaining a 
close watch over inventories. The strong dollar and slow recovery 
abroad are retarding the growth of manufactured exports from Miami 
to Latin America and of grain and coal exports from New Orleans and 
thereby limiting the recovery foreign trade activity in the 
District. Port officials throughout the region foresee a 
continuation of slow export growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers report a slowdown in March-April sales growth 
from the year-over-year advance recorded in the January-February 
period. Easter holiday sales were below merchants' expectations, but 
they were above 1983 levels. Electronics, home furnishings, 
cosmetics, shoes, and sportswear were among the top selling items 
this Easter. Retailers also report that there have been no 
significant increases in suppliers' prices and inventories generally 
are at desired levels. The monthly growth rate of car sales in the 
region remained strong in the first four months of 1984 but, in 
contrast to the 1983 pattern, has fallen below the national rate. 
Compact and medium-sized models are showing particularly healthy 
sales growth here.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in major District cities report decreases in single- and 
multifamily building permits from March to April following increases 
from February to March. Orlando, with 26 percent and 52 percent 
decreases in single- and multifamily building permits, respectively, 
experienced the greatest slowdown from March to April. Most 
respondents attribute the decline to rising interest rates and rainy 
April weather. The Federal National Mortgage Corporation is 
discouraging sharply discounted adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), 
and some private mortgage issuers have become reluctant to insure 
such ARMs. As financial institutions respond to this trend, higher 
income requirements for ARMs may be shrinking the pool of potential 
home buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction, measured in square feet, increased 57 
percent from February to March, surpassing the national rise of 39 
percent. Overbuilding is a concern in Atlanta's office market. Fears 
of further materials price rises and interest rate escalation have 
caused builders in Orlando to decrease speculative building and 
purchase forward commitments to guarantee current rates. Population 
growth and corporate relocations are also fostering development, but 
increased building costs and rising interest rates have spurred 
builders in some areas to rush projects in progress in case the boon 
should end soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at banks has been strong through the first quarter. 
Business and real estate lending has grown most rapidly, although 
business lending slowed somewhat in early April. Consumer lending 
softened in the March-April period. Deposits, especially demand 
deposits, at large commercial banks declined in March. Contacts 
believe withdrawals for income tax payments caused the shrinkage. 
Savings and loan associations in Louisiana and Mississippi 
registered large increases in mortgage commitments, but higher 
mortgage interest rates dampened this activity somewhat in April. A 
poll of southeastern savings and loan associations revealed little usage of deep-discount (5-7 percent range) adjustable-rate 
mortgages. S&amp;Ls have taken steps such as raising minimum income 
requirements to protect themselves from the heightened risk of such 
loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regional interstate banking is gaining legislative momentum in the 
Southeast. Georgia has enacted a law permitting interstate banking, 
and Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina have bills at 
varying stages of the legislative process. Meanwhile, banks outside 
the Southeast are taking advantage of a provision in federal banking
statutes allowing out-of-state banks to operate consumer loan and 
deposit-taking facilities provided they refrain from offering either 
business loans or checking accounts. Over 30 institutions have 
applied to operate these consumer banks in Florida and Georgia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most sectors of the tourism industry posted increases at the 
beginning of the spring season. Visitor center registrations were 
generally up in March, although the rate of growth in Florida was a 
narrow 2 percent, a reflection of both a deceleration in visitor 
growth and a later Easter. Respondents report that convention 
business is healthy, especially in Nashville and Orlando. Losing tax 
revenues showed a double-digit percent increase over year-earlier 
levels in every state. Hotel occupancy rates, however, have softened 
from last year because of the large number of new rooms available. 
The 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans should help hotels in 
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Reservations managers report 
strong bookings through the spring. Advance ticket sales to the Fair 
had been below expectations but have spurted in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Air traffic continued to rise in most smaller cities in March, but 
the Atlanta and Miami airports reported a drop in passenger volume 
of 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. These declines reflect the 
elimination of sharply discounted fares, which inflated air travel a 
year ago. Cruise ship bookings are still slow but on the rise. 
Anticipating growth, several lines have launched new luxury ships 
from Florida ports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In response to rising feed costs, pork farmers began to reduce 
inventories last year by marketing hogs earlier and breeding fewer 
sows. A recent survey suggests that reductions are continuing and 
this summer's farrowings at the national level will be the lowest 
since 1975. However, partial data for the Southeast imply that 
inventories here will remain at approximately 90 percent of 1983 
levels. If normal crops are produced in 1984, feeding costs should 
decline in the fourth quarter and hog prices should rise, prompting 
an increase in production that will reach the consumer next year. 
Declining costs and rising revenues should improve the profits of 
pork producers. The pork industry generates over $800 million in 
annual farm revenue in the Sixth District.
