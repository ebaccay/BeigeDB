      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

     <p>
      <strong>
       March 25, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District expect output next 
quarter will probably weaken from the first quarter and indeed may 
decline, but they forecast a more rapid recovery in the second half 
of 1981 than projected by the Reagan Administration. Near-term 
inflation may also improve more than indicated in the Administration 
scenario. Retail sales in the District remain weak, except for auto 
sales, which have improved in response to widespread rebate 
programs. Steel orders and shipments are holding up well. Although 
capital-goods spending has not yet turned around, some signs of 
bottoming out are reported. Housing is weak, but industry officials 
foresee declining mortgage rates in the second quarter of 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Fourth District Round Table forecasts of 28 economists 
on March 13, 1981, were generally more optimistic for 1981 than 
indicated in the Reagan scenario. The median forecast shows growth 
in real GNP of about 2.4% between the fourth quarter of 1980 and the 
fourth quarter of 1981, but with an increase in the implicit price 
deflator of 9.4% and an unemployment rate of 7.5% in the fourth 
quarter of 1981. Only one of the group expects a two-quarter decline 
in real GNP, as a result of strains in financial markets, while 11 
expect a one-quarter decline in real GNP next quarter of less than a 
1% annual rate. Rates of change in real GNP, according to the median 
forecast, are expected to accelerate to about 4% and 5% in the 
fourth quarter of 1981 and the first quarter of 1982, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Output
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Round Table economists were sympathetic with, but 
doubtful of, the Reagan scenario for prices and output into the mid-
1980s. A bank economist pointed to an inconsistency between a 
projected decline in money stock growth and double-digit growth 
rates in nominal GNP during 1981-84, implying faster-than-trend 
growth in velocity. He acknowledged that even his projections of 
growth in output of 3% to 31/2% and 4% to 5% in the GNP price 
deflator by 1984 imply somewhat above-trend growth in velocity. 
Another economist asserted that the Administration's projected 
growth in output might be achieved and that price performance may be 
somewhat better than in the Reagan scenario until 1983-84, when 
supply constraints would reverse the near-term moderating trend in 
prices. Optimism over the price outlook stems from an expected 
cyclical recovery in productivity, supported by deregulations that 
will improve cost performance and by less intense pressure from COLA 
clauses as inflation begins to unwind.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recovery in real retail sales in the Fourth 
District has been weak and well below the national average because 
of softness in the District's economy. An economist associated with 
a major national department store chain expects retail sales in the 
District to continue to be sluggish. Nationally, he expects nominal 
retail sales to increase 101/2% from the fourth quarter of 1980 to 
the fourth quarter of 1981. Department store sales will increase 
only 9% because of an expected slow recovery in furniture and 
appliance sales. In 1982, an 11% increase in retail sales is 
expected, with real growth between 4% and 41/2%. Inflation and the 
latest Social Security tax increases will slow but not stop the 
recovery in consumer spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in this District picked up because of the recent rebate 
programs, which an industry economist estimates boosted new car 
sales 150,000 units nationally. A foreign car dealer reports a 12% 
increase in sales since the beginning of the year, but does not 
expect imports to gain market share during 1981. An auto economist 
notes that high interest rates have not deterred auto sales as much 
as expected, but have constrained dealer purchases and inventories. 
He cites a big shift in auto financing from banks and credit unions 
to auto finance companies, which are offering lower interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel orders over the past four weeks have been running 
higher than expected, according to several industry economists. Even 
sheet steel has been relatively strong in recent weeks, partly 
because auto production schedules in March were above February's. 
Steel shipments in the first quarter will be marginally higher than 
in the fourth quarter of 1980 and are expected to increase by two 
million tons in the second quarter, mostly because of seasonal 
factors. Forecasts for 1981 show a 7% increase in shipments from 
1980, with the volume of imports no higher than in 1980. The bulk of 
the improvement in steel shipments during 1981 stems from an end to 
inventory liquidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital-goods spending appears to have troughed. 
Noting some firming of orders during the first quarter, a durable 
goods producer expects a recovery in factory sales of nonelectrical 
machinery throughout 1981. Factors contributing to the recovery 
include an expected 2% real growth in durable and nondurable goods 
consumption, a better-than-expected level of construction outlays, a 
slowly rising trend in capacity utilization rates, and a declining 
user cost of capital. Heavy-duty truck sales are expected to 
increase about 8% during 1981, with deregulation having no adverse 
affect on overall truck buying. However, metal cutting orders have 
continued to slip throughout the first quarter, according to a 
machine tools producer, and as yet have shown no sign of turnaround. 
Backlogs have been reduced to less than 14 months from a peak of 18 
months in July 1980. Capital spending should accelerate over the 
next few years because of proposed tax policies and capacity 
constraints that may surface by 1982. However, economists with steel 
and rubber producers assert proposed business tax changes will not 
speed investment until enough cash flow is generated to support 
higher spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The bulk of the thrift institutions in the District may 
show losses through the first half of 1981, but the industry will 
remain viable, according to an economist with a regional FHLB. Rates 
on jumbo CDs and money market certificates have declined from three 
months ago and should allow some easing in the cost of funds and 
mortgage rates in the second quarter of 1981, according to an S&amp;L; 
official. In addition, deposit flows are expected to be positive, 
although weak, in 1981. Another S&amp;L official reports that NOW 
accounts have surpassed expectations, but remain a small portion of 
total deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing starts are expected to fall below 1980's pace, according to 
a major area builder, with funds for speculative building virtually 
shut off at the present time. A bank economist reports that small 
builders are under severe financial strain and have contributed to 
bankruptcies among their subcontractors and to income problems of 
several area S&amp;Ls that financed speculative building. A bank 
economist believes that mortgage rates may decline to 13% in the 
near future if the cost of funds continues to ease.
