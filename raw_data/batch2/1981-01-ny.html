      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Second District was mixed in late December 
and January. After a weak showing at the beginning of the Christmas 
season, retail sales surged at the end, with the strength reportedly 
spilling over into the current month. Auto sales slipped for both 
domestic and foreign makes. Outside of the consumer sector, 
conditions were also mixed. For companies in the petroleum, 
chemical, and consumer goods industries, conditions ranged from 
stable to improving. For companies in the capital goods industries, 
however, the situation appears to be deteriorating. The respondents 
generally anticipate sluggish growth in real GNP over 1981, most of 
which is expected to occur in the second half following the 
enactment in mid-year of a broad-based tax cut. On the financial 
side, business loans remain strong while local savings and loan 
associations experienced a slight net inflow of deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite a slow start in early December, retail sales ended up being 
fairly robust during the Christmas season. With but one or two 
exceptions, retailers characterized their Christmas sales receipts 
as being "super," "extraordinary," and "excellent." Moreover, helped 
along by post-Christmas promotional price cutting, the strength in 
retail sales extended into the current year. The cold weather 
stimulated sales of winter clothing and heating equipment in the 
downstate area, but tended to keep some people out of the upstate 
stores. Inventory levels are being closely monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in the Second District continued to languish in recent 
weeks. In response to the high prices and high interest rates, 
consumers have evidently decided not only to postpone purchasing 
domestic cars but foreign makes as well. Inventories are higher than 
dealers would like and are being cut back as much as possible. 
Indeed, as one dealer explained, with the carrying costs of stocking 
new domestic cars currently running between $120 and $150 per car 
per month and the average gross profit per car sold about $500 to 
$600, dealers stand to lose money if they have to hold on to their 
inventoried cars for several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Manufacturing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Second District have lately been rather 
mixed. Business has apparently held up well for those petroleum and 
chemical companies which were contacted. Those companies 
specializing in the production of consumer goods seem to be in a 
holding pattern, changing neither their inventories nor their 
capital spending plans. In contrast, those companies which produce 
capital goods appear to be having difficulties. Even in this sector, 
however, some companies are evidently doing better than others.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic outlook is generally for sluggish real growth in 1981. 
Few companies, however, anticipate an outright decline in economic 
activity in the near term. Many companies are expecting personal and 
business tax cuts mid-year and accordingly foresee a modest 
strengthening in the economy during the second half. The consensus 
forecast is for real GNP growth of 1 to 1-1/2 percent for the entire 
year. No one appears to be unduly disturbed about inflation, judging 
from the fact that only one company even mentioned its price 
outlook. (Incidentally, that one company thinks the CPI will 
increase between 10-1/2 and 11 percent in 1981.)
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In financial markets, business loan demand was strong at year-end, 
and most loan officers reported that the loans outstanding were not 
paid down as quickly in the new year as is usually the case. 
Factories supporting the continued business loan strength include 
the high interest rates in the bond market and the spread between 
the prime rate and the commercial paper rate. In the mortgage 
market, rates on mortgage loans were steady at large commercial 
banks in New York City, but increased slightly at insured savings 
and loan associations, according to a recent survey conducted by the 
local office of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. The survey also 
indicted a slight inflow of deposits (net of interest credited) at 
savings and loans in December, reflecting, in part, growth of NOW 
accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty 
Trust Company), Francis Schott (Equitable Life Assurance Society), 
and James O'Leary (U.S. Trust Company).Their views are personal, not 
institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: The Federal Reserve has regained creditability but at the 
expense of high and volatile interest rates. He expects current 
rates to recede, but relatively high rates will persist until 
inflationary psychology improves. A considerable part of present 
rate volatility is artificial, reflecting the fact that the Federal 
Reserve has to make certain operating decisions based on forecasts 
of day-to-day changes in reserve factors that are often upset by 
later information. Both the desk and the banks would he better off 
if the reserve settlement period were extended or carry-over 
privileges were increased so that bank money managers could focus 
more on their views of which rates would balance underlying supply 
and demand in the money market and less on the need simply to make 
reserve settlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: Federal Reserve policy of late 1980 is beginning to bear 
fruit in realistic prospects for disinflation. High interest rates 
are discouraging borrowing activity even in the commercial real 
estate market, which had been unusually (even speculatively) active 
until recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Very heavy refinancing demands are in the wings. Private bond and 
equity financing is waiting for a chance at balance sheet 
improvement. Expected institutional cash flow is sufficient to 
absorb these offerings. But it is essential to keep Treasury and 
agency financing at reasonable levels to provide room for a return 
to more normal financial ratios in the private sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Leary: The focal point of monetary and other government policies 
must be that the basic inflation rate is very high and that there is 
serious danger that it will rise further this year; and the 
expectation of inflation by decisionmakers has not been reduced 
appreciably, if at all, by the change in administration. Much of the 
traditional long-term, fixed-rate capital market is fact moving 
toward short-term, variable-rate commitments, with this development 
the result of the expectation of inflation. The implications are 
that, until there is real and sustained evidence of effective 
reduction in inflation, there will be a chronic shortage in 
availability of long-term, fixed-rate financing and long-term rates 
will remain very high on any substantial volume of financing.
