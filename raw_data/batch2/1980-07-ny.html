      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Second District declined in May, although 
the decline appears less rapid than in April. Consumer spending at 
some major department stores showed signs of picking up, but 
domestic automobile sales continued soft. There is no evidence that 
the recent easing of the consumer credit controls spurred spending. 
Outside the consumer sector, the outlook was generally pessimistic. 
New orders declined further or stabilized at low levels for many 
manufacturing firms. Production cutbacks, as orders fell, have 
limited inventory build-ups. Despite the uncertain economic 
conditions, few changes have been made in capital spending plans and 
capital goods producers still report strong demand. The weakening in 
demand has reduced the upward pressures on prices. On the financial 
side, loan demand continues to languish despite the recent sharp 
decline in interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending in the Second District was mixed in May. Sales at 
retailers that cater to high-income consumers in Manhattan and 
nearby New York suburbs generally improved over April's 
disappointing levels. Still, sales remained below January's and 
February's levels. A large influx of tourists and foreign visitors 
helps account for some of the good showing in Manhattan, but the 
sales at the New York suburban malls also point to an underlying 
strength. Other large retailers reported sales to be disappointing 
and did not expect a pickup until the end of 1980. The pattern of 
consumer spending varied in other regions of the Second District. 
Retail business in New Jersey began the month rather sluggishly but 
then recovered somewhat. Retail sales in upstate New York remained 
mixed. Scattered inventory problems were cited among retailers, but tight management seems to have averted any serious difficulties. 
Concerns appear to focus on the build-up of certain large-ticket 
items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domestic car sales continued soft in May, but there were reports of 
some pick-up in June. Overall conditions have been described as 
"disastrous" with many dealerships folding. Lack of consumer 
interest and confidence, as measured by a low volume of floor 
traffic, were cited as reasons that were more important than lack of 
credit availability in causing the weakness in sales. Inventories 
are in satisfactory shape for the most part. Imported car sales, 
which had also dropped precipitously in April and May, seem to have 
recovered in June. Used car sales appear to be picking up as well. 
There are scattered reports of an easing in auto lending credit 
conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside the consumer sector, overall business conditions have 
deteriorated further in recent weeks. A sharp fall-off in new orders 
was reported by manufacturers in such diverse industries as copper, 
brass, and aluminum products; machines and tools; chemical products; 
industrial packaging, and other paper products. Smaller declines 
were registered among manufacturers of consumer related non-durable 
photographic supplies, auto-related electrical products, and sheet 
metal. Sharp declines were reported earlier by firms in such diverse 
industries as steel, fibers, large electrical appliances, plywood 
and lumber. Inventories in these industries are generally at 
satisfactory levels due to immediate cutbacks in production in 
response to falling orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to other Second District producers, capital goods 
manufacturers are still reporting strong demand. Backlogs remain 
large, and orders are robust. Similarly, business is strong for 
manufacturers of small electrical appliances and audio equipment. 
The aerospace and the home improvement industries are also doing 
well. It appears that at least at some larger firms plant and 
equipment spending plans will be maintained despite the near-term 
falloff in business activity. On the other hand, a major chemical 
firm reduced its current dollar spending plans. There are some 
reports of retailers either reducing their plans or deferring them. 
The most common technique of making adjustments, however, seems to 
be stretching out or postponing capital spending, rather than 
reducing its dollar amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the economy weakening, evidence is mounting of an easing in 
inflationâ€”apparently more marked than in the previous recession. 
List prices have not been lowered all that much, but prices are not 
rising much from the previous month and even some discounts are 
apparently being offered. Wage pressures also seem to be easing in 
response to the weakening in the labor markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      No evidence was seen of any increase in consumer spending resulting 
from the recent easing of the credit controls. Instead, the 
psychological impact of the program was still felt to be severe. 
Financing terms at commercial banks are reported to have eased in 
recent weeks. All major thrift institutions have lowered mortgage 
interest rates and some have even begun to aggressively advertise 
for borrowers. Business loan demand at banks has not recovered 
despite the recent drop in interest rates.
