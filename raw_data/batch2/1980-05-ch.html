      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 14, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The business decline that developed on a broad front in March, 
spread to additional sectors in April and May. Retail sales have 
slumped, especially for large items and luxury goods. Reports of 
layoffs and short weeks are frequent from manufacturers of a wide 
variety of consumer and producer goods. Residential construction 
activity already has dropped much more than in 1974-75, and 
nonresidential activity is expected to weaken in the second half as 
existing commitments are worked out. Easing credit conditions of the 
past several weeks will have a salutary effect on some of the 
businesses, consumers, and farmers who have been hardest pressed. 
While gloom prevails in agricultural areas because of poor income 
prospects, plantings are off to a fine start.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists have been revising economic forecasts downward. For 
example, one of Chicago' s best-known bank economists told reporters 
on Friday that conditions have deteriorated faster than expected, 
and that the recession may be the "longest and most severe since the 
1930s." Among the industries that have made new cuts in sales 
estimates for 1980 are motor vehicles, steel, building materials, 
farm equipment, and construction equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have no evidence of an upswing in defense procurement in line 
with the Administration's statements. Defense contractors located in 
this district say that any acceleration has been in R&amp;D contracts, 
mainly in New England.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing managers in Chicago and Milwaukee report that the March 
declines in output, employment, new orders, backlogs, and 
inventories accelerated in April. In Milwaukee, where capital goods 
predominate, April's drop was described as "precipitous," and 
reflected preparations dating back 12 months or more when recession 
fears were first expressed. For Milwaukee, 58 percent reported 
shorter lead times on purchased items in April, while only 2 percent 
reported longer lead times, an almost exact reversal of the report 
for April 1979. Price increases have moderated with bids reflecting 
more competitive markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      National retailers report sales depressed everywhere, but with major 
areas of the Seventh District particularly bad. Consumers have been 
holding back on big-ticket items and have restricted credit use. One 
retailer expresses regret that it will not have to establish a 
special deposit under the credit restraint program. Before March, 
consumer credit was being restricted mainly by lenders. Now, 
restraint appears to be more from the demand side. Inventories that 
had appeared slim now seem excessive, and reduction programs are 
underway. Many retailers have been offering unusual price 
concessions, to stimulate sales, e.g., 10 percent store-wide 
discounts, substantial reductions on men's clothing, special cuts on 
multiple purchases, etc. Air travel has declined since February, and 
is now expected to be off 6 percent for the year. Consumers are said 
to be delaying payments on bills owed to professionals, and 
postponing new obligations, especially in the case of dentists.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prospects for the motor vehicle industry continue to deteriorate. 
Further layoffsâ€”temporary, indefinite, or permanentâ€”are reported 
for parts and materials plants, as well as assembly plants. Deep 
cuts, probably permanent, are underway for salaried workers. Capital 
spending programs for subsequent years are being scaled down, mainly 
by reducing the number of new models requiring retooling. So far, 
regular jobless pay and SUB payments, increasingly supplemented by 
"trade adjustment assistance," are helping to maintain worker 
incomes. But the longer-term picture is grim for Michigan, which has 
almost 40 percent of vehicle employment. Michigan concentrates on 
the hard-hit big cars and trucks, it has most of the redundant 
overhead personnel, and it has most of the obsolescent plants to be 
closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Revival of the motor vehicle industry will be made more difficult 
because of the demise of numerous large dealers, some located in 
prosperous areas, who are essential for maximum sales. Auto 
companies also complain that dealers are not carrying adequate 
stocks to take advantage of sales opportunities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Substantial layoffs have occurred, or are scheduled, in the farm and 
construction equipment industries. This is significant because the 
three largest companies had strikes in the current fiscal year that 
lasted 18, 79, and 172 days, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders for steel dropped abruptly in late March and have remained 
depressed. Cuts by motor vehicles producers continue, and new 
weakness has developed in farm and construction equipment, 
structural steel, and prefab buildings. A local steel company has 
reduced its estimate of second quarter shipments by 15 percent in 
recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paperboard orders in physical units, which had leveled off in the 
spring of 1979, were 6 percent below last year in March, and 
probably by a similar margin in April. Many customers have cut back 
on paperboard orders as they have reduced workweeks. Production of 
household appliances, lawn equipment, outboard motors, and other 
large consumer goods shipped in boxes is down more or less sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home mortgage rates have been dropping rapidly from the 16.5-17 
percent peaks posted in mid-April. More important, some new loans 
are actually being negotiated again, in contrast to the virtual halt 
in the March-April period. The decline in new residential 
construction will not be reversed quickly. Too many builders have 
called off plans for 1980, and some buildup in finished properties 
has occurred. In the Chicago area, only 700 permits for single-family homes were issued in the first quarter. This is off 84 
percent from 1978 and 61 percent below the depressed period of 1975. 
Apartment permits are down almost as much. Reports from other large 
district centers are similar. Estimates of the jobless rate for 
construction workers range from 20 to 40 percentâ€”with many on short 
weeks. Demand for ready-mix concrete, gypsum board, hardboard, 
lumber, plumbing fixtures, built-in appliances, and carpeting is way 
off with accompanying layoffs in manufacturing, distribution, and 
installation. Layoffs by realtors and title companies are also 
significant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tight credit conditions and bleak farm income prospects continue to 
have an adverse impact on Seventh District agriculture. Our survey 
shows farmland values down in the first quarter. Since 1960 these 
values dropped in only one other quarterâ€”in 1977. Average rates on 
farm loans at rural banks rose from 13.5 percent in January to 17 
percent in April. While bankers have been rationing credit, they 
also report a steep decline in demand. Farmers are restricting 
purchases of all types, especially equipment. Recent evidence 
suggests that rural credit conditions may be easing as outflows of 
funds associated with high market rates slow down. Spring plantings 
have an excellent start, but scanty rainfall and low topsoil 
moisture raise concern about seed germination.
