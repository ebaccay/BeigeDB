     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 11, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in the First District report that business is holding 
steady at a high level. The most notable change has been 
acceleration in the rate of price increase. Retailers are generally 
pleased; sales are keeping pace with inflation. Manufacturers report 
little change from the production and order rates of the past 
several months; what was strong before is still strong and the weak 
sectors have not deteriorated any further. Loan demand has leveled 
off, but the volume is still very high. Bankers are looking at loan 
customers very closely for signs of cash flow difficulties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers report that sales have held steady in real terms since the 
beginning of the year. This is considered a good performance and is 
expected to continue through the spring. The prices of sales 
merchandise have gone up much less than the CPI; however, the head 
of a large food store chain said that the number of vendors 
increasing prices in January and February was greater than ever 
before. An exception to the relatively favorable retail situation is 
that sector of retailing which is associated with the ski industry. 
Losses due to a lack of snow have been severe and many small firms 
are turning to the Small Business Administration for loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing respondents have seen little change in their 
operations during the past month. No new weaknesses have been 
reported other than recreational aircraft, sales of which are 
sagging sharply. High technology areas are doing very well, 
especially those related to the defense industry. Sales of 
industrial safety equipment, which are tied to national production, 
have come back strongly after a weak fourth quarter. A manufacturer 
of capital equipment used in the pulp and paper and chemical 
industries has record backlogs. High quality appliances are selling 
well although there has been some slowdown at the lower end of the 
range. Sales of housing materials for new construction are weak, but 
sales for repair and remodeling are fairly good. All respondents 
continue to believe that inventories are under control.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand is steady at a high level according to First District 
banking directors. However, one of the region's largest banks 
reports that there has been a surge in the demand for commitments 
from corporations which are concerned about the possibility of 
credit controls. These are firm commitments for which fees have been 
paid. The competition for loans is still very intense among the 
larger banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, Solow, and Tobin are 
available for comment this month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein applauds the recent sharp increases in interest rates. He 
feels it is prudent to wait a month or two before tightening again, 
however. As businesses are turned away from the bond market and are 
driven into bank loans, M1A may surge temporarily. Eckstein, 
nevertheless, favors reducing money growth: "A reasonable target f 
or MlA growth this year may be less than 5 percent due to the 
recession." And, if necessary, interest rates should be increased 
until real aggregate demand declines because "the recession should 
not be a worry, it is badly needed."
     </p>
     <p>
      Solow believes we are on the verge of a two- or three-quarter 
recession; however, he does not believe the recession will reduce 
the inflation rate significantly. To achieve 5 percent inflation, 
the unemployment rate either would have to rise to 11 percent for 
two years or would have to remain near 7 percent for 10 years. Solow 
is "not opposed to properly prepared wage-price controls." A short-
term (6-month) freeze, for example, has a chance of reducing 
inflation provided it is accompanied by oil import quotas as well as 
the appropriate reductions in Federal spending and money growth 
consistent with lower inflation. He does not favor credit controls: 
A successful freeze will reduce inflation and nominal interest 
rates. In any case, Solow strongly emphasizes that the Fed should 
avoid being "stampeded" into precipitous action by a few months of 
distressing data representing past oil price and mortgage rate 
increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin favors wage-price controls. Rather than "muddle through" with 
high inflation or bring about a recession severe enough to reduce 
the inflation rate significantly, he advocates a policy that couples 
wage-price controls with a gradual reduction in money growth and 
Federal spending. Unlike Solow, Tobin does not favor a freeze: 
inflation cannot be reduced 6 percentage points "in one big blow." A 
reasonable goal is to reduce inflation by 1 or 2 percentage points 
per year by a succession of guideposts. Tobin does not favor credit 
controls because these controls, unlike wage-price controls, "are an 
unneeded substitute for tools the Fed already possesses."
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson does not favor wage-price controls. He believes these 
controls can arrest the momentum of inflation only when they are 
enacted during the first year of inflation and when inflation is 
driven by irrational speculation or an ordinary cycle of wages 
pushing prices and prices pushing wages. Our current inflation is 
too mature and too complex for wage-price controls to work. 
Samuelson favors reducing inflation by maintaining real growth near 
zero, because, in his opinion, any attempt to restrain price 
increases must also restrain output growth, and slow growth is the 
least disruptive means of lowering the inflation rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker, like Samuelson, does not favor wage-price controls 
because they are expensive, cumbersome, and ineffective. Moreover, 
Houthakker sees no sign that inflation has accelerated. He does not 
believe the CPI provides a meaningful measure of the inflation rate; 
the rate of increase of the fixed-weight deflator, a superior index, 
has been virtually constant in recent quarters. His recent 
statistical work suggests that "monetary policy is working" so "the 
Fed should stay on its present course." Though the inflation rate 
will remain high during the first half of the year, it should 
decline in the fall. He also sees no sign of a serious recession, 
although real growth during the year will be nearly zero.
