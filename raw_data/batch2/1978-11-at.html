      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Events of the past month have created a sharp contrast between 
  expectations and the current business picture. Growth continues 
  strong in nonresidential investment, heavy industry, and 
  agriculture. There's been some weakening of consumer spending and 
  housing markets, but the near-term outlook remains good. At 
  financial institutions, the rapid run-up of borrowing costs was 
  accompanied by a sharp slowdown in deposit inflows, but no 
  significant liquidity problems have surfaced as yet. A lack of 
  confidence in price-restraint measures and the likelihood of further 
  increases in interest rates has convinced many of the region's 
  businessmen that a recession is in store for 1979.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales were spotty in October and early November. Retailers in 
  many areas reported sales gains that would not cover price 
  increases, with a further softening of nominal sales in the latest 
  two weeks. Unseasonably warm weather has apparently dampened demand 
  for soft goods, particularly apparel. Strong sales of housewares, 
  furniture, and appliances have kept spending growing steadily in 
  other locations. Generally, retail inventories are heavier than 
  desired; retailers have become more apprehensive about post-holiday 
  prospects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto sales reports are mixed as well. There has been considerable 
  grumbling from dealers that low inventories or slow deliveries of 
  popular models have held sales below potential. Buyers continue to 
  favor the larger, higher-priced models, although a few dealers noted 
  resistance to "loaded" cars. Small trucks are in heavy demand and 
  short supply. The used car market is strong; supplies of late models 
  have become inadequate as higher-mileage, older-model cars account 
  for a growing share of dealers' stocks. Import sales are still 
  lagging.
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing markets have continued their gradual slowdown. In southern 
  and central Florida, residential construction activity remains near 
  record levels, but mortgage closings and permits are waning. 
  Directors report that lenders have raised mortgage rates and have 
  tightened credit standards in most areas. Sales and construction of 
  commercial properties, particularly office buildings and shopping 
  malls, appear to have accelerated in the past few weeks; contractors 
  are carrying a sizable backlog of industrial projects. Central 
  Florida is experiencing a boom in all types of nonresidential 
  construction, including several huge tourist attractions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Heavy industries are enjoying very good business. A regional 
  industrial supplier reports sales up 20 percent over the year-
  earlier level. A railcar manufacturer describes demand as "unbelievable" and claims his current bookings could keep him 
  operating at full capacity for 13 months. Manufacturers of metal 
  products find their sales steady and have been shipping from 
  inventories. U. S. Steel plans to add steel finishing facilities in 
  Birmingham to complement its new blast furnace and coke oven 
  battery. In contrast, the southeastern textile industry, ailing from 
  import competition, sluggish apparel sales, and the demise of denim, 
  continues to pare operations and lay off workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Crop harvests, speeded by dry weather and now virtually complete, 
  have been good. Yields are slightly better than average for cotton 
  and soybeans, with total output somewhat below last year's for 
  cotton and sharply higher for soybeans; prices and demand are good. 
  Citrus production has fallen short of expectations, pushing up 
  prices. Drought-damaged winter grazing pastures have forced many 
  cattlemen to dip into feed supplies and could precipitate additional 
  herd liquidations. Pork production has failed to expand 
  significantly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Deposit inflows to both banks and thrifts slowed sharply in October. 
  Interest rates climbed, with the prime rate reaching 10-3/4 percent 
  at many large banks. Directors have pointed out that most banks are 
  fairly liquid and in good shape to weather further increases in 
  interest rates. S&amp;Ls have become noticeably less aggressive in 
  raising funds via the costly six-month certificates.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to branch directors, most major banks began offering some 
  form of ATS on November 1. Set-ups run the gamut from simple 
  overdraft protection to zero-balance demand accounts, with wide 
  variety in pricing structures. Promotions have varied greatly, even 
  within cities; some banks have embarked on a virtual blitz of 
  television, newspaper, billboard, and radio advertising and give-aways, while others have been completely silent. Consumer response 
  has been limited so far.
       </p>
       <p>
        Southeastern businessmen have become markedly more pessimistic since 
  last report. Although the great majority are pleased with current 
  business conditions, only a handful of contacts consider the 
  probability of recession within the next year remote. The uneasiness 
  has been reflected in increased caution in planning and management 
  of inventories, cash flow, and personnel and closer watchfulness of 
  business indicators. By and large, the business community feels that 
  recent and prospective government actions (or inaction) will be 
  largely responsible for any slowdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        President Carter's anti-inflation program has not lowered 
  expectations of inflation. Generally, respondents have little 
  confidence that voluntary controls will work, describing them as a "stop-gap measure" or "the first step toward mandatory controls." Some suspected that either the Government or the unions would not 
  hold up their end of the bargain. Several were troubled that the 
  guidelines permitted larger increases than they were accustomed to 
  in their areas and noted that 7 percent could become a floor, rather 
  than a ceiling, for wage hikes. That possibility and the emphasis 
  that the problem has received of late may have even raised 
  inflationary expectations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The discount rate and reserve requirement increase and dollar-support announcement seem to have reassured many that something 
  concrete has been done toward alleviating the inflation and exchange 
  rate situations, although few are convinced that it will be enough 
  to solve the basic problems. Only a couple of respondents felt that 
  the interest rate increase was excessive or dangerous, but all 
  expected further rises to take a toll in the year ahead.
