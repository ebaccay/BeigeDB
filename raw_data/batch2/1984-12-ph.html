      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy is turning in a somewhat mixed 
performance again in November. On the up side, retailers are 
starting the holiday season with strong sales, realtors are seeing 
an increase in traffic, listings, and sales, and consumer lending 
continues to grow steadily. Less positive are manufacturing, where 
the expansion continues to lose steam, and business borrowing, which 
has been flat over the past six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall economic outlook is generally upbeat. Retailers expect 
to finish the year with a bang, and realtors hope to continue to 
ride the tide of lower mortgage interest rates. Area bankers predict 
continued economic expansion and expect commercial loans to pick up 
again. Growth is expected in manufacturing also, but at a slower 
rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The rate of expansion in local industry continues to decline, 
according to respondents to this month's Business Outlook Survey. 
Almost two thirds of the manufacturers polled in November say there 
has been no change in the level of business activity compared to 
last month. November is typically a slower month, but, even after 
adjusting for seasonal effects, this deceleration in growth is still 
evident. The slowdown is most pervasive in the durable goods sector 
where not one respondent indicated improvement. Producers of 
nondurables, on the other hand, are still posting solid gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on specific indicators also reflect the apparent leveling 
off in manufacturing activity. The only indicator to increase in 
November is shipments; unfilled orders, delivery times, inventories, 
employee payrolls, and the length of the average workweek all 
register minuses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for manufacturing over the next six months is still 
positive, but optimism is waning. The proportion of respondents 
looking for future expansion has been shrinking steadily since mid-
1983 and now stands at 47 percent. Nevertheless, projections of new 
orders and shipments are still strong, and payrolls and working 
hours continue on their way up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial price reports have been marked by stability over the past 
few months. This month, three out of four executives polled say 
there has been no change in either prices paid for raw materials or 
prices received for finished goods. As for the future, however, the 
same proportion of respondents predict higher costs by April, while 
about half expect to receive more for their output.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales over Thanksgiving weekend were strong, giving an extra 
push to what has been an already brisk six-week period. Most retail 
contacts feel that consumer confidence is up, citing increases in 
credit purchases and a "freewheeling" attitude about spending. 
Still, heavy promotional activity is being used to attract shoppers, 
and area merchants say they will continue to use the discounting 
tactic to boost sales throughout December. Currently, sales volume 
is running about 10 percent above last year at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories at Third District department stores are slightly heavier 
than usual relative to sales, but are in line with sales 
expectations for the next month. One contact said that the heavy 
stock levels are a reaction to last year's empty-shelf syndrome, 
pointing out that retailers want to have enough merchandise to avoid 
shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area merchants expect to finish 1984 on a strong note, topping last 
year's exceptional sales by 10 to 15 percent. In part this is the 
result of the date of Thanksgiving this year, which provides two 
extra shopping days compared to last year. Local retailers say that 
each additional day adds about 1 percent to holiday sales figures on 
a year-over-year basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales are very strong in the Third District, up about 25 
percent over a year ago. Car dealers also are seeing improved 
consumer confidence. One contact reports, "people are not buying new 
cars because they need them but because they want them." The average 
wait for a now car is three to five weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on lending remain mixed in the Third District. Commercial 
lending has flattened somewhat over the past six weeks but is still 
up over last year. Area lenders look for a slight pickup in C&amp;I
loans by year-end 1984 in spite of the usual downward seasonal 
pressure. They also anticipate a surge in C&amp;I loan growth in early 
1985 in conjunction with continued overall economic expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer loans are growing steadily. On a year-over-year basis, 
local bankers report increases of 30 percent or more. In the past, 
credit card operations have been cited as the main source of growth, 
but auto loans account for a large portion of the pickup in late 
November. Bankers expect consumers to maintain their spending mood 
through December of this year. Spending in the first half of 1985, 
however, may slow down if the ratio of installment credit to 
personal income, currently about 14.5 percent, reaches or surpasses 
its 1979 peak of 15 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate at most local banks has dropped to 11.5 percent as of 
November 27, and Third District bank economists expect another cut 
of 25 basis points by the end of the year. Forecasts of declining 
rates are based on sluggish fourth quarter economic growth and on 
expectations that the Fed will try to stimulate economic activity. 
Bankers apparently expect such efforts to be successful and see the 
prime climbing back up to 11.75 or 12 percent by mid-1985 as a 
result of renewed growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District realtors enthusiastically report that traffic, 
listings, home prices, and sales are up. Seasonal factors which 
usually depress sales in late fall and early winter are being offset 
by lower mortgage Interest rates and sonic pent-up demand. Thirty-
year fixed-rate conventional mortgages are available for as low as 
12-7/8 percent; 15-year mortgages for 12-1/2 percent. Adjustable 
rate mortgages start at 10-3/4 percent and go up to about 13 percent 
depending on the terms of the agreement. Although lenders are 
pushing ARMs, consumers are flocking to the relatively low fixed-rate loans.
