      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Nine Redbook reports indicated weakening in activity since the last 
FOMC meeting, with varying degrees of emphasis. Exceptions were 
Dallas and Philadelphia, where activity was judged to be expanding, 
and St. Louis with "no marked change". Inflation appears to have 
moderated, but most observers fear a resurgence. Virtually all 
reports commented on the depressive impact of current high interest 
rates, especially on housing, but also on nonresidential 
construction, capital goods, motor vehicles, and inventory 
investment. Employment is sluggish, at best, in most districts. 
Retail trade is mixed, but with auto sales severely depressed 
everywhere. Labor unrest, highlighted by the air controllers' 
strike, is increasing. Capital goods demand is generally weaker. 
Energy development and defense procurement are among the few strong 
sectors. The higher value of the dollar has tended to slow exports 
and increase imports, but quantification is difficult. Consumer 
credit use has slowed. New residential mortgages are difficult to 
negotiate under current terms. The S&amp;L crisis deepens. C&amp;I loan 
demand varies, with merger-related loans a big factor in money 
centers. Crop prospects are "good to excellent" in most of the 
nation. The new fiscal package is viewed as favorable, but no 
substantial early impact is foreseen. Many observers anticipate a 
revival in activity late in the year or in 1982, but only if 
interest rates decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Exchange value of the dollar
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All districts found that the higher 
value of the dollar was affecting imports and exports, but the 
picture is confused by the weak economic situation in Western 
Europe. Also, most observers expect the full impact to be delayed. 
Boston comments on reduced exports of "high-tech" items. New York 
finds exporters "worrying", but with few specific examples of 
declines in sales. Cleveland reports increased foreign competition 
for machine tools and pigments. Richmond finds textiles affected. 
Chicago reports a drop in inquiries from abroad as to the 
availability of U.S. products. San Francisco finds demand for 
aircraft and forest products seriously affected. Various districts 
pointed to reduced foreign demand for agricultural products, with 
accompanying downward pressure on domestic prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Boston, Richmond, and Kansas City reported a trend toward 
price stability with fewer purchasing managers reporting paying 
higher prices. Prices of building materials, especially cement, are 
generally weak. Cleveland economists still see a "core" inflation 
rate of about 9 percent. Chicago reports prices rising faster in 
July than last year, and business equipment prices up at least 10 
percent this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts commented on the growing S&amp;L 
crisis. A New York analyst fears "a mass failure of the thrifts", 
and a shock to the economy. Outflows of funds continued heavy in 
July, and net worth is declining. The new adjustable mortgage loans 
and tax exempt "small savers" certificates may be of some help. But 
the basic problem is high interest rates. Atlanta points out that 
many people could not now afford to buy the houses they live in, and 
Dallas warns of a wave of foreclosures when creative financing deals 
must be renegotiated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing industry remains depressed throughout the 
country, even in the relatively strong economy of the Eleventh 
District. Mortgage rates up to 18% and high prices are preventing 
many potential buyers from entering the market. Some developers are 
cutting prices. Bankruptcies of small builders are increasing. 
Related industries continue to suffer, including building materials, 
manufacturers, forest products, and appliances. Mortgage lending 
activity is reported nearly nonexistent in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing production was generally reported 
unchanged to down in the latest month. Industries linked to the 
construction and auto sectors were particularly adversely affected, 
while those producing military hardware and oil and gas equipment 
benefited. In contrast with other districts, Dallas reported 
continued expansion of manufacturing output, and Philadelphia noted 
signs of improvement following a decline earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on consumer spending are mixed though 
indications of lower, softer, or spotty sales predominant. Autos, 
appliances, furniture, and building materials are particularly 
sluggish. Discounting and heavy advertising to boost sales are being 
reported. Auto sales are benefiting from the recently announced 
promotion programs of the automakers. Additional parts and servicing 
business is partially offsetting weak new car sales in some areas. 
But additional auto dealers were reported to have gone out of 
business. The air traffic controllers' strike is exacerbating the 
problems of the airlines. Tourism, "already anemic" in the South, 
has been hit hard by the strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Businessmen are generally reported to be watching 
inventory levels closely. Nevertheless, excessive levels have 
developed in a number of industries. High interest rate levels are 
encouraging tight inventory control. Kansas City noted that 
inventory cutting appears to be taking place at all stages of 
production. Types of inventories noted as being excessive include 
motor vehicles, farm and construction equipment, construction 
supplies, steel, certain lines of retail goods, and crude petroleum.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital investment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Cleveland and Chicago districts, which 
emphasize durable consumer and capital goods, continue to send in 
pessimistic reports. Nonresidential construction is now softening in 
most regions as a result of financial stringencies. A number of 
districts reported reduced demand for producer equipment, including 
private and commercial aircraft, freight cars, trucks and trailers, 
and especially farm and construction equipment. Energy development 
items, defense equipment, and high-tech items are relatively strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Among the districts reporting good-to-excellent 
agricultural conditions are Richmond (tobacco), Chicago (near ideal 
weather for corn and soybeans), St. Louis, Kansas City, and San 
Francisco. However, Atlanta finds dry weather again restricting crop 
growth, and Minneapolis complains that excess moisture now endangers 
crop yields. Farm income is depressed by low farm prices and rising 
costs, and farmers are restricting new investments.
