      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity in 
August has been showing some signs of expansion, but still remains 
mixed. In the industrial sector, manufacturers say general activity 
appears to be stronger this month than at any other time so far this 
year. As for the future, area manufacturers are maintaining their 
optimism, anticipating a widespread upswing within the next six 
months. Local retail merchants report August sales to be up compared 
to last year's levels and appear to be more optimistic than they 
have been in recent months about the future. Area retailers expect 
sales to grow by the end of the 1981 and, in order to meet the 
increased demand, they plan to make some additions to stock levels. 
Third District bankers indicate mixed loan activity in August. 
Business loan volume is slightly ahead of year-ago figures, while 
consumer loans are said to be soft, for the most part. Local bankers 
forecast no change in consumer loan volume over the next six months, 
but predict slight gains in business borrowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers responding to the August Business Outlook Survey say 
that the local industrial sector is showing some signs of expansion 
this month, the strongest such indication so far this year. This 
report, however, comes on the heels of a reported decline in July's 
manufacturing activity which may have been only a seasonal slowdown, 
typical of area industrial activity in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Supporting the claims of renewed strength, new orders are said to be 
up for the first time since March and shipments have increased as 
well this month. Manufacturers have added to inventories, although 
only fractionally, putting at least a temporary halt to the recent 
cuts in stock levels. It appears that factory employment has been 
helped by the industrial spurt too. Survey participants report small 
increases in their payrolls but no change in working hours is 
indicated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, survey participants are maintaining their optimism 
about economic conditions over the next six months, anticipating a 
widespread upswing in general industrial activity by the start of 
the new year. In terms of specific indicators, about two-thirds of 
the survey respondents forecast climbing levels of new orders and 
shipments between now and February. Plans for meeting the 
anticipated demand include hiring more labor, lengthening the 
average workweek, and boosting expenditures on plant and equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the inflation front, prices paid to suppliers have risen again 
for about 45 percent of the survey participants in August, and over 
one-quarter of the area manufacturers responding to the survey 
report charging higher prices for their finished products. Prices 
are expected to continue climbing, as 9 out of 10 of the survey 
participants anticipate higher input costs by February and about 7 
out of 10 plan price hikes for the goods they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to local retailers, August sales are up compared to year-
ago figures by 5 to 20 percent, but only slightly, if at all, ahead 
of expectations for this period. District merchants attribute the 
gains to, among other things, the expected tax cut, which may have 
given consumers a psychological boost. Sales of soft goods, 
particularly apparel, shoes, and small household items, are doing 
well, while big ticket items remain sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the future, area retailers are more optimistic than they have 
been in recent months, and are hoping to be posting year-over-year 
sales gains of about 9 percent by the end of 1981. Once sales start 
to climb, retailers plan to increase their stock levels. As one 
contact put it, though, we should expect "only a marginal increase, 
certainly nothing alarming."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wholesale
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There has been no clear decline in Third District wholesale firms' 
orders from abroad, despite a strengthening dollar and recessionary 
condition in parts of Europe. Orders from Canada and Japan appear to 
be stronger than those from other nations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers report mixed loan activity in August. C&amp;I; 
loan volume is up 4 to 8 percent over year-ago figures, with some 
banks reporting below-prime lending which has, at least in part, 
boosted their business loan volume over budget by about 2 percent in 
August. Also, they say, aggressive marketing has helped. Consumer 
loans, on the other hand, are flat to slightly off, about 4 percent, 
and generally below budget. Looking ahead to the start of the new 
year, area bankers expect business loans to be showing gains of 2 to 
6 percent over early 1980 levels, while retail loans are expected to 
remain soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of deposit flows in the Third District indicate demand 
deposit levels to be mixed, running 2 percent below to 4 percent 
above last year's figures. Time and saving deposits, on the other 
hand, are 4 to 10 percent ahead of August '80 levels. Bankers say 
depositors are leaning toward longer-term higher-yielding time 
deposits. In an effort to aid deposit flows, a number of area banks 
and thrifts has been planning to offer long-term (more than four 
years) time deposits carrying an unregulated interest rate, before 
such instruments were barred by a U.S. District Court ruling on July 
31.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 20.5 
percent. Cuts in the prime are expected to come soon, leaving the 
rate 150 to 450 basis points below its current level by year end.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Summer business at area vacation spots in the Third District is 
reported to be mixed this season, according to spokesmen from major 
resort areas in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Business at 
South Jersey seashore resorts is off slightly from last year, but 
merchants there expect trade to pick up as they head into the rest 
of the season. The slowdown seems to be stemming primarily from a 
reduced number of longer-term vacationers. The number of daytrippers 
to the shore is up compared to a year ago, boosted by a plentiful 
supply of gasoline, "packaged" bus trips, especially to Atlantic 
City casinos, and generally good fishing. Nevertheless, the "bottom 
line," according to seashore businessmen, is that tight household 
budgets have kept the lid on business so far this season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such has not been the case in Delaware resorts. Tourist volume there 
is running about 9 percent ahead of 1980 levels and occupancy rates 
are said to be close to 100 percent. Delaware officials say their 
increased business this season is owed, at least in part, to a major 
advertising campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pocono Mountain vacation spots are having a fairly good season in 
terms of volume. But while tourist trade is up about 9 percent over 
last summer, people are again spending less money, leaving business, 
as measured by dollar volume, about 2 percent behind 1980 levels. 
Again, tight household budgets are cited as a major factor by Pocono 
officials.
