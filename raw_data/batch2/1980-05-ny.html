      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 14, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Second District continued to lose momentum 
in April. Consumer spending weakened at major department stores 
across the district at the same time that automobile sales were 
lethargic. Outside the consumer sector, the outlook was generally 
pessimistic. Manufacturing firms in many industries have started to 
reduce their workforces in the face of declining new orders and 
shrinking backlogs. Cautious inventory policies, however, appear to 
have kept stocks from growing excessive. Many firms also have began 
to reassess capital spending plans, but there has been only limited 
retrenchment thus far. On the financial side, business loan demand 
at major New York City banks slowed as some companies shifted to the 
long-term corporate bond and commercial paper markets to meet credit 
needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending in the Second District weakened in April. The 
eleven-day transit strike in New York City contributed to the 
downturn at metropolitan stores, but a similar slackening occurred 
throughout the region. While monthly sales comparisons are distorted 
by the effects of the transit strike and timing of the early Easter 
selling season, merchants voiced concern that the recent poor 
performance of sales was indicative of a more prolonged economic 
slowdown. Credit financing of sales fell at a major department store 
chain, while another store reported a shift from credit to cash 
transactions. This downturn is occurring although relatively little 
reportedly is being done by these respondents to directly discourage 
credit card usage. In spite of lagging sales, conservative inventory 
policies have kept stocks at acceptable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domestic car sales fell sharply in April. With few exceptions, 
dealers in the Second District reported a severe falloff in new car 
and truck purchases. In some instances, sales declined by as much as 
40 to 50 percent. In the last 10-day selling period in the month, 
floor traffic at one dealership reportedly ceased and as a result, 
no new orders were being booked. Demand for used cars, however, has 
remained relatively strong and their prices are rising sharply due 
to the increasing scarcity of supply as potential buyers postpone 
the replacement of their old models until they are no longer 
serviceable. Dealers in New York State were concerned that the 
state's usury ceiling on automobile loans was restricting financing. 
All of the respondents felt that local financing problems were being 
exaggerated by media coverage, which was scaring away even those 
customers still eligible for finance company loans. Dealer stocks 
are lean, however, reflecting dim sales prospects and the high cost 
of financing inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside the consumer sector, overall business conditions also have 
deteriorated in recent weeks. A sharp, dramatic falloff in new 
orders and a shortening in lead times was reported by manufacturers 
in such diverse industries as paper products, chemicals, consumer 
and industrial metals, electronic and photographic supplies and 
steel. Several firms have begun to reduce their staffs both through 
attrition and layoffs. In some divisions of a major metals 
manufacturer, layoffs have affected 30 percent of the workforce. In 
contrast to other District producers, machine tool manufacturers so 
far have been relatively insulated from the downturn. Backlogs at 
these firms are still growing as new orders remain strong. While 
some raw material prices have abated, cost pressures remain intense. 
Both labor and energy costs have continued to rise. Despite the 
uncertain economic conditions and the high cost of financing, 
however, relatively few firms have marked down their capital 
investment plans. With the exception of a major chemical firm, which 
reported excessive inventory stocks, inventories remain at 
acceptable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the industrial outlook became more markedly pessimistic 
during April. Expectations of a longer and deeper recession have 
grown. Upstate business leaders note widespread layoffs in 
construction and auto-related industries. Downstate, further 
economic dislocations are imminent with the planned closing of a 
major New Jersey auto plant in June. This shutdown will result in 
direct permanent job losses to 3,700 workers in addition to the 800 
already laid off. Further job cutbacks and losses in income are 
expected as the ripple effects of this plant closing work through 
the local economy. Most respondents do not anticipate a recovery in 
national business activity until the first half of 1981. But, with 
the exception of a steel industry spokesman who feared the effects 
of continuing inflation and foreign competition, the long-run 
outlook for the 1980's remains positive with strong growth in demand 
expected for all products.
     </p>
     <p>
      The weakening in business activity has been reflected in credit 
demands. New York City banks have experienced a sharp easing in 
business loan demand, which they expect to continue over the 
remainder of the year. While there has been some tightening in non-price lending terms, senior loan officers attribute most of the 
weakness to a combination of the recessionary environment, the lean 
inventory situation, and some shifting to long-term financing. 
Moreover, given the current spread between the prime rate and 
commercial paper rates, some firms apparently have recently turned 
to the commercial paper market for short-term funds.
