      Beige Book Report: St Louis

     <center>
      <p>
       <strong>
        March 15, 1978
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Business managers in the Eighth District remain optimistic about 
  further economic gains, despite some setbacks this winter as a 
  result of unfavorable weather and the coal strike. Retail sales, in 
  recent weeks reported to be at about year-ago levels, are expected 
  to resume growth as normal weather returns. Inventories are 
  considered to be satisfactory. Some losses in manufacturing 
  production have occurred because of the weather and the coal strike, 
  but orders in most industries indicate that demand remains 
  relatively high. Construction activity in the District has also been 
  hampered by the weather, but demand for new homes continues to be 
  strong. In the financial sector, business loans at larger banks 
  increased substantially in recent weeks, and moderate increases have 
  occurred in most other loan categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales in recent weeks have been affected adversely by 
  unusually cold and snowy weather. St. Louis department store 
  representatives indicated that sales have about equaled year-ago 
  levels. Some sales gains, however, were registered in areas, such as 
  Little Rock, where weather conditions were not as severe as in St. 
  Louis and Louisville, for example. Automobile dealers report sales 
  were good on days with normal weather and that overall sales have 
  been running near year-ago levels. Retailers were generally 
  optimistic that the current slump in sales is temporary and that 
  sales gains will occur when the weather improves and the coal strike 
  is settled. Current inventories at the retail level are considered 
  to be satisfactory given the expected increases in sales this 
  spring. Retailers noted, however, that this assessment would change 
  rapidly if the expected sales gains are not forthcoming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major utility companies in the District report that coal stockpiles 
  have tended to stabilize in the past few days. This reflects some 
  voluntary cutbacks in electrical power usage, greater incoming coal 
  shipments, and the burning of larger quantities of higher-priced oil 
  and natural gas. Only voluntary reductions in electrical power usage 
  have occurred so far. With the tendency of coal stocks to stabilize 
  and the prospects for additional coal supplies as a result of the 
  Taft-Hartley injunction, the "crisis" situation appears to have 
  eased somewhat. None of the utilities contacted indicate mandatory 
  curtailments are in prospect in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effects of the coal strike on employment and production have 
  been relatively minor in the District. A zinc processing plant in 
  the St. Louis area, which had a special contract with the utility 
  company, chose to shut down its operations rather than pay a higher 
  rate for energy. Also, a local chemical firm closed a phosphate and 
  a textile plant as a result of the coal strike. Earlier this month, 
  a major automobile assembly plant was expected to shut down due to a 
  lack of parts as a result of the strike. However, conditions have 
  apparently improved in areas where the automobile parts are 
  manufactured and the shutdown is not foreseen at present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the threat of power cutbacks and bad weather, manufacturing 
  activity appears to have made modest gains in recent weeks. A 
  representative from a major chemical firm noted strong sales for 
  agricultural and industrial chemicals, textiles, and plastics. An 
  appliance firm representative reported some production losses due to 
  adverse weather, but that orders were strong, partially reflecting 
  the strength in homebuilding. Other products showing strong sales 
  include paper and boxboard, heating equipment, pharmaceuticals, 
  clothing, and recreational equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The demand for new homes continues at a high level. Bad weather, 
  however, has hampered construction work, and some lengthening in 
  order backlogs for new homes has resulted. The backlog of new home 
  orders is now estimated to be 60 to 90 days in the St. Louis area. 
  Most home construction continues to be of the single-family type. In 
  Memphis, the vacancy rates on apartments, which was very high in 
  1975 and 1976, are now reported to be falling rapidly, but rents 
  have not adjusted upward sufficiently to encourage apartment 
  construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dollar volume of commercial and industrial loans at larger 
  District banks has increased sharply in recent weeks. The volume of 
  real estate, consumer, and agricultural loans has been growing 
  rapidly for more than a year. Mortgage loan demand is reported to be 
  excellent at savings and loan associations, reflecting the large 
  amount of construction. Time and savings deposits registered sizable 
  gains at commercial banks and savings and loan associations, but S 
  and L's report gains are somewhat below those registered in 1977. 
  Interest rates on most types of loans have remained generally 
  unchanged from a month ago. Recently, a constitutional amendment was 
  passed by the Tennessee voters which removed the 10 percent interest 
  rate maximum from the state's constitution and placed the power to 
  set usury ceilings with the legislature. This limit has been an 
  important factor in reducing the availability of credit in the state 
  and in the relatively low earnings of some Tennessee banks during 
  years of relatively high market interest rates.
