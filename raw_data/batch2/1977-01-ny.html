      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic conditions in the Second District have continued the 
  moderate improvement noted in recent months, according to directors 
  and other business leaders contacted recently. Retail sales ended 
  the holiday season with a flourish after some sluggishness early in 
  the season. With a few exceptions, inventories seemed to be at 
  desired levels. While orders for capital goods have been coming in 
  slowly, this was partially attributed to businesses awaiting the 
  policy decisions of the incoming administration. The recent price 
  increases of steel and other materials and products were generally 
  expected to hold. On the labor scene, there were predictions of
  moderation in wage demands this year but more emphasis on 
  improvements in non-wage benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        The consensus among retailers in the Second District was that 
  Christmas sales turned out very satisfactorily. As judged by 
  historical patterns, consumer spending started out slowly in 
  December but picked up sharply as Christmas neared. Many retailers 
  characterized the week before Christmas as unusually strong. Within 
  the New York metropolitan area, sales were generally regarded to be 
  stronger in the suburbs than in the City. Upstate, one department 
  store executive labeled the Christmas season as excellent. Directors 
  of the Buffalo Branch, on the other hand, characterized the holiday 
  season as good but not up to original expectations. In their view, 
  exceptionally severe weather may have had a dampening effect on 
  sales. While some merchandise was marked down prior to Christmas, 
  most retailers indicated that markdowns were no greater than 
  customary. On the other hand, two department store executives 
  reported extra promotional activity this Christmas. Early reports on 
  post-Christmas sales were very encouraging, and most retailers were 
  optimistic in their outlook. Nonetheless, the high level of gift 
  certificates purchased this Christmas was interpreted by some as a 
  sign of lingering consumer caution.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the whole, inventories were thought to be in good shape. A few 
  scattered exceptions were mentioned. For example, one director 
  pointed out that inventories of nonferrous metals continued to be 
  extraordinarily high. At the same time, there remained problems with 
  the mix of automobile inventories. Stocks of small cars were too 
  high although they were improving, aided by the rebate programs; 
  stocks of intermediate and full-size cars continued to be tight. 
  Overall, the consensus was that inventories were or soon would be 
  reasonably balanced. One business leader, however, predicted that 
  inventory targets would soon be raised, thereby fostering a moderate 
  step-up in inventory accumulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods producers in the district generally reported that new 
  orders have been coming in at a relatively slow pace of late. In the 
  view of two respondents, this sluggishness stemmed in part from 
  businesses waiting to see what programs the new administration would 
  propose. Of particular interest was the decision as to whether or 
  not to raise the investment tax credit—an issue that was left 
  unresolved in the announcement of President-elect Carter's proposed 
  program of fiscal stimulus. Capital spending was not expected to 
  rise sharply over the next quarter or so, but some business leaders 
  did predict a speedup later in the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Concerning the price increases recently posted on various basic 
  materials and products, most business leaders contacted thought the 
  higher prices were generally sticking despite some reports of 
  discounting. An economist for an automobile company reported that 
  although steel prices had been discounted in early December, posted 
  prices seemed to have been holding since then. An executive in the 
  capital goods industry agreed that price increases for flat-rolled 
  steel products appeared to be holding, but added that discounting 
  could begin if the automotive industry did not expand production as 
  much as expected. With respect to stainless steel and aluminum, a 
  director reported that recent price hikes were sticking.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there was no consensus concerning wage increases for 1977, 
  most business leaders anticipated some moderation from 1976. The 
  rate of inflation was expected to be an important determinant of 
  wage increases. A corporate economist pointed out that some of the 
  wage settlements expiring in 1976 were negotiated during the period 
  of wage controls. The contracts expiring in 1977, in contrast, were 
  negotiated after the wage control program ended, implying that the 
  workers covered by these latter contracts have less "catching up" to 
  do. Some respondents expressed the view that a high unemployment 
  rate will have a smaller than usual moderating effect because the 
  current high rate of unemployment reflects rapid labor force growth 
  rather than sluggish labor demand. Nonwage issues, including job 
  security, fringe benefits, and pension provisions, were seen by some 
  as especially important in 1977. Indeed, one executive thought that 
  while wage increases would moderate, there would not be much relief 
  from cost pressures. Another business leader predicted that the 
  recent contract negotiated by the automobile workers would make 
  labor negotiations tougher than usual this year. On the other hand, 
  directors at the Buffalo Branch thought that the willingness of 
  labor to work with the new administration would help to prevent 
  serious labor disruptions.
