      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 30, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Fourth District economy shows signs of sluggishness with no 
clear direction. On the upside, there are reports of strong gains in 
retail sales, especially of autos. Employment rose in December, and 
commercial bank loans increased in all categories, especially the 
consumer sector. On the downside, manufacturing output, orders and 
backlogs fell in December and manufacturing employment was 
unchanged. House builders remain extremely cautious, although other 
housing market participants' outlooks have been buoyed by interest 
rate declines. The coal mining, and oil and gas exploration 
industries are depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market trends in the District were mixed in December. Ohio 
employment (s.a.) rose in December after having fallen in October 
and November. However, unemployment (s.a.) also rose in December 
after falling in November. The unemployment rate in Ohio rose in 
December to 9.1% (.s.a.) from 8.7% in November. Unemployment rates 
(n.s.a.) in ten metropolitan areas in the District ranged in 
November from 6.5% in Columbus to 15.6% in Wheeling. An index of 
leading indicators of employment in Pittsburgh has shown little 
change since last February, suggesting that employment there will 
not grow further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retail sales registered a further strong gain in 
December. Some auto dealers report sales were up as much as 28% over 
a strong year-earlier period, apparently aided in part by an easing 
in inventory constraints, and the strong sales gains have continued 
into early January. Representatives from area department stores 
report that December sales more than met expectations. Year-over-
year gains were in the 7% to 11% range. Some merchants report 
extensive price reductions while others say price reductions were 
quite limited. Most analysts attribute the fourth quarter rebound in 
sales to a still-positive consumer attitude. However, an economist 
at one department store chain noted that he expects retailers to 
continue trimming inventories over the first quarter of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District shows signs of weakening, and 
the energy sector is depressed. Surveys of production managers in 
Cincinnati and Cleveland show production, new orders and backlogs 
fell in December. However, there are some indications that the 
falloff may be seasonal, and manufacturing employment was unchanged. 
In Cleveland, a substantial majority of respondents expect business 
to be better in the first half of 1985 than in the last half of 
1984. Price pressures continue to be moderate. Vendor delivery 
performance continues to improve. Raw material inventories are 
declining slowly, and finished goods inventories are generally flat, 
except where order declines have resulted in some involuntary 
accumulation. Contacts continue to report very conservative policies 
on inventory accumulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many firms in this District report continued strong competition from 
imports is restraining price increases and keeping profit margins 
small. A containers producer reports a continued shift from glass 
containers to plastic and paper substitutes. A producer of personal 
safety equipment used in industry had strong earnings in 1984 and 
expects a strong 1985. Some chemicals factories in southern Ohio are 
operating at capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major steel producers report some pickup in orders from the 
automobile industry and steel service centers, but transactions 
prices remain well below published prices because of excess domestic 
capacity and strong competition from imports. Steel inventories 
remain high. A steel mill in western Pennsylvania recently announced 
a 500-worker layoff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers have mixed views on the report that domestic 
firms plan a 6.8% real increase in expenditures on plant and 
equipment in 1985. One firm, which expects a recession to begin no 
later than the second half, expects the real change in business 
fixed investment to be negative, partly because of uncertainty about 
tax law changes. Another firm thinks the figure is on the mark while 
a third expects a 10% real increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal mining remains a depressed industry. Many workers are on a 
three-day week, and improvement is not expected until late-1985 when 
excessive stockpiles will have been worked down. Falling oil prices 
have depressed oil and gas drilling activity in this District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Except for home builders, housing market participants in this 
District report continued improvement in their housing-related 
businesses and cite declining mortgage rates as the primary cause. 
The consensus is that housing activity will rebound at a slow, 
sustained pace until mid-1985. Housing market participants expect 
that the rate on fixed rate mortgages will decline as much as 
another 50 basis points, but won't fall below 12%.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors, who remain the most optimistic among market participants, 
experienced further improvement in December in listings and 
contracts closed. There are some signs that the move-up market is 
reversing its flat performance of 1984. Realtors' optimism is 
reflected in one District firm's plan to open three times as many 
new franchises during 1985 as in 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lending volume is expanding because of lower mortgage 
rates, and one lender reports that loan volume in December was 50% 
higher than a year earlier. Lenders anticipate that the resumed 
popularity of the fixed rate mortgage will persist until the second 
half of 1985, when they expect rates to rise. Lenders will sell most 
new fixed-rate mortgages in the secondary market if commitment rates 
are favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Builders remain extremely cautious. New orders remain sluggish, and 
buyer traffic, which a major builder reports was up 11% nationally 
in December, fell 35% in Ohio. Because of poor earnings in 1984, 
builders are positioning to minimize downside risk.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan outstandings in all major categories increased at Fourth 
District banks during the past month. Contacts report that consumer 
loan demand has been quite good, and it should remain relatively 
strong on the strength of new car sales. Business lending has 
picked-up somewhat, and contacts are generally optimistic about 
future demand for commercial loans. One banker, however, thinks that 
recent business loan demand has been rather weak and doesn't expect 
an improvement before March. Deposit growth has been moderate for 
both transaction and nontransaction accounts at District banks in 
the past month.
