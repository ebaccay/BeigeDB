      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 16, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Manufacturing activity in the Fourth District is rebounding from 
  effects of the teamsters strike last month, and major industries are 
  producing at or near effective capacity. Consumer spending has been 
  sluggish except for autos, but business spending has been sustained 
  by further increases in orders and backlogs. Officials claim little 
  sign of speculation or excessive inventory buildup. They uniformly 
  see little sign of price relief for industrial products. Gasoline 
  supplies are tight but have not disrupted business activity. Deposit 
  inflows into S&amp;Ls fell sharply in April. The city of Cleveland 
  remains in default.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment, production and shipments in the automotive and steel 
  industries, the main industries affected by the teamsters strike, 
  are recovering. However, some production losses of large cars will 
  not be recouped because of poor sales. Also, steel haulers in the 
  Youngstown Steel Producing Center are still not back to work. As 
  much as 10 percent of steel production schedules in April were 
  curtailed, in addition to cutbacks in steel shipments. Presently, 
  steel is operating at practical capacity, which is expected to 
  continue through the balance of this quarter because of strong 
  demand from the construction and capital goods industries. Steel 
  economist expect some easing next quarter, partly from lower demand 
  from the auto and appliance industries, and also because some 
  facilities will be shut down for repairs during the summer months. 
  Aluminum is operating at about 94 percent of capacity and an even 
  higher operating rate is expected next quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        District officials continue to report a widening dichotomy between 
  the consumer and business sectors. Some retailers and producers of 
  consumer goods believe a cyclical turning point is near unless 
  consumer spending shows a pickup in real terms. Remarks about 
  consumer resistance to higher prices, increased consumer 
  substitution, especially of food products, lack of strength in most 
  department store type-goods, and moderation in credit card usage, 
  are increasingly common. Although one retail economist expects 
  retail sales in May will show a larger increase than in April, most 
  of the expected gain would be absorbed by higher prices. In his 
  opinion, retail sales are on a plateau similar to 1974. He expects 
  deceleration in income gains this quarter, which along with 
  continued double-digit rates of inflation, would further reduce real 
  spending. Because of uncertainty over sales prospects, retailers 
  have been cutting their fall orders by at least 15 percent in real 
  terms, according to a producer of men's apparel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods producers are still bullish over sales prospects, and 
  some have pushed back their expectations for a decline in orders to 
  the second half of this year or early next year. Their comments 
  emphasize continued increases in orders and backlogs, but they 
  generally report no sign of double-orders because shortages are not 
  prevalent as they were in 1974. Aerospace and machine tool builders 
  report backlogs at the end of last quarter were at least 50 percent 
  higher than a year earlier. Strength in machine tool orders has been 
  widespread because of growing need for modernization and for 
  additional capacity, according to one builder.
       </p>
       <p>
        With few exceptions, district officials assert there is little sign 
  of speculative building of inventories, although most acknowledge 
  some buildup in stocks in line with higher production and backlogs. 
  A ball bearing producer notes some speculative buying that has been 
  triggered by his firm's allocation of production. Limited supplies 
  of domestic steel, coupled with a curtailed volume of steel imports 
  in recent months, have held the buildup in steel inventories to 
  normal levels relative to current usage, although one economist 
  believes that some steel users must hedge in order to protect 
  production schedules. Similarly, an economist asserted that the low 
  volume of imports and strong domestic demand have prevented a 
  buildup of aluminum inventories. Tire inventories held by retailers 
  are believed to be consistent with industry targets, especially in 
  view of the strike against one tire producer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Officials uniformly report little sign of relief from recent intense 
  price pressures for industrial products. Some complain about COLA 
  cost pressures. However, a steel economist notes that guidelines 
  will limit future steel price increases this year to about 4 
  percent, although the market can absorb a much larger increase. 
  Also, a machine tool builder indicated price increases are being 
  held down to some extent by wage-price guidelines. A scheduled 
  increase in aluminum prices was recently scaled downward because of 
  guidelines, although domestic prices are said to be far below world 
  prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gasoline supplies in the District are tight but apparently not as 
  serious as some other regions of the country. While business 
  activity has not yet been hampered by spot shortages, some 
  economists believe short supplies of diesel fuels may disrupt 
  industrial activity later this year. Production and sales of 
  recreational vehicles and light trucks for personal use have been 
  curtailed rather sharply in response to higher prices and reduced 
  availability of gasoline.
       </p>
       <p>
        S&amp;Ls report a sharp drop in deposits since the change in money 
  market certificates last March. However, they acknowledge that April 
  is typically a poor month for deposits and that some rebound has 
  occurred in early May, even in passbook accounts. Apparently, a 
  large part of the decline in April was the result of depositors 
  failing to roll-over maturing certificates and placing funds into 
  passbook accounts for temporary liquidity. Mortgage loan demand is 
  reported to be rising seasonally but is not as strong as a year-ago. 
  Some association officials expect a further increase in mortgage 
  lending rates because of reduced availability of mortgage funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Cleveland enters its sixth month in default, local banks that 
  hold $14.5 million in notes are becoming increasingly critical of 
  the city's inability to present an acceptable repayment plan. One 
  local bank, which has not received information about the city's 
  budget revenues and expenditures during 1979, has threatened to seek 
  a court ruling on the city's obligation to begin repaying the notes. 
  The mayor has responded to the bank's concern by stating that, if 
  state aid is not obtained soon, the city would begin re-payment in 
  July and would repay the total amount by the end of the year. 
  Whether such a repayment schedule could be attained without further 
  cutbacks in operating expenses is uncertain. Indeed, it is unclear 
  whether the city is currently able to meet operating expenses other 
  than payrolls and debt service.
