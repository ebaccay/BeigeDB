      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Strengthening in capital goods, steel, and housing is boosting 
  output and employment in the fourth district this quarter. 
  Additional thrust is coming from some rebuilding of inventories. 
  Capital goods producers generally seem more optimistic that 
  production and spending will accelerate this year, although none 
  expect a boom. Auto retailers are optimistic that 1977 will be a 
  strong year for sales, but other retailers are still cautious over 
  prospects. Upward price pressures remain about as intense as they 
  have been since last fall.
      <p>
       Output and employment in district manufacturing should strengthen 
  this quarter in response to completion of inventory liquidation or 
  to a buildup of inventories. Steel economists report that a good 
  recovery in orders in the last two months is likely to boost 
  production this quarter to within an 85-90 percent operating rate, 
  compared with about 73 percent last quarter. Price hedging and 
  inventory rebuilding account for only a small part of the 
  improvement, according to two steel sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some major appliance producers in the district are rebuilding 
  inventories that were depleted late last year and early this year. 
  For one firm, the inventory buildup is expected to bring inventories 
  up to desired inventory-sales ratios, while another producer expects 
  a buildup of in-process materials of about 10 percent above expected 
  sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital good producers seem to be gaining confidence that plant and 
  equipment spending in 1977 will increase at least as much as 
  indicated in the latest Department of Commerce survey, despite 
  erratic behavior in new orders. While none expect a boom in capital 
  spending in 1977, some indicate that their forecasts of a 12 to 15 
  percent increase in spending now appear to be reasonable. They also 
  indicate emphasis is on modernization of facilities rather than on 
  expansion. Two large machine tool builders remain optimistic that 
  orders, shipments, and backlogs will improve from 1976. They note 
  that their orders in February continued to increase (in contrast to 
  a drop reported in national data) and doubt that their industry has 
  reached a cyclical peak in orders. An economist with a major 
  producer of motors, generators, and general industrial equipment 
  noted that since last November orders began to pick up for a broad 
  line of products, with the exception of equipment used by utilities. 
  He indicated there is a lack of major projects but feels his 
  forecast for a 13 to 14 percent increase in capital spending this 
  year will be realized. His firm will boost capital spending by 20 
  percent from a depressed 1976 level, with expenditures allocated 
  largely for modernization rather than expansion, except for a few 
  high technology items and new products. Similarly, a financial 
  officer with a large capital goods producer reports its projected 
  increase in spending for 1977 will be for modernization, except for 
  completion of some plants that will produce products different from 
  those originally intended when the plants were started a few years 
  ago. He noted further strengthening in orders for heavy-duty trucks 
  and materials-handling equipment for the lumber industry but 
  continued weakness for industrial-purpose lift trucks and shovel 
  loaders used in construction. Recent demands for communication 
  equipment, presses, mini-computers and terminals have been at a rate 
  well above shipments in recent months, according to one producer. A 
  bank economist noted several capital goods clients commented that it 
  is now easier to get finance committees to approve appropriations 
  for all but large projects. Welding equipment and electrode 
  producers expect record sales in 1977 with real gains of at least 7 
  percent from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two soft spots in capital goods are utilities and steel. Spending by 
  utilities remains weak, with little sign of improvement, according 
  to several major suppliers. Some steel economists expect that 
  capital spending by their firms will be no higher than last year 
  because of continued inadequate cash flow and a loss in profits last 
  quarter. A major steel producer is expected to allocate expenditures 
  primarily for replacement, repairs, and pollution control equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers' views of consumer spending range from mild optimism to 
  confidence that real sales will improve this quarter further from 
  last quarter. Several auto retailers and producers are encouraged by 
  the sharp comeback in sales last month and do not expect much 
  consumer resistance to recent price increases in new cars. Auto 
  plants in the district, except for the GMC Lordstown plant which 
  produces the slow-selling Vega, are expected to work overtime or six 
  days a week to meet projected high demand for standard and 
  intermediate size cars. On the other hand, department store 
  executives comment that although sales have been good, they have not 
  increased across-the-board. Some note considerable strength in sales 
  in recent weeks, in part because of a make up for winter losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for new and used housing is reported to be strong, according 
  to directors and mortgage lending officials. Higher prices are not a 
  deterrent in the present market, which is described as a sellers 
  market. One director expects new starts to reach 1.8 million units 
  this year and 2 million units in 1978. Multi-family starts remain 
  weak in the district. An official with a savings and loan 
  association in northeast Ohio expects mortgage rates will increase 
  by at least a quarter of a percent before the end of May. Liquidity 
  of several savings and loans is well above the required rate and can 
  amply support a considerably higher volume of commitments than a 
  year ago. Some directors associated with banks note substantial 
  growth in passbook savings accounts and slow growth in time deposits 
  relative to a year ago. S&amp;L officials report continued strong flows
  in deposits that in some cases still exceed demand in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
       There appears to be little relaxation in upward price pressures. In 
  addition to increases for some steel prices expected by next month, 
  price increases have been announced in recent weeks for glassware, 
  polyvinyl chloride, polyester resins, aluminum and publishing paper. 
  Recent steel price increases appear to be sticking; however, 
  producers of stainless steel withdrew increases that were scheduled 
  to take effect early this month. On the other hand, an official with 
  a petroleum refinery expects that motor gasoline prices, which tend 
  to rise during peak demands in the summer months, may not increase 
  this year if inventories continue well above normal as they have 
  been in recent weeks.
