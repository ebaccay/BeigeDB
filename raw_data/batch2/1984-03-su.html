      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Introduction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The expansion continues in all Federal Reserve Districts, but with 
variations in vigor among regions and sectors. Several banks 
emphasize a revival of consumer and business confidence, and 
widespread views that strong momentum will sustain the recovery 
through the year. Virtually all sectors are expanding or at least 
holding level, with oil and gas well drilling a significant 
exception. Geographically, the strongest gains are occurring on the 
West Coast, with much of the Midwest and Northeast still reporting 
substantial slack in durable goods manufacturing. Almost all 
districts noted exceptional strength in retail sales, often 
exceeding expectations. Demand for housing also is showing 
surprising strength, helped by wider use of adjustable rate 
mortgages. Capital expenditure plans are being raised cautiously, 
with emphasis on productivity and cost cutting. Employment and 
consumer income are rising at a good pace, but markets are still 
generally soft in many northern states. Inventories, overall, remain 
quite low relative to sales. Inventory rebuilding is expected, 
mainly at the retail level. The farm sector remains depressed, but 
is being aided by higher prices and increased plantings. Pressures 
are building on capacity in some industries. Some shortages are 
reported. Price inflation is accelerating, but still only moderately 
overall. Credit demands are stronger, especially for home mortgages 
and installment loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumers continue to lead the expansion, increasing spending since 
the turn of the year more than had been expected. While all products 
are selling well, the list is headed by larger domestic cars, 
imported cars (limited by quotas), small trucks, appliances, 
consumer electronics, furniture, and recreational equipment. 
Philadelphia and San Francisco report a rising share of retail sales 
on credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for new and used homes continued "surprisingly" strong in 
January and February. The housing revival has been particularly 
vigorous in the West. Cleveland reported a leveling in activity. 
Stronger than expected buying is widely attributed to adjustable 
rate mortgages offered at interest rates initially well below those 
charged on fixed-rate mortgages. Richmond notes a revival of 
speculative building, in anticipation of strong spring sales. 
Atlanta notes a sharp drop in permits for multifamily construction, 
as first-time buyers move out of apartments. Dallas also reports 
concern about overbuilding of multifamily structures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Job markets have strengthened in all districts, but unemployment 
remains disturbingly high, especially north of the Ohio river. 
Cleveland reports that cautious employers are increasing use of 
overtime and part-time help in preference to permanent increases in 
force. Chicago notes much slower advance in wages than in past 
years, and widespread moves to curtail non-wage benefits, especially 
soaring medical costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory output continues to advance on a broad front. Output of some 
car and truck models is at capacity, restricted by component 
availability. District reports tell of strength in paper, carpets, 
farm chemicals, and fertilizer (Atlanta), defense and high tech 
capital goods (Boston, New York, and Minneapolis), and lumber, 
aircraft, and missiles (San Francisco). One of the few weak areas is 
oil and gas well drilling (Dallas), with associated manufactured 
goods. Steel is up sharply from the low point, but still far below 
capacity. Agricultural equipment output remains at low levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The upturn in outlays for business equipment, earlier concentrated 
in electronic types, is becoming more widespread among heavier 
mechanical equipment. Further improvement is expected. A few capital 
goods industries are operating near effective capacity, but most are 
well short of these levels. Investment is frequently oriented toward 
controlling costs and enhancing productivity, rather than adding to 
capacity. Industries experiencing strong demand or sharply improved 
orders include electronics and robotics, heavy trucks, trailers, and 
aircraft. Machine tool orders have improved modestly, restrained by 
severe foreign competition. Orders are also up for freight cars, 
construction equipment, and mining equipment, but remain far short 
of prosperous levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although office building construction continues strong in Chicago, 
New York, and Dallas, there are fears of excess space in some areas. 
San Francisco sees a strong rise underway ~n shopping centers and 
hotels. Richmond notes an improving outlook for commercial 
construction. With manufacturers' capital spending mainly to improve 
productivity, factory space is still generally ample. But some firms 
are expanding. San Francisco indicates that electronics and defense 
suppliers are investing in new structures. Most firms, however, are 
reluctant to add new space or even bring marginal facilities back on 
stream. An expected increase in highway construction this year may 
be hampered by Congressional delays in approving funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Higher farm prices and increased plantings, mainly because of the 
expiration of the PIK program, suggest a stronger agricultural 
sector in 1984. However, farmers continue under financial stress. 
Atlanta reports a high rate of farm loan delinquencies, especially 
on government agency loans. Kansas City finds farmland sales sick 
and values soft. Chicago mentions the low sign-up for the new dairy 
program intended to reduce the milk surplus. San Francisco reports 
plantings of fruits and vegetables going well, with good prices for 
product, partly because of the freeze in Texas and Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers and trade firms are keeping inventories at low levels 
relative to activity. Boston, New York, and St. Louis report 
retailers building stocks to accommodate stronger sales. While most 
companies say inventories are at "acceptable" levels (Richmond) or 
"satisfactory" (Kansas City), leadtimes are increasing; and some 
shortages are evident. A number of districts report low inventories 
of motor vehiclesâ€”especially imported carsâ€”electronic components, 
paper and paperboard, and gypsum board.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices are rising at a faster pace, but still not to an alarming 
degree. Philadelphia and Kansas City state that purchasing managers 
expect prices to rise faster as the year moves on. Higher prices are 
related to shortages and longer leadtimes, which reflect pressures 
on capacity. So far the largest price increases have been for 
purchased materials, but increasingly tags are being raised on 
finished goods. Chicago finds large rate increases under discussion 
for electric utilities and telephone service. College tuitions have 
been boosted sharply. Cleveland states that price increases for 
tires have been held back by availability of imports, an observation 
that also applies to a wide range of products.
