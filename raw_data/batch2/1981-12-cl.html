      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

     <p>
      <strong>
       December 16, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District have generally lowered 
their forecasts of real GNP to show deeper declines this quarter and 
next, especially because of inventory correction. Capital goods 
orders are deteriorating, except in limited cases such as energy and 
aerospace. Steel production continues to decline, as inventory 
liquidation weakens orders. Post-Thanksgiving Day retail sales rose 
less than anticipated, and several retailers are pessimistic about 
the remainder of the shopping season. District unemployment is 
expected to rise further in December, because manufacturing 
industries are experiencing shutdowns and seasonal hiring in 
nonmanufacturing is relatively light. Housing may be bottoming out, 
but several S&amp;Ls expect a very sluggish recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several economists, who expected a decline in real GNP 
between 3% and 5% in late October, now have lowered their fourth 
quarter forecasts to show a decline between 5% and 7% (annual 
rates). Effects of high interest rates and a sizable inventory 
accumulations are primary reasons given for the larger than expected 
weakness in economic activity. The peak-to-trough decline in real 
GNP is expected to be milder than the 1980 recession. Although most 
respondents expect the recession to trough in the first quarter of 
1982, a bank economist expects a turnaround no sooner than mid-1982, 
when consumer tax cuts and capital spending provide stimuli. Since 
sharp recoveries often follow an inventory adjustment, an initial 
surge in economic activity is likely, followed by a sluggish advance 
until capital-goods spending accelerates in the second half of 1982, 
according to a capital-goods economist.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital-goods spending is still basically flat, 
according to several respondents, but a few producer-goods 
manufacturers report that orders have been deteriorating a little 
more rapidly recently. Generally, weakness in capital spending for 
trucks, industrial machinery, and farm machinery has been offset by 
continued strength in computer equipment, energy, and electronics. 
Within electronics, an economist for a capital-goods producer notes 
a slowdown in orders for production-related equipment, even though 
order books for advanced technology equipment are full into 1984. 
Recent weakness in construction of office buildings has resulted in 
some decline in commercial air conditioning parts, according to one 
producer. Weakness has also occurred in utilities and their 
construction-related activities, according to a capital goods 
supplier, because of declining power consumption. Several 
respondents expect capital spending to decline in the first half of 
1982 because of concern that interest rate will remain high, as well 
as because of declining operating rates and a lagged effect of weak 
profits during the second half of 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of decline in steel orders is slowing, but steel 
production still exceeds demand. Current operating rates, according 
to a steel economist, are at about 60% of capacity, while order 
rates are equivalent to only about 50%. Inventories are accumulating 
at the mill and among customers, although a steel distributor 
reports some customers are requesting immediate delivery to maintain 
production. Operating rates could fall below 50% in the weeks ahead 
in an effort to control steel inventories. However, an industry 
economist states that inventory liquidations underway may cause 
shortages and could result in a recovery in steel orders by next 
March. A steel fabricator reports business activity has slowed 
substantially since mid-August, with even some softness emerging 
among oil industry customers where oil projects have been disrupted 
by bankruptcies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the District have deteriorated 
more than nationally during November, in contrast to recent months. 
An economist for a major department store chain believes that some 
pickup in retail sales began in late-November, mostly in auto sales, 
but further gains in December are expected to be divided between 
auto sales and GAF. Several local retailers report post-Thanksgiving 
Day sales slightly below year-ago levels, but total sales through 
November were slightly above year-ago levels. Heavy promotions are 
expected through the remainder of the year. An economist for a major 
grocery-store chain reports a gradual slowdown in sales as customers 
experienced falling disposable income in recent months. Spreading 
unemployment has made consumers more cautious. A producer of home 
and personal care goods reports mild year-over-year gains in sales 
(about 2-3%), but these gains are considered to be below expected 
normal increases (about 4-5%) under present economic conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales were very weak in November, according to several local 
auto dealers, and December could be among the worst sales months 
ever. No sales promotion are being offered in December, although new 
promotions may begin in January. An area dealer has cut orders from 
producers by 75%, while retaining a 90 day stock. Several import 
dealers also report weak sales, although less severe than domestic 
dealers. A turnaround is not expected until next spring, and 
possibly not before the next round of consumer tax cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Plant shutdowns for inventory control are expected to 
produce a substantial further increase in District unemployment in 
December.
     </p>
     <p>
      Declines in manufacturing employment have already exceeded 
nationwide declines since the mid-1981 high. The sharpest decline in 
the District, in absolute and relative terms, occurred in auto and 
auto-related industries. Only in primary metals has the decline in 
the District been less than nationwide. Most respondents to the 
latest Fourth District Manufacturing Survey report tightening 
control on labor costs and overtime, but virtually all of the 
recently announced lay-offs are occurring among durable-goods 
producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some housing officials believe a trough in housing could be 
in the fourth quarter, if easing mortgage rates, which have declined 
to about 17%, continue to ease and if an economic recovery occurs 
early next year. Housing orders, according to a major builder, are 
below year-ago levels, although recent year-over-year percentage 
declines have narrowed since summer of 1981. A local builder is 
skeptical that falling mortgage rates will contribute much to 
increasing the number of qualifying loan applicants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also, mortgage lending may be slow to pick up, according to several 
S&amp;L officials, because increased savings flow will be absorbed by 
repaying FHLB advances. Savings flows thus far continue to be weak 
but positive. S&amp;Ls have been more aggressive than banks. in 
promoting IRA accounts. Some S&amp;L officials note that All-Savers 
certificates have shown only marginal increase in November, with 
most the funds coming from existing accounts.
