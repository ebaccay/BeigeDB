      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 9, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Reserve Banks this month are, on balance, 
more cheerful than were those of last month, at least with regard to 
both current and prospective business activity. The improvement in 
the assessment of business conditions is attributable primarily to 
several Districts who see the recession as having bottomed out or as 
ending soon. Several other Reserve Banks, however, continue to 
report weakening economic activity, with no prospects for a recovery 
beginning before the end of the year. With regard to inflation, a 
consensus view is not clearly discernible. Some Districts report an 
easing of price pressures at the materials and retail levels because 
of weak demand, while others hear nothing from manufacturers that 
suggests a slowing rate of inflation. Most Districts report slowly 
rising deposits at commercial banks and at thrift institutions. 
Commercial banks say their interest rates are higher and their 
lending is on the weak side. The most notable development appears to 
have been in mortgage lending, where renewed strength is being 
sapped by rising mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Conditions and Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production and sales in the United 
States stabilized further in recent weeks and prospects for recovery 
improved, judging from Reserve Bank reports. Boston, Philadelphia, 
Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, who last month reported 
further deterioration in their District economies, now report 
business conditions are firming up. Atlanta and Chicago are also 
more upbeat in their assessments this month. Cleveland respondents 
still expect a sluggish recovery will begin next quarter. Dallas 
sees a quickening in the pace of economic activity, up from the slow 
rate of expansion reported last month. San Francisco identifies 
several favorable developments, but believes the recession has 
months to go, while New York and Kansas City report, as they did a 
month ago, continued weakness in their District economies, with a 
likelihood of more weakening until yearend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weak demand is apparently reducing price pressures at the 
retail and commodity levels. St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas 
report reduced profit margins at retail stores, where cost increases 
are being absorbed rather than passed on, and prices are being cut 
to move merchandise. Boston and Chicago are hearing about moderation 
in price pressures for some materials, but manufacturers responding 
to Philadelphia and Richmond say they can relay no evidence of 
relief from inflation. Recent increases in farm product prices are 
reported by Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Chicago and San 
Francisco call attention to the inflationary implications of the 
rising cost of inputs, especially labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial bank lending continues sluggish 
except in parts of the Southwest, and scattered exceptions 
elsewhere. Weakness in consumer credit is explicit in the reports of 
most Reserve Banks, and implicit in the rest. San Francisco says 
financial institutions are concerned that the rise in interest rates 
may result in deposit outflows, although neither San Francisco nor 
any other Reserve Bank tells of any decline in deposits. Atlanta 
notes the rapid growth of international banking in south Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lackluster retail sales characterize District 
reports. Atlanta and Chicago think consumer confidence is improving, 
but San Francisco does not. Dallas and Atlanta find their dealers in 
domestic autos increasingly optimistic about the new model year, but 
New York does not. Most department stores are not counting on sales 
to improve much in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The summer improvement in homebuilding 
activity has been reversed by higher mortgage rates, according to 
Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco respondents. Other Districts 
relay concern about the possibility of such a reversal, or point to 
recent declines in mortgage lending (New York, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Fixed Investment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending on plant and equipment 
is expected to decline. New orders for capital goods are weak, 
except for oil field equipment (Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Dallas). Boston and New York report that sales of capital goods are 
holding up, but only because of backlogs of unfilled orders. 
Richmond notes that low rates of capacity utilization in most 
manufacturing worsen the outlook for business fixed investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With a few exceptions, businesses consider their stocks 
of goods and materials to be just about where they want them 
(Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, 
Minneapolis).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The hot dry weather this summer seriously damaged 
several crops, reduced weight gains in livestock, and forced sales 
of livestock intended for breeding herds. Although farmers in some 
regions will suffer large income losses, net farm income in certain 
other areas and perhaps in the nation as a whole, will be higher 
than it would have been otherwise because of higher farm product 
prices resulting from reduced marketings (Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, San Francisco).
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors and Financial Panel. Professors Eckstein, Samuelson, and 
Tobin agree that monetary and fiscal policies now in place will 
generate a sluggish recovery. Eckstein, concerned about the snugness 
of monetary growth targets, says allowing another housing setback 
would be "pointless nonsense." Samuelson believes the Fed should 
make clear its willingness to violate the targets if they interfere 
with a satisfactory recovery. Tobin thinks an incomes policy is 
required in addition to monetary and fiscal policies to reduce 
inflation, and he considers targets for monetary aggregates to be 
ridiculous. New York now features the views of a Financial Panel as 
a regular part of its report, beginning this month with Henry 
Kaufman, James O'Leary, and Albert Wojnilower. Kaufman expects the 
economy to begin recovering next quarter, despite the backup in 
interest rates which, he says, is slowing the reliquefaction of 
businesses. O'Leary finds a universal expectation of no decline in 
the basic inflation rate-an expectation that he believes is not 
fully appreciated by the authorities. Wojnilower feels the recession 
is ending, and anticipates surprises on the high side in business 
conditions.
