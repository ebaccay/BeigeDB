      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 31, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The unexpectedly strong pace of economic activity last quarter has 
      led some District observers to postpone the timing of a recession, 
      now expected to occur later this year. Retailers and producers of 
      consumer goods are cautious in their appraisal of near-term sale 
      prospects. On the other hand, manufacturers expect to operate at or 
      near capacity at least this quarter. S&amp;Ls are concerned that 
      supplies of mortgage funds may be sharply reduced if latest deposit 
      experience continues. Financial prospects for the City of Cleveland 
      remain uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several economists who had forecast a recession in early or mid-1979 
      have pushed back their expectations to late 1979 in response to the 
      better-than-expected pace of activity last quarter. Some raised 
      estimates of the level of output for the year, but still expect a 
      recession late in 1979. A few economists indicated unwillingness to 
      change their recession forecast because of uncertainty over how long 
      the recent sluggish behavior in monetary aggregates will last. Also, 
      a few others do not expect a recession this year. They point out 
      that consumer spending may not be as weak as perceived and that 
      fixed investment will likely be stronger than indicated in latest 
      surveys.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers and producers of consumer goods are still cautious in 
      comments on short-term sales prospects. They explained that 
      department store sales in December and the fourth quarter showed 
      little improvement in real terms. An economist with a major national 
      department store chain remarked that year-over-year sales gains 
      amounted to about 8 percent last quarter, considerably less than 
      indicated in preliminary estimates of national product accounts. 
      Widespread markdowns and extensive sales promotions in major 
      metropolitan centers of the District during December are expected to 
      dampen sales gains in January, although retailers report sales have 
      been running well ahead of a year-ago, when sales were depressed by 
      frigid weather throughout the District. Some retailers expect 
      modest, if any, sales gains this quarter and have held tight control 
      over orders to their suppliers. An apparel producer, for example, 
      notes that sales to large retailers continue to run behind a year-
      earlier volume. A major auto producer, which late last fall 
      projected total new car sales for 1979 at 11.1 million cars, 
      recently reduced its forecast to 10.8 million units.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity in the District has been sustained by high 
      operating rates, at or near effective capacity, in capital goods, 
      primary metals, automotive products, rubber, plastics and glass 
      industries. Machine tool builders are operating at capacity and 
      expect to continue at capacity through most of this year as backlogs 
      are still expanding. Orders in January have apparently rebounded 
      from a drop in December. In steel, expectations are that the 
      industry will be operating at or near effective capacity this 
      quarter and perhaps next. Millers are generally booked this quarter 
      and orders for second quarter are reported to be heavy. Steel orders 
      from appliance producers have been sluggish but more than offset by 
      sizable demand from the automotive industry and increasing demand
      from capital goods producers, including machinery and construction. 
      The January 1st increase in trigger prices for steel is not expected 
      to result in any meaningful reduction in steel imports until March 
      at the earliest. One economist attributes the unexpectedly high 
      level of demand to a fear of shortages and believes inventories are 
      being built rapidly. Another believes that a rapid buildup of steel 
      inventories is occurring only at the distributor level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers and manufacturers generally are still cautious over 
      inventory policies. Retailers of general merchandise have managed to 
      trim stocks through aggressive promotion last month but apparently 
      some still have higher than desired inventories. Stocks of major 
      appliances, which were trimmed by recent production cutbacks by some 
      large producers, have been reduced to a more normal range. According 
      to one producer, last quarter's adjustment reflects expectations of 
      little or no sales gain this year. Relatively low profit margins, 
      lack of growth over the next few years, the need to revamp 
      appliances for energy conservation, and continuous labor strife are 
      said to be among the reasons for an impending March 1st shutdown of 
      a major appliance producer in the District that employs about 7,500
      workers. A few manufacturers, especially in capital goods 
      industries, plan to step up inventory building in response to 
      further increases in backlogs and rising prices. Tire producers are 
      finding it difficult to build inventories of radial tires because of 
      high demand. One cautionary note is that inventories are actually 
      higher than suggested in customary inventory-sales ratios because 
      many businesses switched from fifo to lifo. Housing demand has been 
      slowing, probably more than seasonally, although causes are 
      uncertain. One source suggests a problem that might be shaping up is 
      the lack of availability of mortgage funds. Some S&amp;Ls have not been 
      offering money market certificates and others have a capped rate 
      below the maximum because of a profit squeeze. Also, S&amp;Ls are 
      investing a sizable proportion of money market certificates, 
      especially in bank CDs. Consequently, mortgage commitments are being 
      held back. One of the largest S&amp;Ls in the District reports a sizable 
      runoff in deposits during January, the second successive month 
      deposit flows have been below expectations. The association 
      attributed outflows to the 2-year Treasury bill they believe has  
      attracted interest because of the longer maturity than savings 
      certificates. Home builders in most parts of the District are said 
      to be cautious in their building plans in order to avoid repetition 
      of the 1972-1973 housing boom.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cleveland's financial prospects for 1979 remain uncertain as the 
      campaign on a referendum to raise taxes and to sell the municipal 
      light and power gets underway. Recent polls show for the first time 
      voter approval for both the 0.5 percent tax increase and the sale of 
      municipal light. However, growing fears that revenues will not be 
      sufficient to balance the budget or to deal with over $90 million in 
      accumulated debt has prompted State legislation that could lead to a 
      Yonkers-style plan to control the City's financial management. While 
      fighting off attempts at State controls, the City administration 
      continues to defer payment on employee pension funds and has stopped 
      construction projects because of a shortage of funds.
