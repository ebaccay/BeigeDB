      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The recession in the motor vehicle and residential sectors appears 
  to have deepened in the Seventh District with no early reversal in 
  sight. Some major unions have gone on strike over disputes involving 
  work scheduling and other problems not related to compensation 
  offers, which are substantial. Consumer purchases of durables, other 
  than vehicles, and luxury goods and services also have slowed. Sales 
  of some capital goods, including farm and construction equipment, 
  have turned down. Backlogs of many companies are said to be eroding, 
  while shipments remain strong. Most companies are attempting to 
  reduce inventories, but there is little evidence of serious gluts. 
  Price inflation continues with undiminished virulence. Record corn 
  and soybean crops have been harvested, but storage and
  transportation facilities are seriously inadequate. All classes of 
  lenders are tightening standards because of reduced inflows of 
  deposits and the high cost of purchased funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The overwhelming majority of consumers, business executives, and 
  lenders believe the nation is in a recession which will run well 
  into 1980. Many observers are puzzled by the strong performance of 
  government data on employment, retail sales, new orders, and "leading indicators." Nevertheless, there is virtually no evidence 
  of panic, such as occurred in late 1974.
       </p>
       <p>
        A surprising number of executives, even in S&amp;Ls, have publicly 
  supported the Fed's tougher policy stance even though they believe 
  painful adjustments lie ahead. However, builders, realtors, labor 
  leaders, and certain politicians are openly hostile.
       </p>
       <p>
        The deep and involved problems of Chrysler are unique among well-
  known companies headquartered in this District, insofar as we can 
  determine. Chrysler's difficulties are of concern to its suppliers 
  and dealers who employ more people than Chrysler itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        The slump that hit the auto and light truck industries early this 
  year shows no sign of abating. Sales of big cars were helped by 
  heavy rebates on 1979 models in August and September, probably at 
  the expense of 1980 models. Inventories of large cars and light 
  trucks remain excessive and new production cutbacks are announced 
  periodically. Deliveries of heavy trucks have begun to slide, and 
  new orders are far below factory shipments. Huge order backlogs are 
  reported for popular small cars, but many people are believed to 
  have placed multiple orders, and some have placed orders with a view 
  to immediate resale at a profit upon delivery. Under these 
  conditions some dealers refuse to quote expected delivery dates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite periodic scares, supplies of gasoline and diesel fuel appear 
  adequate currently. Demand for motor fuel continues well below year 
  ago. Reduced use of vehicles is associated with lower recreational 
  expenditures, and reduced demand for tires, parts, and maintenance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Deere labor pact covering 30,000, concluded after a three-week 
  strike, parallels the auto industry agreement. Wages will rise 36 
  percent in three years, assuming 8 percent additional per year for 
  COLA--more if the CPI increases at a faster pace. Workers also will 
  get 12 additional days off for a total of 46 paid days off annually. 
  Since late October, strikes have been in progress at Caterpillar 
  (40,000) and International Harvester (35,000). The main issues are 
  said to be grievance procedures at "Cat," and mandatory overtime at 
  I-H.
       </p>
       <p>
        Analysts believe these strikes, which affect suppliers of steel and 
  other items, will last for some time. Demand for the farm and 
  construction machinery, and heavy trucks made by these companies had 
  begun to decline in late summer. Production continued at a high 
  level in order to build inventories of finished goods as a 
  bargaining lever. A decline in output would have occurred whether or 
  not labor negotiations were concluded without a strike.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most capital goods producers continue to operate at high rates. The 
  Milwaukee area, which concentrates on capital goods, appears to be 
  the most prosperous of all large District centers. However, most 
  companies report order backlogs declining, particularly if allowance 
  is made for 10 percent inflation in the past 12 months. (We do not 
  hear reports of cancellations, such as occurred in late 1974.) 
  Slackening in the equipment sector is also suggested by a slump in 
  orders for heavy castings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Record crops of corn and soybeans are assured. Transportation and 
  storage facilities are stressed taut. Fitful service on the bankrupt 
  Rock Island and Milwaukee Road railroads, both vitally important to 
  Iowa, is being maintained with federal guarantees and court-ordered 
  expedient s. Motor transport is also strained. The bottleneck dam 
  and locks on the Mississippi near Alton impose a 4-day wait on barge 
  traffic moving South. Storage capacity for grain is full. Transport 
  and storage problems have resulted in a substantial adverse price 
  spread for grain held in the western portion of the District.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liquidity pressures on rural banks, apparent all year, intensified 
  in October. Interest rates are pressing against usury ceilings in 
  some states, especially in Iowa.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to our survey, District farmland values rose almost 6 
  percent in the third quarter, double the pace of the second quarter. 
  On October 1, prices averaged 17 percent above last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgage money has "dried up" throughout the District in the past 6 
  weeks, even in Indiana and Michigan where usury ceilings have not 
  been a problem. Because of outflows of funds, high borrowing costs, 
  and the temptation to keep funds in high-yield money market 
  instruments, lenders have cut new commitments to a trickle. But past 
  commitments are being honored. Some S&amp;Ls have stopped taking loan 
  applications entirely, while others have reduced activity by 
  restricting loans to customers, raising down payments, and lowering 
  loan maximums. Mortgage rates are at 13.5-14 percent in Michigan 
  where they are free to move. On November 8 Illinois suspended its 
  mortgage usury rate which had restricted loans to 11.5 percent for 
  November. The largest S&amp;L immediately announced rates of 13.5 to 
  13.75 percent, plus 2.5 to 3 points, with down payments of 25 to 35 
  percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing has been hit harder in the District than elsewhere. Permits 
  for single-family homes in the Chicago area were 59 percent below 
  last year in September, and down 51 percent for 9 months. The 
  situation is similar in other areas in the District. Transactions in 
  existing homes are very slow. People desperate to sell houses are 
  being counseled to use land contracts, a generally unfamiliar and 
  unpopular device. Housing in the District probably has been affected 
  more than in the nation because of the relative unimportance of 
  speculative building, lack of growth in many areas, and some exodus 
  of weaklings oppressed by three successive severe winters.
