      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District indicate a slowdown in general 
business activity for the month of November. Manufacturers in the 
District say industrial activity has dropped off quite a bit this 
month, but anticipate an upturn in the industrial sector by mid-1982. Local retail merchants report weak sales performance in 
November but are gearing up for a strong Christmas season. As for 
the new year, the current trend of weak sales is expected to 
continue with a slight pick up by next fall. In the financial 
sector, area bankers report sluggish loan activity. Consumer loans 
are down from a year ago, while C&amp;I; loan volume is slightly better, 
but still not strong. Looking ahead to May, Third District bankers 
expect modest increases in overall loan activity. On the residential 
construction scene, sales are off sharply again this month as high 
mortgage rates have discouraged many buyers. Contractors and 
developers are holding off on new groundbreakings until sales pick 
up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area manufacturing activity appears to have slowed quite a bit this 
month, according to the most recent Business Outlook Survey. About 
45 percent of the manufacturers polled in November say industrial 
business conditions are worse then they were in October, while only 
about 10 percent report improvement. In terms of specific 
indicators, new orders have dropped significantly, for the first 
time in three months, with shipments down also, but to a lesser 
degree. Hence, backlogs continue to shrink at over 40 percent of the 
firms surveyed, and a commensurate cut in inventories is noted. As 
for labor, the situation appears to have worsened, as nearly 40 
percent of the manufacturers surveyed report cuts in factory work 
forces and reductions in working hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, respondents to the survey are optimistic, predicting 
an upswing in general industrial activity by May. New orders and 
shipments are expected to show widespread improvement over the next 
six months, and, as production picks up, many manufacturers 
anticipate adding to their payrolls, lengthening the workweek, and 
increasing capital expenditures. Despite the anticipated strength, 
though, manufacturers plan to keep a lid on inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inflation continues in the local industrial sector in November, 
according to the survey, but price hikes are less prevalent this 
month than they've been in some time. Just over one-third of the 
respondents report paying higher input costs than they did in 
October, and only about one-tenth say they are charging more for 
their finished products. Manufacturers expect inflation to rekindle 
in the near future, however, as three-quarters of the respondents 
expect to be paying more for raw materials by May and nearly two-thirds plan to raise the prices of the goods they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail
Area retailers say sales are off to a weak start in November and 
little to no improvement is expected for the rest of the month. 
Currently, sales are running about 9 percent over November '80 
levels, in nominal terms. In efforts to boost their volumes, 
District merchants have run big promotional campaigns, but November 
sales are still below expectations. Local retailers attribute the 
sluggishness to, among other things, unseasonally mild weather which 
has discouraged consumers from buying heavy winter clothing. Credit 
card sales are up over last year and collections are slowing but 
remain good.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the future, Third District merchants are anticipating a 
strong Christmas season, but are somewhat bearish about 1982. Area 
merchants expect the current trend of weak sales to continue into 
the new year, projecting sales to increase by, at best, 3 1/2 to 5 
percent. As a Director of this Bank in the retail business notes, 
area merchants will have to fight hard for business through the 
spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories are healthy at this point, despite November's 
softness. Inventories are at peak levels now as area retailers gear 
up for a strong Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers report sluggish-to-mixed loan activity in 
November. Consumer loan volume is down by as much as 21 percent from 
last year's figures, mainly because banks continue to take a 
restrictive posture toward retail lending. Business loan volume is 
better but still not strong. C&amp;I loan activity is running between 8 
and 11 percent ahead of November 1980 levels. In attempts to bolster 
their commercial loan volume, some area bankers report a nominal 
amount of below-prime lending. For the most part, however, business 
borrowing remains in line with bankers' expectations. Consumer loan 
activity is well below budget. Looking ahead, contacts expect 
commercial loans to post only modest, if any, gains of up to 5 
percent over the next six months and retail loans are expected to 
pick up slightly as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of deposit flows in the Third District indicate that demand 
deposit levels are down about 11 percent from year ago figures. Time 
and saving deposits, on the other hand, are up slightly and 
generally as planned. Demand for all-savers certificates, introduced 
October 1, got off to a good start, but fell short of area bankers' 
projections. Demand for the certificates appears to be gaining 
momentum again though, as contacts note a slow, steady growth in 
their volumes. Of the money going into all-savers certificates, 35 
to 40 percent is estimated by bankers to be new.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 17 1/2 percent. 
Projections of the prime over the next six months are mixed; some 
Third District bankers expect the rate to drop by 150 to 250 basis 
points, while others anticipate a hike in the rate to 18 1/2 percent 
by May when they expect the recovery to be underway. On October 27, 
Philadelphia's First Pennsylvania Bank announced that it was raising 
the interest rate on MasterCard loans to 19.8 percent, 4.8 points 
above the legal limit in Pennsylvania. In making the move, the bank 
is relying on the "most favored lender" doctrine. Neither state nor 
federal regulators have indicated whether they will fight the move.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      November seasonal factors have combined with tight mortgage money to 
produce a further drop in housing sales this month, according to 
area real estate brokers. New residential sales are reported to be 
down 90 percent from November '80 figures, while resales have 
dropped by 50 percent. Prices are said to be softening, but mortgage 
rates of 18 to 19 1/2 percent have kept most buyers out of the 
market. Area contacts have cut their sales forces 15 to 20 percent 
and are beginning to put their own capital into their business, 
hoping to hold on until rates slide back down. In the meantime, 
contractors and developers are holding off on new groundbreakings 
until sales pickup.
