      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Most bankers and economists in the Fourth District believe that 
  October 6 policy changes have virtually ended prospects for a soft-landing and have increased prospects for a deeper than previously 
  anticipated recession. While the capital goods sector is still 
  experiencing backlogs, economists are concerned that the higher cost 
  of financing inventories will cause inventories and hence new orders 
  to be reduced. However, some abatement in inflation is expected in 
  1980. Banks have generally tightened credit and raised interest 
  rates for mortgage, installment and C&amp;I loans. The housing market is 
  now expected to be slow through the first half of 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 26 economists who attended the Fourth District Economists Round 
  Table meeting held at this Bank on November 9 generally agree that 
  the economy has already peaked. All but two expect a decline in real 
  GNP in the fourth quarter of 1979; the median forecast of the group 
  indicates a 2.1% decline in real GNP from the third quarter of 1979 
  through the third quarter of 1980, considerably deeper than they 
  expected last June. However, at least three scenarios emerged with 
  respect to the outlook. Despite weakening auto production to 9.7 
  million in 1980 compared to 10.4 in 1979, an auto industry economist 
  expects a brief, mild recession in the first half of 1980, followed 
  by a mild recovery in the second half. Mortgage markets have
  improved because of structural changes, inventories are more 
  tightly-controlled, and money stock growth will likely remain at 
  about the same rate as 1979. However, a bank economist feels that 
  classical business cycle adjustments will override the structural 
  changes. Thus, the need to rebuild savings and reduce debt levels as 
  employment declines will tend to weaken the recovery. Several 
  economists point out that stepped-up consumer spending during the 
  third quarter of 1979 to avoid higher prices may have been a form of 
  savings for consumers. Finally, an economist for a durable goods 
  producer expects a sharp recovery after mid-1980, based largely on a 
  350 basis point decline in short-term interest rates by spring 1980 
  and a substantial tax cut for businesses and consumers late next 
  year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto producers and suppliers have scaled down their estimates of 
  domestic car sales and production for this quarter and for 1980. A 
  group of eight economists now expects domestic new car sales this 
  quarter of about 2.1 million units and 8.1 million units next year. 
  Dealers claim carrying costs of new car inventories have jumped to 
  as high as $150 monthly per car, and assert that dealers will trim 
  stocks and orders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods producers continue to be relatively optimistic, with 
  one official in specialized machinery expecting backlogs to carry 
  plant and equipment expenditures through the first half of 1980. 
  However, a bank economist notes that nonresidential spending and 
  real nondefense orders have already peaked. An economist with a 
  transportation equipment firm considers the truck cycle to be in an 
  early contraction phase that will continue through the third quarter 
  of 1980, followed by a strong rebound in truck sales. Thus, the 
  recovery should be lead by capital expenditures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several economists state that businesses have pursued cautious 
  inventory policies and perceive little inventory problems, except 
  for automobile and auto-related industries. However, one major tire 
  producer reports no serious inventory accumulation either at the 
  plant or among its dealers. Steel inventories are believed to be 
  excessive, and one steel economist expects steel consumers will 
  begin to liquidate stocks this quarter and continue well into 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        While inflation continues at a strong pace in October, the median 
  forecast of the Fourth District Round Table economists shows a 
  decline in the GNP implicit price deflator from a 9.3% annual rate 
  in the fourth quarter of 1979 to a 8.0% annual rate in the fourth 
  quarter of 1980. One bank economist believes that interest rates and 
  inflation are at secular peaks. Several economists point to somewhat 
  larger productivity gains in 1980 to help offset increases in labor 
  costs. An agricultural economist expects food price increases to 
  slow in the first half of 1980, assuming no supply constraints, but 
  to rise sharply by the end of the year. Several economists expect 
  oil prices to rise sharply again in 1980, as a higher proportion of 
  world supplies is shifted to the spot market. A housing slowdown is 
  generally expected to provide relief for the home ownership 
  component of the CPI in 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing prospects have been scaled down as a result of October 
  changes in policy actions. While several S&amp;Ls in Ohio report little 
  change in lending policy other than higher mortgage lending rates, 
  the effect of credit rationing by price has substantially cut the 
  number of low downpayment loans and eliminated many potential buyers 
  from the market. In western Pennsylvania, many S&amp;Ls apparently 
  curtailed lending. Although most S&amp;Ls are expected to be able to 
  honor commitments already on the books, one S&amp;L economist expressed 
  concern about the shift of S&amp;Ls back to short-term markets for funds 
  which could become costly in the near future and could create 
  serious roll-over problems. Still, several S&amp;L officials report that 
  every attempt is being made to continue lending activity. Housing 
  starts, according to a FHLB economist in this District, are still 
  expected to reach their earliest forecasted level of 1.8 million in 
  1979 despite the latest surge in mortgage rates. However, starts may 
  fall to 1.3 or 1.5 million units in 1980, as net outflows of 
  deposits restrict the availability of funds to S&amp;Ls. If the market 
  is threatened by such steep declines, one S&amp;L economist expects FHLB 
  and other housing agencies to institute programs that will support 
  an additional 0.3 million starts in 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        District banks apparently have tightened lending activity, 
  especially among consumer and C&amp;I loans. One bank economist states 
  that large firms so far are unaffected by high interest rates and 
  some are taking advantage of rates by being net suppliers of funds. 
  However, middle-sized firms will be in serious trouble if high rates 
  continue for 6 to 9 months. Two large banks note a decline in C&amp;I 
  loans, which may be the result of anticipatory borrowing in previous 
  months. According to a capital goods producer, banks have showed 
  greater reluctance since October 6 to buy secured paper of small job 
  shops, which is making it difficult to finance machinery sales. Auto 
  dealers complain that banks have tightened credit terms and have 
  sharply curtailed lines of credit. Finally, some banks report that 
  the rejection rate for consumer loan applications has risen since 
  early October and new borrowers without much credit experience must 
  now obtain co-signers.
