      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The recovery is continuing in the Ninth District, although it no 
longer appears to be gaining momentum. With the harvest of major 
cash crops almost complete, farm earnings seem unlikely to slow the 
pace off the recovery. The strength of consumer spending is also 
consistent with continued recovery. The employment picture still 
looks good as well, and there is some scattered news of expansion in 
manufacturing and mining. However, no clear trend is evident in 
district financial activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For the most part, district agricultural conditions continue to 
promise healthy farm earnings. While corn may not contribute to 
earnings as much as previously thought, income from soybeans looks 
better than expected, and the outlook for wheat is also good. 
Livestock profits continue to suffer, but some improvement is 
anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The expected yield for corn in Minnesota was recently revised 
downward 9 percent because of corn borer and windstorm damage. This 
represents a loss of $132 million at current prices. Even though 
Minnesota's corn harvest is down about 45 percent from last year's 
level, corn still ranks as the state's largest cash crop and is 
expected to bring receipts of $1.35 billion. One reason for the 
reduced harvest, though, is the PIK (payment-in-kind) program, which 
will swell farm income. This will partially offset the losses due to 
the small harvest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Soybean yields in Minnesota and South Dakota are exceeding 
expectations, and prices remain good. Many Minnesota farmers are 
reporting yields well in excess of the previously forecast 31 
bushels per acre, and a Bank director reports that South Dakota 
yields are around 35 bushels per acre. Soybean prices are also 
strong, in part due to low crop output in much of the rest of the 
nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The wheat crop has been generally favorable in Montana and North 
Dakota. Bank directors report that the yields were good in eastern 
Montana and excellent around Bozeman. Wheat prices are generally 
running a little higher than last year in Montana. While the amount 
of wheat harvested in North Dakota was below the ten-year average, 
its protein content and overall quality were good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although livestock operators are continuing to be hurt by high corn 
costs and low cattle prices, they are expecting some improvement. 
The outlook for feeder cattle in Montana "may not necessarily be too 
bad," according to one Bank director. But livestock prices are still 
low. Reflecting these low prices, our recent survey of Ninth 
District rural bankers indicates that pasture and grazing land 
values fell 4 percent from March to September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending for general merchandise, motor vehicles, and 
housing appears to be maintaining the strength evident last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in the Ninth District seem to be holding firm. A 
prominent bank holding company economist states that "we've seen 
considerable strength, much stronger than the nation," in the Twin 
Cities retail scene. One large Twin Cities retailer reports 
September sales 23 percent higher than last September. Another big 
Twin Cities chain reports a 20 percent increase for this 12-month 
period, its "biggest increase in many years." Also Bank directors 
report brisk retail sales in the rest of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The district's motor vehicle sales are also strong. For one large 
domestic manufacturer, truck sales were 23 percent higher and auto 
sales 7 percent higher this September than last. Auto sales in South 
Dakota were up 15 percent over the sane period. bank directors 
report that auto sales are going well in Montana and are up in 
economically depressed Upper Michigan, too.
     </p>
     <p>
      While housing activity may have slackened from its torrid pace of 
earlier months, it remains better than a year ago. In August, 
residential building contracts in Minnesota nearly doubled; compared 
with last August. The Minneapolis Board of Realtors reports that 25 
percent more housing units were sold this September than1ast. But 
many homes. have been pulled off the Twin Cities market in recent 
weeks due to lack of demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While the evidence is mixed, the most recent statistics indicate 
that the district employment picture is stable. In August, Ninth 
District employment rose only slightly to a seasonally adjusted 3.12 
million, and the unemployment rate also rose a bit to 8.15 percent. 
However, a regional economist for a large area bank believes that 
the strike by 8,000 AT&amp;T workers could have accounted for the 
smallness of the employment increase. Minnesota unemployment claims 
rose substantially in August, but a state analyst believes that the 
seasonal adjustment was "so atypical it would throw everything off." 
The unemployment rates in North and South Dakota were only 4.2 
percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. The Sioux Falls SMSA recorded
an unemployment rate of 3.2 percent, which was the nation's lowest. 
However, some parts of the district continue to report problems. A 
large manufacturer in Upper Michigan recently announced a big 
layoff, and northern Minnesota's recovery lags behind the rest off 
the state's.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There are some signs of expansion in these vital sectors. The good 
news in Minnesota is Ford Motor Company's decision to increase 
employment by 270 workers soon and to spend $250 million expanding 
its St. Paul assembly plant, which will create another several 
hundred permanent jobs. Also, printing and writing paper 
manufacturing facilities in the district are currently running at 
100 percent capacity. While about half the plants in northern 
Minnesota are still inoperative, an iron pellet plant in that area 
is hiring back a large number of workers this month. Finally, 
although a Bank director finds that coal production was a little 
lower in Montana this August than last, he notes that oil and gas 
activity increased somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial sector activity is not moving strongly in either 
direction. District bank deposits and loans were down in September, 
but they appear to be rebounding in October. Our recent surrey of 
district rural bankers Indicates that in the third quarter the 
demand for new agricultural loans remained low to normal. It also 
indicates, however, that at the same time the demand for refinancing 
of existing ag loansâ€”though still somewhat above normalâ€”dropped 
sharply.
