     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Tenth District is reflecting the national 
downturn. Weakening sales have led retailers to trim inventories. 
Inventory control is apparently even more of a problem for 
manufacturers, who are reducing input orders and production. There 
is no sign of a revival in homebuilding or house sales, although 
inflows to thrift institutions have improved slightly. Livestock 
prices may increase somewhat later in the year and thus improve 
income prospects in the farm sector. Loan demand at commercial banks 
is generally weak, as is deposit growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers contacted in this month's survey report that total 
dollar sales through May 1980 are somewhat better than in the first 
five months of 1979, but are slowing somewhat in the more recent 
months. Sales of furniture and appliances are particularly weak. 
Costs are continuing to increase for all types of merchandise, and 
at an increasing rate. The latest cost increases are expected to 
push up retail prices as retailers try to maintain markups. While 
most retailers indicate that current inventory levels are 
satisfactory, all retailers report that they have been trimming 
inventory levels slightly due to softening sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Half the purchasing agents contacted report an easing off of input 
price increases in recent months, and over two-thirds believe this 
trend will continue as the year progresses. Lead times for most 
inputs have been declining, and are expected to remain shorter than 
usual in the coming months. About half the purchasing agents 
indicate that inventory buildup has become a problem and they plan 
to reduce their orders to compensate. Most firms contacted have 
excess plant capacity, and over half have idled some workers. About 
one-third of the companies have recently cut back on their plant and 
equipment expenditure plans due to slumping product demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District homebuilders' associations indicate that housing 
starts are down more than 50 per cent compared to last year, with 
single-family starts leading the decline. There is no sign of a 
revival in homebuilding or house sales reported. Many association 
spokesmen believe that potential home buyers are waiting for 
mortgage rates to fall below 12 per cent before buying. They also 
report that inventory of unsold homes is not critically high, due to 
the unusually low number of completions, and that home prices are 
holding steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of savings and loan associations contacted report 
improved savings inflows in May of this year compared to May 1979 
and compared to the first quarter of this year. Most savings and 
loans expect to see only slight improvement in savings inflows for 
the remainder of 1980. While some noted that demand for mortgage 
funds has picked up recently, others indicate that demand remains at 
very low levels. Currently quoted rates on conventional mortgage 
loans range from 12 to 12.5 per cent with all District savings and 
loans expecting rates to drop the rest of the year to between 11 and 
11.5 per cent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Beef supplies will continue to remain tight and the cattle price 
outlook is beginning to look more optimistic. The numbers of cattle 
and calves on feed in seven states were the lowest on any June 1 
since 1975 and 11 per cent below the level of one year earlier. May 
marketings of fed cattle were the lowest since 1975. Additionally, 
May placements of cattle on feed were off 13 per cent from levels of 
one year earlier indicating continued tightness in the future supply 
situation. Cattle prices may continue to increase somewhat 
throughout the summer due to the reduction in beef supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District hog producers are facing grim prospects for 
profitability in 1980. But hog prices have improved in recent weeks 
and some price improvement is expected during the remainder of this 
year. The hog and pig inventory on June 1 was the largest on record, 
and producers are cutting back on production. A reduction in 
breeding stock along with lower farrowings should help reduce pork 
supplies and bolster prices towards the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm machinery and equipment sales throughout most of the Tenth 
District improved somewhat during May, with slightly more 
improvement expected during June. The improvement is apparently due 
mainly to various manufacturers' programs including cash rebates, 
waivers of finance charges for up to 1 year, and agreements to 
finance purchases at some percentage rate below the prime lending 
rate. Area bankers report that they are receiving little demand for 
machinery loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand in the Tenth District is generally weak. High lending 
rates and a weakening economy appear to have resulted in a general 
decline in the demand for commercial and industrial loans as well as 
consumer loans. The demand for real estate loans, while still 
generally weak, has been strengthening in some parts of the 
District. Some bankers also report that some customers are 
experiencing economic difficulties and several bankers feel that 
some of their local auto dealers are facing bankruptcy.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the past month, the prime rate in the District has declined from 
the 17 to 18 per cent range to the 12 to 13 per cent range. Nonprice 
lending terms generally remain unchanged. Most bankers report that 
their deposits are either flat or growing slightly. For the first 
time in many months, demand deposit growth appears to be in line 
with the growth of other deposit liabilities. However, no deposit 
category is showing any exceptional strength.
