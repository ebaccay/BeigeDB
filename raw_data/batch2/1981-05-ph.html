      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 13, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District in May are that business remains 
sluggish to mixed. In the industrial sector, area manufacturers 
report a few signs of expansion this month but, for the most part, 
overall manufacturing activity has remained basically unchanged. 
Local manufacturers anticipate widespread pick-ups in general 
activity within the next six months, though. Area retailers report 
sales up over year-ago figures, rebounding in May from the losses 
suffered last month owing to a mass transit strike in Philadelphia. 
Contacts forecast marginal increases in their sale volumes within 
the next six months but no "boom" in sales is expected. Third 
District bankers report mixed loan activity in May as C&amp;I loan 
volume is up but consumer loans are off by as much as 16 percent. 
Looking ahead to the next six months, business loans are expected to 
increase slightly and retail loans to remain flat. On the 
residential construction scene, sales are mixed. New residential 
sales are running about even with May '80 levels, while resale 
volumes have dropped as much as 50 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers responding to the May Business Outlook 
Survey say that although the local industrial sector showed a few 
signs of expansion this month, manufacturing activity remained 
basically unchanged, continuing a trend that started in January. 
Shipments are up slightly in May and inventories, after six months 
of holding steady, have increased marginally this month as well. New 
order levels, on the other hand, are about where they were in April. 
On the employment front, the situation remains unchanged from last 
month with no expansion in either payrolls or the average workweek 
reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the future, survey respondents are predicting widespread 
pick-ups in general industrial activity within the next six months. 
New orders and shipments are expected to take off between now and 
November, and, as production picks-up, area manufacturers plan to 
make some additions to inventories. Labor stands to gain from such 
optimism, as survey respondents plan to lengthen the average 
workweek and hire new employees within the next six months. 
Increased capital expenditures are also forecast.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area industrial prices are up again in May as 70 percent of the 
survey respondents report paying more for raw materials than they 
did last month, and about one-half say they are charging more for 
their finished products. Local manufacturers expect inflation to 
continue over the next six months as nearly 9 out of 10 respondents 
anticipate higher input costs by November and nearly 8 out of 10 are 
planning price hikes for the goods they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have bounced back in the Third District in May from the 
losses suffered last month owing to a mass transit strike in 
Philadelphia. A new contract agreement for the Transport Workers 
Union was ratified on April 10, ending a 26-day walkout. According 
to area merchants, May sales are doing well compared to year-ago 
figures, up 10 to 20 percent. The Easter shopping season was longer 
this year and big promotional campaigns helped to bring in more 
business. Credit card sales in May are 3 to 4 percent above year-ago 
figures, accounting for over one-half of total sales this month. One 
major area retail chain is starting to accept VISA and Master 
Charge, thus giving their credit sales an added boost. Sales of soft
goodsâ€”apparel and small household itemsâ€”continue to be strong, with 
big ticket items remaining sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead to the next six months, local merchants expect the 
current trend of strong sales to continue but are planning 
cautiously. Contacts project sales over the period to run only 
slightly ahead of last year's levels, about 4 to 7 percent. 
According to one spokesman, the first quarter of 1981 was strong and 
the second quarter should be better, but no "boom" in sales is 
expected. Inventories remain in-line with no changes in stock levels 
planned, as retailers hope to keep inventory-sales ratios healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area bankers report mixed loan activity in May. C&amp;I loan volume is 
up 1 to 6 percent over year-ago figures, slightly off budget for the 
most part. Consumer loans, however, are off as much as 16 percent in 
May, generally below budget. Local bankers say they are holding off 
pushing consumers loans until the rates come down a bit and their 
marketing efforts might prove fruitful. For the longer term, area 
bankers say they are not too optimistic about the next six months. 
Their forecasts, therefore, are on the conservative side. Commercial 
loans are projected to increase slightly, 3 to 4 percent, by 
November and consumer loans to remain flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of deposit flows in the Third District are mixed. Demand 
deposit levels range between 4 percent below to 2 percent above 
year-ago levels, savings and time deposits 4 percent below to 5 
percent above May '80 figures. Contacts blame the lackluster 
performance on the fact that many customers are putting their money 
into 26-week certificates and money-market funds in order to get a 
higher return on their money.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 19 
percent. Projections of the prime indicate an expected drop in the 
rate, leaving it about 200 basis points below the current level by 
November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing sales in the Third District remain sluggish in May. New 
residential sales are running about even with last year's levels, 
while resale volumes are off by as much as 50 percent. In downtown 
Philadelphia, though, condominiums and townhouses appear to be doing 
well. Prices are reported to have been stable over the last few 
months, but as construction costs rise many brokers expect the price 
of new homes to go up as well. Mortgage money is available if, as 
one contact put it, "the borrower is willing to pay the price." 
Current mortgage rates are running 15 3/4 to 16 1/2 percent. Area 
brokers say if mortgage rates drop to 13 1/2 percent, their sales 
would increase by almost one-half of their current volume and starts
would pick up as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The United Mine Workers (TJMW) walked out on March 27 after their 
old contract with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association expired. 
So far, railroad transportation is the only major industry of the 
economy to feel the strike's pinch. Steady declines in coal traffic 
have resulted in employee layoffs at Conrail, the highly publicized 
Philadelphia-based railroad. Coal represents about one-fifth of 
Conrail's total shipments. Since the UMW strike began, Conrail has 
furloughed 1,400 workers throughout the system.
     </p>
     <p>
      In New Jersey, residents could face power blackouts this summer if 
the UMW strike continues into July. Electric utilities there report 
having only a 60-day supply of coal remaining. South Jersey's power 
problems have been compounded by increased tourism in the Atlantic 
City area, since casino gambling was legalized in 1978. Officials 
are predicting a record-breaking number of visitors to the shore 
this summer, requiring a large amount of electrical power. Spokesmen 
for the utilities say they will face some supply difficulties even 
if the strike ends soon. To prevent blackouts, utility officials are 
urging customers to conserve energy and industrial users to cut down 
on non-essential use.
