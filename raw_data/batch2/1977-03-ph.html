      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic activity in the Third District is mixed. Reports on 
    department store sales are uneven, but activity in manufacturing 
    clearly is expanding. New orders and shipments are higher this month 
    while inventories are unchanged. At the same time, both employment 
    and the workweek are expanding for the first time since last summer. 
    The impact of the natural gas shortage on production in 
    manufacturing appears to have been moderate, and prospects for 
    making up shortfalls in output are good. Both retailers and 
    manufacturers are optimistic for the longer term. Bankers say that 
    business loan demand remains flat and they look for no substantial 
    increase through this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers responding to the latest Business Outlook Survey 
    report substantial improvement over last month. One-half say that 
    business is better this month compared to one-third reporting 
    improvement in February. Increases in new orders are reported by 
    almost one-half of the respondents and a similar proportion report 
    increases in shipments. Last month, new orders and shipments had 
    increased at one-third of the firms surveyed. Inventories show no 
    change after declining in February.
       </p>
       <p>
        This improvement in the manufacturing sector is evident in 
    employment. One-fourth of the businessmen surveyed report increases 
    in work forces and one-fifth report some lengthening of the 
    workweek. This is the first time since last summer that concurrent 
    increases in work forces and the average workweek have been 
    reported.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the longer term, manufacturers look for additional expansion. 
    Eight out of 10 foresee a better business climate by September. New 
    orders are expected to climb at 82 percent of the firms surveyed and 
    shipments are expected to increase at 74 percent. At the same time, 
    higher levels of inventories are projected, and further improvement 
    in employment is anticipated. One-half of the respondents plan to 
    hire additional employees while 42 percent foresee a longer 
    workweek. Increases in spending for plant and equipment six months 
    ahead are projected at 45 percent of the firms polled-- about the 
    same as last month.
       </p>
       <p>
        A special survey was conducted to examine the impact of the natural 
    gas shortage on industrial production. Out of 31 respondents, 17 say 
    that production levels were not affected by the shortage. Five of 
    these firms do not use natural gas while 12 were able to switch to 
    alternative fuels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of the 14 firms affected, mostly in primary metals and food 
    products, disruption of normal activity was apparently moderate. 
    Output levels were reduced by no more than 10 percent below normal 
    at six of the firms affected and were between 10 percent and 25 
    percent below normal at four of the 14 firms. Nine respondents say 
    that employment was reduced as a result and working hours were 
    shortened at 10 of the affected companies. Only two firms reported 
    complete shutdowns, and one of these was for one week only.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the respondents, prospects for making up production 
    shortfalls within the next six months are good. Eleven of the 
    respondents plan to make up one-half or more of the output lost with 
    five of these planning to recover the entire amount. Two firms 
    expect to make up only one-fourth of their shortfall, and one firm 
    plans no catch-up. However, output at this firm was no more than 10 
    percent below normal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prices in manufacturing continue to increase and higher prices for 
    finished products are more widespread. Forty-seven percent of the 
    respondents report higher prices for supplies this month while 34 
    percent report higher prices for their finished products. Last 
    month, the same proportion indicated higher input prices while only 
    16 percent indicated higher output prices. By September, 84 percent 
    look for higher prices for supplies and 71 percent foresee higher 
    prices for their outputs. Both of these are about 10 percentage 
    points below the proportions expecting increases six months out in 
    February.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers in the area give varied reports on department store sales 
    in February. One says that sales were good early in the month but 
    tapered off more than expected. Another labels performance as 
"disastrous" and feels that a newspaper strike, which limited his 
    store's advertising, was an important factor. However, two other 
    area merchants are pleased with recent sales. One of these notes 
    that February balanced out a poor January, and as a result, he is 
    more bullish in his outlook for the rest of the year. Contacts are 
    looking for improved sales in March and are "cautiously optimistic" 
    about the spring in general. Inventories are reported to be in "good 
    shape." Bankers in the area report that business loan demand is flat. One 
    says that corporate treasurers are showing more interest in terms 
    and conditions on loans, but he doesn't expect much of an increase 
    in actual volume in the near term. Another banker notes increased 
    opportunities to participate in fixed-rate, term loans, but adds 
    that the reaction at his bank has been passive thus far. Some pickup 
    in business loan demand is projected in the second half of this 
    year, but no substantial increase is expected. Two of the bankers 
    contacted look for business loan volume by the end of '77 to be 5 
    percent above year-end '76 levels. Bankers report no visible effects 
    on customers' borrowing plans or ability to repay loans as a result 
    of the natural gas shortage.
