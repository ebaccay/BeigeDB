      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 31, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity and inflation remain strong in the Kansas City 
  District. Purchasing agents report that input prices are rising at a 
  7 to 10 per cent rate and that they are beginning to encounter some 
  input availability problems. Fourth quarter retail sales were very 
  strong, but retailers expect some softening in upcoming months. 
  Financial conditions in the agricultural sector continue to improve 
  with the uptrend in farm prices, especially for livestock. The 
  recent improvement in farm cash flows has been reflected in better 
  liquidity positions at rural banks. Loan demand is reported to be 
  fairly strong throughout the District, and bankers are not expecting 
  any decline in interest rates before mid-1979.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District purchasing agents expect the prices of most major 
  inputs to continue rising in 1979 at approximately the same 7 to 10 
  per cent rate experienced during 1978. The prices of steel and 
  plastics have grown particularly rapidly during the past three 
  months. Lead times have been lengthening in nearly all industries 
  contacted, creating availability problems for some inputs. For 
  example, tools for the small aircraft industry are reported in 
  extremely short supply and the agricultural machinery industry is 
  finding steel difficult to obtain. No labor supply problems are 
  reported, except in the small aircraft industry where there is a 
  serious shortage of skilled workers. The agricultural equipment, 
  machinery and rubber products industries are operating at nearly 
  full capacity. Present levels of input inventories are satisfactory 
  for nearly all industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers report that sales have been strong in recent months, and 
  extremely good in December. Clothing, toys, and electronic games 
  have been big sellers while fabrics and home decorations have been 
  unusually weak. Despite strong fourth quarter performance, business 
  activity is expected to slacken in 1979. Most retailers contacted 
  predict that sales in the first half of 1979 will be but 7 to 10 per 
  cent above those in the first half of 1978, before adjustment for 
  inflation. Though inventories are currently viewed as being at 
  satisfactory levels, many retailers plan some reductions by spring 
  in anticipation of the slowdown in sales growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirm that 
  meat supplies for 1979 will probably exceed 1978 levels by a small 
  margin, with beef production declining and pork and poultry 
  production rising. The prospects for larger pork supplies-
  particularly during the second half of 1979-may dampen some of the 
  upward price pressures in the cattle industry. Production levels for 
  corn and soybeans in 1978 were recently revised upward, adding 
  further to the abundant supplies available for 1978-79. Unless 1979 
  production levels are greatly reduced-an unlikely event based on the 
  planting intentions report-crop prices could weaken substantially 
  during the second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      One Bank director, who has consistently expressed concern about the 
  agricultural situation over the last two years, now feels that most 
  farmers are satisfying their cash-flow requirements. He observes 
  that consumers do not now seem to be resisting rising meat prices, 
  but wonders how much longer this situation will last. He believes 
  that the credit needs of farmers are generally being met by the 
  banking community, although the impact of rising interest rates on 
  farm cash flows is causing some concern. Money is now readily 
  available for livestock loans, but bankers are scrutinizing their 
  other agricultural loan requests quite closely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural credit conditions in the District continue to show 
  improvement. Relative to a year ago, loan demand seems to have 
  tapered off, fund availability has increased, and farmers have 
  improved their repayment performance. Moreover, loan-deposit ratios 
  at rural banks declined slightly in the fourth quarter-but they are 
  still somewhat above year-earlier levels. The average ratio as of 
  January 1, 1979, was 62.2 per cent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District bankers report widely varying experience in deposit 
  growth since mid-December, with the most common response being that 
  deposit growth has been lower than during most of 1978. Money market 
  CD's have continued to grow strongly, but there has been some 
  weakness in both savings deposits and IPC demand deposits. Bankers 
  express the view that ATS accounts will continue to grow in 1979, 
  although the initial growth spurt in these accounts is over. With 
  the exception of one Omaha bank, there are no plans to extensively 
  promote ATS accounts in the early part of 1979.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand is reported to be moderately strong, although several 
  bankers suggest that it has been slightly weaker than a year 
  earlier. Most banks report that loan-deposit ratios are about at the 
  desired level, but several banks that have recently experienced weak 
  deposit growth find themselves with slightly higher ratios than 
  would be preferred. One Kansas City bank reports that it is planning 
  to tighten nonprice terms on consumer loans, and several banks 
  report slightly more restrictive lending policies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers' expectations as to interest rates are fairly evenly divided 
  between those who think that interest rates are now at or near their 
  peak and those who expect some additional increases in short-term 
  rates. There is general agreement that rates will show little 
  decline before mid-1979.
