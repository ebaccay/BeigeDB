      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      According to this month's district reports, economic activity in the 
nation remains mixed. Agriculture probably offers the most 
consistent observations, with most districts indicating bright 
prospects for crop yields and farm prices later in 1981. The 
construction industry is in the doldrums for the most part, with 
residential building still not showing any real life, and commercial 
construction beginning to lose its momentum. Manufacturing remains 
soft in many areas, but reports from Minneapolis and Dallas hold 
some hope for the industrial sector. Factory inventories are 
generally in good shape. Retail trade is one of the brightest spots 
on the economic horizon at this time, with sales running well ahead 
of the June 1980 levels in most districts, and ahead of most 
projections as well. Auto sales remain a blemish, though. Financial 
institutions continue to show very little, if any, loan growth and 
are experiencing deposit flow problems as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The prospects for agriculture have brightened somewhat 
across the nation. Excessive rains in parts of the Midwest have 
subsided, and although plantings of corn, cotton, and soybeans are 
behind schedule, normal yields are projected. Other parts of the 
nation, suffering from drought conditions earlier this year, also 
got some relief in recent weeks, improving the outlook for farmers 
in those areas too. In particular, a record crop of winter wheat is 
forecast, despite previous frost and drought damage. Farm prices are 
generally depressed at this time. Some recent strengthening has been 
noted in Atlanta, though, and is expected in most other districts as 
well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Every district reporting on residential construction 
tells the same story in July-very little activity, owing primarily 
to high mortgage rates. Creative financing appears to be offering 
very little help to the sagging homebuilding industry, with many 
institutions offering VRMs, GPMs, VMMs, etc., but few potential 
homebuyers accepting the new instruments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction is generally stronger than residential, but 
it too has started to show some signs of tailing off. Commercial 
building continues to move at a good clip in Atlanta, Minneapolis, 
and Dallas, but has started to soften in Chicago, St. Louis, and San 
Francisco. High rates are said to be responsible in part for the 
dropback. Many of the projects already in progress when credit 
conditions were initially tightened are now reaching completion but 
are not being replaced with new ones, as developers are scared off 
by high financing charges and economic uncertainty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial activity is mixed in July. While 
Minneapolis and Dallas report improvement in the manufacturing 
sector, some production cutbacks are reported in Boston and Chicago. 
New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis all indicate little 
or no change in factory activity in those areas. Both Boston and New 
York say there has been little interest on the part of manufacturers 
to increase plant and equipment outlays. Manufacturers' inventories 
are generally "in line" to "a little tight," except in St. Louis 
where some curtailment of production is planned to reduce excessive 
stock levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending on general merchandise is reported 
to be quite strong in most districts, with sales outpacing both 
year-ago levels and expectations as well. The exceptions are in St. 
Louis, where sales are up in nominal terms but flat after adjusting 
for inflation, and in San Francisco where "a rather widespread and 
substantial weakening in consumer spending" is noted. Part of the 
unexpected strength is a result of heavy promotions, mentioned in a 
number of district reports. Growing consumer confidence, as 
evidenced by a pickup in recent credit sales, and the anticipation 
of a tax cut are also cited as explanatory factors, however. As for 
the future, most retailers are projecting a strong finish for 1981, 
with perhaps only a temporary slackening in the third quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are almost universally very, very soft. Sales in many 
districts are only slightly ahead of last year's depressed levels, 
remaining well below the prosperous volume of 1978.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand is variously described as "flat," "sluggish," 
and "weak" across the country, as both consumers and businessmen 
appear to have trimmed borrowing to the bone. The prime rate ranges 
from 19 1/2 to 20 1/2 percent. Bankers have tried to bolster 
borrowing with a variety of floating rate schemes, as noted by New 
York, but apparently without much success.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flow problems are mentioned in a number of reports and seem 
to be especially acute in the Twelfth District where there has been 
an increased call for legislative action allowing thrifts and banks 
to more effectively compete with money market funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A fair amount of strength in the services related to 
tourism is implied in the district reports from Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis and Minneapolis. Summer tourist trade is picking up in 
those areas, aided by adequate gasoline supplies and some recent 
softening in gasoline prices, and has been giving tourist-related 
retail sales a boost. An exception is noted by Atlanta. In South 
Florida, the usual wave of foreign tourists has been checked a bit 
by recessionary conditions in Europe, a stronger American dollar, 
and some political unrest in nearby Central America.
