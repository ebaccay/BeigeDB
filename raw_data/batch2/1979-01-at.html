      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 31, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        A surge in consumer spending seems to have improved businessmen's 
    attitudes and brought retail inventories under better control, but 
    activity in most other sectors has been waning. Both loans and 
    deposits have grown slowly. The easing of housing markets continues, 
    and recent nonresidential construction news has been less upbeat. 
    Current and prospective job growth is lackluster. Industrial output 
    levels are generally holding strong, with perhaps some increase in 
    stocks. Agricultural prices remain on an uptrend.
       </p>
       <p>
        A late December spurt in consumer spending allowed merchants 
      throughout the District to equal or exceed 1977's sales records and 
      reduced their inventories almost to desired levels. Since Christmas, 
      markdowns and promotions have been only slightly heavier than usual 
      and sales have continued good. Big-ticket expenditures have been 
      described as growing slowly in some areas; brisk demands for luxury 
      items, home furnishings, and small appliances have been noted in 
      others. Some banks, but few retailers, have noted an upward drift in 
      consumer loan delinquencies, although these have largely proved 
      collectible. One Birmingham banker reported that local credit card 
      sales have fallen below the year-earlier level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto sales reports have been mixed but generally point to weakness 
      in the new car market. Sales of trucks and used cars remain very 
      strong. Auto stocks appear to be relatively light, with dealers 
      complaining loudly about the high cost of inventory financing and 
      floor planning. A few are offering discounts to customers who order 
      from the factory.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recent unexpected strength in the national economy and the 
      pickup in southeastern consumer spending appear to have ameliorated 
      businessmen's expectations. Many still look for recession later this 
      year but anticipate it to be mild and consider the economy in good 
      shape to weather it. Most believe that their own areas or businesses 
      will fare better through any slowdown than will the nation as a 
      whole. Retailers are less anxious about prospects than they were in 
      early December but remain among the most pessimistic respondents. 
      Bankers, too, look to 1979 with caution; the fast food industry is 
      expecting real trouble from rising beef prices, wages and utility 
      costs, and higher unemployment among their teen-aged customers. 
      Contractors hope that home repair business can take up the slack 
      left by a housing slowdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bank lending has turned unexpectedly sluggish; tightening of loan 
      terms and credit standards has been widespread across loan types, 
      lenders, and locations. Deposit growth has been largely confined to 
      money market certificates; at both banks and thrifts, passbook 
      savings inflows have been weak or negative. One director commented 
      on the "amazing speed" of shifts from passbook accounts to six-month 
      certificates. Most S&amp;Ls have felt obliged to continue to offer these 
      at ceiling rates, but a significant amount of these funds are being 
      channeled into the money, rather than housing, markets. Tennessee's 
      financial institutions are facing rather dismal prospects, possibly 
      a state credit crunch, if the legislature fails to liberalize the 
      usury ceiling this year. The majority of our contacts in that state 
      expect the pending bill to pass, however.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the exceptions of south Florida, northeast Tennessee, and some 
      spots along the Gulf coast, all areas of the District have now noted 
      some slowdown in residential construction and real estate sales. 
      While some sources indicate that rising prices and financing costs 
      have reduced housing demand, others claim that the availability of 
      money is the effective restraint, with mortgage applications still 
      rising. Unsold stocks are reported to be low, albeit increasing in 
      some places. Expectations of a substantial slowdown in 1979 are 
      widespread but not universal—some Florida analysts are counting on 
      continued in-migration to keep residential markets at near-boom 
      activity levels in that state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the heavy backlog of contract work and reports that businesses 
      intend to go ahead with planned capital spending, nonresidential 
      construction should continue to grow moderately through 1979. But 
      the plant announcements of the last few weeks, though steady in 
      number, have been primarily for small- to medium-sized projects. The 
      potential for expansion of office and warehouse facilities may not 
      be realized because of zoning restrictions, stringent financial 
      market conditions, or the failure of rents to keep pace with 
      operating expenses, say realtors in two major cities.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've seen signs of slower job growth in the latest weeks, including 
      a sizable round of layoffs. In response to a denial of a requested 
      rate increase, Alabama Power has cut its work force but not by as 
      much as it threatened. Ingalls Shipyard continues its gradual, 
      large-scale staff reductions. Retailers anticipate some clerical 
      layoffs with the raising of the minimum wage. However, labor 
      supplies are still characterized as tight in some industries, 
      notably paper and shipping.
       </p>
       <p>
        Production levels remain high in most nonautomotive manufacturing 
      plants. Steel output is brisk, with a heavy backlog of orders, 
      though there appears to be some inventory overhang in the industry 
      and Jacksonville Port's steel import volume has been strong. A paper 
      plant has announced its closing, but generally, production volume is 
      good; transactions prices are rising but not as rapidly as list. 
      Phosphate producers are reported to stockpiling their products in 
      anticipation of higher prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Farm product prices continue to advance, led by beef. Damage to 
      Florida's citrus crops from an early January freeze was mainly 
      confined to leaf burn. Harvesting has been stepped up; the earlier 
      California freeze has boosted demand for the Florida fruit. Support 
      for and participation in the recent tractorcade was rather thin.
