     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence is increasing that some of worst hit consumer sectors will 
level off or improve moderately in the third quarter. Capital goods, 
however, are weakening on a broad front. Consumer and bus mess 
borrowing activities are assuming more normal patterns. Price 
cutting is common in wholesale markets. Housing transactions are 
picking up. Farm income prospects have improved with higher prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sectors that appear to have touched bottom in May, June, or July 
include retail sales of general merchandise, passenger cars and 
light trucks, RVs, manufactured housing, gypsum board, cement, and 
steel. In no case, however, has a dramatic reversal occurred. Also, 
the improvements are largely associated with the consumer sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most business managements are pushing stringent programs to cut 
costs to a point that may impair their ability to respond to 
increases in final demand later in the year. Cost-cutting measures 
include layoffs (even of valued, experienced people), hiring 
freezes, short weeks, suspension of COLAs and various nonwage 
benefits, halting contributions to pension funds, paring of 
inventories (even to the point that standard items are not stocked), 
using only the most efficient equipment, deferral of all but the 
most essential maintenance and repair, and delaying payments of 
bills. Clearly, these measures will adversely affect long-term 
competitive strength, but they are undertaken in a spirit of quiet 
desperation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Complaints of slow pay on outstanding debts by both businesses and 
consumers are widespread. Actual inability to pay on time is 
responsible in some cases, but more commonly debtors are attempting 
to avoid interest costs by shifting the burden to their suppliers. 
Delinquencies on consumer credits have increased significantly, but 
are still not at the high level of 1975. Personal bankruptcies are 
becoming a much more serious problem, partly because of the new law. 
Businesses complain of a surge in bad checks, and a rise in 
shoplifting (already historically high). Bank robberies in the 
Chicago area have tripled from last year's rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales appear to have improved moderately since the May low. 
Consumers continue to buy cautiously and tend to patronize discount 
stores. (If K-Mart sales increase relative to Sears at the rate of 
the past 12 months, K-Mart will be the nation's top retailer a year 
hence.) Some old-line chains are expanding their discount type 
operations to meet competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicle dealerships, small builders, and trucking companies continue 
to close their operations, some filing for bankruptcy, in numbers 
unknown since the early 1930s. Dealership closings, many large and 
long-established, will have far-reaching consequences. Not only are 
numerous employees involved, but a healthy dealer organization is 
essential for mass marketing of new and used vehicles and for 
servicing new cars under warranty. High interest costs for carrying 
inventories of slow-selling models have been a large factor in the 
dealer crisis. Captive finance companies have stretched their 
resources to help stronger dealers to survive. Dealer mergers have 
been tolerated and even encouraged by manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      With short lead times and unused capacity in virtually all lines, 
price-cutting is common in wholesale markets, including steel, 
nonferrous metals, and cement. Vendors are ready to negotiate prices 
on such items as office equipment and heavy trucks. Such concessions 
are thought to be a temporary reaction to weak markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel shipments are believed to have reached a low point at about 50 
percent of capacity around midyear, down from 83 percent in April. 
Since then, there has been a slight uptrend. A smaller Chicago steel 
company has closed permanently. One of the largest Chicago-area 
mills is operating only one of six blast furnaces. Customer 
inventories of steel are said to be "extremely low," and any 
strengthening of final demand must quickly be reflected in orders 
for steel.
     </p>
     <p>
      The farm and construction equipment industries continue in a slump, 
but there are hopes that demand will revive with the prospective 
improvements in farm income and residential construction. Demand for 
heavy trucks remains very weak. Order backlogs for rail cars are 
eroding. Since March, demand for capital goods has been slipping on 
a broad front. Notable exceptions are metal-cutting machine tools, 
and items related to oil and gas well drilling. A producer of large 
castings is operating at only 50 percent of capacity and demand for 
forgings, in tight supply a few months ago, has dropped sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home mortgage lending has picked up with rates in the 11-12 percent 
range plus 2-3 points. Housing starts remain at a postwar low for 
the summer months, but the unsold inventory is small and some rise 
in starts is seen before year end. Several large commercial 
buildings nearing completion in Chicago's Loop area are virtually 
100 percent leased. Starts on several additional large commercial 
buildings will occur in the fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm income prospects improve as crop prices rise substantially in 
response to growing evidence that harvests will be affected 
adversely by weather-related damage. Crops look good in most of the 
Cornbelt, but pollination problems apparently will reduce yields. 
Hot weather also has adversely affected prospective meat supplies 
because of increased mortality, mainly of chickens, and poor weight 
gains for hogs and cattle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand at rural banks in the district continues soft. Partly, 
this reflects lagging declines in the interest rates they charge. At 
midyear rates on farm loans averaged about 14 percent, down only 3 
points from the end of the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our survey of farmland values shows an average decline of 2 percent 
in the second quarter which followed a similar decline in the first 
quarter. Values still averaged about 3 percent over the year-ago 
level.
