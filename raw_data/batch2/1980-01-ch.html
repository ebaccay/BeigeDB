      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 29, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Seventh District has been affected more than the nation by the 
slowing in activity. Further deterioration is expected. Output and 
sales of motor vehicles and recreational goods remain weak with no 
reversal in sight. Capital goods production, overall, probably has 
passed its peak. Wage settlements have been generous. Price 
inflation has not moderated, except for temporary bargains on items 
in excess supply. Except for depressed sectors, inventories are of 
moderate size in both manufacturing and retailing. The grain embargo 
has not had the adverse effect on prices that had been feared. 
Although mortgage terms have eased, the drop in the housing sector 
is still underway. Credit remains available, but at high rates, and 
with more careful screening of applicants. The crisis in Chicago's
municipal finances appears more serious as additional information is 
forthcoming.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although most of the information presented in this report is 
negative, total output, employment, and sales remain at high levels. 
Virtually nobody expects a broad, deep recession. Large order 
backlogs in some industries and a heavy volume of contracts for 
nonresidential construction will keep activity at high levels in 
these sectors into the second half of 1980. Moreover, except for a 
widely publicized case, there is little evidence of defaults on 
loans or other commitments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing managers in both Chicago and Milwaukee (the major 
producers of capital goods) reported a significant deterioration in 
output, new orders, backlogs, and employment starting in December. 
Surveys of the outlook for the new year are the most pessimistic 
since December 1974.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business leaders are deeply concerned about inflation. There is a 
widespread tendency to applaud the Federal Reserve's firm position, 
but without any conviction that the rate of inflation will slow 
significantly. The growing expectation that defense outlays will 
rise significantly has not had any impact on the outlook here. 
Military orders are a very small factor in this district. Moreover, 
there is no evidence that increased military orders will be 
forthcoming in the near future, and few companies are anxious to 
obtain such contracts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Weather continues favorable, particularly in comparison with each of 
the last three years. There have been no problems with fuel, 
transport, or ability of workers to get to their jobs or to stores. 
As a result, January may appear more robust in year-to-year 
comparisons than is truly the case. Moreover, there will be no 
"bounce back" as the weather improves, such as occurred in each of 
the past three years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The motor vehicle industry, centered in Michigan, continues to be 
the major problem area. Layoffs and plant closings, some temporary, 
have continued at the vehicle producers and their suppliers of 
components. Demand for tires, batteries, and other replacement items 
is also off. More dealerships have closed and there is serious 
concern that this trend will accelerate before the spring selling 
season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other industries hit by high fuel prices and concerns over 
availability are RVs, boats and motors, and restaurants. High beef 
prices have played a role in the poor results of some fast food 
outlets. Some have closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel shipments are expected to decline 3 or 14 percent this year, 
but activity may remain near current levels—about 81 percent of 
capacity. Except for motor vehicles, orders have remained at good 
rates. Customer inventories are low and lead times are very short.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among the capital goods that have showed weakness starting in late 
1979 are farm equipment, construction equipment, and trucks and 
trailers. Heavy backlogs for machine tools and railroad equipment 
appear firm for the time being. A number of producers of capital 
goods and other multinationals report foreign sales to be stronger 
than domestic sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers had stocked ample quantities of warm clothing, galoshes, 
skiing equipment, snowblowers, and other winter goods. Sales of 
these items have been very poor because of the mild, virtually 
snowless winter. In recent weeks discounts ranging up to 50 percent 
have helped to move excess stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Aside from the depressed items, retail sales are said to be 
relatively good. Credit has continued to be used freely with no 
significant increase in delinquencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business slowdown has not caused unions to moderate their 
demands. The strike at International Harvester over mandatory 
overtime that started November 1 is still on, with no serious move 
by either side toward an early settlement. Oil refinery workers 
struck after turning down a 9 percent increase, but refineries can 
be operated for a long time by supervisory personnel. A Chicago news 
truck drivers' strike was settled for a 16.4 percent boost 
(retroactive) to $426 per week. Tank truck drivers settled for a 
13.4 percent rise after losing a strike for a full COLA. Chicago 
teachers threaten to strike if the school term is cut to save cash. 
Chicago firemen also are threatening a strike to get a contract, 
despite generous compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The grain embargo has caused a backup in the "pipeline" moving grain 
to the ports. The strain on transportation is giving way to 
underutilization. Corn Belt farmers and bankers had feared much 
lower grain prices. However, after the initial drop, prices 
recovered to pre-embargo levels. The large carryover of grain stocks 
resulting from record crops will continue to overhang the market, 
because no large orders are anticipated from non-Communist 
countries. Diversion of grain to alcohol production is strictly 
limited in the near term by the capacity of distilleries which is 
fully utilized.
     </p>
     <p>
      District farmland values rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, down 
from 6 percent in the third quarter, and the smallest rise since 
late 1977. At year end district farmland values were 14 percent 
higher than a year earlier, and four times as high as 10 years 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage terms have eased somewhat. The going rate in the Chicago 
area on 20 percent loans is now 12 1/2 percent plus 2 1/2 points. 
Loans are readily available to good risks, but many potential buyers 
have pulled out of the market. S&amp;Ls have been repaying borrowings in 
some cases. People desiring to sell homes have been advised to use 
land contracts, conditional sales, second mortgages, and other 
devices, but such transactions are not popular with sellers who wish 
to realize the full cash price.
