      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 11, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Discussions with Directors, businessmen, and financial executives 
indicate the economy of the Eleventh District continues to expand. 
Department store sales have quickened recently. Skilled labor is in 
tight supply in the major District centers, and labor markets are 
tight generally in Houston, Austin, and oil and gas drilling areas. 
With the demand for workers already high, the increase in the 
minimum wage will impact primarily in retailing and food service 
activities. Deliveries of oil field equipment can't keep up with the 
boom in drilling activity. The increase in planned capital spending 
by petroleum processors appears to be leveling off, and construction 
of apartment buildings is increasing sharply. The rapid pace of home 
buying is providing District S&amp;Ls with all the business they care 
to handle, while agribankers plan an 8-percent cutback in number of 
farm borrowers serviced. The impact of the longshoremen's strike at 
Texas ports is minor.
      <p>
       September department store sales in the District rose faster than 
  the fairly strong rate of sales established in the first eight 
  months of the year. Retailers report inventories are balanced and 
  expect sales to remain strong for the rest of the year. Sales gains 
  are fairly broad-based although some weakness is evident in shoes 
  and men's clothing. Retailers in El Paso report that sales to 
  Mexican nationals have returned to near the rate that prevailed 
  prior to the devaluation of the peso.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total employment in the District states continues to expand. But a 
  survey of area offices of the Texas employment Commission indicates 
  skilled labor remains in short supply. In such isolated areas as 
  Midland and Odessa, the problem of attracting workers is exacerbated 
  by shortages of housing. In the large urban centers there is an 
  increasing need for executive secretarial and skilled clerical help 
  in all industries. Because the demand for workers is so high, the 
  increase in the minimum wage at the beginning of the year is not 
  expected to affect most pay scales. Important exceptions, however, 
  are the retail trade and food service industries. A higher minimum 
  wage will cause some retailers to trim their sales staffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of active drilling rigs continues to grow. In Texas, for 
  example, 801 rigs are operating, compared to 693 a year ago. As a 
  result, drill pipe and tool joint attachments are in tight supply. 
  Forty percent of the state's drilling contractors have new rigs on 
  order, as compared to 10 percent two years ago, and another ho 
  percent plans to order new rigs in the near future. The lead time 
  required for a manufacturer to deliver a new rig has stretched to 
  six to eight months from four to six months last spring.
      </p>
      <p>
       The announced increases in planned capital expenditures by the 
  petroleum processing industry appear to be leveling off. Plans for a 
  billion dollar ethylene plant to be constructed and operating by 
  1982 were shelved recently, although one of the two partners in the 
  venture is willing to revive the project if another partner can be 
  found. A survey of the refining industry suggests that there are no 
  plans to build large refineries in the foreseeable future. The only 
  exception to that view is if and when offshore production is 
  developed on the Atlantic seaboard, a few large refineries may be 
  built on the East Coast. Future additions to capacity in the 
  industry will come from small specialty refineries, and existing 
  refineries will be modified to increase the output of no-lead 
  gasoline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction of apartment buildings is increasing at a rapid rate in 
  Texas. Almost 8,000 multifamily starts were recorded in August, 
  while single-family starts are increasing at about 6,000 units a 
  month. A growing number of observers and participants in this 
  business express concern that overbuilding could exist in the large 
  urban centers by next summer. In that case, rents would level off 
  and even decline in some areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgage loan demand at District S&amp;Ls remains strong, and most 
  associations report that they have all the business they care to 
  handle. Savings inflows continue at a fast clip, but a seasonal 
  slowdown from the strong inflows experienced earlier in the year was 
  noted by several respondents. Rates range from 8 3/4 percent to 9 
  percent on conventional mortgages. Most respondents expect rates to 
  generally hold steady into next year. Moreover, the current runup in 
  money market rates has not triggered disintermediation, nor is it 
  anticipated in the near term.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to preliminary results of our latest survey of 
  agribankers, farm borrowers from banks are going to be cut back 
  about 8 percent. Inadequate farm income, insufficient equity, and 
  poor management were cited as reasons borrowers will fail to qualify 
  for further financing. It is reported many agricultural loan 
  repayments are being made from outside income—minerals, business, 
  savings, or sales of assets. Participations in the guaranteed loan 
  programs of the Farmers Home Administration and Small Business 
  Administration are up, and a few additional banks are utilizing the 
  seasonal borrowing privilege at this Bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longshoremen's strike is having a minor impact at Texas ports. 
  All conventional break-bulk and mixed cargoes are being handled as 
  usual, and only container ships are being picketed. Most exporters 
  halted foreign sales in mid-September in anticipation of a general 
  strike, but sales resumed once it was clear that the strike would 
  not affect break-bulk carriers.
