      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists have scaled down their forecasts of economic 
activity for 1982. The steel industry is being squeezed between weak 
demand and strong imports. Business construction is mixed. Steel and 
petroleum product inventories are falling. Home appliance production 
has been curtailed. Bankers are lending cautiously as their 
customers' financial positions weaken. Usury laws are limiting bank 
automobile financing. Pressures on labor and parts suppliers for 
cost reductions are substantial. Unemployment rates are high and 
rising amidst a rapid pace of plant shutdowns.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists who attended the Fourth District Roundtable 
Meeting on March 12 at this Bank scaled down their forecasts of 
economic activity for 1982 from their late-October forecasts. The 
median of 33 forecasts now shows a 3.3% annual rate of decline in 
real GNP this quarter, a small upturn next quarter, and growth rates 
between 4 and 4 1/2% (a.r.) in the final two quarters. All but three 
forecasters expect positive growth in the second quarter. The median 
forecast shows the GNP implicit price deflator rising at a 6.6% rate 
in the first half and a 7.0% rate in the second half. The 
unemployment rate is expected to peak at 9.2% next quarter and ease 
to 8.7% in the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major steel company reports "the first glimmers" of 
improvement in orders for a few products, but total orders are still 
damped by users' inventory liquidation. That firm's profit margins 
are being squeezed between rising costs and the decline in product 
prices that was aggravated by the January jump in steel imports. 
Another steel firm reports that imports are "demoralizing" markets, 
and prices are "extremely weak and unstable." Both firms expect 
their inventories and employment to decline again in March. Another 
steel firm reports orders have recovered almost to their December 
level following a decline prompted by the early-year increase in 
interest rates. Three major steel firms' forecasts of 1982 domestic 
steel shipments range from 82.5 to 89.0 million tons, compared to 
87.0 million in 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of machine tools reports order cancellation rates 
are high and sales of consumable cutting tools and supplies are 
down. He has furloughed workers in the last month, expects to lay-
off more, and foresees no upturn this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A fabricator of aluminum cans and a producer of 
polymers both recently announced major expansions of their 
production facilities. Cleveland and Pittsburgh are experiencing 
booms in office building construction. Oil and gas drilling activity 
in southern Ohio is down 12% from "a fantastic level" in 1981. A 
petroleum company economist expects no increase in total domestic 
drilling this year. A major steel firm announced deferral of plans 
to double its capacity to produce pipe for the oil and gas drilling 
industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A petroleum industry economist reports that petroleum 
product inventories are being liquidated but crude inventories are 
not being liquidated. Two major steel firms report their inventories 
fell in February and will fall again in March. An aluminum producer 
reports that fabricator inventories are extremely low while producer 
inventories are high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Durable Consumer Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major manufacturer of home appliances 
reports appliance production has been sharply curtailed in the last 
three months in a lagged response to the decline in house 
construction. He expects more layoffs of appliance workers and notes 
these may be permanent because appliances are no longer a growth 
industry. Nevertheless, he expects retail sales of appliances to be 
better in the second half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Bank Lending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A banker in a small city expects many 
failures in agriculture, construction, and automobile agencies and 
sees weak markets for resale of property acquired from bankrupt 
clients. His bank will have to curtail loans to firms whose net 
equity has disappeared. Banks will no longer extend credit to tenant 
farmers without a signature from the land owner. Some farmers are 
selling their cattle to finance their spring planting. A Pittsburgh 
banker reports that Ford and Chrysler captive credit companies are 
no longer extending credit in Pittsburgh. Local bankers do not want 
to make automobile loans because the state usury law ceiling is too 
low, so the automobile dealers are having great difficulty financing 
sales. An auto producer estimates that with a prime rate of 16.5%, 
usury laws make bank lending for automobile loans unattractive in 21 
states accounting for 37% of the U.S. car market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Cost of Production
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A petroleum company economist expects the cost 
of drilling oil and gas wells to rise by 10% this year after rising 
between 20% and 30% annually in the last two years. A food industry 
economist expects sizeable commodity price increases in 1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pressures on labor and parts suppliers for cost reductions are 
substantial. A meat packer in Cincinnati is threatening to move 
unless labor concessions are granted. An auto industry economist 
reports that because of recent union concessions, his firm's labor 
costs will rise by 15%-18% instead of 25%-30% over the life of the 
contract. A truck parts manufacturer has eliminated COLA for all 
non-union employees. A tire manufacturer has eliminated COLA for 
white collar workers. A Pittsburgh electrical contractor reports 
electricians' union acquiescence to time and one-half pay for 
overtime instead of the area tradition of double time. A bearing 
manufacturer has received demands from six Fortune 100 customers in 
the last 30 days for price reductions ranging from 2% to 7 1/2%, and 
believes his competitor is yielding to similar demands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment and Plant Closings. Recession effects have spread and 
deepened throughout the Fourth District. Unemployment rates are 
higher in the Fourth District than national average. For the top 11 
SMSAs in this District, the January NSA unemployment rates range 
from 8.8% in Columbus to 13.8% in Toledo and 15.7% in Youngstown.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rapid pace of plant shutdowns continues in the District. The 
most recent is the closing of a 65 year old rubber plant in Akron 
that will result in a permanent job loss for nearly 1,300 salaried 
and hourly workers. The plant was the sole surviving producer of 
auto passenger tires in Akron, once the tire- producing capital of 
the U.S. (Since 1979, 14 tire plants in U.S. have closed.) Also, in 
mid-February, GMC announced the closing of a stamping plant in 
Cleveland that employs 1,200 workers. The announcement that a second 
Cleveland plant, employing 1,700 workers, would be closed apparently 
will be rescinded as part of the recent GM-UAW agreement.
