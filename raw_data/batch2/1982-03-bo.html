      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      There is no upturn yet in the First District. Retailers report that 
sales have been slow, although not much slower than expected. While 
a few manufacturers see signs of a pickup, the majority report no 
improvement or further declines. In both retailing and 
manufacturing, inventories have increased relative to desired 
levels. A lack of confidence in the future is depressing capital 
spending, even by firms with adequate funds for investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailing continues to be slow in the First District, but merchants 
reported no serious disappointments relative to plan, since they 
expected sales to be slow. The first quarter is traditionally weak 
for retailers, and weaker still so far this year. Those contacted 
reported February transactions were below last year; while dollar 
sales were slightly up for some retailers, others' sales were down 
as much as five percent in some New England states. Inventories are 
slightly above desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several retailers mentioned considerable geographic variation in 
sales performance. Results for individual product lines were also 
mixed. One merchant said increasing fabric sales signaled that 
consumers are economizing through home sewing; another said better 
women's sportswear and "designer" housewares had moved strongly; 
another's declines were storewide.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the retailers contacted are taking a "conservative" approach to 
the first half of the year, expecting the current slowness to 
continue. Several said promotional activity will remain at its usual 
seasonal levels. Ordering and buying for the second half of the year 
were said to anticipate an upturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the First District has fallen since the 
end of last year, and while a few firms report that recent business 
has been better than expected, most see no signs of improvement. For 
three consecutive months now, surveys of local purchasing managers 
have found more firms in which production and orders have fallen in 
the month than firms with increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The problems of the auto industry and the commercial airlines were 
of particular concern to this month's respondents. The commercial 
airlines continue to cut back orders for new engines and parts, 
causing substantial employment losses in the First District's 
aircraft industry. This decline has also affected manufacturers of 
electronic components and communications equipment. Among the areas 
recently affected by difficulties in the auto industry are tires and 
capital equipment. Again, there is concern that conditions will 
deteriorate further. Not all the products in which demand has 
softened are tied to particular problem industries. The demand for 
specialty industrial chemicals has weakened; the paper industry has
seen a downturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among the few positive developments was a report of a definite 
pickup in orders for packaging for consumer products and medical 
supplies; the demand for industrial packaging has not improved. The 
defense business continues to be a source of strength. Firms which 
were not previously active in defense work are now competing for 
contracts. In a few cases, bottlenecks have developed because 
inexperienced subcontractors and suppliers are having difficulty 
meeting defense specifications.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to labor negotiations, manufacturers expect settlements 
to be more moderate than in the past; labor is more likely to be 
flexible on fringes than on take-home pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inventories have recently become higher than desired, according to 
several First District manufacturers; unless sales pick up in the 
next few weeks it will be necessary to make further production cuts. 
However, the manufacturer of packaging materials reports that both 
his inventories and those of his customers are very low; if demand 
were to improve quickly, he would have difficulty responding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A December survey of the capital spending plans of New England 
manufacturers was just released. New England firms plan on 
increasing capital spending in 1982 by 12 percent; this is the same 
as the actual 1981 increase but less than originally planned. High 
technology firms account for most of the increase. Comments by 
industrial manufacturers are less encouraging, however. While few 
admit to actively cutting back capital spending, most are looking at 
projects more closely. According to one producer of capital goods, 
there are a lot of companies which should be investing and which 
have funds available for investment but which are not investing 
because they lack confidence that the economy will turn around any 
time soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, Solow, and Tobin were 
available for comment this month. Pointing to sharp declines in 
consumer and business confidence, Eckstein fears the economic upturn 
will be delayed and weak. He notes pervasive fear of a financial 
disaster and urges the Fed to give some weight to that contingency. 
He views widespread bankruptcies of the thrifts "not as a risk but a 
certainty" and calls for a public explanation of "the safety net 
against financial collapse." Whatever the long-run validity of 
monetarism, there is no present danger of overliquidity and lower 
interest rates are needed to mitigate financial distress and to help 
restore confidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Houthakker feels monetary policy is "on the right track" 
and recommends moving back toward the top of the Ml range over the 
next few months. He fears the large Federal deficit but, like 
Eckstein, expects only token spending reduction and tax increases. 
With monetary growth of 5 percent, Houthakker sees the chances of a 
Depression as "very small."
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Samuelson notes that high nominal interest rates are 
partly due to less rationing of credit. With apprehension about 
prospective deficits and "hysteria" about the money growth targets, 
Samuelson speculates that macroeconomic policy may not be able to 
contrive a recovery. Fiscal stimulus creates fears of future 
deficits which discourages investment and monetary growth in excess 
of the targets creates credibility problems. Nevertheless, more 
years of stagnation are not satisfactory and will increase the 
"natural" unemployment rate. The crusade against inflation may not 
be consistent with the need to absorb the resources freed from the 
long-term decline of the auto industry and basic manufacturing due
to changes in comparative costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Solow sees the point of a tight monetary policy to 
encourage a shift toward a tighter fiscal policy but feels 
continuation of a tight policy now would "overdo it." He finds it 
implausible that the Congress will enact major spending cuts or tax 
increases with the unemployment rate above 9 percent. He rejects the 
notion of a "permanent monetary policy" that can be set once and for 
all. There is a clear need for a shift in the policy mix with a net 
move toward expansion. An expansionary policy in the early stages of 
an upturn would leave plenty of time to react to any excess demand 
pressures. A focus on the past three years of no growth, not a few 
months of an upturn, suggests that the marginal anti-inflation 
payoff of further restraint will be small relative to its costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Tobin advocates "the Accord of 1982"—a deal between the 
Fed, the Congress, and the Administration to reduce the Federal 
deficit and encourage economic recovery. The Congress would suspend 
the 1983 tax cut and indexing of spending programs and cut spending 
enough to hold the deficit to $80 billion in 1983 and 1984. The Fed 
would abandon its current procedure and follow instead a nominal GNP 
goal that would ensure a strong recovery. The nominal GNP goal would 
be reduced in succeeding years. This plan would allow the Fed to 
back away from an untenable monetarist policy that is losing 
credibility with the people that matter—the business community 
that is so disenchanted with the current policy mix.
