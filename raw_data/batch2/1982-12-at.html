      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Late fall economic conditions in the Southeast show mixed signs. 
Construction continues to improve, generating optimism among 
construction-related manufacturers. The labor market appears to be 
stabilizing, and job growth in some sectors is accelerating. 
Optimism prevails in the travel industry. However, the profit 
potential for most farmers remains clouded and consumer spending has 
yet to show a pre-Christmas surge.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Latest available statistics on employment 
imply an end to the deteriorating labor market conditions reported 
previously, but unemployment continues to rise, and reports from 
industry representatives on capital spending plans indicate that the 
outlook for increased hiring is inauspicious. October figures 
indicate that declining construction employment finally may have 
reached bottom. Rates of decline are decelerating in several 
construction-related manufacturing sectors, such as lumber, wood, 
stone, clay, and glass. Bankruptcies among lumber-related 
manufacturers are reportedly on the wane, although some smaller 
firms may have trouble surviving until the seasonal spring upturn in 
housing. Except in government and trade the rate of growth in other 
nonmanufacturing sectors accelerated in October. Job attrition 
continued in most manufacturing sectors, and for the first time 
since World War II the District's unemployment rate reached 10.5 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our survey of firms and trade associations reveals moderate optimism 
among producers of construction-related goods, such as lumber and 
carpets, and among makers of structural steel. The latter expect 
government spending on defense and infrastructure to stimulate 
demand. However, chemical manufacturers do not share this optimism. 
Even in industries with capital spending plans, job creation is 
likely to be minimal because the impetus is cost-cutting efficiency 
rather than growth-related expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers report generally higher 
promotional activity compared to the same period last year. They 
regard immediate post-Thanksgiving consumer buying to have been 
good, as expected, but the subsequent lull is lasting longer than 
usual. Consumers are delaying holiday purchases in hopes of deep 
discounts in the last few weeks before Christmas. Big-ticket home 
furnishings continue to show improvement in some areas. Purchases of 
personal computers, tools, exercise equipment, small appliances, and 
cosmetics generally remain strong. Unseasonably warm weather has 
caused winter apparel to move slowly, but luxury wear has noticeably 
improved. In contrast to 1981, retailers are comfortable with 
inventory levels and are not likely to reduce prices more. Thus, 
profit margins are unlikely to narrow further. However, sales volume 
and profits will depend upon the strength of last-minute buying.
     </p>
     <p>
      Southeastern auto sales slightly outpaced the nation's rise of 31 
percent in November. Cut-rate loans are successfully stimulating 
sales and helping to reduce car inventories. Nevertheless, the 
short-term sales outlook is not bright because consumers remain 
troubled by rising unemployment and high real interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For the near future, realtors and thrift 
officials feel that the post-election November 15 drop in the FHA/VA 
rates may have "propped a stick" in the mortgage "window," which the 
pre-election slide in mortgage rates opened. Confidence in the 
future of housing is slowly returning as concern diminishes that 
political engineering occasioned earlier drops in mortgage rates. 
Single-family building permits show the greatest degree of recovery. 
Other construction sectors are faring less well, and industry 
representatives expect slack demand and overbuilding to keep 
nonresidential contract construction sluggish well into 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thrifts have been slow to accrue benefits from the housing recovery, 
but total loans closed by S&amp;L's have finally begun to improve. 
Industry spokesmen attribute the delayed recovery of thrifts vis-a-
vis other construction indicators to increased competition from 
seller financing and mortgage companies and to a longer "wait and 
see" period by home buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Optimism, predicated upon national economic recovery, 
discounted airfares, and the popularity of EPCOT, is widespread 
among the tourist industry representatives in our survey. 
Preliminary, partial data and reports from those polled indicate 
that out-of-state travel in the upper-price brackets (air travel and 
lodgings) has already begun to rise. November attendance at EPCOT 
remains ahead of projections reportedly because Florida residents 
and out-of-state retirees are flocking to the new attraction. 
Nonetheless, several sources maintain that EPCOT's effect elsewhere 
in Florida is negligible or negative. Business and convention travel 
shows mixed signs. Contacts report that Atlanta appears to be 
improving while South Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana remain weak. 
Respondents in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama blame rainy weather 
rather than economic conditions for the more than seasonal decline 
in local tourism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Southeastern cotton farmers are experiencing 
extraordinary yields in 1982. The most recent USDA projections 
estimate five of the six District states will enjoy record yields; 
Georgia should surpass its previous record by 20 percent. Yield is 
likely to determine profitability for most cotton producers, but 
some Mississippi farmers are facing losses of both their crop and 
income as a result of an apparent business failure. A large cotton 
company, already in receipt of substantial cotton, is unable to pay 
farmers or to return the cotton for which warehouse receipts are now 
held by a creditor of the company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most grain farmers face only a small chance of profit from the 1982 
crop, notwithstanding a recent 5 percent rise in prices. At present, 
widespread flooding in the Mississippi valley has done little injury 
to crops, but potential damage is of concern, and extension 
personnel in Mississippi report other weather-related damage. Recent 
aberrations in temperature and a surfeit of rain have adulterated 
the quality of the remaining soybean harvest. One estimate suggests 
a possible loss of 10 million bushels, valued at approximately $52 
million. Large supplies have thwarted efforts to sell low- quality 
beans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of a cross-section of District banks and savings 
and loans regarding "bridge" and Money Market Deposit Accounts 
(MMDA's) indicates a substantial response to the new instruments. 
Although few institutions in the District are offering rates as high 
(21-22%) as those in Atlanta, the premiums are enough above current 
money market funds to attract considerable corporate and personal 
interest throughout the District. Insurance, which the MMDA's 
provide, is another factor of particular attractiveness to retired 
and large personal account holders. Except in institutions offering 
low rates, early indications are that most of the funds are being 
attracted from money market mutuals. The probability of continued 
substantial shifts between money market mutuals and the new accounts 
appears high. Such shifts may create either liquidity problems or an 
atmosphere of potential problems. In such a climate even more funds 
would be transferred out of money market mutuals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Panel of Economists
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In response to our request to assess the 
strengths and weaknesses of their respective economies in 1983, most 
members of our panel of economists cite construction as a probable 
leading sector. Several respondents are pessimistic regarding 
nonresidential construction though. Reflecting in part the economic 
heterogeneity of the District, little consensus exists otherwise 
regarding either strengths or weaknesses. Construction-related 
manufacturing seems likely to improve, in the opinion of many 
panelists. Chemicals, textiles, oil, gas, exports, and agriculture 
were each cited by a few respondents as potentially weak sectors.
