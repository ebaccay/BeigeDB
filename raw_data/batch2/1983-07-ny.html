      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Introduction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic recovery continued at a steady pace in most of the 
Second District through May and June, but some industries and 
regions are not yet experiencing renewed economic growth. The most 
dynamic sectors of the District's economy were homebuilding, high 
technology industries, some automotive suppliers, and the financial 
and service industries. The regions in which these industries 
dominate—New York City, Northern New Jersey, Long Island, Syracuse, 
and Albany—are performing well. It also appears that the patrons of 
upscale retail establishments are spending much more than they were 
last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the regions that specialize in the manufacturing of steel and 
producers' durables recovery has yet to begin, and some observers of 
these areas are not even sure that the recession has bottomed out. 
Unemployment rates remain above 13 percent in Buffalo and Elmira, 
for example. In general, the unemployed manufacturing workforce has 
not been called back in large numbers. Other weak spots include the 
agricultural sector and, possibly, the office construction industry 
as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some local firms are beginning to increase their borrowing from 
banks as economic activity strengthens, but overall the pickup 
remains spotty. New inflows of deposits associated with the MMDAs 
have encouraged banks to be more aggressive in expanding loans to 
businesses, and demand has strengthened for construction loans, 
inventory financing, and loans to computer-related companies. 
Nevertheless, in the industries and regions where the economic 
recovery has not been felt, loan demand remains very sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the price side, only a little immediate upward pressure has been 
felt on most prices. However, some shortages of construction 
materials have developed, and the increasing cost of medical 
insurance is raising widespread concern.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the exception of the heavy industrial plants of the Buffalo 
area, most District manufacturers are reporting increases in orders 
and shipments. The high technology sectors on Long Island and in the 
Albany area have done especially well, and the automotive suppliers 
near Jamestown and Syracuse are beginning to resupply the "Big 
Three." However, growth in output has not yet translated into 
decreases in unemployment in most places. Unemployment in all of the 
District's major labor market areas, except Poughkeepsie, remains 
higher than it was a year ago. Employers, for the most part, have 
been increasing the length of workweeks instead of recalling laid 
off workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's major retail chains continue to compete intensely for 
market share. Sales to middle income households especially have been 
described as a "competitive blood bath". The stores serving high 
income clientele have enjoyed the largest sales increases over last 
year, while the lower priced chains have had substantially smaller 
gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The drop in interest rates since last summer continues to improve 
the earnings outlook for thrift institutions in the Second District. 
On average, quarterly losses at New York State mutual savings banks 
were considerably smaller in QI 1983 than during 1982. Similarly, by 
the end of 1982 over half of the savings and loan associations in 
New York and New Jersey had turned profitable, and more recently 
this proportion has risen further.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit inflows at thrifts have increased as a result of the MMDAs, 
particularly outside of New York City. New savings inflows to New 
York and New Jersey S&amp;Ls have picked up in 1983, and recent inflows 
appear to have been the strongest in several years. At New York 
mutual savings banks, the rise in net deposits since last year has 
generally been more modest. In part this reflects the high degree of 
competition for funds in the New York City market. Moreover, some of 
the savings banks are not aggressively expanding their liabilities 
as a result of concern over their capital positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Public Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The continuing strong performance of the New York City economy—led 
by the finance and service industries—has improved local fiscal 
circumstances markedly. In January the City's financial analysts 
were predicting a large deficit and local leaders were planning 
large tax increases and the layoffs of some 4,000 school district 
employees. Since then, revenue collections have exceeded 
expectations in every month. The latest projections envision a 
substantial budget surplus, and plans are being considered for 
service improvements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stronger than expected performance of the City's economy and the 
improved condition of its treasury helped pave the way for New 
York's reentry into municipal bond markets. The City's first 
competitive bond issue since the fiscal crisis of the mid 1970s 
recently received a respectable welcome in the market, although 
still at a relatively low credit rating.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The wet weather this spring is not expected to reduce crop 
production in New York State. However, net farm income was flat in 
New York last year and is expected to remain so this year. Corn 
acreage has been reduced through the Payment in Kind program, but 
PIK does not apply to New York's large dairy and fruit industries. 
Agriculture should, therefore, remain a weak sector of the District 
economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing sales and construction continued to increase in May though 
they were curtailed somewhat by the bad weather. In recent weeks 
some signs have emerged that buying activity has spread to smaller, 
less expensive homes, in contrast to the first quarter when sales 
were largely confined to the more expensive end of the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the northern and eastern suburbs of New York City and in 
Syracuse, commercial real estate and construction markets remained 
quite active. In other areas, the amount of new space about to come 
on market suggests that construction starts will be sluggish through 
1983. However, most observers of commercial real estate in the 
District remain optimistic regarding the prospects for filling 
existing office space and expect new construction projects to follow 
before too long.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With two exceptions, major wage or price increases are not likely 
this year. Most wage settlements are calling for increases below six 
percent, and most industries apparently consider competition too 
strong to venture significant price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      One exception is building materials. Contractors are experiencing 
shortages of lumber and of skilled labor. However, increases in the 
prices of these inputs are typical during the early phase of an 
expansion of housing construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second exception to the general picture of price stability is 
causing more concern. The costs of health care, and therefore of 
employee medical insurance, continue to increase quite rapidly. 
Employers are beginning to experiment with and even implement 
changes in their medical insurance programs aimed at reducing these 
costs. Some savings have been realized, but changes are meeting 
employee resistance.
