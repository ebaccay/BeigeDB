      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending continues strong all over the Twelfth District, 
with an emphasis upon autos and big ticket items. The inventory 
picture is mixed, with aluminum and small cars moving downward and 
aerospace and forest products moving upward. Construction activity 
continues brisk and rainfall improves the outlook for agricultural 
production. Commercial lending moves up slightly in April and 
purchases of large CD's continue downward. The general consensus in 
the district is that the President's energy policy increases 
uncertainty and will lead to a slowdown in plant and equipment 
expenditures in 1977.
      <p>
       Consumer spending is reported strong in almost all urban areas of 
  the Twelfth District, while low farm prices and drought have 
  generated a weakness in rural consumer demand. The composition of 
  consumer demand tends to favor autos and appliances. A good portion 
  of spending appears to be associated with the construction boom; 
  furniture, appliances and other household goods are receiving 
  considerable consumer attention. Some sporting goods stores are also 
  claiming a dramatic rise in sales. One item reported to be facing 
  slower sales is coffee. A supermarket price war continues in Los 
  Angeles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto sales are currently above 1st quarter levels in most areas. For 
  example, one foreign car distributor in Oregon reported the 
  following pattern of sales: Jan. 1,110; Feb. 1,002; Mar. 1,450; Apr. 
  2,137. Foreign auto sales account for 33 percent of total in Oregon. 
  Composition of district auto sales is generally reported to be 
  steady (with percent shares of 35 compact, 34 intermediate, and 30 
  large). However, subsequent to the President's energy message some 
  areas report a shift to large cars and other areas a shift to small 
  cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business inventory movement is mixed. For example, inventories of 
  small cars have fallen to very low levels for some makes, while 
  newsprint inventories have grown quite large due to a softening in 
  Japanese demand. In fact, decreased Japanese demand has led to a 
  buildup of inventories in a number of West Coast forest product 
  lines. One large aerospace firm (Boeing) reports an increase in 
  inventories in anticipation of an expansion in sales. Aluminum 
  inventories continue downward and one producer expects an aluminum 
  shortage next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spotlight in western production continues to fall on the housing 
  sector. Construction activity appears brisk all over the district. 
  Southern California reports first quarter building permits up by 50 
  percent over the year earlier figure (with a 60-40 percent, singe-multiple composition) and housing values up by 68 percent over a 
  year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The construction boom has helped to keep the forest products sector 
  active, and demand for cardboard containers is also reported up. 
  Aluminum production is currently higher than the first quarter level 
  and aerospace activity continues at the same high first quarter 
  rate. Some manufacturing volume is reported down from the first 
  quarter levels. While the drought continues to adversely affect the 
  agricultural sector, rainfall has brightened the outlook of one and 
  two months ago. For example, the Yakima Valley in Washington will 
  now get 30 percent of its normal irrigation deliveries rather than 
  the 6 percent of normal previously announced. In Oregon, all parts 
  of the agricultural sector are reported improved, with the exception 
  of livestock where water shortages, poor pasture and record-high hay 
  prices are very seriously hurting a number of producers. 
  Agricultural employment is down all over the district.
      </p>
      <p>
       While consumer lending still continues strong, business loan demand 
  is flat in some areas and up slightly in others. Two large 
  California banks, plus one Oregon bank report that commercial 
  lending in April was slightly above the first quarter level. An 
  Idaho banker reports loan demand is ample in volume but down in 
  quality due to low crop prices, water shortages and confusion over 
  the new energy policy. Real estate lending is strong in a number of 
  areas and two Washington bankers have expressed concern about the 
  strength of demand for and size of these loans. In particular, they 
  see an increasing number of real estate loans based upon both 
  husband and wife incomes and they are uneasy about making these 
  loans but feel obliged to do so by sex discrimination laws. A 
  quantitative picture of lending is given by one large California 
  bank: since year-end, consumer installment lending is up 8 percent, 
  real estate up 6 percent and commercial up 1.6 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a general consensus that the President's energy policy 
  increases uncertainty and will cause a general slowdown in plant and 
  equipment spending until the actual shape of the energy program and 
  its effect upon various energy prices becomes clear. One Oregon 
  banker feels that all major industrial plant and equipment 
  expenditures will be reviewed in light of the new energy policy's 
  effect on construction costs, direct energy costs, conversion-to-coal costs and rebates and investment tax credits. But, like most of 
  our directors, he feels that these effects will not be clear until 
  it is known how much of the program remains intact after its journey 
  through Congress. The president of a major forest products firm 
  claims that since 1973 energy use per unit of output has already
  been reduced by 10 percent in his industry and he foresees both the 
  further use of waste material for the internal generation of energy 
  and the construction of new plants using coal as the primary 
  purchased fuel. However, a gas company president feels a shift to 
  coal will be possible only through a relaxation of California's air 
  quality standards and the introduction of a cleaner coal burning 
  technology. And one aluminum producer feels that forcing companies 
  to switch to coal will drive some offshore, including one of his own 
  plants. The increased uncertainty generated by the proposed energy 
  program has caused one large California bank to lower its forecast 
  of 1977 state plant and equipment spending by one percentage point—from 13 to 12 percent over last year.
