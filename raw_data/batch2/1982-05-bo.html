      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the First District vary considerably from 
sector to sector. Retail sales have been stronger than expected. 
Department stores cite an increase in the importance of promotional 
activities as the most important effect of the recession. 
Manufacturers, on the other hand, report a pronounced decline in 
economic activity since the first of the year. Although the rate of 
decline seems to have slowed, signs of an upturn are few and far 
between. As production and employment levels have been cut back, a 
number of firms have adopted work-sharing arrangements. Reports from 
the banking sector range from "an excellent year" to very poor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail conditions in the First District appear to be stronger than 
the retailers themselves expected. Although sales are not booming, 
dollar sales are running above last year and in some cases, ahead of 
department store prices. Promotional activities are reported to be 
increasingly important in generating sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several retailers expressed surprise that the slack in the national 
and local economies was not having a larger effect on their sales 
figures. This was mentioned both by merchants with a predominance of 
high income customers and by those serving primarily low income 
consumers. A representative of a New England department store with a 
nationwide parent company reported that the New England sales 
increase was second highest of all the parent's stores. Seasonal 
factors, such as the timing of Easter, distort comparisons with last 
year; but among those reporting, first quarter (February through 
April) sales were up 4 to 12 percent over the first quarter of last 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      All those contacted described inventory management as especially 
difficult under current business conditions, but all reported 
success in their ongoing inventory control efforts. Promotional 
activities have been an important inventory reduction tool, and 
several mentioned a heightened consumer response to well-advertised 
specials. Price reductions, they noted, increase profits 
proportionally less than sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases from suppliers have not moderated as much as the 
CPI, but some retailers report fewer or slower increases. This 
slowdown will appear in retail prices with a lag, since the goods 
being purchased now will be sold in the fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Signs of continuing weakness far outnumber signs of an upturn, 
according to First District manufacturers. In an April survey of 
local purchasing managers, substantially more firms reported 
decreases over the month than increases for production, employment, 
new orders and backlogs. There have been order cancellations for 
aircraft equipment; the airlines' financial position has suffered as 
the recession has reduced business travel. A manufacturer of 
household products, for whom the rehabilitation and remodeling 
business had sustained sales through 1981, has seen a sharp downturn 
since the first of the year; sales are not falling as rapidly as 
earlier in 1982 but they are still falling. A producer of energy
saving capital equipment reports that firms have been postponing 
projects since the first of the year; in a number of cases, firms 
have the resources to proceed but they are uneasy about the future. 
Orders for heavy capital equipment for the petro-chemical and auto 
industries remain depressed. The problems of the auto industry are 
also causing production cutbacks and layoffs among the region's 
machine tool makers. Some of the region's fastest growing high 
technology firms have begun to feel the recession; revenue growth 
has slowed, profit growth even more so and several of the largest 
have curtailed hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among the more encouraging reports was the observation by two firms 
that business at European plants has picked up. However, one firm 
described the strength in Europe as uneven, while a manufacturer of 
specialized industrial equipment said most of the increased demand 
at its European plants was from the developing nations, not Europe 
itself. Also encouraging were reports from a manufacturer of semi-
conductors and a supplier to the semi-conductor industry that 
bookings have picked up in that industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many firms which have reduced production and employment levels have 
adopted work-sharing arrangements. The most common approach has been 
to shut down whole plants for several weeks. A number of firms have 
also introduced four-day workweeks; in others, employees work for 
four weeks and are off the fifth. The firms which have adopted four-
day weeks and rotating schedules say they have done so in order to 
hold onto their workforces. It is not clear whether such practices 
are more common now than in other recessions of comparable severity; 
they are certainly more common than in 1980.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from the banking sector are mixed. One bank contacted was 
enjoying an excellent year, while another reports that loan losses 
are up sharply and first quarter earnings were very disappointing. 
One banker noted that passbook savings deposits seem to have 
stabilized; while his bank was continuing to lose accounts to the 
money market funds, this outflow was being offset by funds from the 
thrifts. He did not think his was an isolated situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Samuelson, Solow and Tobin were available for 
comment this month. Eckstein believes that the risks associated with 
continued high interest rates have become uncomfortably high. If 
rates do not decline soon on their own, the Fed will have to ease up 
on the monetary brake to insure that a series of cascading 
bankruptcies do not drag the economy into a deeper, more prolonged 
recession. With respect to inflation, he anticipates a reversal of 
food and fuel prices will soon end the days of a declining CPI. He 
foresees no budget agreement until after the November election, 
although the recent unity among Republicans is an encouraging 
development. Eckstein envisions a final budget including $20-30 
billion in tax increases and $30-35 billion in expenditure 
reductions, yielding a 1983 deficit of about $l25 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solow expects an anemic recovery in the second half and notes that 
most risks are on the downside. Interest rate declines due either to 
a weak economy or a resolution of the budget stalemate cannot be 
interpreted as an easier monetary policy or as enhancing the 
prospects for recovery. In fact, if current monetary policy is 
appropriate for the current stance of fiscal policy, a move to 
fiscal restraint surely implies an easier monetary policy is needed. 
Solow argues that a budget compromise would be the most advantageous 
occasion to adopt a more lenient monetary policy without raising 
inflationary expectations. He believes continued progress in 
reducing the Federal deficit would be facilitated if monetary policy 
were to offset the effects of fiscal restraint. He fears that, after 
three years of no economic growth, a stagnant economy will bring 
"semi-permanent" damage to the economy' s productive capacity, and 
preclude strong capital formation and productivity growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin also favors a shift in policy mix. Given the likelihood of 
high unemployment this year and next, he doubts that monetary ease 
would set off an economic boom that would raise inflation. Even when 
inflation has receded, he fears that the Fed may not tolerate a 
healthy recovery for fear of throwing away its victory won at such 
great cost.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson believes that given the prevalence of "monetarist 
monomania," the Fed should not respond to a budget compromise by 
violating its targets only slightly. The amount of stimulus gained 
would not be commensurate with the credibility lost. Nevertheless, 
he strongly urges the Fed not to abandon its role of lender of last 
resort if unemployment is still 10 percent by the end of the year 
and the economy is in real danger of a depression. He believes that 
high interest rates will come down sufficiently to permit a modest, 
if delayed, recovery in the second half of the year.
