     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 14, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall economic activity has changed little in recent weeks 
according to Eighth District businessmen. Consumer spending at 
department stores has increased somewhat from August to September. 
In contrast, automobile sales, while on an uptrend since April, 
declined slightly from August to September. Manufacturing activity 
is mixed but, on balance, has changed little since early September. 
Increased orders and production were reported by manufacturers of 
metals, chemicals, and construction materials, while orders for 
capital goods declined further. Home sales in September were 
adversely affected by rising interest rates. Overall loan volume 
increased in recent weeks, led by business loans to manufacturers. 
Even though agricultural harvesting is proceeding rapidly, sharply 
reduced crop yields in parts of the District will substantially 
reduce farm incomes this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending has increased modestly in recent weeks according 
to area retailers. Department store representatives report that 
September sales were up from both August and from a year ago. Some 
retailers noted that recent gains have been achieved by markdowns 
and promotions, so that profit margins remain depressed. Retail 
sales in some rural areas are reported to have shown little 
improvement in recent months due to depressed farm incomes. 
Automobile sales have generally risen since last April, although 
September sales were down somewhat from August. Car dealers report 
that substantial showroom traffic has been generated recently by the 
newer energy efficient models of domestic manufacturers, but that is 
too early to assess their sales potential.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are at generally acceptable levels at both the retail 
and manufacturing firms. A major chemical firm reported that 
excessive inventories of some plastics, intermediate chemicals and 
industrial chemicals have been reduced to satisfactory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity appears to have been unchanged in recent 
weeks, and no further substantial layoff of workers was noted. Gains 
were reported by manufacturers of construction materials, metals, 
chemicals, and feeds. A producer of construction materials noted, 
however, that the recent gains are likely to be short-lived because 
higher interest rates are expected to reduce housing activity. Some 
manufacturers of clothing and appliances noted little change in 
recent weeks. Capital good orders are on the downside; high interest 
rates and anticipated tax benefits from legislation next year are 
reported to be reasons for the falloff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential housing sales declined in September after increasing in 
the early summer months. A representative of the St. Louis home 
building industry reports that home sales in September may have 
declined to one-half the level of July and August, and that, for the 
year, they may be only about 20 percent of normal. Rising interest 
rates are cited by homebuilders for the decline. Rates have risen 
from 11-1/2 percent to around 13-1/2 - 14 percent since mid-summer. 
Virtually no backlog of home sales exists, so that residential 
construction layoffs will occur as sales decline. Nonresidential 
building continues at a high level as a result of existing projects. 
A representative of one St. Louis firm noted, however, that an 
office building project has been shelved because of the recent rise 
in mortgage interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent financial developments include somewhat higher loan volumes 
at area financial institutions and higher interest rates. Business 
loan volume at banks is reported to have increased in recent weeks. 
Higher demand for loans was noted by manufacturing firms, 
particularly textiles, petroleum refining, and chemicals. In 
addition, a small increase in consumer installment loans and a 
seasonal increase in agricultural loans associated with grain 
storage from the fall harvest was noted. Partially offsetting these 
gains were declines in loans to retailers and wholesalers. Lenders 
report that the movement away from long-term fixed rate mortgages is 
gathering momentum, and that such mortgages may soon be regarded as 
a thing of the past. Some banks report a reluctance to lend to 
consumers since a change in the personal bankruptcy law has 
increased bad debt expenses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural producers in the District, particularly in Arkansas and 
Missouri, face substantially reduced incomes this year due to poor 
crop yields, death losses of poultry, and higher production costs. 
In Arkansas, the soybean and rice crops are reported to be down 50 
and 25 percent, respectively, from original estimates. In addition, 
Arkansas poultry producers suffered heavy financial losses last 
summer due to heat related deaths of poultry. As a result of reduced 
incomes in these areas, local banks report the potential for bad 
loans is the highest in many years.
