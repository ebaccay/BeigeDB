      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 18, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending and residential construction continue to lead the 
Twelfth District economy into recovery. Retail sales at department 
stores and auto dealerships continue to improve, while the decline 
in mortgage interest rates has held Western homebuilding and sales 
activity at levels far above those of a year ago. Manufacturing 
activity is picking up in a few important industries such as lumber 
and aluminum, but most of the region's capital goods and mining 
industries continue to experience extremely weak demand. Despite 
ample funds and aggressive promotional efforts on the part of the 
institutions, commercial and consumer loan demand at Twelfth 
District banks remained sluggish during April, but the banks report 
a significant increase in real estate lending activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports throughout the Twelfth District confirm the growing strength 
of retail sales in March and April. Major department store chains in 
Southern California reported that sales increased in both months and 
in April ran about 8 percent above the level of a year earlier, 
representing a solid gain in real terms. One respondent described 
sales at smaller stores, such as those selling women's apparel and 
shoes, as "the best in years, even better than Christmas". In the 
Pacific Northwest and Intermountain states, department stores also 
are experiencing strong year-to-year sales increases. The pickup is 
extending beyond apparel, which remained relatively strong even 
during recession, to a broader spectrum of product lines. In 
particular, the upturn in home sales is helping to spur sales of 
household goods, including furniture, appliances, and other big 
ticket items. Interest rate concessions by automobile manufacturers, 
and declining gasoline prices, have stimulated sales of automobiles 
and recreational vehicles. Retail credit delinquencies are returning 
to more normal levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District manufacturing industries that serve the housing and 
defense sectors are showing improvement. But the majority of 
industries—namely, those that manufacture durable capital goods—
continue to reduce output and employment. Perhaps the brightest spot 
in the district economy in terms of a turnaround is the Pacific 
Northwest lumber industry. The recovery in national homebuilding 
activity enabled the industry to boost production during the first 
quarter 46 percent above the level of a year earlier and to raise 
prices on average by 11 percent. The region's aluminum industry also 
has reactivated some idle capacity. But layoffs continue in a number 
of other important industries however. The paper industry continues 
its cost-cutting efforts in the face of weak demand. In both 
California and Washington, the aerospace equipment manufacturing 
sector has been benefiting from increased defense business, but 
weakness in civilian markets for aircraft and electronic equipment 
have continued to reduce overall industry payrolls. In the 
Intermountain states—Arizona, Nevada, Utah—the nonferrous metals 
industries are once again experiencing depressed demand now that the 
likelihood of a copper strike has diminished. Throughout the 
District, capital goods industries that produce such goods as 
trucks, machinery and equipment and ships, have yet to experience a 
turnaround in demand. The decline in oil prices is depressing oil 
drilling activity and revenues in Alaska and California and causing 
layoffs at Intermountain coal and uranium mining sites.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The West shared in the moderate decline in housing starts and 
building permits recorded nationally in March, suggesting that the 
pace of residential construction in the district in coming months 
may not be quite as high as during the first two months. But housing 
analysts still expect regional homebuilding activity to be at least 
50 percent better for the year than last year's depressed level. 
They stress, however, that homebuilding activity could drop much 
more sharply during the rest of the year if mortgage rates do not 
fall further. This is because homebuilders built inventory during 
the first quarter in the expectation that rates would fall further, 
qualifying more buyers. If the decline is not realized, they will be 
caught with excess inventory and reduce construction sharply. The 
fact that most of the new homes being constructed are at the lower 
price range and that many carry subsidized FHA/VA mortgages also 
suggests that the recovery will not be sustained unless rates fall 
further to make homes affordable to a greater segment of the public. 
Lower rates also are needed to offset rising home prices. In the 
non-residential sector, construction is reported to be slowing due 
to the high vacancy rates in most metropolitan areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rain storms continued in California through April causing further 
adverse consequences for the agricultural sector. In addition to an 
estimated $300 million in crop losses sustained earlier in the year, 
farmers face further financial losses as a result of continued 
delays in plantings of important row crops such as lettuce, tomatoes 
and onions. Prices for these products have risen sharply in the past 
few months but volume has been so reduced as to result in far less 
than normal revenues. Also, the storms seriously reduced the 
prospective nut crop by preventing pollination of blooming orchards. 
Although prices for livestock, grains and a wide array of other farm 
products also rose in April, District farmers and ranchers expect 
1983 to be another difficult year, with net income showing little, 
if any, improvement over 1982's depressed level. Large world crop 
supplies, weak overseas economies and the rising value of the U.S. 
dollar are combining to lower exports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although Twelfth District banks have been aggressively promoting 
commercial and consumer loans as an outlet for the huge inflow of 
funds generated by the MMDA's, demand for those types of loans 
remained sluggish during April. Real estate loans showed a similar 
pattern. But since institutions are reporting strong real estate 
lending activity, this probably just means that the recovery in the 
housing market has yet to translate into an increase in the 
aggregate statistics on real estate loans. Banks are noting an 
increase in both loan inquiries and new loan extensions which 
coincides with the fall in mortgage rates and consequent surge in 
housing starts and permits during the first quarter. An additional 
favorable indicator that a homebuilding recovery is underway is that
the majority of the lending activity in recent months has 
represented new credit extensions, rather than the refinancing of 
old loans.
