      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 12, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Responses to our latest survey of District manufacturers suggest 
  some slowing in the rate of expansion over the past month. Shipments 
  continued to grow but new orders were essentially flat and backlogs 
  of orders declined somewhat. Inventories were unchanged, remaining 
  moderately above desired levels, and inventory policies continue on 
  the cautious side. Retailers, on the other hand, report improvement 
  in sales and relative sales of big ticket items over the past month. 
  Expectations have become mixed. Manufacturers surveyed have turned 
  decidedly pessimistic about the national outlook while retailers and 
  Richmond Directors retain basically positive expectations for the 
  second half of the year. Credit market activity in the District is 
  brisk, with some institutions reporting record consumer and 
  commercial lending in June. Real estate lending, while showing some 
  signs of tapering, is still vigorous.
       </p>
       <p>
        District manufacturers continued to expand employment and weekly 
  hours over the past month as their shipments continued to increase. 
  But in the face of stable new orders some reduction in backlogs 
  resulted and further improvement in employment are doubtful. 
  Inventories of both materials and finished goods were virtually 
  unchanged and inventory positions relative to desired levels 
  improved slightly. Although one-third of the manufacturers surveyed 
  view current stocks as excessive, a small number consider them 
  inadequate. Most respondents view current plant and equipment 
  capacity as about right and there is little sentiment for altering 
  current expansion plans. Manufacturers also continue to report 
  widespread price increases, but such reports were slightly less 
  common this month than last.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers' responses were somewhat more positive. Total sales were 
  up in June as were relative sales of big ticket items. There is some 
  question, however, as to whether these increases involve more than 
  just price changes. Nonetheless, retailers are encouraged by recent 
  performance and look for continued improvement. Inventories at 
  retail were larger than a month ago, but remain in line with desired 
  levels. One of our Directors attributes current satisfaction with 
  inventories to the relatively strong sales activity of recent weeks. 
  He feels that even a minor reversal in sales would lead to a rapid 
  turnaround in retailers' views of current inventory levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Current expectations vary widely from sector to sector. 
  Manufacturing respondents have become pessimistic over the past 
  several months; half now expect the general level of business 
  activity nationally to worsen over the next six months. Their 
  expectations for their respective firms and market areas are not 
  quite that weak, but are essentially negative. Retailers, on the 
  other hand, are basically optimistic, with most expecting further 
  improvement nationally, locally, and in their respective firms over 
  the remainder of the year. Most of our Directors who commented on 
  this topic expect second-half growth, nationally, to be somewhat 
  below that for the first half of the year. Specifically, they expect 
  real GNP growth in the 3-4 percent range. Current perceptions of 
  local labor market conditions are likewise varied. Comments by 
  Directors suggest some tightness in markets for specific types of 
  employees and in areas which have recently experienced rapid growth 
  or development. Otherwise there is no indication of impending 
  constraints arising from labor market conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bank business lending seems to be generally stronger than expected. 
  Recent increases in commercial and industrial loans have been 
  concentrated in the durable goods, retail trade, and transportation 
  sectors. The coal industry has also been a big borrower of late, 
  leading West Virginia banks to increase their requests for loan 
  participations with correspondent banks. A clear cut pattern has 
  emerged in business use of loan proceeds, with capital expenditure 
  financing explaining the largest part of commercial and industrial 
  loan demand. Consumer installment loans of commercial banks have 
  increased rapidly in recent weeks, largely as a result of healthy 
  automobile sales. Bankers seem to expect continued strong demand for 
  installment loans over the near-term, although some note that 
  consumers' interest in big ticket items may be cooling off. Demand 
  for residential mortgages continues strong, and is responding only 
  moderately to increases in interest rates. Real estate loan demand 
  is not limited to the single-family area. There is still interest in 
  borrowing to finance construction of apartments and condominiums, 
  although the latter are intended as primary residences, not second 
  homes. Area banks seem generally comfortable with their liquidity 
  positions, but thrift institutions are concerned about low rates of 
  deposit growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The District's total cash farm income, led by significantly higher 
  livestock receipts, continues to show a slight improvement over a 
  year ago. Soil moisture conditions throughout the District were 
  marked by considerable diversity as of July 1. Moisture levels 
  ranged from short to very short in South Carolina, with drought 
  conditions broadening and cutting yield prospects, to mostly 
  adequate to surplus in West Virginia. Elsewhere, soil moisture was 
  also short in slightly more than half of North Carolina but 
  generally adequate in Maryland and Virginia. While conditions of 
  most field crops and pastures were generally rated as fair to good, 
  apple and peach prospects were reported as good to excellent.
