      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 5, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Fuel stringencies appear to have pushed an already shaky economy 
  into a significant decline. Profound changes in thinking and 
  planning by consumers, businessmen, and lenders are inevitable. 
  Consumer purchases of low-mileage vehicles have dropped very 
  sharply. The Seventh District has not been afflicted with long lines 
  at gas stations, but driving has been curtailed with adverse 
  consequences for tourism and other nonessential activities involving 
  travel. The "strike" of the independent truckers has had some 
  limited effect in reducing availability of produce and fuel. Demand 
  for most types of capital equipment remains vigorous, but some 
  producers report slower orders. Some easing has occurred in demand 
  for basic materials such as steel and paperboard. Price inflation 
  has accelerated, especially products based on petroleum. Major labor 
  contracts have exceeded the guidelines. Residential construction and 
  sales of existing homes remain seriously depressed. Early 
  development of district corn and soybean crops is rated as "good." Higher grain and soybean prices are boosting farm income prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Supplies of gasoline and diesel fuel in the district are probably 
  about 10 percent below year ago, although no one knows for sure. 
  Some stations are on 70 percent allocations or less. Demand would 
  have been up about 3 percent, assuming last year's prices, according 
  to industry analysts.
     </p>
     <p>
      District states have generally avoided significant lines at gas 
  stations, but this has been possible only because motorists have 
  curtailed nonessential driving. Dealers have used various devices to 
  discourage sales, usually by shortening hours and/or shutting down 
  weekends and some week days. Auto clubs have warned motorists to 
  stay close to home. As a result, those who have ventured out on 
  trips often report ample supplies. The worst spot fuel shortages 
  have been associated with efforts of independent truckers to impede 
  deliveries. The truck strikes, ironically, have improved fuel 
  supplies in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Diesel stringencies have caused sharp price increases and are 
  reported to have slowed some construction work. Large truckers 
  report diesel "tight but adequate." The financially troubled 
  Milwaukee Road has indicated that its service, vital to some areas 
  in Wisconsin and Iowa, may be reduced. Diesel fuel for barge and 
  lake-boat traffic is also very tight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most large trucking firms have their own storage tanks. They put in 
  reserve supplies in the spring, and seem to be operating normally.
     </p>
     <p>
      The independent truckers (owner-operators), who use truck stops 
  almost exclusively, have attempted, with varying success, to block 
  shipments of fuel and farm products. The strikes have been most 
  effective in impeding shipments of animals to slaughter. Operations 
  of some hog-processing plants have been halted temporarily. Receipts 
  of fresh produce at terminals have been reduced, but few stockouts 
  are reported. Deliveries of fuel have been disrupted for varying 
  periods, although tank wagon drivers are not directly involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      The independent truckers' strikes are not supported by the 
  Teamsters. The independents are only loosely organized. In this area 
  they carry mainly "exempt" commodities which are not subject to ICC 
  rate regulations. They are stopping their "own kind," not wanting to 
  tangle with the Teamsters by stopping regulated truckers. Demands of 
  the independents are somewhat amorphousâ€”adequate fuel and/or fuel 
  subsidies, relaxed restrictions on weight and length of rigs, etc.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports indicate a substantial drop in business at distant resort 
  areas and outlying shops and restaurants in metro areas. A drastic 
  falloff in demand has been reported for RVs (down 60-70 percent), 
  vans, light trucks, and large cars. For the first time in memory 
  there is even a substantial surplus of Cadillacs. Production has 
  been cut back and layoffs have resulted. The model year clean up 
  will involve unprecedented problems. Prices of large used cars have 
  plummeted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conversely, long waiting lists are reported for desirable small cars 
  which are selling at full list price. Supplies of four-cylinder 
  engines, unexpectedly, have become a bottleneck.
     </p>
     <p>
      The gas shortage has aided some activities. Entertainment and 
  recreational areas close to home are enjoying improved business. 
  Sales of bicycles, mopeds, hand mowers, and gas tank locks have 
  boomed (where available).
      <p>
       <p>
        Commercial construction is booming, particularly in Chicago's Loop, 
  and new contracts for stores and office buildings remain at a high 
  level. Plant construction activity is well above year ago, but new 
  contracts have dropped off. The residential sector is in trouble. 
  Chicago area permits are 40 percent below year ago for five months. 
  Existing homes have sold very slowly, despite sizable price cuts, 
  which have dropped prices below year ago in some areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for capital goods, overall, remains vigorous, but some 
  diversified producers report a slower order trend. Machine tool 
  producers are booked well into 1980. Heavy trucks and most types of 
  construction and farm equipment continue to sell at a fast pace. 
  However, a producer of castings for capital goods reports order 
  cancellations for the first time since 1975.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for workers appears to have eased, particularly in the auto 
  centers. However, Chicago help-wanted ad volume is still above year 
  ago. Demand remains intense for really skilled workers in 
  metalworking trades, the building trades, most white collar 
  occupations, and for professionals generally. Labor pacts have 
  generally exceeded the guidelines. The UAL settlement may be worth 
  40 percent for three years. Chicago-area carpenters and bricklayers 
  each received a 10 percent boost raising their total compensation to 
  $15 per hour ($30,000 per year), with another 10 percent increase 
  slated for 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        Collective bargaining is extending to additional fields. A Chicago-
  area department store chain recently agreed to a union contract, the 
  first of its kind. A strike of 3,000 Cook County nursing-home 
  employees began on July 1, with demands for a 54 percent increase in 
  compensation over three years.
