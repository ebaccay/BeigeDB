     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 14, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The recession continues to be felt in the Twelfth District, as 
sluggish economic activity was reported throughout the region. 
Retail sales generally were down despite increased promotional 
activities. A variety of labor issues were of major interest during 
the past month. Strikes and the potential for strikes involving a 
substantial number of workers were reported throughout the district. 
Interest rates and unemployment both continue to be high and concern 
is expressed over this continuing phenomenon. Mortgage loan demand 
has fallen drastically in response to movements in interest rates. 
Commercial loan demand has also fallen but large corporate borrowing 
remains at its past rapid pace. The agricultural picture remains 
bright as good harvests and profits are anticipated. Industrial 
activity remains stable with little change in behavior expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The EMPLOYMENT picture in the region has centered on a variety of 
labor negotiations. Both the 71 day old Kennecott Copper strike and 
the strike by winery workers have ended. One mine workers' agreement 
has been reached while another is still in negotiations. The 
possibility of an aerospace workers' strike involving over 30,000 
employees was diverted with the recent acceptance of a contract 
package. The unemployment situation is regarded as serious in many 
industries, but particularly in the automobile, steel and 
construction sectors. A notable exception to this situation is the 
electronics industry where demand for skilled workers is still high. 
A number of respondents feared that the unemployment picture for 
minorities may aggravate racial tensions.
     </p>
     <p>
      AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY is reported to be good throughout the Twelfth 
District. Excellent harvests are predicted for a variety of crops, 
with record harvests expected in some areas. The drought conditions 
in some areas of the country have created high prices for a number 
of crops, especially potatoes. The current heat wave in some parts 
of the district has created concern for the plum, peach, and 
nectarine harvests. The high price of cattle feed has brought on 
expectations of higher meat prices in the coming months. However, 
given reports of increases in herd size, some believe that increased 
supply will help to hold down meat prices next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Little change in the INDUSTRIAL sector was reported. Most businesses 
are continuing with past investment plans despite the rise in 
interest rates. In general, investment activity is low and 
inventories are reported to be below normal in a number of 
industries. This was created concern of higher prices when the 
recovery begins. For some industries, the slack in domestic business 
is made up by above normal foreign sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recovery of RETAIL SALES continues to be slow. Although some 
areas are reporting an increase in sales brought about by seasonal 
factors, retail sales in most areas are down. The use of credit 
cards is still way below normal. While some specialty shops and more 
expensive stores are reporting increased sales, most stores are 
reporting sluggish sales and large inventories. A number of areas 
note a sharp rise in promotional activity. Whether this increase in 
advertising is in response to feelings of a shift in consumer 
spending moods or an attempt to decrease inventories is uncertain. 
Also present are reports of manufacturers offering discounts off 
list price.
     </p>
     <p>
      The HOUSING market has been drastically hurt by the increase in 
interest rates. Mortgage rates of 14 percent and higher have 
severely reduced the demand for mortgage loans. The filing of 
permits for new construction has also been sharply curtailed. 
Property is staying on the market much longer than in the past few 
months. The lumber industry has been especially hard hit by the 
decrease in housing activity. Demand has been flat and unemployment 
in the sector is very high.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS is widely regarded as gloomy. 
Expectations of higher costs and declining markets are expressed. 
The rise in interest rates has brought about an outflow of deposits 
as savers are moving their funds to money market instruments. Rising 
rates have also had a dampening effect on the demand for loans by 
small borrowers. However, the demand for loans by large corporate 
borrowers does not appear to be affected by the increase in interest 
rates. This stable behavior is believed to be due to the fear of 
even higher rates in the future, deferment of long-term financing 
due to conditions in the bond market, and the relative narrowness of 
spreads between the prime and commercial paper rates. A great deal 
of concern was expressed over the coming of NOW accounts. Also 
discussed was the potential for problems created by a change in the 
pricing behavior of financial institutions brought on by movements 
towards deregulation. Additional concern was expressed about the 
increase in bankruptcies and loan losses.
