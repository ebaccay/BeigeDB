      Beige Book: National Summary

      <strong>
       December 10, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Reserve Banks this month indicate, on 
balance, a definite weakening in the economy, with widespread 
prospects for a W-shaped recession resulting from sharply rising 
interest rates. While manufacturing is generally slowing, modest 
gains in orders are still prevalent. Inventories at the 
manufacturing and retailing levels are considered to be 
satisfactory, but in some cases are described as lean. Consumer 
spending in the early part of the Christmas season has been 
disappointing, but retailers expect heavy discounting to provide a 
strong finish. Bank loan demand is weak, with business loans 
generally holding up better than consumer loans. Mortgage lending is 
depressed, as rates reach as high as 16% in some districts. Farm
price increases have strengthened the agricultural sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The effect of rising interest rates on housing, autos, and 
business investment is blamed for a weakening economic outlook. 
Economic activity in the past month has been relatively unchanged in 
Boston and St. Louis, but is becoming sluggish in most other Reserve 
Banks. Only Atlanta reports strengthening, except for housing and 
auto sectors. Expectations of a resumption of recession are 
mentioned by Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco. 
Several bank economists in Cleveland now view the recent recovery as 
a temporary lull from the recession. Respondents in New York, 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond expect conditions to improve 
by the second half of 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sluggish or slowing manufacturing activity 
is indicated in Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Kansas 
City. However, high interest rates have not prevented widespread 
gains in manufacturing employment in Atlanta, or increases in new 
orders in Boston and Chicago. Manufacturing has improved somewhat in 
Dallas, based on strength in chemical and energy industries. 
Richmond reports mild declines that cut across most industry groups, 
while Philadelphia reports a sharp downturn in early December. 
Cleveland and Chicago are experiencing sustained strength in steel 
orders, partly related to a turnaround of inventories, but both 
report that no revival in capital goods orders has occurred yet. 
Some machine toolmakers in New York report weakening sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inventories are generally reported to be under tight 
control at both manufacturing and retailing levels, mostly because 
of the high cost of financing. Several Reserve Banks note that 
inventories of some items are quite lean at the retail level. 
However, inventory problems with autos and housing are cited by 
Boston and Richmond. St. Louis and Cleveland expect quick 
adjustments to inventories, notably in steel and autos, following an 
economic slowdown. Chicago reports that retailers may still find 
January liquidation sales necessary despite clamps on stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have shown mild strength in Kansas 
City, Dallas, Richmond, and Atlanta, but are flat or sluggish in 
most other Reserve Banks. Heavy traffic is reported by Chicago, but 
buying is said to be restrained, especially for big-ticket items. 
Consumer durable sales fell substantially in San Francisco, and 
Richmond reports durable goods sales remain weak. Heavy promotions 
are reported in most districts and are the basis for relative 
optimism among retailers for a healthy Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Auto Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales are generally described as weak or declining, 
according to most Reserve Banks, because of rising interest rates 
and high prices on new models. Sales are off in Minneapolis, Kansas 
City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Some gains are noted in Boston over 
year-ago levels and in St. Louis over summer levels, but dealers 
view such gains as unsatisfactory. While domestic sales are stagnant 
in New York, foreign car sales picked up. Dallas sales are hampered 
by a usury ceiling that makes auto loans unprofitable. Some banks in 
Cleveland and Chicago are reluctant to finance dealer floor plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mortgage lending activity continues to weaken, with Boston, 
Chicago, Atlanta, and San Francisco experiencing a virtual halt in 
mortgage loans. Mortgage rates at or near 16% in Chicago and San 
Francisco are apparently the highest in the nation. Philadelphia 
reports that seasonal declines and tight mortgage money have 
contributed to curtailed sales at a level 40 to 65% below last June. 
The difficulty over qualifying for financing is particularly noted 
by San Francisco, while St. Louis reports that three-fourths of loan 
applications are rejected. Some banks in Cleveland are providing 
preferential rates to builders who they financed, and St. Louis 
reports that builders are subsidizing home buyers by offering below 
market rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although loan demand is generally soft, some improvements 
in business loan demand are cited by Dallas, Kansas City, and St. 
Louis. Sources of the loan strength are restricted to energy and 
agricultural industries, although business loans in St. Louis appear 
to be supporting Christmas inventories. Richmond reports a mild 
increase in installment credit. Bankers in Minneapolis state that 
funds are available, and several districts report that deposit 
growth is supported by large CDs. Both St. Louis and San Francisco 
stress that much of the business borrowing is short-term. Strong 
business loan demand, centered in inventory financing and in 
substitution of business loans for commercial paper, is also 
reported by New York.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural production and farm income are relatively 
strong as a result of rising farm prices. St. Louis reports a sharp 
increase in wheat acreage and expects a substantial increase in 
double cropping of wheat acreage in 1981, if prices hold. Kansas 
City states that credit conditions have shown sustained improvement 
and Dallas notes an increase in the usage of Government agencies for 
loans at lower interest rates than banks. However, farm income 
prospects have dimmed in Atlanta, as prices for meat, citrus crops, 
and cotton decline.
