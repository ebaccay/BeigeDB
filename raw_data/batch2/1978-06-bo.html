      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Directors and other Red Book respondents of the Federal Reserve Bank 
  of Boston report strong economic growth which they expect to 
  continue throughout the year. One pattern that emerged clearly is 
  that while many executives are worried about the economy as a whole, 
  their own businesses are doing very well; several respondents gave 
  the opinion that the published data are not reflecting the true 
  strength of the economy. Commercial and industrial loan demand is 
  growing strongly and production and employment in the First District 
  are up. Retail sales remain healthy although some concern has been 
  expressed about the future. Tightness is reported in the market for 
  skilled labor in the electronics industry and shortages of some 
  types of aluminum are expected later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The chief economist of a large electrical equipment manufacturer 
  reports very strong demand in both consumer and industrial markets. 
  This company's domestic capital goods orders are up by about 25 
  percent over last year and major appliances and other consumer 
  durables are also doing very well. A Connecticut director reports 
  that manufacturers across the state are experiencing very strong 
  growth in orders and sales. This pattern was also reflected in the 
  comments of directors from other parts of the region. The Chairman 
  of the Board of a local department store chain reports continued 
  strong sales although he is highly concerned about the impact of 
  inflation on consumer sentiment later this year. Retail inventories 
  are somewhat higher than desirable although they are not a cause of 
  great concern at this point. Loan demand continues to be very strong 
  in the northern New England states and is also improving at the 
  large Boston banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recently completed survey of small businesses across New England 
  indicates that many are planning price increases and several have 
  had substantial wage settlements in the last few months. All of 
  those participating in the Red Book calls expressed great concern 
  about inflation. Several Massachusetts electronics companies 
  reported shortages of skilled technicians, electrical engineers and 
  other technical professionals. A large manufacturer of aircraft 
  components expects shortages of aluminum to develop next year and 
  also reports difficulties in finding machinists in some locations. 
  However, this bank's survey of potential bottlenecks indicated that 
  widespread shortages or capacity problems are not expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        A survey conducted to obtain the requested information on the new 
  six-month time certificate found that practically all but the 
  smallest commercial and savings banks are offering the new 
  certificate. But about one-fifth of the cooperative banks (small 
  state-chartered savings and loan associations) in Massachusetts are 
  reported offering them.
       </p>
       <p>
        A.	All but one are offering the maximum rate and that one is a 
  cooperative bank in Rhode Island paying the auction rate plus one-eighth.
       </p>
       <p>
        B.	Around one-half of the larger institutions are advertising 
  heavily.
       </p>
       <p>
        C.	Heavy advertisers generally had good inflows. Savings banks 
  with the higher rate generally had relatively better inflows than 
  commercial banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        D.	Those with good inflows report that one-half or more is 
  outside money, while among the others very little is outside money.
       </p>
       <p>
        E.	Respondents generally are not very enthusiastic about future 
  prospects. After the initial flurry, they think inflows will taper 
  off. Respondents think this money is expensive and they are 
  apprehensive about the future, fearing that bill rates may rise to 
  eight or nine percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, and Samuelson were available for 
  comment this month. They all agreed that the recent surge in 
  consumer prices does not imply an increase in the underlying "hardcore" inflation rate. Further, none of the three believed the 
  acceleration to be the result of widespread "excess demand." Eckstein noted that the rate of price advance is no worse than was 
  previously expected, while both Houthakker and Samuelson felt that 
  they would require more confirming evidence than they have yet seen 
  before concluding that unemployment has reached its natural rate or 
  that full capacity output has been achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        All respondents favored the maintenance of the current posture of 
  monetary policy. Eckstein believes that no further policy changes 
  should be attempted until incoming data reveal the effect of earlier 
  rounds of tightening on the economy. In his view, current policy 
  seems to be producing the desired effectsâ€”witness the deceleration 
  in the rate of money growth and the increase in mortgage ratesâ€”so 
  that it would be a mistake for the Fed to use up all of its "margin 
  for movement" at the present time. He expects a slowdown in the 
  economy to begin in August or September due to declining housing 
  starts as disintermediation intensifies and weak consumption 
  spending as households reduce excessive debt burdens. According to 
  Samuelson, current policy should aim at avoiding less than 3 percent 
  real growth in 1979. He feels that a "preventive growth recession" 
  is not necessarily desirable, and therefore urges the Fed to "dig in 
  its heels" to prevent a too rapid tightening of credit markets. 
  Houthakker agrees that current monetary policy is appropriate, 
  although he would like to see it accompanied by a substantial 
  reduction in the Federal budget deficit.
