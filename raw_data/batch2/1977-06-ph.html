      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is expanding but at an 
uneven pace. Sales at area department stores are reported to be 
mixed, while activity in the industrial sector continues to expand. 
New orders and shipments are higher than in May, while inventories 
remain stable. Employment and the workweek also continue to 
increase. For the longer term, retailers report widely differing 
sales forecasts while manufacturers anticipate additional 
improvement in business conditions. Plans for increases in capital 
spending over the next two quarters are less widespread than in 
previous months. Commercial bankers say that business loan demand is 
flat, but consumer loans are increasing. Housing markets are active, 
but with the exception of Atlantic City, no speculation in real 
estate is reported.
      <p>
       Manufacturers responding to the latest Business Outlook Survey 
  report that general business conditions are better than in May. Of 
  the executives surveyed, 42 percent say that business has improved 
  this month. This is similar to the proportion reporting gains in the 
  previous survey. New orders and shipments are higher in June, and 
  inventories remain unchanged after increasing fractionally last 
  month. At the same time, employment and the average workweek in the 
  industrial sector continue to expand, although the gains are not as 
  widespread as in May.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the longer term, manufacturers continue to be optimistic. More 
  than two-thirds of those polled expect better business conditions by 
  year-end. Specific increases are projected in new orders by about 
  two-thirds of the respondents, and shipments are expected to climb 
  at a similar proportion of the sampled firms. At the same time, 
  inventory levels are expected to increase over the period, and gains 
  in employment are forecast as well. One out of three respondents 
  plans to add to their work forces by December, and one out of five 
  foresees a longer workweek. Increases in capital spending six months 
  out are anticipated at one-third of the firms polled. This is down 
  somewhat from last month and the lowest fraction since last summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices in the industrial sector continue to climb but increases are 
  no more widespread than in May. Fifty-six percent of those sampled 
  report paying higher prices for their inputs, while 29 percent are 
  receiving higher prices for the products they sell. By December, 
  about eight out of ten expect to be paying more for supplies and 
  seven out of ten anticipate receiving higher prices for their 
  finished products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department store sales in the area are mixed. Reports of current 
  dollar sales range from 17 percent above to 8 percent below year-ago 
  levels. For the most part, merchants say that sales are running 
  somewhat below their expectations. They cite unseasonably cool 
  weather, a public transit strike early in May, and going-out-of-business sales by a major competitor as reasons for sluggish 
  performance. In general, inventories are said to be in reasonably 
  good shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the longer term, some retailers expect sales to remain weak 
  throughout the next two quarters, while others look for a pickup. 
  One merchant expects sales by the end of the year to be "about the 
  same as last year in real terms with a 5 percent increase in current 
  dollar sales."
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers in the region report that while consumer loans are 
  expanding, business loan demand remains essentially flat. All of the 
  banks contacted have hiked their prime rate to 6 3/4 percent, but 
  bankers say that this has probably not slowed loan demand. One notes 
  that his bank has made a few loans at rates below prime in order to 
  attract some non-local customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the longer term, bankers look for moderate gains in business 
  loans and further increases in interest rates. One banker expects 
  commercial and industrial loan volume by the end of this year to be 
  about 6 percent above year-end '76. He notes that loan volume is 
  currently running behind that expectation. At the same time, gradual 
  increases in interest rates are expected with a prime rate at the 
  end of the year in the 7-7 1/2 percent range.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subject of real estate speculation was discussed with several 
  contacts at various locations in the Third District. With the 
  exception of Atlantic City, there are no reports of any speculative 
  activity. Mortgage lending is reported to be strong in some parts of 
  the District, but there is little in the way of "second mortgage" 
  activity at the institutions surveyed. One executive of a large MSB 
  in Philadelphia notes that, "We don't have any speculation in this 
  area, and we don't expect to see any." According to this official, 
  land prices and construction costs are going up at "expected" rates 
  and appraisals of existing housing are not climbing "inordinately." Moreover, he adds that there is little or no excess demand for 
  housing in the region, and this type of market will not support much 
  speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial bankers in the Pocono Mountains resort area say that 
  residential and commercial real estate markets appear to be "orderly"â€”sales activity and price movements are well in line with 
  their expectations. In the Lancaster area, price increases for 
  housing and farmland are about the same as last year. Some farmland 
  there is being converted to commercial use, and all land that is 
  being sold appears to be for the immediate active use of the buyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       One area where real estate prices have gone up at a much faster rate 
  than in the past is Atlantic City. An official with that city's 
  Housing Authority attributes this to the recent legalization of 
  casino gambling in that city. In one case, a lot which sold for $800 
  before the casino referendum sold for $10,000 afterwards. In this 
  contact's view, "Some of these prices seem out of line, but with the 
  casinos on the horizon, who knows?"
