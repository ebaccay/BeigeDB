     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 10, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In recent weeks the economic recovery grew stronger in much of the 
Second District. Retail activity was very brisk in June, and though 
the July pace was a little slower, sales remained well above year-ago levels at most stores. Additional signs of strength were evident 
in the housing and nonresidential real estate markets. Business 
activity continued to pick up in the manufacturing sector where 
producers of many different goods reported rising orders. However, 
manufacturers remain generally cautious about production increases 
and new hirings, and demand for new business loans is still slack. 
Agricultural conditions are mixed. Fruit and field crops look good, 
but the dry weather in July has hurt the vegetable crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers described their June sales as "outstanding" and 
"extraordinary." Most of our respondents, representing a broad range 
of income markets, also posted double-digit gains over year-ago 
levels in July. One suburban discount chain reported that July sales 
were "gangbusters," up 25 to 30 percent. Others felt the July pace 
was not quite as good as the prior month but attributed the slight 
falloff to special factors such as hot weather or store remodeling. 
They saw nothing to indicate a slowdown in the recovery. The only 
report of sluggish demand came from an upstate New York chain of 
department stores; lingering weakness in some local economies held 
gains there to only two percent above last year. Respondents 
indicated they were increasing their inventories in anticipation of 
greater activity. Two were letting their stocks rise faster than 
sales. The competitive environment, which had been quite fierce 
earlier this year, appeared to be easing, but the level of 
promotional activity generally remained high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity remained at a high level during 
recent weeks. Many homebuilders have enough contracts to carry them 
through the rest of the year. In fact, the industry has been so busy 
in some areas that a significant shortage of skilled labor has 
materialized. While the current levels of sales and construction 
activity are quite high, builders are wary about the recent upturn 
in interest rates; they fear higher mortgage rates could cut the 
demand for homes next year. However, future construction activity is 
likely to be stimulated by recent New York State legislation which 
will provide millions of dollars in low interest loans for the 
private construction of multifamily, rental housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The nonresidential real estate sector appeared to be strengthening 
further, especially in suburban areas.  The rate at which available 
space is being leased has picked up significantly, and ground was 
broken for a number of office buildings in New Jersey and 
Connecticut. Work on ongoing projects continued strong. Although 
announcements of new construction projects in New York City are 
expected to remain scarce for awhile, several promising properties 
were purchased by developers in the downtown Manhattan areaâ€”indicating a definite firming in market conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity continued to pick up in the manufacturing sector. 
Manufacturers of diverse producer and consumer goods, such as 
chemicals, electrical equipment, home weather stripping, and toys, 
reported that orders were rising. Auto parts suppliers noted that 
their upswing has been maintained, and several defense companies 
were awarded sizable contracts. Businessmen generally are now 
convinced that the economy will continue to expand but they remain 
cautious, nonetheless. Production increases still are being 
scheduled primarily to meet incoming orders rather than to rebuild 
inventories. Moreover, while recalls have significantly reduced the 
number of employees on layoff, few firms are expected to add new 
workers soon. One respondent thought it would take several more 
months of improvement before firms would make long-range commitments 
to capital projects or substantial new hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the agricultural sector vary by product. The New York 
fruit crop looks favorable, and growers are anticipating attractive 
prices as well. Field crops have recovered from earlier bad weather, 
although first cuttings are occurring a few weeks later than usual. 
In contrast, vegetable yields have been threatened by an unusually 
dry July. Dairy farmers are concerned about rising production costs; 
grain prices have begun moving upward in response to PIK-related 
crop reductions, and a general buildup in herd size is expected to 
exert further pressure on feed costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The strong economic recovery nationwide has not been reflected in 
the demand for business loans at Second District regional banks. In 
July, these banks reported only a slight increase in business loans 
outstanding, mostly stemming from take-downs under existing lines of 
credit, and almost no increase in new applications for business 
loans. In contrast, in the consumer sector, strong increases in the 
demand for creditâ€”for auto purchases, personal loans, and charge 
card purchasesâ€”seem to reflect rising consumer confidence and ample 
loanable funds at banks. The demand for mortgage credit appears to 
have backed off a bit because of recent increases in long-term 
rates.
