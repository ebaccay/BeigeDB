      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 5, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business activity in the Second District activity appears to have 
  slowed in June, according to recent comments of directors and other 
  business leaders. Shortages of gasoline appear to have reduced 
  consumer spending. Department store sales were mixed, and sales of 
  new automobiles declined. For the most part, production levels of 
  manufacturers appear to have remained strong, although order 
  backlogs have been trimmed in some instances. While most respondents 
  voice little concern over the level of inventories, a growing number 
  noted that their inventories were growing. The work stoppage by 
  independent truckers appears to have delayed deliveries of many 
  products, but has yet to create substantial disruptions. On the
  financial scene, credit demands remain strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to reports from throughout the Second District, department 
  store sales were mixed in June. Respondents attributed at least part 
  of the slowing to shortages of gasoline. The present gasoline 
  shortage has apparently given a competitive edge to downtown stores; 
  sales in New York City reportedly were 5 to 10 percent higher than 
  last year, while suburban stores suffered declines of 5 to 10 
  percent. Despite these current problems, many retailers remain 
  optimistic about the future. Based on the experience of California, 
  they expect sales to return to normal once the gas crisis atmosphere 
  disappears. As a consequence, many merchants voiced little concern 
  over inventory levels. At the same time, however, less optimistic
  assessments were offered by a growing number of respondents. These 
  retailers reported they had lowered their sales projections, and 
  were holding down inventory stocks. In their view, consumers' heavy 
  indebtedness, the eroding purchasing power of consumers' incomes, 
  and uncertainties over the prospects for continued business 
  expansion were affecting consumer behavior.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to dampening department store sales, the gasoline 
  shortage appears to have weakened sales of new cars. In particular, 
  sales of large cars have slowed considerably. Sales of the more 
  fuel-efficient intermediate and small cars have remained strong or 
  in some instances have risen dramatically. Depleted inventories of 
  these small-sized cars were viewed by several automobile retailers 
  as restraining sales. While major automobile manufacturers announced 
  cutbacks in the production of large cars, the effect of the cutbacks 
  in New York and New Jersey are unlikely to be severe, since the 
  majority of assembly plants located here produce intermediate-and 
  small-sized cars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Outside of retailing, business activity also appears to be 
  moderating. Most producers are fully booked for the near term, but 
  order backlogs have fallen somewhat for paper products and 
  intermediate nonferrous metal products. For the most part, 
  production levels are remaining steady, a notable exception is one 
  major supplier of photographic equipment and supplies. This firm is 
  beginning to curtail production in response to weaker sales and some 
  buildup in inventories. At least at this point, however, most 
  business respondents report that inventory levels generally are in 
  line with shipments. Little concern was voiced over shortages,
  although a few firms are being adversely affected by shipping delays 
  and uncertainties due to transportation delays caused by the work 
  stoppage of independent truckers. Still, some materials in short 
  supply, plastic pellets for molded parts, and the costs of others, 
  such as feedstocks for chemicals, are rising rapidly.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the financial scene, the demand for credit remains strong. 
  Officials at several major banks in New York City report continued 
  strong demand for business loans. These respondents foresee no 
  marked weakness in the demand for business loans during the second 
  half of 1979. In their view, the demand for financing of 
  acquisitions and inventories will remain strong and bolster business 
  borrowing. With respect to current business loan demand, most 
  respondents failed to see any evidence that inventory accumulation 
  or the energy situation were playing an especially important role in 
  raising financing demands. Several bankers did cite the growing 
  importance of loans to finance acquisitions. The consensus view was 
  that the prime rate has peaked and will remain at its current level 
  through the third quarter and, in line with short-term market rates, 
  will decline during the fourth quarter. Outside of the business 
  sector, demand for consumer credit and home mortgages in the Second 
  District also remains strong. The directors of the Buffalo Branch 
  reported that the rise in New York State's usury ceiling on home 
  mortgage interest rates to 9 3/4 percent had had little impact on 
  the availability of mortgage funds, because it remained well below 
  market interest rates. In New Jersey, an official of a leading 
  thrift institution felt that the rise in that state's usury ceiling 
  to 10 1/2 percent had noticeably increased the supply of funds.
