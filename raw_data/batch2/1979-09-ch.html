     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 12, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The view that the economy has entered a recession is widely held in 
  the Seventh District, but many companies have not been affected 
  directly and foresee no crisis. The dichotomy between weak consumer 
  markets and relatively vigorous capital spending continues. However, 
  orders for equipment are slowing and backlogs of some companies are 
  declining. Labor markets have softened in most areas. Price 
  inflation has not abated. The farm sector is generally prosperous.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most executives in the district apparently accept the view that the 
  economy is in a recession that will be "short and shallow." 
  Frequently, they state that they have seen no sign of a decline 
  themselves, but, nevertheless, they are taking the usual precautions 
  of tightening up on new hiring, inventory investment, and, in some 
  cases, capital appropriations. They insist that their operations are 
  not as vulnerable as in late 1974, because of "lessons learned" in 
  1975.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although employment has probably leveled off overall in the 
  district, substantial layoffs have been confined to the motor 
  vehicle and recreational vehicle industries. Even in the depressed 
  residential sector, there are few signs of idle workers. But new 
  hiring is down. Help-wanted ads in Chicago papers dropped sharply in 
  August, after remaining at a high level through June.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumers continue to show caution on major purchases, but they 
  appear to have ample funds for "back-to-school" items and everyday 
  purchases. Lower-priced general merchandise chains appear to be 
  benefiting at the expense of luxury-oriented stores.
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial price cuts on overstocked autos have stimulated sales in 
  recent weeks. Nevertheless, 1980 model production schedules for 
  larger cars are still being reduced with periodic shutdowns of 
  assembly lines. Demand for light trucks and recreational vehicles 
  continues very weak. Sales of heavy trucks are holding at record 
  levels, but analysts are convinced that a, decline is inevitable 
  with 1980 down 20 percent or more.
       </p>
       <p>
        About one-third of Chrysler's hourly workforce is now on indefinite 
  layoff. Chrysler's future is of particular concern to the City of 
  Detroit where it is the largest employer. There are fears that at 
  least one major obsolete plant will be closed permanently. With 
  supplementary benefits, laid-off auto workers receive up to 95 
  percent of their normal take home pay. However, depletion of 
  Chrysler's SUB fund threatens this portion of the benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Orders for steel from the motor vehicle industry have been cut in 
  line with production schedules. Shipments to most other industries 
  remain well above last year. However, new orders, especially 
  advanced bookings, are well below shipments and backlogs are 
  declining.
       </p>
       <p>
        While most capital goods producers continue to operate at high 
  rates, the picture is increasingly spotty. Sales of farm equipment 
  continue very strong, and above earlier estimates. Electrical 
  components are still vigorous. Demand for construction equipment and 
  materials handling equipment, however, has eased off. New orders for 
  metal-cutting machine tools have leveled off, but backlogs are 
  expected to keep most producers going full blast into next year. 
  Orders for freight cars dropped suddenly in June. The freight car 
  backlog is large, but cancellations are possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gasoline supplies appear adequate if not ample. Many gas stations 
  have extended operating hours, but not to normal standards. Much of 
  the improvement reflects reduced driving. Summer traffic on 
  Interstates in Illinois was l4 percent below last year, compared to 
  a 22 percent shortfall in early June. The month of May had been even 
  with a year ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Heating oil supplies are further below desired levels in the Midwest 
  than elsewhere. However, experts believe that no serious shortages 
  will occur this winter, unless some new supply problem develops.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonresidential construction is still vigorous, especially for office 
  buildings and hotels. Builders are rushing construction of at least 
  10 large office buildings and hotels in downtown Chicago. Recently 
  another large office building of 1.1 million square feet was 
  announced. Some of the first buildings started in the current wave 
  will be occupied soon. Leasing is said to be proceeding at a rapid 
  pace. Existing high quality space is in tight supply. Rents are 
  reported to be up 25 percent from last year and 60 percent from 
  1977, partly because of escalation contracts. Hotel occupancy is 
  also strong and room rates are up 20 percent in about 18 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        The market for single-family homes in the Chicago area is probably 
  the weakest of any large metropolitan area. This situation does not 
  reflect a depressed local economy because employment and 
  unemployment data compare fairly well with national trends. 
  Moreover, mortgage money has been available, at about 10.5 percent 
  on 20 percent loans. The weak home market is blamed partly on three 
  successive severe winters, which may have encouraged net out-
  migration and a rapid expansion of the condominium market.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chicago area residential permits were 42 percent below year ago in 
  July, and off 40 percent for seven months. Single-family permits 
  were off 45 percent for July, and off 49 percent for seven months. 
  An unusually large number of existing homes are listed for sale, and 
  houses remain unsold for unusually long periods. Meanwhile, the 
  inventory of finished new homes is slim as few starts have been made 
  without firm orders. Prices of existing homes have declined in many 
  areas, especially on higher-priced units and units located away from 
  built up areas. Prices of new homes have continued to rise with 
  costs of labor and materials. Similar reports are heard from other 
  large urban areas in the district.
       </p>
       <p>
        A growing number of contractual payments, not only wages, but rents 
  and other outlays are automatically escalated. Many contracts cite 
  the local index. In July, when the all-city CPI was 11.3 percent 
  above last year, the indexes for Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee 
  were up 13.5, 12.8, and 14.9 percent, respectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this point, corn and soybean crops in the Midwest appear to be 
  heading for records or near-records. However, a severe early frost 
  could cause losses because of late plantings. Transportation tie-ups 
  in moving grain have been worsened by the Rock Island strike.
