      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      After holding up fairly well earlier in the recession, the economy 
of the Second District appeared to be weakening in May and early 
June. The unemployment rate for the region remained below the 
nation's, but there were signs of deterioration in many sectors and 
localities. Indeed, we were unable to find any concrete indications 
that an upturn had begun. Many of the gains scored by retailers in 
May could prove short-lived as early reports for June showed a 
decrease at some stores. Poor conditions generally prevailed in the 
residential construction sector. Nonresidential building was still 
brisk, but the outlook was uncertain as softness in the office 
rental market persisted. There was no letup in layoffs in the 
manufacturing sector and some producers noted sharp declines in 
their business. It was therefore not surprising to find business 
leaders generally more pessimistic than last month with few looking 
for any recovery before year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity increased in May, as many department stores finished 
the month above plan. The improvement could be short-lived, however, 
as some firms reported a weakening of sales in early June. 
Promotional activity was heavy throughout this period. Overall, 
nondurable goods generally sold well despite a softening in apparel 
sales at a few stores; sales of big ticket items like home 
furnishings stagnated. While inventories did not pose serious 
problems, stocks at some stores tended to the high side. Some 
retailers continued to expect the tax cut and social security 
increase to spur sales during the second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction remained depressed with sales and starts 
substantially below year-ago levels. As in our last report, 
observers noted some positive signs. In New York City, sales of 
existing homes were still brisk in Queens, and sales of cooperative 
apartments in small buildings improved in Brooklyn. In suburban 
areas, condominium construction increased modestly, and "buy downs" 
stimulated some homebuying.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for nonresidential construction weakened. Many 
developers throughout the District postponed groundbreakings for new 
buildings, but ongoing projects, like Battery Park City, are likely 
to sustain a high level of construction for the next few years. The 
office rental market was soft again this month in both city and 
suburban areas, enabling lessees to negotiate more favorable terms. 
Possibly foreshadowing further weakening of the midtown market, two 
firms—one in advertising and one in publishing—resisted large rent 
hikes by moving from prime space to less costly parts of Manhattan. 
Nonetheless, most respondents believed the office market was 
fundamentally sound. Demand for space was expected to grow rapidly
as banking and the international sector in general expand further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions varied widely across the region. Some previously 
strong areas, such as Syracuse, reported a softening and those 
already hard hit, such as Buffalo, deteriorated further. Although 
the rate of unemployment was essentially unchanged and still below 
the nation's, announcements of new workforce reductions continued. 
In industries such as oil and steel, firms shut down plants, some 
permanently. Companies postponed or even canceled capital 
expenditure plans, as capacity utilization fell and interest rates 
stayed high. For many producers business distinctly worsened. For 
example, a ball bearing manufacturer reported that new orders fell 
to only 10 percent of the level of a few weeks previous and were 
running below cancellations. Similarly, a furniture producer which 
had been prospering at the previously resilient luxury end of the 
market found that the demand for its goods had collapsed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business leaders, except for retailers, turned more pessimistic, and 
few looked for any upturn before the end of the year. As economic 
conditions have weakened across the region, hopes for an early 
turnaround have faded. Respondents from such previously strong areas 
as Rochester and Long Island are voicing much more concern than 
before, although their gloom does not approach that reported in 
Buffalo.
     </p>
     <p>
      The price slowdown continued, but contacts expressed little 
confidence in its permanency. Once demand picks up, prices are 
expected to rebound as firms restore profit margins. A more 
encouraging sign on the price front was the apparent moderation in 
wage settlements, with reports of increases in the 6 percent range 
not uncommon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from David Jones (Aubrey C. Lanston &amp; 
Co.), James O'Leary (U.S. Trust Co.) and Robert Stone (Irving Trust 
Co.): Their views of course are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jones: Three factors are tending to prop up interest rates, despite 
still pronounced recessionary tendencies. First, a commendably tight 
monetary policy. Second, heavy Federal government credit demands 
associated with an excessively loose fiscal policy. Third, large 
"desperation" business borrowing as profits-strained business 
competes with the Federal Government for funds to finance excessive 
inventory stocks, interest payments, wages and salaries and other 
necessities. The upshot is likely to be continued high interest 
rates through most, if not all, the remainder of 1982. Also, there 
could be mounting business failures, and major financial strains in 
the commercial paper and Eurodollar markets which could operate to 
virtually cut off financing to less credit worthy borrowers. 
Paradoxically, it may be that significant interest rate relief will 
not come until sustained economic recovery gets under way in 1983. 
Only then will business (those that survive the recession are likely 
to be lean, cost efficient, and highly productive) be able to 
generate sufficient profits to be able to pay off short-term debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Leary: During the balance of the year the political and public 
pressures on the Fed will intensify to an alarming level: (1) the 
current increase in interest rates, if it continues and is 
sustained, may deepen the recession or at least postpone any 
significant recovery; (2) the financial side of the economy is a 
minefield and "crowding out" is a serious danger; (3) the Fed does 
not have such room to maneuver before it begins to lose its 
credibility; (4) the widely expected bulge in money supply in July 
will present a very difficult problem for the Fed; (5) the fear 
remains high the huge Federal deficits and excessively easy credit 
will sooner or later lead to a new upward ratcheting of inflation; 
(6) the long-term capital market is especially vulnerable—due in 
part to the changed position of the life insurance companies it has 
lost such of its stability and is much more susceptible to wide 
swings in psychology.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unfortunately, the Fed has very little option and must adhere quite 
closely to its targets even if in the near term they contribute to a 
rise of short-term rates, prolongation of the recession, and intense 
political pressure. If instead the Fed permits the monetary base to 
expand at the rate it has increased so far this year or even higher, 
the result will be a sharp increase in interest rates in any event, 
especially long-term rates. Adherence to the monetary targets will 
keep the heat on the Administration and Congress to hold down the 
Federal deficit, which is where the real policy problem lies, not 
with Federal Reserve policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stone: The economy has reached bottom and activity has begun to turn 
up or will soon do so. Recovery is likely to be moderate however, 
and should interest rates not decline it may abort in late 1982 or 
early 1983. The market's focus is currently on the possibility of 
another bulge in the aggregates in July and on the large Treasury 
financing needs that loom ahead—all against the background of the 
heightened state of uncertainty in the aftermath of Drysdale. With 
all of this, it seems to me the appropriate course for the Fed is to 
hold to its present nonborrowed reserves path and to let borrowings 
rise to meet the increase in reserve requirements associated with 
the July bulge in the aggregates should it occur. But in view of the 
very fragile state of the market I believe the Fed should 
temporarily speed up the provision of nonborrowed reserves if the 
rate increases that would accompany such a rise in borrowings should 
seem disorderly or excessive.
