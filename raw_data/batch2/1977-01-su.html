      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        This month's District reports strongly suggest that the "pause" in 
the current recovery has ended and that the pace of business 
activity is regaining momentum. Virtually all reports indicate some 
improvement in economic activity. Retailers generally enjoyed a good 
to excellent Christmas season, with sales strengthening markedly 
toward the close of the season and with continued strength evident 
in early January. Business inventories appear to be in line with 
desired levels, except for scattered exceptions. There is additional 
evidence of strengthening in residential construction. While the 
capital investment picture remains mixed, there appears to be 
mounting evidence of an impending improvement in that sector. 
Prices, however, continue under upward pressures. The demand for 
commercial loans remains generally sluggish, and inflows into 
savings deposits continue at a high rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        As it has throughout the current recovery, consumer spending 
continues to provide the main thrust to the upswing. Retailers on 
the whole enjoyed a good Christmas season, with general merchandise 
sales rising above year-ago levels, in line with or exceeding 
expectations. The retail sales performance varied widely, however, 
ranging from unexpectedly strong and generally excellent (Boston, 
Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco) to above last year 
(Philadelphia, New York) and to a more restrained slightly improved 
(Richmond) and not overly strong (Kansas City). Auto sales, 
particularly those of standard or large size vehicles, are also 
mentioned as being particularly brisk by several Banks (including 
Minneapolis, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco). Although 
several Banks note that the improvement was achieved at least in 
part by dint of markdowns and other aggressive promotional 
activities, Chicago and New York report that by and large such 
activities did not reach exceptional proportions. A number of Banks 
report that the uptrend in sales that emerged as Christmas 
approached has continued in evidence in the immediate post-holiday 
period and early January. Atlanta and St. Louis thus report 
excellent results in post-Christmas promotions, and retail 
respondents in several Districts are reported to be cautiously 
optimistic regarding developments over the coming months. 
Respondents in the Minneapolis District feel that consumer 
confidence has improved since the election, but retailers in the 
Philadelphia District look for only moderate growth during 1977, 
with a sluggish first half.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those comments that were received on residential housing suggest 
that consumer outlays for new homes continue to gather momentum. San 
Francisco reports that the residential housing market is very strong 
and continues to strengthen each month, and Minneapolis notes that 
District authorizations of new housing are close to 1972's record 
levels. St. Louis reports homebuilding made considerable progress in 
that District in 1976 and that prospects are for further gains this 
year, while Dallas respondents expect homebuilding will continue to 
be a major source of strength in the southwestern economy. Boston, 
however, characterizes residential construction as a major weak spot 
in the New England economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inventories at the retail and/or manufacturing level were generally 
regarded to be about in line with sales and at desired levels, 
although there are scattered reports of undesirably high stocks of 
certain items, including some nonferrous metals, furniture, T.V.s, 
and smaller cars. Few indications of shortages were reported with 
the exception of an actual or potential dearth of natural gas 
mentioned by Richmond, Cleveland, and Minneapolis, as well as fuel 
oil in the Minneapolis District.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turning to business expenditures for plant and equipment, the pace 
of such outlays by and large continues to lack vigor, but there is 
growing evidence that a pickup in this sector might be getting under 
way. Thus, among others, Cleveland reports rising activity in the 
machine tool, communications equipment, printing equipment and heavy 
duty truck industries. Chicago reports a pickup in orders for mining 
equipment, a further expansion of planned equipment purchases by 
auto companies, and alludes to the prospects that various major 
projects kept on the "back burner" by the food processing, paper, 
chemical, and glass industries might be activated this year. 
Although St. Louis characterizes prospects for capital spending as 
mixed, it reports several announcements of sizable investment plans 
for 1977, and Atlanta reports that new industrial expansion 
continues rapid in its District. About one third of the 
manufacturers surveyed monthly by Philadelphia plan increases in 
capital expenditures over the coming months. Respondents in the San 
Francisco District feel that tax incentives would have positive, 
albeit slight, effects in stimulating capital investments, if such 
incentives were made a permanent part of the tax structure. 
Respondents in Dallas and New York felt that major capital outlays 
would be deferred until the direction of government policy became 
clearer.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the dark side, indications of increased upward pressure on prices 
were reported. Respondents in the Philadelphia monthly survey report 
that higher prices and costs are somewhat more widespread than in 
December, while in the latest Cleveland survey, the proportion of 
respondents expecting price increases remained as high as in the 
previous two months. Recent price increases in the steel industry 
are reported to be sticking, according to observers in the Chicago 
and New York Districts, although respondents indicate discounting of 
steel prices in the San Francisco District. Reports from 
agricultural areas of the nation note the relatively low prices 
currently paid producers for grains and certain other agricultural 
commodities as a result of record crops. Kansas City reports that 
earlier concerns over the District's winter wheat crop have been 
allayed by an extensive snowfall that has provided needed moisture 
as well as a protective snow cover. While grain prices may thus be 
held down, farmers are reported to expect rising cattle prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The demand for business loans at commercial banks generally 
continues sluggish, although loans to agriculture strengthened. 
Inflows into time and savings accounts continue at a high level, 
with consequent downward pressure on mortgage rates. Several 
District reports indicate reductions in rates paid on consumer time 
certificates, or consideration being given to such cuts, and 
Cleveland reports reductions in rates paid on passbook accounts at 
banks in several cities of the District.
