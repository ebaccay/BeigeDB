     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 21, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The big economic news in the past 30 days has been the impact of 
  severe weather on sales and output. Strike-depleted coal reserves of 
  electric utilities are requiring power usage restrictions in 
  Indiana. Retail sales were strong prior to mid-January when the 
  storms began to take their toll. But sales are expected to snap back 
  as weather improves. Inventories are generally on the low side. 
  Prices of manufactured goods are rising more rapidly. Demand for 
  capital goods continues to increase overall. Orders for steel have 
  improved since December. Mortgage credit is tightening, and home 
  starts are expected to decline in 1978. Farm credit conditions have 
  improved slightly. The recent rapid rise in hog prices reflected a 
  surprising decline in marketings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bad weather hampered sales and output in much of January and 
  February to a greater extent than in any previous winter in memory. 
  Heavy snow, ice, and high winds caused widespread worker 
  absenteeism, particularly in Illinois and Indiana. Activity was 
  affected in the retailing, construction, manufacturing, and service 
  industries. Trucks often were unable to move, at least not at normal 
  speed. The railroads also had problems with widespread freight car 
  shortages. Heavy ice on the waterways has drastically slowed or 
  halted traffic. A record number of airline flights were canceled. 
  Among the industries affected significantly by weather were steel, 
  paperboard, motor vehicles, and appliances. In all cases losses in 
  sales and output caused by weather are expected to be recovered in 
  the months to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Electric utilities serving most of the district will be able to 
  supply their customers despite the long coal strike. This is because 
  of large starting stockpiles, and heavy use of western coal and 
  nuclear power,. Problems are mounting in Indiana, however, except 
  for the steel producing area at the foot of Lake Michigan. Strike-
  affected utilities in the rest of Indiana have requested a sharp 
  cutback in lighting. Mandatory cutbacks for large industrial users 
  are expected shortly. Some factories can supply a portion of their 
  power needs from self generation. But power cuts of 50 percent or 
  more would shut down or curtail the operations on a massive scale. 
  Many district manufacturers with ample power available emphasize 
  that they are dependent on components made in Ohio and other power-
  short areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Large retailers were very pleased with sales prior to mid-January. 
  Snow and blizzards since then have had an unprecedented impact on 
  volume. Customers and clerks often could not get transportation, and 
  deliveries of merchandise were hampered. Some winter-related items 
  are now in short supply. Rising incomes and evidence of consumer 
  optimism (despite some surveys to the contrary) probably assure a 
  rapid rebound in sales as weather improves. Prices of general 
  merchandise are expected to rise 4.4 percent on average in 1978, 
  somewhat more than last year. Airlines credit discount fares with 
  large gains in passenger traffic, weather adjusted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bad weather and strikes have reduced motor vehicle output 
  substantially in the past 30 days. In part, these output cuts merely 
  substituted for layoffs which would have been required to hold down 
  excessive inventories of cars and trucks. Temporary shortages of 
  models that have been selling well are expected, however.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel orders have increased in recent months. One company projects 
  1978 shipments at 97 million tons, assuming a 3 million ton cut in 
  imports. Auto company orders are down, but orders for plates, bars, 
  and structurals for capital goods are up. Orders have also increased 
  at steel service centers. Weather problems on deliveries reduced 
  shipments 10 percent in January. Coking coal supplies are adequate 
  if the coal strike ends by April 1. User inventories of steel are 
  believed to be very thin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there are important exceptions, demand for capital goods, 
  overall, has continued to improve. Construction equipment is the 
  strongest sector. Farm equipment continues very weak, but one 
  tractor plant has reopened as scheduled after a January layoff. 
  Producers of castings, axles, transmissions, valves, controls, 
  motors, and other components sense that demand for most types of 
  equipment is rising. Design-engineer companies that handle major 
  long-lead time projects say that their workload has increased in 
  recent months, after a long dry spell, and they find the outlook "very promising."
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for homes has held up well in recent weeks, in view of severe 
  weather. Nevertheless, analysts anticipate a 10 percent decline in 
  starts in 1978 to about 1.8 million (with a drop in singles more 
  than offsetting a rise in apartments) because of recent and 
  prospective disintermediation. S&amp;Ls around the district say that net 
  inflows of savings have been "below expectations" this year. The 
  average drop from a year ago was 30 percent in the Chicago area, but 
  much more at some institutions. Some officers in downtown areas 
  reported "red figures." Interest rates have increased by as much as 
  a half percentage point in the past two months, and are now in the 9 
  to 9 3/8 percent range on 20 percent loans. Further increases in 
  rates are expected. This week some S&amp;Ls have tightened other terms 
  by reducing maturities and by increasing fees. Some are limiting new 
  loans to single-family owner-occupied dwellings. Borrowings at the 
  FHLBs are up significantly. Commitments have been made more 
  cautiously in recent months, and fees have been charged more 
  frequently. Despite the points cited above, no drastic curtailment 
  of new loans is anticipated unless disintermediation accelerates 
  sharply.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our survey shows that farmland prices increased moderately in the 
  fourth quarter, offsetting a decline in the third quarter. The 
  increase for 1977 was 13 percent, smallest since 1972. Credit 
  conditions at rural banks improved slightly in the fourth quarter, 
  halting the rapid deterioration of the third quarter. Higher crop 
  prices in recent months reflect, in part, a record movement of grain 
  under CCC loans. Margins of livestock producers have improved as 
  prices rose in recent months. The very rapid rise in hog prices 
  since year end has surprised most analysts. Hog marketings have been 
  well below expectations. Partly this may reflect weather conditions, 
  but earlier projections of a 5-7 percent rise in hog slaughter in 
  the first half are being scaled down.
