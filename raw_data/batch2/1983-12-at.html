      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The southeastern economy continues to strengthen. Employment and 
orders are up in regionally important industries. Vigorous retail 
sales during the Thanksgiving weekend have made merchants optimistic 
regarding the Christmas season. Housing sales have increased since 
the FHA/VA rate dropped, and commercial real estate investment is 
lively. Business lending by major banks has improved markedly, and 
the growth in consumer lending remains healthy. Tourist trade is 
picking up in several major convention cities. The Payment-In-Kind 
(PIK) program has aided many farmers, but heavy debt burdens presage 
difficulties for marginal operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A poll of southeastern manufacturers indicates that employment and 
orders continue to improve even though the latest available labor 
market statistics for October show mixed signs. Employment losses in 
the petrochemical industry have ceased, and economizing measures 
have enabled firms to earn profits despite low utilization rates. 
Oil and gas drilling is increasing in Louisiana and Alabama. 
Corporate executives, anticipating rising energy prices over the 
next two to three years, are optimistic about prospects for 1984. 
Brisk sales of new cars have spurred demand for tires. In response, 
Alabama tire manufacturers, who produce 15 percent of the nation's 
supply, are expanding capacity by as much as 10 percent. Government 
contracts for military clothing are boosting production in the 
apparel industry. Pulp and paper mills are now operating at over 90 
percent of capacity, almost 10 percentage points higher than last 
year. Demand for computer paper has been especially strong. Southern 
mills produce 52 percent of the nation's paper. Timber industry 
representatives report continuing upward momentum and expect 
production levels by year-end to approach peak 1979 levels. However, 
the effect of the upturn in housing has yet to reach some areas of 
Mississippi that depend heavily on lumber manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major southeastern retailers polled about Thanksgiving weekend sales 
report double-digit increases over last year's levels. Sales of 
apparel, toys, electronic goods, and home appliances have been 
especially strong despite limited price discounting. Most merchants, 
encouraged by the high levels of activity over the holiday weekend, 
are optimistic that consumer spending will reach a new peak by year-end. New motor vehicle sales continue to grow at a crisp pace. Truck 
and van sales are outperforming car sales, in part because dealers 
have had an abnormally low inventory of new cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The drop in the FHA/VA rate to 12.5 percent in early November 
stimulated housing sales by decreasing buyers' monthly mortgage 
payments, in the view of most realtors polled. Nonetheless, many 
potential buyers may be delaying purchases in anticipation of 
further decreases, and Atlanta lenders believe the increase in 
discount points that generally accompanies a decrease in FHA/VA 
rates may have motivated some sellers to leave the market rather 
than pay the additional fees. Orlando and Nashville realtors report 
increases in new-home sales, and Atlanta real estate agents indicate 
improvement in the used-home market. However, the cancellation of 
the Clinch River Breeder Reactor has dampened sales of single-family 
houses in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate development in Tampa and Miami is proceeding 
swiftly. Tampa city officials are evaluating designs for a large 
multi-purpose convention center, and the city's first billion dollar 
project is under construction. Contacts indicate that Miami is 
undergoing an office-building "boom" fueled by developers' 
expectations of the legalization of interstate banking and attendant 
increases in demand for office space. Rapidly growing areas such as 
Atlanta and Jacksonville are also experiencing heavy investment in 
commercial real estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Deposits at large commercial banks advanced from September to 
October by 1.5 percent, slightly below the previous month's rate of 
increase. The slowing resulted from a decline in the growth rate of 
time deposits, which represent over half of southeastern bank 
deposits. Loans at large commercial banks increased 3.4 percent from 
September to October. Business and real estate lending grew markedly 
faster, while consumer lending sustained the strong pace of previous 
months. Some large southeastern banks have begun investing in one 
another's stock, building relationships which they could quickly 
expand if interstate banking wins legislative approval.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lodging tax revenues increased in October relative to year-earlier 
levels in all states except Tennessee, but hotel occupancy is still 
down in most cities except Orlando. Contacts in Atlanta and New 
Orleans report that the addition of new facilities has ameliorated 
convention trade. The first phase of the Georgia World Congress 
Center expansion, adding 65,000 square feet of exhibition space, 
opened in early October. Attendance at southeastern attractions 
continues to outpace year-earlier levels, and most of those surveyed 
plan to invest in expanded facilities in hopes of drawing visitors 
to the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans. More than 15,000 people 
applied for 8,000 jobs at the Fair during the two weeks after 
applications were first accepted in November. The number of 
passengers at most of the District's major airports continues to 
increase over year-ago levels. Both large and small carriers are 
adding service to smaller cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop farmers' net income for the year has increased 10-15 percent 
above 1982, primarily because of PIK commodity payments. Profit 
margins of livestock operations have diminished steadily in 1983 as 
rising production coincided with sharp increases in feed costs, 
leading to a classic price-cost squeeze. In the broiler and egg 
industry 1983 was better than 1982, but the improvement would have 
been greater if the climb in feed costs had not offset much of the 
gain offered by rising prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nevertheless, the increase in net revenue signals a reprieve, not a 
turnaround in the farm economy. According to reports from the Farm 
Credit System and commercial banks, conditions are improving for the 
more conservative, financially sound farmers who constitute most of 
their borrowers and who are poised for recovery. In contrast, 
borrowers from the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), who tend to 
operate marginal and/or highly leveraged farms, found only a 
temporary respite, if that, in 1983. In every District state except 
Tennessee, FmHA delinquency rates have edged higher compared to a 
year ago. The delinquency rate of Georgia's borrowers from FmHA is 
56 percent, the highest rate in the nation. Only in Tennessee is the 
rate less than
      <br/>
      one-third. Many farmers in this group can do little 
better than hope to continue in business. Agribusinesses, 
particularly those which supply farm inputs such as fertilizer, have 
experienced trade declines of a third or more, although equipment 
repair work reportedly has increased.
