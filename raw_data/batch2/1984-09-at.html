     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Southeast are mixed, but strength 
continue to outweigh weaknesses. Industries dependent on 
international trade continue to be hit hard by the climb in the 
value of the dollar. Consumer spending remained strong through 
August, but summer tourist trade fell below anticipated levels of 
growth. Very recently, declines in mortgage rates have contributed 
to renewed growth in residential construction. Deposits at financial 
institutions are also increasing for the first time in many months. 
The general outlook for farmers is somewhat brighter than in several 
years, but last winter's freeze devastated many citrus groves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in industries sensitive to interest and foreign exchange 
rates have deteriorated, and labor markets have softened. 
Unemployment rates increased in each of the Sixth District states 
from June to July, after holding steady, on average, for three 
months. Higher short-term rates and slower residential construction 
nationwide caused many furniture plants to reduce inventories. As a 
result, some small sawmills expect to close temporarily. The 
increasing strength of the U.S. dollar is adversely affecting many 
southeastern industries. A Florida shoe manufacturer expects to 
furlough 1,500 workers because of import competition, and leather 
employment in Tennessee is down 17 percent from last year. A 
recently retooled steel plant in Alabama closed temporarily in 
response to weak foreign demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the chemical, energy, and defense industries is 
brighter. Two large oil companies recently announced plans to build 
refineries in Alabama. For the third consecutive month, the number 
of active drilling rip in Louisiana increased in July. Military 
contracts boosted manufacturing employment in Georgia this year, and 
job growth is likely to continue through 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales activity in the region continued strong through August. 
Atlanta, Orlando, and Jacksonville led the region in sales gains. 
Thanks to a spending surge in the latter part of the month, August 
sales activity was reportedly better than in July. Electronics, fall 
clothing, and housewares moved particularly well, but all 
departments fared better than last year, according to most store 
managers polled. Auto sales remained healthy through August, but 
dealers are concerned about the impact of a strike, which some feel 
could keep potential customers out of showrooms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The construction outlook has brightened over the past two months. 
Residential brokers and real estate agents report new strength in 
single-family home sales as a result of the recent mortgage rate 
decline, which enabled more homebuyers to enter the market. In some 
areas, rates on fixed-rate mortgages fell from 15 percent in July to 
as low as 13 1/2 percent in early September. Mortgage rates appear 
high by past standards, and much of the activity has been in the 
resale market, where buyers can assume mortgages at less than 
current market rates. The attractiveness of adjustable-rate 
mortgages apparently is waning. Earlier this year, roughly 60 
percent of new mortgages were of this type, but our latest survey 
suggests that this level may have been the peak and the proportion 
is now declining. Apartment vacancy rates are beginning to rise as 
first-time homebuyers vacate. Estimates of vacancy rates range from 
20 percent in Jackson, Mississippi, to below 6 percent in Atlanta.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction in the Southeast continues to surge despite 
high interest and office vacancy rates. Developers, financiers, and 
leasing brokers, buoyed by the continued strength of nationwide 
business expansion, believe demand for office, warehouse, 
manufacturing, and retail space will increase. However, commercial 
developers have historically provided more office space than most 
southeastern markets could readily absorb. Office buildings are the 
most common type of commercial construction currently in progress, 
yet most markets have more excess office capacity than any other 
type of commercial structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loans by large commercial banks advanced in July and August after a 
strong June showing. Real estate credit recorded faster growth than 
business or consumer lending. Mortgage commitments at S&amp;Ls fell 12 
percent from June to July, but recent mortgage rate declines are 
likely to have produced some growth through mid-September. Large 
commercial banks recorded the first substantial growth in deposits 
in July and August since February, but financial institutions report 
that loan demand exceeded new deposits in early September. The 
overall deposit advance is traceable to additions to nontransaction 
accounts, principally certificates of deposit, and a deceleration of 
the five-month decline in demand deposits. A slight majority of 
those polled indicate they are setting rates on their money market 
accounts on the basis of national rates. More than half the 
institutions contacted believe that time-deposit maturities on new 
issues are shortening, but only slightly. Most banks attributed this 
change to expectations of higher interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions in the tourism industry are mixed. Rainy weather 
and increased international travel, due to the high exchange rate of 
the dollar, depressed midsummer tourism in the Southeast. However, 
hotels had higher revenues, and air travel remained strong through 
August. World's Fair average daily attendance through early 
September dropped slightly to 42,000. Attractions, such as theme, 
state, and national parks, are posting only slight gains or declines 
in attendance. Visitor center registrations also dropped in July. 
The lodgings industry is showing more positive signs. All states 
reported double-digit increases in hotel/motel tax receipts in July, 
reflecting increases in room rates and occupancy. The World's Fair 
and increased business travel are largely responsible for the strong 
performance of lodgings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for District farmers appears more favorable than in 
recent years. Despite a drought in June, most crop yields are 
expected to approach record 1982 levels. Last year's sharp reduction 
in commodity stocks, a strong economy, and increased Soviet 
purchases may keep prices at a profit-making level. As a result, net 
revenue for major District crops is projected to be up substantially 
this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The full extent of Florida's citrus damage from last winter's freeze 
is now estimated at $1.1 billion. The freeze, the worst in this 
century, caused varying amounts of fruit loss and tree damage to 
approximately 100,000 acres of citrus. Florida's citrus industry is 
likely to shift further south as growers seek to replant trees, 
which take five years to reach bearing age, in areas less vulnerable 
to freezes.
