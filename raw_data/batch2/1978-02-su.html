      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 21, 1978
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Severe weather conditions and the potential effects of the coal 
  strike dominate this month's Current Economic Comments. Because of 
  unfavorable weather, retail sales throughout much of the country 
  were below expectations. However, respondents in most districts 
  believe that consumer demand is basically strong and expect to make 
  up the lost sales in the spring. Manufacturing was up but again 
  somewhat less than expected. In the financial sector, deposit 
  inflows to thrift institutions have slowed while mortgage demand 
  remains strong. Consequently, mortgage rates have risen in 
  approximately half the districts. Fears about disintermediation vary 
  considerably among districts, but most report that lending 
  institutions are fairly confident they can meet the demand for 
  mortgages. Thus far, the coal strike has had only minor secondary 
  effects on the economy, but this is likely to change as widespread 
  power curtailments now appear imminent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost every District reports that economic activity during the past 
  several weeks was adversely affected by severe weather. Winter 
  storms had their greatest impact in the northern districts, although 
  Atlanta also experienced significant negative effects. Boston 
  reports that much of southern New England was literally shut down 
  for almost a week. Chicago describes the impact of the storms on 
  sales and output as greater "than in any previous winter in memory."
     </p>
     <p>
      Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. 
  Louis, Dallas and San Francisco all report that retail sales were 
  depressed by weather conditions. In most cases retailers expect to 
  make up the losses in later months. Philadelphia retailers are 
  looking forward to a strong spring season; Dallas store executives 
  are optimistic about the impact on sales of rising income levels and 
  the proposed tax cuts. Such expectations seem to be supported by the 
  experience of retailers before the winter storms and in unaffected 
  areas. Chicago reports that retailers were very pleased with their 
  experience until mid-January and the onset of the bad weather. 
  Richmond, which did not report severe storm impacts, observed 
  increases in both total sales and the proportion of big ticket 
  items, and Atlanta reports that those areas least affected by bad 
  weather experienced strong sales growth. In northern New England, 
  the ski industry is enjoying another great year. According to San 
  Francisco and Atlanta, automobile sales which had been slow began 
  picking up in mid-January. Retail inventories were not seen as a 
  problem in any district except St. Louis where stocks of new cars 
  were larger than desired. Chicago notes that weather-caused 
  shutdowns at the auto plants substituted for layoffs otherwise 
  needed to hold down excessive inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity appears to be increasing, although in most 
  districts dealing with this topic, the experience of the past month 
  fell short of expectations. Again weather was thought to be the 
  major cause of the slowdown. San Francisco observes that production 
  levels are steady or growing in most industries and that some 
  industries have largely achieved full capacity. The aluminum 
  industry, in particular, is operating at capacity and there is 
  actually a shortage of capacity at the rolling stage. Richmond's 
  survey of manufacturers finds a general increase in new orders and 
  rising backlogs. Dallas notes that sales in the apparel industry 
  have strengthened; chemical sales remain weak but improvement is 
  expected. St. Louis reports that aircraft manufacturing and 
  industries serving the housing market are experiencing strong 
  demand, although overall the rate of growth in manufacturing has 
  slowed. New York and St. Louis both find that capital goods 
  producers are making small gains but are not doing as well as 
  expected. New York manufacturers do not expect the tax proposals to 
  improve this situation. Chicago reports that the demand for capital 
  goods has picked up, with construction equipment the leading sector. 
  Steel orders have also increased, primarily because of the capital 
  goods demand. According to Cleveland, capacity utilization in the 
  steel industry will rise to the mid-eighties from about 75 percent 
  in the previous quarter. The most pessimistic report comes from 
  Philadelphia, which finds no change in new orders and a small 
  increase in shipments. Richmond, Atlanta and Philadelphia report 
  slight increases in manufacturers' inventories. Excessive automobile 
  inventories have been reduced by planned shutdowns in the St. Louis 
  district and storm-caused disruptions. Cleveland, Dallas and San 
  Francisco note that refiners' inventories of petroleum products are 
  above desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the financial sector, almost all districts report that the inflow 
  of deposits to thrift institutions and other mortgage lenders has 
  slowed. Kansas City finds that deposit growth has actually picked up 
  since the fourth quarter but is below that of two years ago. The 
  demand for mortgages has remained strong. As a result, in over half 
  the districts mortgage rates have increased in recent months. The 
  greatest increase seems to have occurred in the Sixth District; 
  Atlanta reports that conventional rates have risen 1/2 percentage 
  point in one month. This increase seems to have attracted borrowers 
  hoping to avoid higher rates in the future. Chicago reports some 
  savings and loan institutions have begun to reduce maturities and 
  increase fees; some are lending only for single-family, owner-occupied dwellings. Some California thrift institutions have also 
  limited loans to single-family dwellings and in Oregon a number of 
  thrifts have adopted a temporary moratorium on lending. In most 
  districts, however, the thrift institutions believe that they can 
  meet the mortgage demand by supplementing regular deposit inflows 
  with other funds. Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City 
  report that thrift institutions in their districts plan or have 
  already begun to borrow at the Federal Home Loan Banks. In the 
  Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City districts a number of thrifts are 
  planning to sell mortgages in the secondary market. Atlanta reports 
  that saving and loan associations there have launched campaigns to 
  promote savings and are offering ceiling rates on certificates of 
  deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      The extent of concern about disintermediation varies considerably 
  from district to district. Institutions in New York and Philadelphia 
  are particularly worried that higher interest rates will lead to 
  serious disintermediation. One Philadelphia mutual savings bank 
  believes an increase in short-term rates of only 25 basis points 
  will cause a significant shrinkage in mortgage funds. As mentioned 
  above, San Francisco reports that several thrifts have already left 
  the mortgage market. On the other hand, institutions in most 
  districts seem to feel that they can meet projected demand with 
  higher rates and by seeking non-deposit funds. Boston thrifts 
  believe disintermediation will not be a serious problem unless 
  short-term rates rise 100 basis points.
     </p>
     <p>
      Districts with substantial involvement in agriculture report that 
  price increases are likely in 1978. In California rains ended 
  drought conditions but damaged crops. Consequently, prices of 
  vegetables like lettuce and carrots have risen sharply. Atlanta 
  reports that orange prices are "sky high" and that cotton prices are 
  rising. Kansas City and Chicago both believe that pork prices will 
  be higher than previously estimated and Kansas City thinks that 
  there may be "rather explosive price increases in the cattle 
  industry." There is still some talk of a farm strike, but interest 
  has dwindled.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago and St. 
  Louis are very concerned about the potential economic impacts of the 
  coal strike. To date the impact has been largely confined to the 
  direct effects in the mining and railroad industries. However, 
  supplies of coal have run low and these districts fear that there 
  will soon be power curtailments which will in turn result in 
  widespread layoffs. Richmond and St. Louis report that utilities in 
  their districts may have to begin curtailments within two weeks. As 
  Atlanta and Philadelphia point out, even those coal users with 
  relatively large stocks are worried because after the strike is 
  settled there will still be a considerable delay before deliveries 
  start up. The most critical situation appears to be in Indiana where 
  utilities have already requested a cutback in lighting and will soon 
  reduce power to large industrial users. The steel industry, however, 
  has adequate supplies of coking coal as long as the strike is 
  settled by April 1.
