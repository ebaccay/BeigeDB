      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Retail sales during the Christmas season were reported as not overly 
strong in the Tenth District, with the exception of the Denver area. 
Reports from several larger District cities showed a generally 
favorable view of the sales of 1977 autos to date, with the outlook 
for the next several months fairly optimistic. A good deal of the 
concern expressed last month over the lack of moisture and snow 
cover for the District's winter wheat crop has been allayed by a 
very extensive snowfall. Regarding scattered reports of increasing 
interest rates on farm loans, contacts with two dozen agricultural 
banks in the Tenth District showed a variable pattern of change with 
rates being charged averaging nearly the same as 3 months earlier. 
Tenth District bankers presented a mixed picture for business loan 
demand, with some banks reporting strong loan demand and others only 
seasonal increases. While banks have been considering cuts in 
offering rates on consumer savings deposits or consumer CD's, only 
two institutions have, thus far, reduced rates selectively by one-fourth per cent. At the same time, there were no outright instances, 
from among a number of savings and loans contacted, of reductions in 
rates paid on passbook deposits. However, in several cases, it was 
reported that issuance of 7 3/4 and 7 1/2 CD's had been discontinued 
and that possible future rate reductions were under consideration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Telephone calls to a number of major retailers in the Tenth District 
regarding sales over the recent Christmas season elicited generally 
restrained responses, with the exception of the Denver area where 
such terms as "outstanding" and "fantastic" were used to describe 
the December sales picture. Elsewhere, sales were reported to be up 
over the period last year, but gains were not seen as exceptional or 
up to some of the more optimistic projections. Most respondents 
indicated that their inventories were at, or close to, desired 
levels, and all respondents reported no recent change in prices, 
either from their vendors or to their customers. District auto 
dealers reported a generally favorable response to date on the part 
of the public toward the 1977 models. Intermediates and full-size 
cars are in strongest demand and shortest supply, and the outlook 
for sales over the next several months appears to be optimistic.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the exception of southern Oklahoma, the District's winter wheat 
crop is largely covered by a protective blanket of snow which fell 
very recently. In addition to providing badly needed moisture, the 
snow will offer protection to the dormant wheat from wind erosion 
and winterkill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following scattered reports about increasing interest rates on farm 
loans, a telephone survey involving 24 District agricultural banks 
was conducted to determine both the extent to which they are loaned 
up as well as their most common interest rates on four different 
types of farm loans. Loan to deposit ratios of the respondents 
ranged from 12 to 80 per cent, with a mean of 58 per cent (little 
changed from October 1). Interest rates ranged from 8 per cent on 
feeder cattle and other operating loans to 11 per cent on 
intermediate- and long-term loans. In the last 3 months, 10 banks 
increased rates on at least one kind of agricultural loan by 25 to 
100 basis points. At the same time, seven banks lowered interest 
rates on at least one kind of farm loan between 25 and 100 basis 
points. On balance, interest rates being charged by the respondents 
averaged nearly the same as 3 months earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenth District bankers contacted in January presented a mixed 
picture of changes in business loan demand. Some banks reported 
strong gains in business loan demand while others said that loan 
increases in December were only seasonal. Several of the banks 
reporting strong gains had increases in all areas of business loan 
demand, while one reported that strength resulted primarily from 
agribusiness overlines at smaller banks. Strong gains in consumer 
installment lending were recorded, with above seasonal gains in bank 
card use noted by most banks. Agricultural loans continued to be a 
source of strength in overall loan demand at the larger Tenth 
District banks. Loans for grain storage have been particularly 
strong although new cattle loans are at a low level.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the fall of short-term market interest rates below passbook 
rates, most banks have been considering cuts in offering rates on 
consumer savings deposits or consumer CD's. However, only two 
institutions have reduced rates so farâ€”one reduced by one-fourth 
per cent the offering rate on certificates with maturities from 30 
days to 2 years, while another cut by one-fourth per cent the rate 
on 90-day certificates. One bank plans to reintroduce service 
charges on passbook accounts and another is putting a cap on the 
amount which can be placed in a consumer CD.
       </p>
       <p>
        Savings and loans throughout the Tenth District were contacted, and 
none of them reported any outright reductions in interest rates paid 
on passbook deposits. However, in several cases, issuance of 7 3/4 
and 7 1/2 CD's had been discontinued. In addition, several savings 
and loans were considering taking such an action in the near future, 
or lowering the rate on deposits, if competitive conditions 
permitted. There were a number of reports of recent reductions in 
mortgage rates and terms, in some instances to an 8 1/2-8 3/4 per 
cent range on 75 per cent to 80 per cent contracts. Further possible 
reductions were under consideration, depending upon the emerging 
competitive situation.
