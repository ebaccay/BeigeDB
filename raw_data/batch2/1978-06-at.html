      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Current activity levels are quite high, but rapid inflation and 
  tighter money have intensified the uncertainties in the outlook. The 
  only bottlenecks that appear serious are truck and rail transport, 
  although minor shortages of a variety of construction materials are 
  widespread. Consumer response to the new CDs has been slight thus 
  far; financial institutions have accepted them with some 
  reservations. Heavy sales of automobiles and other hard goods have 
  buoyed retail spending to a probably unsustainable pace. Housing 
  demand and actual construction are still booming, but inhibiting 
  factors have begun to emerge. Many directors attribute some of the 
  recent strength in consumer buying to inflationary expectations, but 
  cautious control of inventories has held anticipatory buying to a 
  minimum in the business sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of the District banks and savings and loan associations are 
  offering both the new six-month and the eight-year certificates. 
  S&amp;Ls have been most aggressive in advertising the deposits, 
  particularly in major cities. Some banks and thrifts, mainly in 
  rural locations or small cities, will offer them only on request; 
  several have taken a wait-and-see attitude and are holding off on 
  the short maturity certificate. Thus far, issuance has been rather 
  slow. By and large, banks and S&amp;Ls do not expect the new instruments 
  to attract a substantial volume of new funds but add that they 
  should help retain deposits, and a few think they will get good 
  volume in one or the other eventually. Although a significant shift 
  of funds between the types of institutions is not anticipated, 
  deposit structures may be noticeably affected. The consensus is that 
  the bulk of money will come out of existing time and savings 
  accounts, thus raising the cost of funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The majority of our 35 branch directors and Atlanta area business 
  analysts found only minor shortages, if any, in their areas. 
  Inadequate supplies of various construction materials were widely 
  mentioned but never described as serious; lists included insulation, 
  roofing, plywood, cement, other lumber products, nails, gypsum 
  products, some steel products, and asphalt products (in order of 
  frequency of mention). A continuing shortage of paper for web 
  offset printing presses was described as critical by two sources; 
  directors close to Louisiana's oil industry cite shortages of 
  drilling rigs and drill pipes. Two directors volunteered forecasts 
  of shortages: in unleaded gasoline and mid-sized autos by summer's 
  end and in large steel castings and in lower grade steel used in 
  nails and reinforcing rods by year-end. The most serious supply 
  problems at the moment are bottlenecks in both truck and rail 
  transportation. Because past weather problems have caused an unusual 
  coincidence of crop maturity in different areas, fruit and vegetable 
  growers are having great difficulty moving perishables to market 
  through the strained trucking system. With an abnormally large 
  number of cars and locomotives under repair and seasonal grain 
  traffic, rail freight bottlenecks have delayed shipments of 
  phosphate and building supplies, especially.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumer purchases continued brisk through May, with most areas 
  reporting year-over-year sales gains well in excess of price 
  increases. Hard goods sales have shown the most rapid advances. A 
  large grocery chain has seen its beef sales fall 15 percent in the 
  past two weeks in the wake of rising prices. Retail stocks are 
  generally heavier than desired, reflecting overly optimistic buying 
  rather than slower sales. Auto sales have been very strong; the 
  combined daily sales rate of four regional distributors of domestics 
  climbed to 24 percent over the year-earlier pace in May; one set an 
  all-time record, and two posted records for the month of May. Large, 
  luxury models have been selling extremely well. The used car, truck, 
  and import markets remain vigorous.
       </p>
       <p>
        Home loan demand and construction activity continue to boom, 
  although mortgage rates are rapidly approaching 10 percent and high 
  financing costs appear to have squeezed some projects off the 
  drawing boards. In northern and central Florida, several S&amp;Ls; have 
  suspended new mortgage lending. Demand for office and commercial 
  space in Atlanta has improved dramatically and encouraged a return 
  to speculation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our survey of directors on the CD and shortage situations also 
  included questions on inflationary expectations and anticipatory 
  buying. Many suspected that buying to beat price increases accounts 
  for a portion of recent strong advances in consumer spending, 
  especially for homes and automobiles. A few gave examples of similar 
  behavior in the business sector—in ordering of capital equipment 
  (cranes, lathes, and milling machinery), purchases of construction 
  materials (although the short supplies may be as responsible as 
  inflation), and real estate decisions. However, uncertainties in the 
  outlook have induced most businesses, and manufacturers in 
  particular, to keep a tight rein on purchases. Apparently, the fear 
  of getting caught with excessive stocks has precluded stockpiling of 
  goods for the purpose of cost control, although some businesses are 
  accumulating stocks to support especially brisk demand where supply 
  conditions permit. Cost increases are the motivation for most mark-ups, the directors believe, but there are indications that recent 
  price hikes have included a margin for anticipated inflation. 
  Virtually none of our directors found evidence that the possibility 
  of price controls has been the major consideration in pricing.
       </p>
       <p>
        A wide variety of special cut-rate air fares, usually representing a 
  35- to 40-percent discount, has boosted southeastern passenger 
  traffic and benefited Miami in particular. The airlines have done 
  substantial hiring for reservations offices. When asked how long he 
  thought the low rates would be offered, a major airline business 
  analyst replied that the carrier had already begun to feel the 
  effects of the revenue dilution.
