      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Fifth District manufacturing activity remains firm at this point as 
  new orders and shipments continue to gain over the past month. 
  Responses to our survey also indicate some drawing down of 
  manufacturers' inventories, particularly of finished goods, during 
  October. Manufacturing employment and weekly hours worked continued 
  to rise among our respondent firms. Nonetheless, manufacturers' 
  expectations for the next six months weakened markedly during the 
  latest survey period. Reports on the retail sector are a mixed bag; 
  automobile sales appear to be slowing, if only slightly, while other 
  retail activity remains firm. Credit demand in the district has been 
  strong in recent weeks, with both businesses and consumers borrowing 
  significant amounts. To date there has been no sign of any 
  substantial moderation in credit demand, even though interest rates 
  have increased sharply. Strong demand for farm loans, rising 
  interest rates, and continued liquidity pressures at some banks were 
  reflected in our latest survey of farm credit conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the manufacturing sector, activity in the Fifth District 
  continued to expand during October. Shipments and new orders both 
  gained over the month, although the gain in new orders was somewhat 
  less widespread than in September. Backlogs of orders and materials 
  inventories were essentially unchanged, while stocks of finished 
  goods continued to run off. Overall, manufacturers' inventories have 
  been brought very nearly into line with desired levels. Current 
  plant and equipment capacity is also at or near desired levels at 
  most respondent firms. Manufacturing employment also made some 
  month-to-month gains, although these gains were not particularly 
  widespread, and weekly hours worked were up slightly. Prices 
  continued to rise broadly as 65 percent of our respondents reported 
  paying higher prices over the past month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers' expectations deteriorated badly during our latest 
  survey period. Half of the manufacturers surveyed now expect the 
  level of business activity nationally to worsen over the next six 
  months, while over one-third expect a decline in activity in their 
  respective market areas. Over half of these respondents expect to 
  maintain current levels of production in their own firms, but even 
  here expectations have weakened over the past month.
       </p>
       <p>
        No clear picture of current conditions in the retail sector emerges 
  from our various sources of information. Our survey of retailers 
  suggests some minor gains in total sales and in relative sales of 
  big ticket items over the month. Other sources indicate that sales 
  of department stores have turned spotty around the district with 
  weakness in apparel and other textile products and some scattered 
  strength in home furnishings. Automobile sales, although strong, 
  seem to have tapered off in recent weeks, at least in some areas. A 
  survey of district bankers shows October as a strong month for 
  consumer installment lending, due largely to automobile sales. 
  Installment lending is described by bankers as strong but not 
  booming. Use of credit cards by consumers continues to be moderately 
  strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most Fifth District directors have detected no significant impact of 
  the recent run-up in interest rates on consumer demand for homes or 
  the rate of homebuilding in their respective areas. More often it is 
  nonavailability of funds, if anything, rather than the interest 
  rates, which is dampening residential construction and/or sales 
  activity in real estate markets. There is some concern, however, 
  that more serious effects on housing will be felt in the near 
  future. This situation may be compounded by what appears to be a 
  growing reluctance on the part of financial institutions to pay 
  market rates on money market certificates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business loans have surged ahead over the past several weeks, 
  although a substantial part of this lending appears to be in 
  response to seasonal credit demands. Commodity dealers and retail 
  stores account for a large share of borrowing at large area banks, 
  but public utilities have also been active. While the major source 
  of recent loan demand appears to be middle market firms that are 
  expanding plant facilities, there has also been some pickup in usage 
  of lines of credit by larger companies. Demand for new credit lines 
  may also be increasing somewhat. Agricultural loan repayment rates 
  and the number of renewals and extensions of existing loans 
  continued to be roughly the same as the improved levels of the 
  second quarter. Banks actively seeking new farm loan accounts showed 
  a modest rise in the third quarter, while the fraction of bankers 
  forced to refuse or reduce a farm loan because of a shortage of 
  funds continued at the reduced level of the second quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Estimates through July reveal continued improvement in district cash 
  farm income, with all of the increase coming from livestock 
  marketings. Drought conditions have reduced corn and soybean yields 
  in some areas, but bumper harvests of these crops and other feed 
  grains are still anticipated. The season average price for flue-cured tobacco continues at a record level, some 13 percent above a 
  year earlier, as the end of the 1978 marketing season approaches.
