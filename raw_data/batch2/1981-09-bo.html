      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the First District have not changed 
significantly since the last report. Manufacturers are generally 
operating below capacity; there are no indications of an upturn. 
Foreign sales remain a problem area. The retail picture seems 
somewhat brighter; sales tax revenues over the summer were up 
strongly from year-ago levels. Banking respondents see an increasing 
number of problem loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers have been saying the same thing since spring. Sales 
are soft; backlogs are low. For firms engaged in the export 
business, foreign sales are a source of weakness. The problem 
appears to be the strong U.S. dollar more than the state of foreign 
economies; firms with subsidiaries abroad are not experiencing sales 
declines comparable to those suffered by exporters. One large 
exporter, the first to report exchange rate problems, believes that 
the European situation has bottomed out; new orders seem to be 
picking up. This respondent thinks that the improving U.S. inflation 
rate is starting to offset the effects of the strong dollar. Among 
the domestic areas which are particularly weak at present are 
commercial aircraft components; heavy capital equipment for glass-
making and other process industries; and circuit breakers, 
appliances, and other construction-related products. The demand for 
automotive parts, on the other hand, has strengthened slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      The manufacturing firms contacted are proceeding with capital 
spending plans despite disappointing sales. They are "building for 
the long run." However, all those contacted are large firms which 
rely heavily on internal financing. Also, sales of electrical 
equipment used in industrial construction have now begun to fall 
off.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the retail sector are more encouraging. Sales tax 
revenues over the summer months were up sharply from year-ago 
levels, suggesting that retail sales were stronger than previously 
thought. Food sales are reported to be keeping pace with inflation 
while general merchandise sales have been running ahead of 
inflation. Apparel has been particularly strong. Credit sales are 
said to be picking up. One large department store chain recently 
announced a major capital expansion in the region; however, a 
supermarket chain and another department store chain have just 
closed operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banking respondents report an increasing number of problem loans. 
For a large southern New England bank, these problems are 
concentrated in real estate related areas; developers and, more 
recently, manufacturers in the home furnishings business have been 
encountering difficulties. These banks are generally unenthusiastic 
about the "all-savers" certificates but are gearing up to pursue IRA 
funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, and Tobin were available 
for comment this month. Professor Eckstein feels the climb in 
initial claims may be signaling a recession. He feels real GNP in 
the third quarter fell more than the "flash" estimate and predicts 
less than 1 percent growth this quarter. He argues the Fed should 
"live by our principles"—i.e., seek to achieve the M1B target by 
the end of the year. He believes the lower end of next year's 
targets are "disastrous" and the mid-points are "highly ambitious." 
Eckstein believes that the Fed cannot ignore nominal interest rates 
and favors a floor of 12 percent at present for the Federal funds 
rate. He argues that "our understanding of the relationship between 
either interest rates or reserves and the aggregates is sufficiently 
loose that we should not use those instruments too aggressively."
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Houthakker favors giving "absolute priority to fighting 
inflation unless it raises unemployment a lot." Since present policy 
has not raised unemployment so far and is working to slow inflation, 
he sees no reason to change policy. He is concerned about the recent 
rapid growth of reserves. Neither the dollar nor the current account 
should be of concern to current monetary policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Samuelson notes that the weakness in housing and autos is 
spreading to fixed equipment and durable goods. He regards the 
recent drops in the stock and bond markets as "hysteria." It is not 
reasonable to regard increased deficits due to weak economy as 
inflationary rather than as a symptom of weakness. Federal spending 
is not out of control; most of the recent revisions reflect higher 
interest costs. When the economy is weak a deficit is not unhealthy. 
With the economy weak, he sees no dilemma in returning money growth 
to the target range. This is no reason to resist a drop in rates in 
a weak economy. Further easing is fully consistent with the stated 
policy of pursuing moderate money growth regardless of the level of 
the deficit or prevailing rates of interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Tobin raised the issue of the appropriate mix between 
monetary and fiscal policy. He noted that the commitment to steady 
reduction of the monetary growth targets makes no allowance for the 
recently proposed increases in fiscal restraint or for the 
performance of the real economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin sees ample room for easing within present policies without 
destroying the System's credibility. He noted that any undershoot 
this year would be built into next year's targets, making that 
policy stance tighter. He is suspicious that the strength of M2 
relative to M1B may reflect a shift from long- to short-term 
financing triggered by high rates and uncertainty rather than a more 
generous monetary policy. Tobin notes that the Treasury's continuing 
to issue long-term bonds is not consistent with the conviction that 
long rates are out of line with future short-term rates and 
inflation. With this conviction, an "Operation Twist"—with the 
Treasury borrowing short and the Fed selling bills and buying 
bonds—would reduce future government interest costs.
