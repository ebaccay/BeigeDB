      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy shortages, aggravated by the coldest winter in the past 100 
  years, have hampered production, employment, income and sales in the 
  Fourth District. Our latest monthly survey shows that more 
  manufacturers expect curtailment in output in February than last 
  month. Lost output of automobiles, glass and appliances caused by 
  natural gas shortages are expected to be made up in the second and 
  third quarters, although some steel producers express uncertainty 
  that the steel market will revive as much as was expected just a 
  month ago. Economists who attended this Bank's meeting on the 
  economic outlook on February 3 still expect the expansion to 
  continue through 1977, despite constraints on fuel supplies. 
  Interest rates on passbook savings, which were lowered in several 
  major metropolitan areas of the District last month, were raised by 
  several thrift institutions in the Cleveland area.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worst winter since the 1870's has caused scattered shutdowns 
  especially in steel, automotive, glass and fabricating metal 
  industries, widespread school closings during January and early 
  February, and reduced retail shopping hours. Temperatures in 
  northern Ohio, for example, have been 33 percent below normal so far 
  this winter. Demand for energy, especially natural gas, has been 
  well above supply. Bottlenecks in transportation have aggravated the 
  shortages. Natural gas has been in short supply, and supplies of 
  alternate fuels have been available but tight. According to an 
  official with a major utility in Ohio, daily flows of natural gas 
  into Ohio equal only 81 percent of the State' s requirements. 
  Prospects for the longer term should improve. With higher prices for 
  natural gas, demand and supply would likely be in balance by 1982, 
  and prices would decline after the mid-1980's because of excess 
  supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because supplies of natural gas into Ohio have been curtailed each 
  year since 1972, some manufacturers have switched to alternate 
  fuels, including coal, oil and propane. These fuels are currently 
  available, but bottlenecks in transportation have hampered 
  deliveries. Despite the higher mix of heating fuel to gasoline, 
  shortages of gasoline this summer are not likely, according to one 
  source. Refinery capacity has been increased 18 percent since 1973 
  and larger supplies of imports are available now than during the 
  gasoline shortage in 1973.
     </p>
     <p>
      An estimated 15 million tons of a projected 55 million tons of coal 
  production was lost in January as a result of heavy snows, cold, and 
  absenteeism, according to an economist with a major coal producer. 
  Frozen coal piles held by utilities and barges of coal that could 
  not move on the Ohio River worsened the situation. Utilities had an 
  estimated 65- to 70-day supply of coal at the end of January. Major 
  coal producers apparently do not expect a coal shortage this year 
  even though they expect the mineworkers union to reopen its contract 
  later this year. The industry's capacity to produce is estimated at 
  100 million tons above the recent 675 million ton annual rate of 
  output.
     </p>
     <p>
      Estimates from a variety of reliable sources suggest that as of 
  early February, about 110,000 manufacturing workers were laid off, 
  or about 2 percent of total employment in the District. Many of 
  those workers have since been recalled. Primary metals, automotive, 
  glass and pottery, and fabricating industries appear to be hardest 
  hit by the natural gas curtailment, although a variety of smaller 
  industries ranging from greenhouses to forging producers, is also 
  affected. At least 500,000 tons of steel ingot production was lost 
  in January because of energy problems, according to one estimate. 
  One steel producer laid-off 1,000 workers, or 14 percent of its 
  workforce, for several days because its barges of fuel oil were 
  frozen on the Ohio River, and coke oven gas supplies were cut 
  because of frozen pipes. Another large steel producer experienced 
  only minimal losses because of extensive oil storage capacity which 
  was built in recent years. Although steel economists expect steel 
  shipments and production this quarter will increase about 5 percent 
  from last quarter, they are now apprehensive that a recovery will 
  not begin this quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of flat glass indicated its firm laid off 2,600 of 
  its 5,000 employees for a few days in mid-January, but all have 
  since been recalled. The firm switched to oil and propane but still 
  requires natural gas for some types of fabrication.
     </p>
     <p>
      Developments in the automotive industry are mixed. Two major auto 
  parts suppliers report energy shortages have had only minimal 
  effects on their operations, but both are concerned over slow 
  deliveries by some of their suppliers. Ford lost about 35,000 to 
  40,000 autos and trucks in January because of energy shortages and 
  slow deliveries of supplies to their assembly plants. Nearly 26,000 
  of 33,000 GMC workers in the Dayton area were laid off January 16-18, and 20,000 were recalled January 19. Another 4,200 workers were 
  laid off at a GMC assembly plant near Cincinnati, but since then, 
  all GMC employees in Ohio except 280 were recalled.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite fuel problems, overall economic expansion is still expected 
  to be sustained through 1977, according to the 29 economists who 
  attended a recent meeting held at this Bank. The median forecast of 
  the group expects real GNP to increase about 5.7 percent from the 
  fourth quarter of 1976 to the fourth quarter of 1977. They expect 
  the rate of inflation to average 5.4 percent in 1977, and the rate 
  of unemployment to show only gradual improvement from 7.9 percent in 
  the first quarter to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1977. The 
  group reduced its forecast of fixed investment to a 13.9 percent 
  gain from last year, compared with a 15.0 percent gain they expected 
  at the October 1976 meeting. On the other hand, they were slightly 
  more optimistic with respect to residential construction than they 
  were last fall. At a capital goods seminar in Cleveland sponsored by 
  the local chapter of the NABE, a Townsend-Greenspan official 
  forecast a 13 percent increase in fixed investment (7 percent to 8 
  percent in real terms) from 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some savings and loan associations, which only last month lowered 
  rates paid on passbook savings accounts and on savings certificates, 
  reverted to the 5 1/4 percent rate of passbook accounts. A few 
  associations also raised rates to maximum ceilings on shorter 
  maturing certificates, but kept the 7 percent rate on 6-year 
  certificates. A $400 million deposit association apparently lost $2 
  million in deposits during January to competitors who did not reduce 
  passbook rates. The prime rate for mortgage loans is expected to 
  remain at about 8 1/4 percent for a 70 percent loan.
