      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       January 28, 1981

       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The slowing of business activity in December and early 
January appears to be setting the pace for little growth in the 
first quarter of 1981 in the Fourth District. The unexpected 
strength of the economy in the fourth quarter of 1980 has led most 
respondents now to expect a flat first quarter. Steel continues to 
be an exception, with orders and shipments holding up surprisingly 
well. Real investment spending continues to decline, but may reach 
its trough in the first quarter of 1981. Consumer spending has 
weakened, despite a late surge in Christmas sales. Little activity 
in housing is reported, with some lenders raising mortgage rates to 
as much as l6 1/2% for an 80% loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unexpected strength last quarter has caused several 
respondents to back away from earlier predictions of a decline in 
real GNP during the first quarter of 1981. A resumption of inflation 
psychology following the removal of credit restraints and a 
lessening sensitivity to interest rates are often cited as reasons 
for the relatively strong performance in the fourth quarter. 
However, a bank economist also lists a substantial increase in 
federal spending and widespread optimism after the third quarter 
rebound as additional major factors. Several respondents expect 
"high" interest rates to contribute to first quarter flatness, but 
note that effects have been slower and less severe than in past 
periods of relatively high interest rates. A capital goods producer 
states that availability of credit has not been a problem as in past 
periods of tight money and believes that the shock of record high 
interest rates is wearing off. Respondents typically forecast fourth 
quarter 1980 to fourth quarter 1981 growth of 2% in real GNP and 10% 
in the implicit price deflator.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel shipments in January remain strong, according to an 
industry economist, although new orders are running well below 
December's rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, January's orders are considerably better than expected for 
early 1981. Inventory adjustment remains the major source of 
strength, with steel consumers no longer trimming inventories, 
except perhaps for industrial machinery, and steel service centers 
continuing to build inventories. Steel consumption has held up 
better than expected, according to an industry economist, because 
the auto industry has not deferred or canceled orders. Orders from 
the auto industry were lean to begin with, but an industry economist 
expects deferrals to begin in February. The steel industry made 
profits in the fourth quarter of 1980 (in some cases, sufficient to 
offset year-to-date losses), according to one producer, and may make 
profits in the first quarter of 1981 if orders continue to hold up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Investment spending remains weak in January, although 
some sectors continue to show strength. A capital goods producer 
reports that their aerospace business is stronger than their 
capacity to produce and their petrochemical business is very strong 
with no prospect of slowing. However, orders for industrial 
equipment began softening in November and mobile off-road equipment 
is still off over 50% from the latest peak. High interest rates may 
be a cause of the softening, especially among suppliers to the auto 
industry, A durable goods producer states that, with the special 
boost from the locomotive and airlines industries, company orders in 
the fourth quarter of 1980 were equal to the fourth quarter of 1979 
(in real terms). An economist for a machine tool producer notes some 
pickup in small cutting tools orders, which reverses a downward 
trend since early 1980 for the company. A bank economist expects a 
3% real decline in total business investment in 1981, with some 
improvement beginning in the second half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers and producers of consumer goods are 
generally bearish over near-term spending prospects. Although retail 
sales surged during the closing days of the Christmas shopping 
season, an economist for a major department store chain does not 
view the improvement as a shift in consumer buying or attitudes, 
because the increased sales only compensated for earlier weaknesses. 
However, inventories are generally lean, because retailers have been 
cautious with order placement. Across-the-board declines for food 
stores, drinking and eating places, and department stores are 
reported by an economist for the consumer goods industry. Food price 
increases may drop from a 12% rate to 8% because of better-than-
expected supplies for wheat, soybeans, beef, pork, and poultry. Auto 
sales have shown no improvement in recent weeks, according to an 
area auto dealer. An auto industry economist reports that small car 
sales are doing well, but expects overall sales to drop from an 8.8 
million rate in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 8.6 million in the 
first quarter of 1981. A bank economist reports no pickup in overall 
consumer borrowing and notes that the lending rate on auto loans, at 
14 to 15%, is too high to generate much demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity is more than seasonally weak, according to 
area realtors and mortgage lenders, but "high" mortgage rates have 
been less of a deterrent than expected. Because interest rates have 
been high for some time now, according to a bank economist, some 
buyers can no longer wait for more favorable borrowing rates. 
Innovative financing is also enabling buyers to accommodate to the 
higher rates. An area real estate dealer estimates that 60% of 
transactions in recent months have involved non-conventional 
mortgages. However, the dealer reports that January sales, which are 
usually double the December level, are currently running behind 
December's rate. An S&amp;L official expects little improvement until 
the third quarter, if mortgage rates would drop to the 12 to 13% 
range.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reason loan commitments have not fallen as much as expected, 
according to an economist with a regional FHLB in the District, is 
that S&amp;Ls have been able to raise money and build new liquidity. NOW 
accounts particularly have attracted larger amounts of funds than 
expected. While some switching from passbook accounts has occurred, 
an S&amp;L official reports that new money is being attracted. Despite 
offering less competitive terms than area S&amp;Ls, a bank economist 
also notes a net increase in funds from NOW accounts.
