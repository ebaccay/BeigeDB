      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District in March indicate the local economy 
is expanding. Manufacturing activity has surged ahead substantially 
since January. Retail sales rebounded strongly from a disastrous 
February snowstorm and are quite strong in early March. Loan 
activity at area banks is unchanged but deposit levels are up. In 
the real estate market, home sales continue to increase and housing 
starts are slowly coming to life.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District businessmen predict further recovery for area 
business over the next six months. Manufacturing contacts are 
planning for substantially improved activity by September. Retailers 
say sales should stay strong through the summer. Bankers are 
forecasting minor gains for consumer lending, but stable demand for 
business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing market in the Third District has entered the spring 
buying season by gaining dramatically since January. Brokers report 
sales volumes up 30 percent to 90 percent over year-ago figures. 
Mortgage rates are now in the area of 12.50 percent to 13.50 
percent. Realtors note, however, that it is still tough for first 
time buyers to qualify for the lower rates, keeping an upper limit 
on sales activity. While most of the activity is still in previously 
owned houses, new homes are finally beginning to sell also. Prices 
of new homes have firmed up a bit and, although the stock of unsold 
units is still somewhat heavy, Third District builders are slowly 
starting new construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers responding to the Business Outlook Survey say Third 
District industrial activity climbed sharply both this month and in 
February. A robust recovery for local industry finally seems to be 
taking hold. New orders and shipments zoomed upward, halting the 
deterioration of producer backlogs and slowing inventory 
decumulation. Employee ranks held steady in March (the first month 
since September 1981 without a drop), as did the length of the 
average workweek.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity is widely expected to pick up steam over the 
next six months, pushing the present expansion further along. Area 
businessmen predict that new orders will continue to soar between 
now and September causing a widespread buildup in producers' 
backlogs. In addition, survey respondents say that by early fall, 
stock levels should have turned the corner and begun growing. Plans 
for stepped-up production include enlarging payrolls, extending 
working hours and, reflecting renewed confidence, increasing capital 
expenditures in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices are mixed in March. Prices received for final 
products have held steady again this month but, after four months of 
stability, the cost of inputs has crept upward. A return to higher 
price inflation as business improves is projected, but not to the 
levels observed in the late 70s.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales growth at Third District department stores has dipped slightly 
since the last Redbook, slowing from its fast start this year. The 
east coast's "Blizzard of '83" virtually halted sales for several 
days in early February, forcing many store closings and countless 
transportation problems. The weather, however, has turned very 
favorable since then, and sales in the last four weeks, aided by 
larger than expected tax refunds, have recouped most of the early 
February losses. Current dollar volume is ahead of last March by 10 
to 12 percent, down from January's huge year-over-year gains but in 
line with retailers' forecasts. Most lines are moving well, with 
activity centered, as expected, in apparel and other soft goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants are counting on a buildup in consumer confidence to keep 
sales moving through the summer. With the economy rebounding and 
shoppers' balance sheets in good order, and likely to improve with 
more tax refunds and a mid-summer tax cut on the way, retail 
contacts project year-over-year gains of about ten percent by 
September. Store operators, however, are planning to keep 
inventories in check at least until consistent sales growth is 
obvious. Stock levels are presently very trim.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers report little change in loan activity in 
March. Commercial loan volume, in line with lenders' plans, is about 
where it was in January, ranging from even-with to nine percent 
ahead of a year ago. Contacts report some recent cooling of C&amp;I loan 
demand, however, as rebuilding area businesses cut down on distress 
borrowing. Retail loan activity remains above last March's levels as 
well, but, in spite of declining interest rates, consumer caution 
has kept the demand for loans below bankers' expectations. Banking 
contacts are forecasting continued sluggishness in overall loan 
demand for at least the next six months. Unlike retailers, they 
project a slow recovery, and expect the demand for business loans to 
be flat. In addition, consumer confidence will be slower in 
developing than previously expected, they contend, providing only a 
modest boost for consumer loans by September.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate at banks in the Third District is currently 10.5 
percent, having dropped 50 basis points since the last Redbook. 
Interest rates have been firming recently with upward pressure 
coming mainly from worries about the federal deficit and Fed 
policies, according to banking contacts. Nevertheless, bankers are 
predicting the prime will slide another 50 basis points by the third 
quarter, but caution that some temporary upward movement is possible 
before then.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit growth in the Third District has been substantial over the 
past six weeks. Demand deposits are currently running as high as 
seven percent above year-ago levels; bankers cite approaching 
corporate taxes and an increased precautionary demand for money as 
contributing to the surprising strength in demand balances. The 
money market account continues to attract large amounts of new money 
and keep time deposit levels high, as well. Current estimates put 
time deposits 16 percent to 40 percent ahead on a year-to-year 
basis.
