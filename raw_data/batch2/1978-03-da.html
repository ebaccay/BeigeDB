      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Directors and businessmen report that economic activity remains 
  strong in the Eleventh District. Consumer spending has picked up 
  with department stores and auto dealers reporting large sales 
  increases. Manufacturing activity has moderated slightly although 
  durable goods industries continue to post strong performances. A 
  further slowing in net savings inflows to banks and savings and loan 
  associations was recorded in February. Despite higher mortgage 
  rates, residential builders are optimistic that activity will 
  continue near last year's pace. With the planting season 
  approaching, a lessening of farm strike activity is anticipated by
        <br/>
        agri-businessmen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sales at department stores and auto dealerships rose rapidly late in 
  February. Some of the gains were apparently the recovery of sales 
  lost during recent periods of bad weather. Department store 
  executives say that sales in coming months will show large gains 
  over recent months and will be approximately 10 to 15 percent above 
  year-earlier levels. Auto dealers report that customer acceptance of 
  the 1978 models is good and that there is no more than the usual 
  price resistance. Recent weakness in auto sales is attributed to the 
  effects of bad weather. The outlook for new car sales is described 
  as "favorable" with some dealers adding that sales will be as "good 
  as ever." Inventories at most retail establishments are near desired 
  levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturing activity remains strong, although the pace has slowed 
  since the fourth quarter of last year. Many respondents complain of 
  declining productivity as marginal workers are hired to fill skilled 
  positions. To ease the effect of rising labor costs, some 
  manufacturers are installing more automated equipment. Output in 
  such durable goods industries as fabricated metals, lumber and wood, 
  and machinery is up substantially as their products remain in strong 
  demand. Heavy backlogs of orders exist in many industries. However 
  some metal fabricators report that recent new orders have been 
  erratic or weak. Primary metal producers report only modest growth. 
  Copper and zinc smelters describe their situations as "very bleak." Current operations are only marginally profitable, and the only 
  investments being made are pollution control equipment required by 
  law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Drilling activity and drilling equipment manufacturers are still 
  operating at capacity and near record paces. Supplies of tubular 
  goods are expected to remain tight well into the second quarter and 
  spot shortages of some sizes are possible. Additions to 
  manufacturing capacity are being planned that will be sufficient to 
  meet the expected growth in demand and should ease the supply 
  situation somewhat. Nondurable goods manufacturing activity remains 
  sluggish. The apparel industry, squeezed by rapidly rising 
  production costs and by stiff competition from imports, is in an 
  unstable position with some firms closing plants. Some jobs are 
  being "exported" as more American apparel manufacturers start up 
  plants in other countries. The sales outlook for chemicals is good 
  for the first half of the year. Capacity utilization is generally in 
  the 85-90-percent range for most chemical producers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Deposit growth at banks continues to slow, and some switching from 
  savings accounts into CD's is reported. Bankers expect deposit 
  growth to remain slow for the next several months, but report they 
  do not expect disintermediation to become a problem. Loan demand 
  remains strong although some slowing of consumer loan growth 
  occurred in February. Since the second quarter of 1977, business and 
  consumer loans have shown exceptional strength, outpacing historical 
  rates during comparable periods of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 9 1/2 percent rate set last month at most savings and loan 
  associations on conventional mortgage loans appears to have slowed 
  the pace of mortgage lending, however, some S&amp;Ls report turning 
  down more loan requests last month than in previous months. S&amp;Ls 
  are reluctant to commit funds until their liquidity position is 
  improved. Net savings inflows slowed substantially in February from 
  January and remain below year-earlier levels. S&amp;Ls are finding that 
  nondeposit sources of funds continue to tighten as well. Borrowing 
  from the Federal Home Loan Bank is becoming more expensive, and the 
  secondary market has become an unprofitable source of funds as 
  yields there have risen above 9 1/2 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Residential construction firms expect activity to remain near last 
  year's level despite higher mortgage rates. Construction of multi-
  family units is expected to pick up as vacancy rates continue to 
  fall. Many major home builders have two to three months of business 
  on their books.
       </p>
       <p>
        Texas currently appears to be a focal point of the American 
  Agricultural Movement. Although the farm-strike movement has gained 
  much publicity recently, agribankers and agribusinessmen anticipate 
  a slowdown in future protest activities. Many farmers have already 
  begun planting crops in South Texas. And with planting dates 
  approaching over the rest of the District, most protesters are 
  expected to return to the fields to prepare their cropland for 
  plantings. However, the exact impact of the farm-strike movement on 
  planted acreage at this time remains uncertain. There is some 
  concern that striking farmers may make reprisals on non-strikers, 
  but no specific cases have been reported.
