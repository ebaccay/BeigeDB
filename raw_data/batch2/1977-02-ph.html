      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy is feeling the effects of weather-related 
  problems. Retailers report that sales have been adversely affected, 
  and industrial production and employment are being curtailed. The 
  Third District's survey of manufacturers was starting to point to an 
  improvement in business conditions in that sector along with 
  unchanged levels of employment. However, the survey was conducted 
  prior to the gas shortage, and more recent checks with officials in 
  each of the District's states indicate that layoffs are occurring. 
  Bankers in the region say that current disruptions in economic 
  activity could affect business loan demand to some degree, as well 
  as repayment of loans by small and medium-sized firms. All agree, 
  however, that there is little evidence of this yet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Absent the gas shortage, manufacturing executives responding to the 
  latest Business Outlook Survey say that business is better than in 
  the previous month. Close to 30 percent of the respondents report 
  improvement while 6 percent indicate a worsening in business 
  conditions. New orders and shipments are higher, and, to some 
  degree, shipments are being made out of inventories. Stock levels 
  are down at more than one-third of the firms sampled. At the same 
  time, employment and the average workweek are unchanged for the 
  second month in a row. In general, this picture holds for both 
  durables and nondurables.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, manufacturers look for additional improvement. 
  Almost 9 out of 10 executives surveyed expect a pickup in economic 
  activity over the next two quarters. New orders, shipments, and 
  inventories are projected to increase over the period, and 
  employment prospects are favorable as well. One-half of the 
  respondents plan to hire additional employees and one-third plan to 
  lengthen the average workweek. At the same time, capital 
  expenditures are expected to climb at 50 percent of the firms 
  sampled—up about 10 percentage points from the previous survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price pressures in manufacturing are about the same as last month. 
  Forty percent of the respondents report paying more for their 
  supplies and 14 percent are receiving more for their finished 
  products. Both of these proportions show little change from last 
  month. By August, 9 out of 10 expect to be paying more for their 
  inputs and 8 out of 10 anticipate higher prices for the products 
  they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment in the District is suffering from shortages of natural 
  gas and other cold-weather problems. State officials in New Jersey 
  estimate that as of February 4th, 32,000 workers had been laid off 
  statewide as a direct result of shortages of natural gas, including 
  8,000 in the Third District portion of the state. An additional 
  6,300 have lost their jobs because of icy conditions, mostly in the 
  fishing industry. Roughly one-half of these layoffs occurred in the 
  Third District. In Pennsylvania, a survey by the state found that as 
  of February 4th, about 160,000 workers statewide had lost their jobs 
  as a direct result of the natural gas shortage. A state official in 
  Delaware reports that an auto assembly plant with 1,700 employees 
  will be closed temporarily because it cannot get parts from another 
  company plant in the Midwest. Natural gas has been curtailed to 
  industrial users in Delaware, and consequent layoffs of roughly 
  2,000 are scattered among 9 firms. It's reported that many companies 
  in the Third District are trying to alter production processes and 
  shorten the workweek in order to keep their workers employed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the area say that sales have been affected by the 
  severe winter weather, but not in monumental proportions. One 
  merchant, who was looking for January sales to meet or slightly 
  exceed year-ago levels, reports that the last two weeks in the month 
  were "terrible" and indicates that sales were down about 7 percent 
  in real terms. He guesses that part of this was due to limited store 
  hours near the end of the month. Another retailer puts January's 
  loss in real terms at 4 percent. One of the merchants contacted 
  reports that his stores registered mild gains over last January, and 
  notes that he is struggling to keep many items in stock. Other 
  retailers say they are virtually cleaned out of cold-weather 
  merchandise. For the most part, there are no problems in receiving 
  supplies reported. For the immediate future, one merchant expects 
  sales in February to "come on like gangbusters," but the majority of 
  retailers contacted are scaling down their sales forecasts as a 
  result of cold weather, layoffs, and higher home heating bills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers report that business loan demand remains essentially 
  flat. One notes that loans to regional customers have been moving up 
  slightly, but is not ready yet to call it a definite trend. A banker 
  in New Jersey notes some heavy borrowing from mortgage loan brokers, 
  but other purely local demand is weak. In general, bankers look for 
  a gradual upturn in business loan demand this year. Only a mild 
  pickup is anticipated through the first half, with more acceleration 
  in the third and fourth quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      This outlook could be affected, however, by the current disruptions 
  in economic activity. At one New Jersey bank, credit demand from 
  fuel oil distributors to finance inventory has picked up 
  considerably. Overall, however, bankers feel that the gas shortage 
  could delay the expected upturn in business borrowing. Some indicate 
  that, if the cold weather continues, their small and medium-size 
  customers may have trouble cleaning up their loan payments as fast 
  as planned. However, there is no substantial evidence of any of 
  these potential effects at this time.
