      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 13, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic activity in the Fourth District continues to expand in 
  response to a high level of production of automobiles and steel and 
  further increases in capital goods. However, manufacturing activity 
  is being supported by some involuntary inventory buildup, especially 
  of consumer goods. While retailers and producers of consumer goods, 
  excluding autos, are not very optimistic over sales prospects, 
  capital goods producers are encouraged because of sizable backlogs 
  and a generally favorable outlook for new orders. Steel operations 
  are expected to continue at 85 to 90 percent of capacity again next 
  quarter. Mortgage loan demand has dropped sharply in recent weeks. 
  Intense efforts are underway to prevent a default by the city of 
  Cleveland on December 15.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several key industries in the District are manufacturing at rates 
  close to effective capacity, especially primary metals, machine 
  tools, and industrial machinery. Although there are no widespread 
  bottlenecks or shortages such as in 1973 and 1974, shortages of 
  skilled labor—and even dependable labor—are constraining 
  production, especially in machinery industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto producers and suppliers are still relatively optimistic, 
  despite recent slippage in sales. Suppliers of steel, glass, tires, 
  and auto components report GMC orders coincide with their publicly 
  announced production schedules for the next few months. Also, a 
  major appliance producer is reasonably optimistic that consumers are 
  unlikely to sharply curtail spending for these goods because of 
  continued gains in employment and income and the strong replacement 
  market for major appliances.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, other producers and retailers of consumer goods 
  are less sanguine. A major producer of household soaps, detergents, 
  and paper products indicates that year-over-year sales gains in 
  recent months have slowed and are below expectations. In his 
  judgment, high rates of inflation have caused consumers to cut back 
  consumption of personal care products. Retailers of general 
  merchandise also report reduced sales gains in recent weeks. They 
  expect, at best, that this month's year-over-year sales increase 
  will be larger than last month's but well below the increase 
  recorded in December 1977.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inventories of consumer goods have been built rapidly at both the 
  retail and manufacturing level. According to one report, retailers 
  have cut back reorders to keep stocks from building further, but 
  manufacturers have continued to produce goods in expectation that 
  sales would continue at last spring's high rates. Therefore, some 
  manufacturers have involuntarily added to stocks in recent months.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent surge in new orders and backlogs adds support to 
  expectations by some capital goods producers that gains in real 
  spending next year will be in the 5- to 6-percent range, instead of 
  2 percent or less as indicated in latest surveys. According to some 
  producers, the latest surge in orders reflects a growing 
  substitution of capital for labor because of a shortage of qualified 
  workers, favorable effects of dollar depreciation, and perhaps some 
  double ordering because of shortages. Those firms that produce 
  aircraft and aerospace components, freight cars and railroad 
  equipment, and computer equipment are most optimistic. However, 
  others have less favorable expectations because they have not 
  experienced recent acceleration in orders or because orders have 
  been relatively flat with little prospect for a pickup. Major 
  machine tool builders report strong but not accelerating order 
  activity, and one builder pushed back his expectation of a peak in 
  new orders from third quarter 1978 to the spring of 1979. A major 
  producer of coal mining machinery believes many of his product lines 
  are at cyclical peaks in orders. Still others see a relatively flat 
  year ahead because of a lack of broadly based strength in capital 
  goods. A major builder of basic processing plants remarked that his 
  backlog is not large enough to sustain operations through a mild 
  recession as has typically been the case in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel producers are operating close to 90 percent of capacity and 
  are growing more confident that this rate will carry at least 
  through the first quarter of 1979. Orders have picked up strongly 
  and those for January and February are considerably better than 
  anticipated. Strong demand from the construction industry and 
  capital goods produced the unexpected strength in steel. Producers 
  have not yet had setbacks from the auto industry. Moreover, domestic 
  steel users may be substituting some foreign for domestic steel, as 
  higher trigger prices either reduced the price advantage of foreign 
  steel or boost foreign above domestic prices. The strike of 
  independent steel haulers is disrupting as much as 5 percent of 
  total steel shipments this month, especially in the Pittsburgh 
  producing area, although neither steel production nor employment has 
  been affected by the strike.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgage loan demand in recent weeks has weakened in response to a 
  usual seasonal drop and further tightening in lending terms by banks 
  and S&amp;Ls. Mortgage money generally is available, although borrowers 
  are discouraged by rates that are as high as 11.5 percent for a 95 
  percent loan. Lenders are charging 9.75 percent to 10.75 percent for 
  a 60 percent loan. S&amp;Ls are having no difficulty in rolling over 
  the certificates now maturing, and some report that strong deposit 
  flows are continuing into early December because of the money market 
  certificates. Those S&amp;Ls that acknowledge use of funds obtained 
  from certificates for short-term investments, especially CD's, 
  rationalize their actions on grounds they can more easily support 
  continued issuance of certificates, while at the same time making 
  funds available to prospective home borrowers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the city of Cleveland, serious proposals have emerged in a last-minute effort to avoid default on $15.5 million in bond anticipation 
  notes that mature December 15. A plan developed by an outside 
  consultant calls for resolution of the sale of the municipal light 
  plant and the passage of a state law establishing a fiscal control 
  board with power to raise the income tax rate by 0.5 percent to 1.5 
  percent. The rate increase would make Cleveland's rate comparable to 
  other Ohio cities and add about $30 million in annual revenues. The 
  city administration plans a layoff of 600 fire, police, and service 
  workers starting next year which would save about $6 million. It 
  also has scheduled bill payments for December 31 so that checks will 
  not clear the banks until 1979. Even with a rollover, the city would 
  still face the possibility of default when an additional $25 million 
  in notes begins maturing next summer.
