      Beige Book: National Summary

      <strong>
       May 18, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>

      <strong>
       Preface
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This edition of Redbook contains a special section. In addition to 
preparing their regular reports on general economic conditions, 
District Bank staffs assembled and summarized additional information 
on conditions in their regional construction industries. The 
construction industry was selected for special attention because it 
appears to be playing an especially important role in the current 
economic recovery and because analysts have been concerned about the 
sustainability of the first quarter's marked pickup in housing 
starts.
     </p>
     <p>
      District Bank contributions were assembled at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, where a summary was prepared. That summary appears 
as an appendix to this Redbook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports suggest that the recovery is gaining 
momentum. Consumer spending has strengthened further across the 
nation. Manufacturing activity is generally on the upswing, although 
weakness persists in some industries, capital goods for example. 
Lending activity is mixed, with mortgage loans showing a widespread 
increase and commercial loans sluggish. Agricultural conditions vary 
considerably; bad weather continues to plague farmers and there is 
no consensus on how much the payment-in-kind (PIK) program will help 
them. As more signs of recovery have emerged, businessmen have 
gained confidence that economic activity will continue to pick up 
through the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recovery in consumer spending intensified in recent weeks, 
expanding both geographically and across product lines. All 
Districts reported continued or growing strength, except for Kansas 
City, where gains over 1982 were smaller than at last report. Boston 
reported the largest sales growth, more than 10 percent above 1982. 
Apparel and electronics continued to move well in most Districts. 
Many also noted increases in sales of furniture and other home 
durables, which some attributed to the recent strength in housing 
demand. Automobile sales strengthened in seven Districts. Retail 
inventories generally remained lean, but there were some signs of 
expansion in Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond. Optimism 
for future sales growth is widespread; only Atlanta reported 
expectations of weakening, and only for the short term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District Banks reported that recovery in the manufacturing sector 
advanced broadly, but areas of weakness remained. Substantial 
increases in orders have led to backlogs and longer delivery times 
in many regions, and production has been stepped up accordingly. 
Average workweeks have been growing, and a majority of Districts 
indicated that employment was moving up as well, albeit slowly in 
many cases. Boston, Richmond, and St. Louis reported broad-based 
improvements affecting a wide variety of industries such as inks, 
castings, textiles, and furniture. In other Districts however, 
strength was narrower. In Atlanta, the signs were uneven, with 
revival in lumber and phosphates countered by continued slack in 
textiles and petrochemicals. The pickup in San Francisco was 
confined to housing-related and defense sectors, with many others 
still reducing production and employment. And Minneapolis reported 
that the pace of improvement slackened in all but paper and building 
input industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods and mining remained dark spots. Producers of machine 
tools and other business equipment have seen no turnaround and 
future prospects are uncertain. Chicago was concerned that few 
capital projects were being planned, and St. Louis and Cleveland 
also foresaw no improvement in the next few months. However, Boston 
and Philadelphia noted that businesses were at least beginning to 
express some interest in capital projects. Mining also remained 
depressed, with low energy prices hurting coal mine operators in the 
Midwest and Far West.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan activity remained mixed in almost all Districts. Commercial and 
industrial borrowing continued to be weak across the country; only 
St. Louis reported an increase in volume. Demand for consumer loans 
was somewhat stronger, growing in St. Louis, Richmond, Philadelphia, 
and Cleveland. Mortgage lending continued to pick up throughout most 
of the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the deposit side, funds continued to flow into MMDA and Super NOW 
accounts. The inflows appeared to be moderating in a few Districts 
though. Banks are reported using these accounts primarily to fund 
short-term or adjustable rate loans, and are selling off fixed rate 
mortgages in the secondary market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions varied among Districts in recent weeks. 
Unusually wet and cool weather continued in many parts of the 
country. As a result, planting of corn is behind schedule in a 
number of areas. Farmers in California face additional losses due to 
delays in plantings of important crops such as lettuce, tomatoes and 
onions. In Atlanta, however, recent improvement in the weather 
allowed farmers to make up much of their planting. In addition, 
Kansas farmers are expected to harvest the second largest wheat crop 
ever.
     </p>
     <p>
      There was no consensus on the effects of the PIK program. Dallas, 
St. Louis, and Minneapolis expected the resulting crop reductions to 
improve the incomes of grain farmers. However, Atlanta noted the 
program was disrupting the poultry industry by pushing up feed 
prices. Some agricultural suppliers were aided by the increased 
spending associated with higher farm incomes, but others were hurt 
by the removal of land from cultivation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The emergence of more signs of recovery has engendered a climate of 
optimism. Businessmen in many Districts are now confident that 
strong consumer spending and residential construction will spur 
increases in demand through the rest of the year. Accordingly, they 
expect manufacturers to continue expanding output and employment. 
However, in Boston, New York, and Minneapolis, there still is 
concern that the recovery will be weaker than usual. And Chicago 
reports that much of the ground lost during the recession will not 
soon be regained in the Midwest. On the inflation front, the 
evidence is encouraging. While prices are beginning to edge up, 
economists do not foresee a significant acceleration of inflation 
over the next year.
