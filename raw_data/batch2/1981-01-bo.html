      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the First District is largely unchanged since 
  the last Redbook report, and most respondents do not foresee major 
  changes for either better or worse in the next several months. 
  Retailers are generally satisfied with Christmas sales. Final 
  reports are not yet in but the consensus is that sales were late but 
  fairly good. Among manufacturers there is a suggestion of a slight 
  weakening since November; some of the smaller high technology 
  companies are starting to see declines in orders. The well 
  publicized shortage of natural gas in Massachusetts has passed; it 
  does not appear to have had a major impact on business activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers report that Christmas sales were vigorous, particularly in 
  the final days. However, it will not be possible to know whether the 
  1980 season was profitable until final inventories are completed. 
  Although the volume figures are encouraging, sales and markdowns 
  were widespread. Retail inventories are under control with the 
  possible exception of some consumer durables.
     </p>
     <p>
      Surveys of New England purchasing agents suggest a slight decline in 
  manufacturing production and new orders since November. Several 
  sources have mentioned that some of the smaller manufacturers of 
  computers and other high technology products are beginning to see 
  declines in orders and backlogs. On the other hand, two large high 
  technology companies in the instruments and electronic components 
  industries report that orders in December were strong relative to 
  the rest of 1980. However, these firms are still taking a cautious 
  approach to early 1981. A large manufacturer of appliances reports 
  that the demand for lamps and other small items has strengthened 
  while the demand for large appliances remains weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increases in the prices of industrial materials and components seem 
  to have become more prevalent. The chief economist for one of the 
  nation's largest manufacturers expressed concern that debt service 
  has become such a large component of total costs for many firms that 
  the short run effects of higher interest rates on business costs are 
  likely to outweigh the favorable long term effect on inflation of a 
  slack economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, and Solow were available 
  for comment this month. All agreed that the Fed made a creditable 
  effort to follow the new operating procedure in 1980. Houthakker 
  would like the procedure to be pursued even more vigorously in the 
  future. However, Eckstein, Samuelson, and Solow feel that if the new 
  procedure results in extreme interest rate volatility, it may be 
  necessary to rely more on policy makers' judgment and general 
  understanding of the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Eckstein believes the new operating procedure has not been 
  a success. "I'm not quarreling with the average level of interest 
  rates during 1980, but the monetarist experiment caused real 
  interest rates to swing from -6 percent to 7 percent." He believes 
  interest rates are now too high. "If the Fed holds the federal funds 
  rate at 20 percent until real growth is negative, it ought to be 
  fired. A funds rate of 14 or 15 percent is sufficient to reduce 
  growth without inviting a crash or sacrificing capital formation." 
  In retrospect, "the experiment was expensive, but it's the tuition 
  we'd pay for a more skillful monetary policy in the future. If the 
  Fed has not learned to pay more attention to real interest rates, 
  however, the experiment was a disaster."
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Houthakker is "mildly encouraged" by the first year of 
  experience under the new monetary policy. Citing the fourth quarter 
  spurt in real GNP, he believes the real effects of high interest 
  rate volatility are not as large as some believe. Houthakker thinks 
  the economy is receiving the right medicine from monetary policy but 
  not from fiscal policy. He argues that a reduction in the deficit 
  would permit interest rates to fall at the same time that money 
  growth rates are reduced. Since M-2 is insulated from effects of NOW 
  accounts, Houthakker advises the Fed to announce M-2 goals and 
  suspend goals for M-IB until more evidence on the extent of 
  substitution is available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Samuelson does not view the October 1979 change in 
  operating procedure as an important reform. He feels that 
  monetarists exaggerate the gains that would accrue from steady money 
  growth. Nevertheless, he feels that the Fed "gave it a good try" in 
  1980, especially in view of the fluctuations in money demand that 
  occurred during the year. Although Samuelson suspects the swings in 
  money growth would have been reduced last year "if every member of 
  the FOMC were tortured every time money deviated from its path," he 
  remains unconvinced that close control of the aggregates is an 
  important policy goal. With respect to goals for 1981, Samuelson 
  also feels that it is not reasonable to worry about raising the M-1B 
  range to recognize the effect of NOW accounts as long as M-2 will 
  not be affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Solow reads the new operating procedure as a distinct turn 
  toward monetarism, but believes that common sense prevailed in the 
  departures from the procedure that occurred since the new procedure 
  was adopted. Solow thinks that the size of the swings in interest 
  rates surprised the FOMC. He also believes they contributed to 
  economic instability because of their disturbing effect on 
  investment planning. For 1981, Solow argues that a unified economic 
  plan encompassing both monetary and fiscal policy is necessary. He 
  fears that massive tax cuts may render monetary policy impossibleâ€”the only way the Fed could resist the resulting inflation is by 
  causing a severe recession. In his view, the burden of restraint 
  should be borne more by fiscal than by monetary policy. Dismissing 
  the credibility argument, Solow feels that the combination of 
"tight" fiscal and "easy" monetary policy is the best way to raise 
  the share of investment in GNP.
