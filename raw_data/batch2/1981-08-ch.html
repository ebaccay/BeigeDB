      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic prospects for the Seventh District have 
deteriorated in the past month or two—at least for the short term. 
Most observers still anticipate improvement late this year and in 
1982. Current high interest rates clearly are dampening many 
activities. Forecasts for a number of sectors have been scaled down. 
However, there is little fear of a precipitous decline such as that 
of the spring of 1980. The new fiscal package is viewed favorably by 
most executives, but no substantial early benefits for business are 
foreseen. Demand for workers is very weak, but some unions have won 
large gains in compensation and labor unrest is rising. Consumer 
outlays apparently slowed in July. The higher value of the dollar 
has encouraged some imports and discouraged some exports. 
Residential construction remains depressed and some nonresidential 
projects have been postponed. Crop prospects are favorable, but farm 
income continues weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business attitudes
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Important district industries have scaled down 
their forecasts for the remainder of the year. Included are 
agricultural, construction, and industrial equipment; motor 
vehicles, electronics, cement, steel, paper-board, and the airlines. 
Purchasing managers reported declines in employment, new orders, and 
backlogs in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Value of the dollar
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The higher exchange value of the dollar has had 
some impact on imports and exports. A number of exporters attribute 
a decline in demand from Western Europe to this development. The 
local Department of Commerce office notes a substantial drop off in 
inquiries from abroad concerning availability of U.S. products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite improvement from last year's depressed level in 
some sectors, particularly motor vehicles, payroll employment in our 
five-state area was 4 percent below two years ago in June, compared 
with a rise for the nation. Total employment was off at least 5 
percent in the two year comparison in Indiana, Iowa, and Michigan, 
and manufacturing was off more than 11 percent in these states. 
Help-wanted ads are about at last year's reduced level. Employers 
report very heavy response to ads for vacancies of various kinds. 
Very few employers, public or private, are hiring actively.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor unrest
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite slack job markets, various labor groups have 
obtained large gains in recent negotiations. In the building trades, 
carpenters, cement masons, and laborers won 10.5 percent first year 
increases in wages. Heavy equipment operators struck on July 20 in 
the Chicago area after turning down an offer of a 12 percent 
increase. Chrysler workers, having accepted wages well below those 
paid by competitors, are aggravated at reports of salary boosts for 
executives and designers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices of petroleum products are down slightly, and 
cement is off sharply. But most prices continue to rise. In July, 68 
percent of reporting Chicago-area companies paid higher prices than 
in June and only 2 percent paid lower prices, a marked acceleration 
compared with a year ago. Business equipment prices will average at 
least 10 percent higher this year. Even larger increases are being 
reported for utilities and mass transit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Further involuntary increases in inventories have 
occurred in motor vehicles, farm and construction equipment, and, 
possibly, steel. Most other retailers and manufacturers insist 
stocks are under close control.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prospects for a revival in demand for equipment have 
dimmed. Particularly weak demand is reported for machine tools 
(although backlogs are substantial) and equipment for agriculture, 
construction, railroads, and trucklines. The construction equipment 
outlook is grim, and smaller and weaker companies are forced to 
consider sales of plants or mergers. Oil field equipment and 
apparatus for regulating energy consumption in buildings are among 
the few bright spots.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third quarter output schedules for both cars and 
trucks have been reduced because of poor sales. Layoffs are rising 
again because of model changeovers and extended summer shutdowns.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel executives have grown less optimistic about demand this 
fall. Service centers are buying steel more cautiously. Operating 
rates for Chicago-area mills are generally higher than for the 
nation because facilities are more modern on average and because 
imports are less of a factor here.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer buying
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Domestic auto sales are lagging last year's poor 
level, and manufacturers are offering rebates and subsidized 
interest to attract customers. A very large general merchandiser is 
pleased with sales gains in July and early August, but some of its 
competitors have done less well. Price competition is reflected in 
reduced profit margins. Airline traffic was down 8 percent in June 
and 6 percent in July. The major airlines were in serious trouble 
before the devastating controllers' strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing market remains depressed throughout the 
district. Chicago-area permits in the first half were up 37 percent 
from last year, but 78 percent below the 1977 peak. Mortgage rates 
are in the 17-18 percent range plus 3 points and fees. Few potential 
buyers can manage the high monthly payments. S&amp;Ls are now offering 
AMLs, some exclusively. Much of the lending activity at S&amp;Ls
involves transfers of existing loans with "blended rates", and a 
variety of novel features. Some S&amp;Ls have been forced into joint 
ventures with builders to avoid foreclosing on projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since July 20 the equipment operators' 
strike has halted work on many projects in Northern Illinois. 
Starting last spring many smaller commercial projects were postponed 
because of high interest rates. In July work was stopped on two 
large buildings for similar reasons. Foreign investors are providing 
financing for large downtown buildings in increasing volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District crops are rated "good to excellent" following 
near ideal weather. Harvest estimates have been scaled upward. Crops 
in the eastern Cornbelt remain vulnerable to an early frost because 
of late plantings. Corn and soybean prices are now well below year 
ago levels. Export demand remains sluggish. District farmland values 
rose about one percent in the second quarter to a level almost 14 
percent above year ago. (These prices have quadrupled since 1973.) 
The slower rate of increase in the first half is attributed to low 
farm earnings and high interest rates. District agricultural banks 
have ample funds, but loan demand remains slow. Loan rates at these 
banks are at a new high and are above the rates charged by other 
farm lenders.
