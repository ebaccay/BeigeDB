      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 9, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Second District continued to be weak in 
August. Although several department stores reported gains spurred by 
back-to-school purchases, sales were soft at others, and merchants 
were uncertain about the outlook for sales in the coming months. 
Automobile purchases also remained slow. Dealers are expecting 
little improvement until mid-1981, despite the introduction of new 
models. Outside the consumer sector, capital spending plans are 
still being reassessed at some firms and new orders at capital goods 
producers continued flat. The backlog of unfilled orders at these 
companies, however, has forestalled layoffs. The respondents, for 
the most part, discounted the favorable economic signals recently, 
and generally agreed that the recession was not about to end. On the 
financial side, business loan demand, while remaining generally 
weak, has shown some signs of picking up. At the same time, many 
banks have increased the prime rate to 12 per cent in response to 
rising market rates. The tighter money market conditions have been 
felt in the mortgage market as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in the Second District was 
uneven during August. At both higher priced department stores and 
mass marketers, activity early in the month was stagnant. This 
weakness, however, was linked to the very hot weather rather than to 
the recession. Spurred by back-to-school purchases in the latter 
part of August, many department stores were able to compensate for 
the earlier weakness and ended the month with fairly strong year-
over-year gains. As has been the case for the last couple of months, 
New York City stores outperformed their suburban branches, while in 
upstate New York, the opposite sales pattern prevailed with suburban 
stores reporting better sales than in the large cities. Although 
inventories at most stores were not burdensome, one large department 
store was still concerned over its level of stocks in light of the 
very uncertain sales outlook. This store preferred high stocks, 
however, to the possibility of losing sales when demand strengthens. 
In general, the outlook of most merchants was cautious and 
uncertain. But, on a more positive note, one retailer felt that 
continued caution in consumer spending now may well result in an 
exceptional Christmas season when many postponed purchases might be 
made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales in the Second District were also mixed, soft early 
in August but stronger towards the end of the month. Demand for 
smaller-sized used cars has held up well and truck sales were on par 
with last August. According to one respondent, however, this upturn 
will not be sustained because it largely stemmed from purchases 
which could no longer be postponed. High interest rates and the 
sizable downpayment currently being required for automobile loans 
continue to be major deterrents to sales particularly for lower and 
middle income customers. (In some cases, however, inventory 
shortages and slow deliveries are hampering sales, primarily for 
foreign cars.)
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Manufacturing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Outside the consumer sector, little 
evidence of improvement has developed. New orders at capital goods 
producers are minimal although backlogs of unfilled orders are 
sufficient to prevent layoffs at present. Inventories at most 
manufacturers are very low and with liquidation continuing, 
according to one respondent, a pickup in economic activity may begin 
soon, albeit a very moderate one, as inventories are rebuilt. 
Nevertheless, one major steel manufacturer has revised downward its 
long-term capital spending plans and a "major review" of all plant 
and equipment spending is underway at a large producer of paper and 
related products. In addition, this producer may close certain 
marginal paper plants soon because it expects to lag the nation 
during the recovery just as it did in the downturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic outlook of most District respondents 
was rather pessimistic. The recent signs of an upturn were not 
considered sufficient to trigger a sustained, broadbased recovery 
this year. In particular, the housing sector is expected to remain 
weak for some time. Respondents were divided, however, in their 
forecasts of consumer behavior. Some felt that the current cautious 
attitude and higher saving rate were only temporary aberrations 
while others expect consumers to continue to restrain their spending 
in light of an anticipated renewal of strong inflationary pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On the financial side, business loan demand 
at large New York City banks remained soft, although a little 
stronger than in previous months. Senior loan officers attributed 
this weakness to the lack of major capital spending programs, little 
acquisition activity, and the limited need for inventory financing. 
Only in the apparel industry was the demand for inventory financing 
fairly heavy. Reflecting the increasing cost of funds throughout 
August, banks increased the prime rate to 12 per cent. Higher 
interest rates have had a noticeable impact on the mortgage market. 
Lending activity has tapered off as the rates on new commitments 
have been increased from 1 to as much as 2 1/4 percentage points.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Starting this month we will have comments from 
several of a group of financial market experts. This month we have 
comments from Henry Kaufman (Salomon Brothers), James O'Leary (U.S. 
Trust Company) and Albert Wojnilower (First Boston).
     </p>
     <p>
      Kaufman: The backup in interest rates will not prevent a fourth-
quarter recovery in the economy, but it is slowing the 
reliquefaction of businesses. There are now two corporate bond 
calendars-a "highly likely" new volume and a "shadow" calendar which 
hinges on a 50-75 basis point decline in long-term interest rates. 
This decline, however, can only come about if short-term interest 
rates fall. Otherwise, long-term interest rates will be under some 
upward pressure. Corporate reliquefaction is also being retarded by 
the involuntary inventory accumulation, the fall in profits and the 
temporary oil glut. The first two factors are likely to be reversing 
in the period ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Leary: I find almost a universal expectation that the basic 
inflation rate will not decline appreciably in the near term and 
that the odds are strong that the inflation rate will escalate again 
in 1981 and beyond. As a result of this expectation and the 
expectation about interest rates which follows, one cannot expect 
long-term institutional investors to behave as they have in past 
cycles. The authorities need more than ever to take the intensifying 
expectation of inflation into account.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: Notwithstanding some comments to the contrary, my own 
feeling is that the recession is ending. This view confirmed by many 
nonfinancial contacts. In financial markets widespread expectation 
of a double dip recession. Accordingly, despite rise in interest 
rates, lenders more aggressive in pushing out credit. Thus would 
anticipate surprises on the high side in business conditions. Ten 
percent inflation clearly imbedded in the economy, but not in the 
markets.
