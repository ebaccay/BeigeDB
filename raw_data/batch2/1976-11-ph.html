      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is mixed. Retail sales are 
  improving somewhat, but the manufacturing sector is at a standstill. 
  New orders and shipments are unchanged from last month, and 
  inventories and employment are lower. Nevertheless, the longer-term 
  outlook both in retailing and manufacturing remains optimistic. 
  Reports of cost increases in manufacturing are less widespread than 
  in October, and prices for finished products are only marginally 
  higher. Bankers continue to report weak business loan demand and 
  foresee no substantial pickup over the next twelve months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers responding to this month's Business Outlook Survey 
  report that overall business conditions are about the same as last 
  month. This is the first time since January that these businessmen 
  have not reported some improvement in general business activity. New 
  orders and shipments are unchanged this month while inventories and 
  employment are lower. Factory work forces have declined for the 
  second month in a row and the average workweek is shorter for the 
  first time since last December. The bulk of the work force 
  reductions is in the durable goods sector—especially primary 
  metals. Manufacturers in this industry report weakening demand for 
  their products as a result of excess capacity in capital goods 
  industries and the possibility that some of their customers are 
  running down inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite this widespread pause, area manufacturers see brighter 
  business skies down the road. With the exception of inventories, 
  which are projected to be at current levels six months from now, all 
  major indicators are expected to increase. Specific gains are 
  anticipated in new orders, shipments, unfilled orders, and work 
  forces, along with an expanding workweek as well. At the same time, 
  plant and equipment expenditures are expected to climb over the 
  period. However, projections of gains six months out in 
  manufacturing employment and capital spending are not as widespread 
  as last month. In the current survey, 36 percent of the respondents 
  plan to add to their payrolls over the next six months and 41 
  percent anticipate higher levels of capital spending. Last month, 46 
  percent expected to hire additional employees and 50 percent were 
  planning hikes in spending for plant and equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of price increases for supplies are less widespread than in 
  October, and prices for finished products in manufacturing are only 
  fractionally higher. One-fourth of the executives in the current 
  survey report paying more for their inputs compared to one-half 
  reporting increases last month. At the same time, 15 percent of the 
  businessmen surveyed report charging higher prices for the products 
  they sell while 10 percent report lower prices. This "net increase" of 5 percentage points is down substantially from last month when 23 
  percent were charging more for their outputs and 5 percent were 
  charging less. Half of the respondents who report receiving lower 
  prices are in primary metals where some firms are attempting to 
  bolster sagging demand by lowering prices. Over the next half year, 
  9 out of 10 businessmen expect to be paying more for their supplies 
  and 7 out of 10 anticipate higher prices for their finished 
  products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the area report that current sales are "substantially 
  better" than they were over the past few months. The majority of 
  merchants contacted put current sales levels at about 10 percent 
  above the same period last year. The one exception indicates gains 
  of only a "few percentage points" over year-ago levels. Despite 
  this reported improvement, however, most retailers feel that the 
  recent lull in retail activity has not come to an end. Several 
  mention that consumers are still somewhat cautious and they note 
  that unusually cold weather may have pushed sales of winter 
  outerwear ahead by 4-6 weeks. Merchants are hoping that the next few 
  months will show healthy sales activity, but they are less than 
  certain in their projections. As one executive puts it, "Shoppers 
  have the means to step up their buying, and we expect them to begin 
  loosening their purse strings soon. Unfortunately, we haven't seen 
  any signs of this yet."
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the region report that consumer loan volume is trending 
  upward, but business borrowing remains flat. At the same time, 
  bankers feel that this situation will probably not change 
  significantly over the next year. One reports that some of his 
  corporate customers are telling him they see little need for new 
  bank loans arising in 1977. Another banker feels that business loan 
  demand should pick up sometime, but he sees no indications as to 
  when this might happen. There is general agreement that the 
  conditions on loans will ease somewhat, but there is no active 
  policy of price-cutting reported now.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer-term, bankers feel that loan volume will expand 
  moderately in 1977 with only a gradual increase in interest rates. 
  Most of the bankers contacted look for a prime rate of 7 3/4 by 
  year-end '77. Consumer loans are expected to be fairly strong next 
  year, and projections for business loan volume range from 6 to l2 
  percent over average 1976 levels. The executive at the upper end of 
  this scale notes, however, that to realize this, "we'll definitely 
  have to hustle."
