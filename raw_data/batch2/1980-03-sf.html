     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 11, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Twelfth District exhibits few signs of a 
recession, but the influence of high interest rates has been widely 
felt in the housing industry and rapidly rising prices are a 
universal phenomenon. Consumer spending is continuing at a strong 
pace despite high prices; this behavior is believed by many to 
reflect a pessimistic inflation psychology. Labor demand in defense-related industries and in high-technology industries is contributing 
continued strength to employment figures. Loan demand remained 
strong at most banks and S&amp;L's last month, but there is widespread 
concern about the conversion of savings deposits into money market 
accounts and the consequent effects on the cost of funds. With the 
exception of activities affected by the recent flooding in 
California, the agricultural sector is reported to be in good shape.
     </p>
     <p>
      The housing sector in the District has been affected significantly 
by the recent runup in market interest rates. With the exception of 
Southern California, most residential real estate markets are 
reported to be very slow, with considerably reduced resale and 
construction activity. The level of activity is very sensitive to 
the prevailing mortgage rate; several builders in California were 
reported to have started up again in early January as mortgage rates 
began to moderate. As rates resumed their rise, however, housing 
starts were depressed once again. Resales and construction in 
Southern California (particularly the San Fernando Valley and Orange 
County areas) appear to have suffered somewhat less than the 
district as a whole. In Salt Lake City, where the inventory of 
unsold homes has fallen about 25 percent, some anticipate a housing 
shortage in the spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending continues to buoy the economy of the western 
region. Although sales of American cars in January were down about 
15 percent over last year, there are waiting lists in many areas for 
the smaller domestic and foreign models. In Southern California, the 
aggregate volume of retail sales is up about 20 percent with certain 
submarkets posting even larger gains. The demand for durable goods 
is mixed, with strong demand reported in Central California, but 
weak demand in Oregon and Idaho, for example. There is widespread 
agreement that a "spend it now" attitude is responsible for the 
pattern of high levels of consumption spending and low savings 
rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The special mix of industry in the District is largely insulating 
the region's economy from the deleterious impact of the weak 
residential construction sector. Portland's economy, for example, 
has experienced a 900 percent increase in personal income attributed 
to electronics and light manufacturing firms since 1973 and these 
sectors remain strong today. The demand for the region's products in 
the Pacific Rim markets is also quite strong. Strength in the 
foreign demand for lumber, for example, has helped to offset 
weakened demand from the residential construction sector. 
Predictions of increased demand for defense-related products have 
made the markets for skilled labor (such as sheet-metal workers and 
computer processing personnel) very tight. In fact, there is some
concern that the West Coast aerospace industry may have too little 
excess capacity to be utilized for additional production. A major 
aircraft manufacturer, however, argues that it has the ability to 
considerably expand defense-related production. Moreover, weak 
profits in the commercial airline industry have caused some carriers 
to not exercise their option to buy new aircraft and this may create 
some spare capacity in the aerospace industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      High interest rates are causing concern in several sectors of the 
economy. Financial institutions continue to experience conversion of 
traditional consumer accounts into money market certificates, 
raising concerns over the cost of funds. Loan demand generally 
remains strong, however, in most categories including consumer 
credit except where loan qualification is a problem and in those 
areas where usury limits have curtailed the flow of credit. A bank 
in Washington, for example, reports that credit card lending is only 
about 25 percent of its normal level because of institutions' 
reaction to the 12 percent usury limit that prevails in that state. 
The severe price declines in the bond market may have encouraged the 
increased use of banks as a source of corporate credit. Commercial 
and industrial loan quality is reported to be deteriorating, 
however. High interest rates are causing particular problems for 
frozen food processors, automobile dealers, and others for whom 
inventories are an important factor in their marketing. Bankruptcies 
in the frozen fish industry, for example, are reported to be 
increasing at a rapid rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agricultural sector is reported to be in a relatively healthy 
position. The prices and production of most crops appear to be 
sufficient to maintain farm incomes and carry the farmers to the 
next planting season: beet farmers are benefiting from the recent 
runup in sugar prices; the citrus crops appear to be in good shape 
due to milder winter conditions; and the type of wheat grown in the 
Northwest has not been adversely affected by the recent developments 
in the Russian and Iranian markets. February wheat prices of $4.24 
per bushel, for example, are near the October highs of $4.35 per 
bushel. Vegetable markets have been weak (particularly onions and 
potatoes), however, and several planting areas in the San Joaquin 
and Sacramento deltas were lost to flooding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence of a rapid inflation rate is apparent throughout the 
District. A dairy firm involved in labor negotiations anticipates 
that the Teamster's national Master Freight Agreement will be the 
reference point for many industries. That settlement is tantamount 
to a 35.5 percent increase in wages over a three-year period. 
Seattle University expects a 12 to 14 percent increase in 
compensation costs this year. Natural gas prices have risen 35 to 70 
percent in the last year. Newsprint prices are at an all-time high 
of $375 per ton, causing severe cost pressures for publishers. A 
regional producer of aluminum reports that aluminum ingots, which 
normally trade for 66 cents per pound, recently traded on the London 
metal exchange for $1.01 per pound.
