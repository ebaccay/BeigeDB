      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 5, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Directors and businessmen in the First District report increasing 
  signs of economic weakness; however, activity in several sectors 
  remains vigorous. During the past two weeks there has been a 
  significant slowing in retail sales. Retailers attribute much of 
  this to the gasoline shortage. The trucking strike has not yet 
  created significant disruptions but this may change in the next few 
  days. Reports from manufacturers are mixed. Capital goods producers 
  are doing well; however, some manufacturers of consumer durables are 
  seeing a falloff in demand. Loan demand in the First District 
  remains high; deposit growth is minimal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales have fallen off significantly in the past couple of 
  weeks. The head of a major department store chain reports that June 
  sales are below last year's in nominal terms. Another large retailer 
  finds that sales are just barely keeping pace with inflation. The 
  gasoline shortage is believed to be an important source of this 
  weakness; downtown stores are faring better than ones further from 
  the population centers. Tourism in northern New England is also 
  suffering from the gasoline situation. Thus far the strike by the 
  independent truckers has not caused substantial disruptions at the 
  retail level. Produce prices, which normally decline at this time of 
  year, remain high; however, there have not been widespread 
  shortages. The next week is considered critical. A large meat 
  wholesaler has begun laying off employees because of reduced 
  supplies.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the manufacturing sector producers of capital goods are 
  experiencing strong demand. One major manufacturer of nonelectrical 
  machinery says that backlogs are well above last year in three of 
  four areas; the greatest strength is in heavy equipment, 
  particularly for the chemical industry. Automotive product orders, 
  on the other hand, have fallen off. Consumer durables are faring 
  less well; while one major producer of appliances has had sales 
  above expectation, another reports that white goods are moving very 
  slowly. The jewelry industry in the region is experiencing weak 
  demand, although this may reflect style considerations rather than 
  economic factors. One rather discouraging note in view of the 
  current gasoline situation is that an important supplier of 
  engineering services for the construction of refineries and power 
  plants reports very little activity. Several firms contacted believe 
  that their inventories are now too high. For the most part, 
  shortages of materials are confined to specialized components with 
  lead times for electronic components particularly long.
       </p>
       <p>
        Loan demand in New England remains high. One large bank in southern 
  New England reports that it reached an historic peak in mid-June. 
  All lines are doing well, although one respondent notes that much of 
  his commercial demand is from small-and medium-sized organizations. 
  The one dissenting report is from a bank in northern New England, 
  which has seen a softening in the past two weeks. The only deposit 
  growth is in money market certificates. To supplement deposits, one 
  small bank reports that it is actively borrowing in the secondary 
  market, while a very large bank is bringing back funds which had 
  been lent abroad.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein, Samuelson, Solow, and Tobin were available for 
  comment this month. All agreed that the economy has probably entered 
  a recession, so that an easier monetary policy is appropriate at the 
  present time. Since they also agreed that the current inflation is 
  primarily the result of supply shocks, all believe that at least 
  partial monetary policy accommodation is warranted despite the high 
  probability that rapid price increases will continue for a few more 
  months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Eckstein describes the downturn as a "supply recession" 
  attributable to oil price increases, gas rationing, and such 
  attendant supply-side phenomena as the truckers' strike. In his view 
  the demand element is slightâ€”mainly the depressing effect of high 
  consumer debt loadsâ€”so that it would be an error to act as if the 
  economy is experiencing a demand recession. Eckstein believes that 
  the Fed would be wise to let the funds rate drift down, but not 
  according to the historical pattern. In particular, he thinks a rate 
  no lower than 8.5 percent is appropriate if a damaging reflation is 
  to be avoided. He warns that should rates move sharply lower, 
  forcing the system back up against the supply ceiling from which it 
  has recently fallen, the next business cycle will be accompanied by
  much worse price behavior than was experienced in the current one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Samuelson believes that it is time to let the market know 
  that interest rates have peaked. Some easing in interest rates is 
  necessary in order to prevent a "hard landing," an outcome he sees 
  as excessively costly given the modest inflation gains that would 
  likely result. Since the current inflation is not the kind that can 
  be easily reversed by Fed policy, Samuelson warns that we must be 
  prepared to accept slow economic growth for an extended period of 
  time if a more acceptable inflation rate is to be achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Solow notes that the arrival of the recession somewhat 
  earlier than many forecasters had previously expected can in a 
  certain sense be regarded as fortunate, since it provides less 
  opportunity for unwanted inventories to accumulate. Without an 
  inventory overhang, he expects the downturn to be relatively mild 
  and short-lived, the recovery well underway by early 1980. Solow 
  believes that the challenge for monetary policy is to avoid a 
  repetition of the 1974 experience, which in his view would do little 
  to moderate the supply-induced inflation. Arguing that easier 
  monetary and tighter fiscal policy would be preferable to the 
  current policy mix, Solow advises the Fed to ease now in order to 
  head off a possible tax cut.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Tobin observes that the recession is "just what the doctor 
  ordered" last November. Unless a severe downturn is deemed 
  politically desirable, he thinks that the Fed should now begin to 
  ease its policy stance. Although Tobin is concerned that recent 
  price increases may be built into future wage demands, he sees no 
  evidence that this is occurring yet nor does he think that a gradual 
  decline in short-term interest rates is likely to alter labor's 
  behavior.
