      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions continue to improve in the Fourth District. 
Employment is rising and unemployment is falling, but the 
unemployment rate remains well above the national average. Retail 
sales gains continue and merchants are optimistic about Christmas 
sales. Manufacturing activity continues to increase. Steel and 
capital goods output is increasing slowly. Sales of existing houses 
continue to be hurt by the level of interest rates and customer 
confusion about rates, but sales of new houses have improved 
recently. Commercial banks have become less liquid as deposit growth 
slowed, and loan volume increased sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the District improved further in October, 
although unemployment remains high and substantially above the 
national average. The number of unemployed workers fell, cutting the 
unemployment rate to 10.6% (nsa), which is 2.2 percentage points 
above the national (nsa) rate. Nevertheless, Ohio's unemployment 
rate has improved substantially from the 13.2% rate of a year 
earlier. Unemployment rates in eleven major SMSAs in the Fourth 
District in September ranged from 8.5% (nsa) in Columbus to 14.5% in 
Youngstown.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local indexes of leading indicators for Pittsburgh and Cleveland 
continue to rise, although less rapidly than earlier in the year, 
suggesting that further improvement in labor market conditions lies 
ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the substantial pool of unemployed workers, some smaller 
firms report evidence of a tightening in markets for some skilled 
employees—an event which some expect to lead to a quickening in the 
pace of wage increases over the next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices, Wages, and Earnings
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real earnings of workers in manufacturing have risen sharply in the 
last year. Average weekly earnings for production workers in 
manufacturing increased 11.4% from a year earlier in Cleveland, 
11.4% in Pittsburgh, and 9.6% in Cincinnati. The Consumer Price 
Index for urban wage earners rose only 1.1% from a year earlier in 
Cleveland, 1.5% in Pittsburgh, and 2.8% in Cincinnati.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of Fourth District retailers indicates sales gains 
continued into November, although the pace of domestic new and used 
car sales showed a normal, seasonal slowdown between October and 
November. Three major general merchandisers report November sales 
increases of roughly 9%-13% from year earlier sales, which compares 
favorably with the national average of 9.4% over the same period. 
The retailers report a rather broad-based sales improvement, 
although most hardgoods and apparel items are selling unusually 
well. New and used car dealers in the District report a moderate 
sales slowdown from October, which is typical for the season. Of the 
domestic new-auto retailers reporting, all indicate inventories are 
within an intended 40 to 50 day range. Import car dealers, however, 
continue to lose sales because of quota-induced availability 
problems. Most retailers contacted are optimistic about holiday-
season sales prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues to expand in this District. A 
survey of purchasing managers in the Cleveland area indicates solid 
gains in production and new orders in October; no respondent 
reported declines. Raw materials inventories are being increased and 
a slight decline in finished goods inventories is attributed to 
strong shipments. Employment expanded as firms reported callbacks, 
new hiring, overtime, and shift expansions. Respondents are bullish 
for the remainder of 1983 and the first half of 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of Cincinnati area purchasing managers reveals production 
and new orders rose more rapidly in October than in September. 
Backlogs and employment also rose. Prices paid rose more rapidly in 
October than in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Bank's survey of Fourth District manufacturers reveals new 
orders and backlogs increased again in October and are expected to 
increase in November. Shipments expanded in October but no further 
gains are expected in November. Inventories are expected to decline 
in November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major steel firm reports that demand for steel is rising but not 
rapidly enough to strengthen prices very much. Because of cash flow 
pressures, steel producers are reluctant to build inventory despite 
the prospect of rising sales in 1984. The industry is operating at 
about 60% of reported capacity, up from 25%-30% for many producers 
last December. Actual operating rates are somewhat higher; one firm 
estimates actual industry capacity at 143 million tons, instead of 
the reported 151 million tons. Despite slack in the industry, there 
are some bottlenecks in finishing capacity, as some mills that 
produce flat rolled products are operating virtually at capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital goods producers report increasing orders and output, but 
from a very low base. Machinery producers note that capital goods 
production is growing slower here than in the nation because the 
District has a very small share of the rapidly growing electronic, 
high-tech equipment industry. Traditional capital goods industries, 
including machine tools, heavy-duty trucks and industrial and 
electrical equipment, have been reviving in recent months but 
operating rates are generally well below those of the high-growth 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Realtors report hope sales in recent months have fallen about 30% 
from last spring. Most of the decline is attributed to the midyear 
increase in mortgage interest rates. Realtors attribute part of the 
decline to recent changes in FHA and VA rates, which have caused 
customer confusion about the direction and level of rates. The 
inventory of listings is rising because of the slowdown in sales. 
Nominal transactions prices have not yet fallen but are expected to 
decline next spring if demand doesn't recover by then. Realtors 
report a recent increase in use of alternative financing 
arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Builders report that sales of new homes picked up in October and 
November following a third quarter slump, but sales are 13% below 
this time last year. Overall, 1983 will prove to be a profitable 
year for most builders, and builders expect the same level of 
activity in 1984 if mortgage interest rates do not increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In recent weeks, commercial banks in the Fourth District have become 
somewhat less liquid as deposit growth has slowed and loan demand 
has strengthened. Demand deposits declined slightly, while savings 
and small time deposits increased by small amounts. Loan volume 
increased sharply. The bulk of the increase in loans went to banks 
in foreign countries, commercial and industrial borrowers, and 
brokers and dealers. Banks apparently financed the increase in loans 
by reducing their holdings of other earning assets and by issuing 
large denomination CD's. In particular, declines were evident in 
bank holdings of cash, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, 
municipal securities and federal funds sales.
