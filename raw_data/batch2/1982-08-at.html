      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Midsummer economic conditions in the Sixth District remain weak; 
however, signs of increasing activity in some sectors are 
encouraging. An upturn in building permits indicates that the 
outlook for construction may be brightening. The District's farm 
economy is also showing some improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the exception of Atlanta, Knoxville, and 
Jacksonville, retail sales are down or flat in real terms in spite 
of heavy promotions. Sales in Mississippi and Florida seem to be 
especially weak. Home furnishings, most hard goods, and some apparel 
are moving slowly, while menswear, auto parts, and home 
entertainment equipment are doing relatively well. Consumers are 
buying cautiously and paying particular attention to quality. 
Retailers, reporting generally taut inventories and anticipating a 
gradual increase in sales over the next two quarters, are buying 
guardedly for the Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales have come to a virtual standstill since the termination 
of price promotions in early June. Even in metro Atlanta's 
relatively strong economy, July and August floor traffic and buying 
have been quite slow. A spokesman for Atlanta car dealers attributes 
this slowdown to consumer expectations of further declines in 
interest rates and of reinstated price rebates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The construction sector appears to be 
poised for a possible recovery from the slight decline of the past 
several months. In July and early August both single-family and 
commercial building permits rose after a two-month drop. Office 
vacancy rates have been slowly falling. Lower mortgage rates have 
yet to have an impact on the housing market, where most activity is 
attributable to adjustable mortgage loans, state mortgage bond 
programs, and higher income buyers. Nonetheless, realtors and 
thrifts remain hopeful that the market will improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bank loans in Georgia, especially to corporations, are reported to 
be showing strong gains from year-ago levels, whereas loan growth in 
other states is slowing as acceptable loan customers are becoming 
increasingly difficult to find. Because of the decline in energy-
related business activity, bank lending in Louisiana has been 
especially hard hit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Planned capital spending for 1982 amounts to a mere 3.5 percent 
increase in current dollars over last year. Moreover, most of this 
investment is concentrated in the chemical and petroleum industries. 
One bright spot is the Port of Mobile, where recently expanded coal-
handling facilities have contributed to a 103 percent expansion in 
coal exports during the first seven months of 1982 compared with 
1981. Ongoing improvements should allow the port to double current 
coal export capacity by early 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, Sixth District employment 
statistics except in certain "pockets" of prosperity such as Atlanta 
present a bleak picture. From May to June the District's unadjusted 
employment declined slightly (0.4 percent), running counter to both 
seasonal and current national trends. However, average weekly hours 
increased slightly more than in the nation. Regional employment and 
average weekly hours remain below last June's levels. Employment 
growth did occur in some sectors, for example, construction, 
services, and certain nondurable manufacturing industries (food, 
apparel, and paper), but this expansion was generally less than 
seasonally normal. Chemical and petroleum industries in Louisiana 
have been particularly hurt by the recession. Layoffs in Louisiana's
chemical processing plants numbered more than 2,500 in the past six 
months, and more are slated.
     </p>
     <p>
      At 9.4 percent, the region's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate 
in June was down fractionally from May and remained slightly below 
the nation's, largely because of Florida's and Georgia's jobless 
rates of 7.5 and 7.6 percent, respectively. Four of the six District 
states continue to have double-digit jobless rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The tourist industry is thriving in the vicinity of the 
World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, but in Louisiana and Florida, 
business is down and, elsewhere, merely holding steady over last 
year. July attendance at the Fair tapered off somewhat from May and 
June levels but continues to meet official projections. The Fair's 
"spillover effect" is being felt at hotels, motels, campgrounds, 
state and national parks, and private attractions as far away as 
Nashville and in the border regions of Kentucky and the Carolinas. 
However, elsewhere, the Fair has not overcome the effects of the 
recession by triggering the widely anticipated increase in tourist 
trade.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The present outlook for the District's farm economy 
shows a few bright spots and the possibility of future improvement. 
In the livestock sector pork producers are receiving prices 
approximately 15 percent higher than last year. Continuing declines 
in production of both pork and beef presage further price increases. 
Poultry, which is important in the District's farm economy, has not 
yet shown much gain from reductions in supplies of competing meats. 
Aggregate income from the livestock sector is likely to remain below 
1981 levels, but profit margins of individual farmers should 
improve. Crop producers face low prices and forecasts of high 
yields. Cotton and tobacco prices, which have recently shown 
strength, are the sole exceptions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite some improvement District farmers are not likely to be able 
to make significant progress toward debt reduction in 1982. Loan 
delinquencies have declined modestly in recent weeks, but they 
remain alarmingly high by historical standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Panel of Economists
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Local academic, banking, and business 
economists polled in a telephone survey indicated their evaluation 
of the Fed's continuing targets for money growth as acceptable and 
appropriate to anticipated recovery. Their recommendations for 
monetary policy ranged from maintaining the status quo by not 
revising targets upward to stimulating further reductions in short-
term interest rates to foster recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Estimates varied regarding the timing of recovery. Some respondents 
felt that the recession had already reached its trough in all 
District states except Florida and Mississippi, but others were more 
optimistic regarding Florida's economy and less so regarding 
Louisiana's. At least one economist predicted that recovery would 
not begin until spring, 1983, well after the nation's unemployment 
rate surpassed 10 percent. All those polled expected only a weak or 
moderate recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      None have seen much effect from federal income tax cuts and social 
security increases because of the offsetting effects of "bracket 
creep" and higher state and local taxes. Response in Florida was 
expected to be stronger than elsewhere due to the relatively large 
percentage of the work force still employed and the state's 
disproportionately large number of social security recipients. 
Economists surveyed anticipated retail sales of nondurable goods to 
be the prime beneficiary of increased disposable personal income.
