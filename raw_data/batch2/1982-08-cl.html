      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A sluggish national recovery is expected to begin this 
quarter but there are few signs of recovery in the Fourth District. 
Unemployment remains high and additional plants are being closed. 
Consumers remain cautious and capital goods activity is weak. 
Additional inventory reductions are likely. Steel producers and 
farmers continue in difficulty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       National Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District generally 
expect a sluggish national recovery beginning this quarter but have 
scaled down their expected gains in output for the near-term because 
the capital goods slump is sharper than expected. One respondent 
asserted that recovery will not be sustainable without (1) a better 
outlook for Federal deficits, (2) greater conviction by consumers 
that inflation has moderated, and (3) a 200 basis point decline in 
long rates and a further 100 to 150 basis point decline in short 
rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most observers report no signs of recovery in the 
Fourth District, although there are some signs that the bottom is 
near. Primary metals, capital goods, and the coal market are all 
weak. Plant closings and layoffs continue, and capital spending 
plans are being reduced. Preliminary results from our August survey 
of Fourth District manufacturers, however, show some optimism for 
August. On balance, the 19 respondents expect shipments and new 
orders to rise in August after declining in July, and backlogs to be 
unchanged after declining in July. The survey indicates 
manufacturers are significantly more optimistic, or at least less 
pessimistic, in their expectations for August than they were a month 
ago about July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment Situation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets in the District remain weak as 
unemployment continues high, additional plant closings are 
announced, and layoffs exceed callbacks. In Ohio, the unemployment 
rate at 11.8 percent (sa) in July, showed no net change since March. 
Among the District's eleven major SMSA' s, unemployment rates (nsa) 
in June ranged from 9.6 percent in Wheeling to 18.3 percent in 
Youngstown, and most SMSAs had rates about 2 percentage points 
higher than the national rate. Measures of current activity in the 
Pittsburgh area, which usually lags the national economy, show 
continued declines through early July. Initial unemployment claims 
are up significantly, and an index of leading indicators for the 
Pittsburgh region fell in June for the 14th consecutive monthly 
decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Temporary and permanent plant shutdowns continue to be announced. 
Babcock and Wilcox will permanently close an 800 employee boiler 
parts plant by December 1, AM International is permanently closing a 
450 worker duplicating machine parts plant on October 15, Republic 
Steel will "suspend indefinitely" by November 1 operations at two 
bar mills, affecting 700 employees, and Clark Equipment Company is 
closing its 450 employee truck plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. A 
director in southern Ohio reports that layoffs exceed callbacks in 
his area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Consumer
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some respondents assert that the tax cut is not 
leading to a surge in spending on durables. Consumers are very 
cautious because of high interest rates, fear of unemployment, and 
the belief, conditioned by the sticker shock phenomenon, that 
inflation has not abated. One banker estimated car financing rates 
would need to decline to 12% before cars would sell well. Consumers 
are cautious on both necessities and luxuries. A hospital 
association reports patients are now sicker and staying longer than 
several months ago because they delay seeking care, while major 
amusement parks in northern Ohio report attendance is down from last 
year. A major national retailer reports sales are very weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The capital goods industry continues to suffer as new 
orders are weak and planned projects are deferred or stretched out. 
A machine tool manufacturer says orders are flat and will remain 
flat until after two or three quarters of solid increases in PCE. A 
large diversified capital goods manufacturer sees no spark in any of 
his markets. Sales of heavy trucks are below 1974-75 levels. U.S. 
Steel is making sharp reductions in 1982 capital spending plans, 
including stopping construction of a continuous caster in Lorain, 
Ohio. Republic Steel has reduced capital spending plans for 1982 
from $280 million to $200 million. Armco recently reduced planned 
capital spending in 1982 from $570 million to $370 million. Sohio 
has reduced its planned capital spending in 1982 from $3.0 billion 
to $2.6 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      One respondent asserted capital spending could not lead the national 
recovery because (1) capacity utilization is so low, (2) interest 
rates are too high, and (3) the new tax bill would offset a 
substantial part of the tax reductions that corporations obtained 
from the 1981 tax law changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Additional inventory reductions are likely this 
quarter. A major steel producer expects his inventories to fall 
sharply again in the third quarter and less rapidly in the fourth 
quarter. Inventories of oil country pipe are especially high. A 
major automobile producer, who had involuntary inventory 
accumulation in the second quarter wants to reduce inventory this 
quarter but so far has not been successful. A major retailer expects 
less reduction of retail inventories this quarter than last. He 
reports excess stocks of household goods, especially furniture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major steel producers continue in great difficulty. One firm 
forecasts shipments will remain anemic this quarter and show only a 
slight improvement next. Prices are a "disaster," according to a 
director, with oil country pipe prices continuing to fall rapidly 
from a high level and other steel product prices drifting down from 
already low levels. Orders are extremely weak and capacity 
utilization ranges between 40% and 50%.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial difficulty continues among farmers. More 
bankruptcies are expected, even if interest rates fall and crop 
prices rise. Agricultural land prices have fallen by one-third or 
more in eastern Kentucky, and many farmers there who bought land 
just before the price decline now have no equity to collateralize 
working capital loans. A Midwest grain storage executive reports 
grain crops are large, inventories high, and prices low, and asserts 
the farm economy won't turn around very fast.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some bankers acknowledge the prime rate is higher than 
justified by money costs because banks want greater spreads to 
offset loan losses, and because they want to minimize the risk of 
rate increases later in the year. Business loan demand has weakened, 
and loans are limited from the supply side also as bankers have 
become more cautious. Small banks report more problem loans, and 
small businesses being liquidated. A bank that cut mortgage rates to 
16 1/4% from 17% received no customer response and expects none 
until the rate moves below 15%.
