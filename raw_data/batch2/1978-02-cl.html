      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 21, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Blizzards and the effects of the coal shortage have distorted 
  District economic activity for the past several weeks. Retail sales 
  have weakened partly in response to prolonged sub-freezing 
  temperatures throughout most of the District. The coal shortage has 
  hampered manufacturing in some areas, and while layoffs have been 
  minimal, mandatory curtailments in electrical power will cause 
  considerable layoffs when imposed. Savings flows into savings and 
  loans continued to soften in February and while commitments are not 
  being cut back, officials are cautious over prospects for both 
  commitments and mortgage loans for 1978.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers of general merchandise and automobiles attribute some of 
  the weakness in retail sales to severe winter weather. While recent 
  poor performance of sales has not discouraged retailers, some appear 
  less confident than they were a month or two ago. One official of a 
  large department store chain, who remains optimistic for the short 
  run, expects a 15 percent gain in first quarter sales over last 
  year. Sales increases are expected to taper off as the year 
  progresses. An economist with a national retail chain expected some 
  let-up in sales this quarter following an unsustained rate of 
  increase in the fourth quarter of 1977. Despite the large drop in 
  sales during January, he still expects a 9 to 9 1/2 percent increase 
  for the year. A banker noted that retail sales had been depressed 
  directly and indirectly by the coal strike.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto producers and auto suppliers differ on expectations for auto 
  sales and output this year. An economist with a major auto producer 
  expects new car sales of 10.9 million units in 1978, only slightly 
  below his original forecast of 11.2 million last fall. He believes 
  that bad weather over a larger part of the country this year than 
  last has been an important factor in holding down car sales. Auto 
  suppliers, including producers of flat glass, tires and auto 
  components, expect sales in a range of 10.5 to 10.7 million units 
  this year. While suppliers generally note some easing and setbacks 
  in orders from auto producers, none consider this of consequence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coal shortage has resulted in only scattered production cutbacks 
  and layoffs, but worsening conditions can be expected if mandatory 
  controls on electricity are imposed this week in some large 
  metropolitan centers of the District. Of 9 major utilities in the 
  District, all but 3 have plans calling for mandatory cutbacks in 
  power usage that range from 25 to 50 percent when coal stocks fall 
  to a 40-day supply. Three utilities that serve Toledo, Cleveland and 
  Dayton have coal stocks that range from 52 to 60 days. Three 
  utilities that have a mandatory cutback when stocks fall to a 40-day 
  supply have a 43 to 50 day supply. Three utilities have coal stocks 
  that range from 25 to 33 days' supply and plan mandatory cutbacks of 
  50 percent perhaps early this week. One of these utilities serves 
  the Pittsburgh area and another serves northern Ohio.
       </p>
       <p>
        The situation is of course fluid because of daily changes in supply 
  conditions. A principal problem is that several utilities cannot 
  physically increase purchased-power, and supplies of non-union mined 
  coal has either dwindled sharply or has virtually ended. Although 
  coal production this month is estimated at about 25 million tons, 
  compared with a typical monthly average of 60-65 million tons, 
  utilities claim these supplies are not available.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several manufacturers have indicated that they can manage their 
  operations with a 25 percent cutback in electrical power possibly by 
  diverting production to other plants, reducing overtime, reducing 
  the number of shifts, and perhaps, using small generator facilities. 
  Larger cutbacks would result in sizable decreases in both production 
  and employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Supplies of other fuels range from adequate to excessive. A large 
  natural gas supplier in northeast Ohio expects supplies are adequate 
  to accommodate continued below normal temperatures into mid-March, 
  unless temperatures fall much below zero. Another supplier has 
  requested voluntary conservation by its largest customers in order 
  to assure adequate supplies for the coming month. Despite recent 
  cutbacks in refining, inventories of crude, distillate fuels and 
  gasoline are still well above normal levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel operations this quarter appear to be much improved from last 
  quarter. Capacity utilization will probably rise to the mid-80's 
  compared with about 75 percent last quarter. The improvement in part 
  represents price hedge buying, stronger than expected orders for 
  March represent some hedging against the possibility that steel 
  operations will be curtailed by severe cutbacks. Recent steel price 
  increases have been holding, which again is viewed as customer 
  concern over steel supplies. The record volume of steel imports in 
  December is the result of efforts to ship as much steel as possible 
  before the effective date of reference pricing of steel on February 
  21. One steel economist estimates that the selling price of EEC 
  steel shipped into the U.S. should be about $60 per ton higher than 
  the U.S. price, rather than $80-$90 below U.S. prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Executives with thrift institutions are cautious about the outlook 
  for mortgage credit. They have not cut commitments on new mortgage 
  loans and do not expect to curtail commitments unless net savings 
  flows deteriorate further. Officials generally feel there is room 
  for further reduction in liquidity. The main source of concern is 
  volatility of deposit flows, especially in passbook accounts. Most 
  associations had a small gain in net deposits during January, 
  although some larger associations had negative flows. Inflows so far 
  in February are generally positive although outflows were 
  experienced around February 16 when the two-year 7.7 percent 
  Treasury note was offered. Despite positive inflows, several 
  officials noted cash flow this year has been falling behind 
  expectations and in some cases below the volume of commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgage loan demand in the District is described as strong or 
  stronger than last year and one official explained the recent 1/4 
  percent rise in mortgage lending rates in Cleveland (generally 9 
  percent for an 80 percent loan) as an effort to restrain demand. 
  Some associations expect to maintain lending by tapping the 
  secondary mortgage market, and some others plan to either step-up or 
  undertake sale of mortgage backed securities as an additional source 
  of capital.
