     National Summary
This summary is organized around the answers to four key questions 
about current levels of construction activity.

1. How robust is the current upturn in housing sales and 
construction?

2. How serious is the current downturn in nonresidential 
construction activity?

3. How sensitive would activity in the housing sector be to interest 
rate changes of different magnitudes and directions?

4. What is the likelihood of bottlenecks and upward price pressures 
in the construction supplies industries?

Housing Sales and Construction
The recent upswing in housing is widespread geographically, with all 
Districts reporting substantial improvements over the extremely 
depressed levels of the first quarter of 1982. Moreover, a 
moderately high rate of housing construction appears to be 
sustainable at least through 1983. Cautious estimates by economists 
in the construction supply industry indicate an annual rate of 
housing starts of at least 1.5 million units, and the consensus 
among forecasters centers on levels between 1.5 and 1.6 million.

The general feeling is that a marked pickup in the underlying demand 
for houses has occurred, and it was not just January and February's 
good weather that generated the remarkably high figures for those 
months. Moreover, the bad weather in March was probably responsible 
for that month's small drop in seasonally adjusted starts, 
especially in the Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts.

Most Districts reported that sales of low priced homes had picked up 
especially rapidly and there is an apparent tendency toward 
construction and sale of smaller houses. While the houses may be 
smaller than ever, they are apparently still being equipped with a 
full array of appliances. In some regions, Cleveland and 
Philadelphia for example, sales of medium or luxury priced homes 
have also picked up, but the performance of the middle and upper 
markets has been spottier.

While all the Districts reported current improvement, the medium 
term outlook is more mixed. St. Louis and Dallas have started off 
very strong, but starts are expected to slow considerably by the end 
of the year. New York and Boston report activity that is already 
rivaling previous peaks and regional industry observers anticipate 
continued growth. In the other Districts the current level of 
activity falls well below previous peaks, and analysts are uncertain 
as to what the rest of the year will bring.

Nor is there a nationwide pattern in builder confidence. San 
Francisco reports speculative building in anticipation of healthy 
sales later this year. In Richmond and Dallas contractors are only 
completing already-sold homes, and Philadelphia reports a 
substantial, but diminishing, inventory of unsold houses.

Construction of rental housing has also increased, but the strength 
of the upswing varies from District to District in line with the 
tightness of local markets. Rental markets are tight in New York and 
Minneapolis; loose in Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas.

In general then, while there is little doubt that a strong recovery 
in housing is underway, it is not at all certain that the rest of 
1983 will continue as strong as the first quarter.

Nonresidential Construction
The nonresidential construction sector remained generally strong 
over the course of the last recession. Now, however, a slowdown is 
beginning nationwide as large office projects are completed and 
fewer new starts are planned. Vacancy rates have started to climb in 
most reporting regions--exceeding five percent in most places and as 
high as 8 percent in Chicago and 9 percent in Minneapolis. 
Advertised rents for office space have not declined, but several 
Districts report an increasing incidence of rent-reducing special 
deals such as one year's free rent, extensive remodeling, and free 
amenities. Under these conditions developers are taking a "wait and 
see" attitude about future construction plans. vacancy rates will 
have to decline and effective rents will have to increase before 
office construction starts begin to increase again.

The Districts differ in the expected duration of the slowdown in 
commercial starts. Indeed activity has just started to pick up in 
Florida and in some of the smaller Texas cities. Industry analysts 
in New York expect 1984 to be a good year, and new projects are 
being talked about actively in Boston and St. Louis. By contrast, 
observers in Minneapolis fear that it will be three to five years 
before commercial construction activity begins to pick up in that 
District.

None of the Districts reported large amounts of new retail 
construction. Work on smaller shopping malls can be expected to 
begin later this year, about six months after the increase in 
housing construction activity. Only Kansas City reported current 
work on a large shopping mall, and an analyst of large regional 
retail centers does not expect any such projects to be started this 
year across the nation.

Sensitivity to Interest Rates
It is generally agreed that the decline in mortgage rates is the 
single most important factor behind the increase in housing 
activity. Indeed, most respondents tended to feel that a further 
increase in housing sales could still happen even without any 
additional decline in rates. The basic question, however, appears to 
be whether another large drop in conventional, fixed rate, 30 year 
mortgage interest rates--to 10.5 or 11 percent--would bring out a 
great many more potential buyers. Observers in Boston, Philadelphia, 
Atlanta and Minneapolis believe that lower rates would touch off 
something like a boom in housing sales. Analysts in Chicago and 
Dallas are more dubious on this point.

The use of variable rate mortgages, which might reduce the 
sensitivity of housing activity to interest rate fluctuations, does 
not appear to be gaining in consumer acceptance. District reports 
that discussed this issue indicated that the practice of "creative" 
financing had diminished markedly with the drop in rates. The 
conventional 30 year fixed rate mortgage remains, by far, the most 
popular home finance instrument.

The general optimism about the sustainability of a healthy market 
appears to be based on a widespread belief that interest rates will 
not increase. Several Districts report the fear that any increase in 
mortgage interest rates, of say fifty basis points or more, could 
dampen recent growth rates. Market analysts in the New York region, 
however, believe that activity could be sustained, even given a 
small interest rate increase--especially if this were taken as a 
sign that mortgage costs had "bottomed out" and would be increasing 
further in the future.

Input Prices
While there have been a few instances of temporary input shortages 
(notably for lumber and dry wall) and some price rises, observers do 
not expect any sustained pressure on construction costs through this 
year. Construction supply industries are operating far below 
capacity and are apparently capable of increasing production 
quickly; so it is unlikely that anything more than temporary and 
localized shortages will occur in the near future.

However, if mortgage interest rates do fall another percentage point 
or more, and if, as some predict, this leads to an annual level of 
housing starts closer to 1.8 than to 1.6 million, input bottlenecks 
and upward price pressure could begin to become problems.
