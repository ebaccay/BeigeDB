     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Ninth District was sluggish in June and July. 
Most developments were disappointing or at best neutral. Several 
strikes curtailed economic activity; the recovery in district 
manufacturing orders apparently stalled; excess moisture curbed crop 
production and harvests. Farm prices continued to be weak; auto and 
home sales continued to be low; mining and lumbering production 
continued to be weak. Although the increasing foreign exchange value 
of the dollar affected different sectors in different ways, it does 
not appear to have contributed substantially to the general weakness 
of the economy. The one promising sign was that general merchandise 
sales expanded modestly.
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall sluggishness of the district's economy was reflected in 
the continuing weakness in bank lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The improvement in general merchandise sales which began last spring 
continued at a modest pace this summer. Two major Minneapolis-St. 
Paul retailers stated that their sales rose in June and July, but 
not as rapidly as in April and May. Similarly, bank directors 
reported moderate gains in general merchandise sales this summer. 
These sales gains were helped by the dollar's increasing value. One 
large retailer said that the dollar's increasing value has held down 
the costs of imports, thus enabling his firm to offer more 
attractive prices in its discount stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      While general merchandise sales have improved, auto and home sales 
have remained in the doldrums. According to regional sales managers 
for domestic automobile manufacturers, auto sales in June and July 
remained at last spring's depressed level, and according to a 
director from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, several new car 
dealers have gone out of business. Home sales have not improved 
either; mortgage loan applications at Minneapolis-St. Paul S&amp;Ls; did 
not budge from last spring's low level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity and Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial activity has also been sluggish this summer. Many 
district manufacturers continued to operate well below capacity, and 
the recovery in manufacturing orders noted in our last Redbook 
report now appears to have stalled. One large Minneapolis-St. Paul 
manufacturer which supplies construction inputs reported that its 
orders declined in June and July and were below expectations and 
that its customers were holding excess inventories. Other 
manufacturers and directors also indicated that no pickup in 
manufacturing activity occurred this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sluggishness in manufacturing orders cannot be attributed to the 
dollar's increasing value. Several Minneapolis-St. Paul 
manufacturers indicated that if the dollar remained high, it could 
eventually have an adverse effect on their overseas sales, but so 
far, it has not substantially affected them. Because most of these 
firms export specialized products that are not available elsewhere, 
the crucial factor influencing their sales is economic conditions in 
other countries, not the value of the dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like manufacturing, mining and lumbering have remained lackluster. 
Directors reported that coal and oil production and exploration in 
the western end of the district were still increasing, but that low 
iron ore production at the eastern end of the district canceled 
these gains. In addition, weak residential building continued to 
depress the forest products industry at both ends of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growing conditions and farm prices have not improved much since our 
last Redbook report. Last spring drought was a big worry, but many 
farmers in the eastern half of the district are now worried that too 
much moisture will slow crop development and harvests. Although a 
North Dakota director in early July was anticipating excellent crop 
yields, he now only looks for good yields because of excess 
moisture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most prices have remained below last year's highs, and cash grain 
and livestock prices at Minneapolis and South St. Paul either 
remained the same or declined between May and July. The one 
exception was hog prices, which rose 22 percent during this period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The higher value of the dollar, by depressing international demand 
for the district's crops, has helped keep farm prices down. An 
economist with a large railroad indicates that grain shipments from 
our district to ports for export have not been as strong as his firm 
anticipated. He partially attributes these smaller shipments to the 
dollar's higher value making U.S. grain and soybeans less 
competitive in foreign markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Disputes
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The sluggishness in various sectors of the district economy has 
recently been complicated by strikes. The district, like the rest of 
the country, is experiencing slower deliveries and less travel-
related business because of the air traffic controllers' strike. The 
district is also being adversely affected by several other labor 
disputes. Since mid-July, 14,000 State of Minnesota workers have 
been on strike, reducing state services. In addition, labor disputes 
between residential builders and carpenters and between foundries 
and workers have been slowing down construction and manufacturing 
activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The sluggishness in the district's economy is manifested in weak 
bank lending. Loans at Minneapolis-St. Paul area banks in June and 
July were essentially unchanged from their lackluster level this 
past spring. According to directors, bank lending outside the Twin 
Cities also continued to be weak.
