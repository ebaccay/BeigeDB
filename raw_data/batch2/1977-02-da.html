      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for a few problem areas, business conditions in the Eleventh 
  District continue to improve. The unemployment rate has declined to 
  6.0 percent, although total employment has also dipped slightly. 
  Industrial output has not been seriously affected by fuel shortages 
  or weather conditions, and the tight energy situation should spur 
  drilling efforts. With the exception of nonresidential building, 
  construction activity continues to strengthen. Savings and loan 
  associations report that mortgage loan demand is expanding rapidly, 
  and mobile home sales are on the rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fuel shortages have not severely hampered business activity in the 
  District because alternative fuel supplies have been readily 
  available. The only weather-related work stoppages have been due to 
  icy roads that prevented some workers on two days from getting to 
  work in a wide area of North Central Texas and Oklahoma. 
  Curtailments of natural gas used as a feedstock slowed production at 
  a few chemical plants, particularly those that are supplied with 
  interstate gas. But a bigger problem to the chemical industry is 
  transportation bottlenecks that forced some production cutbacks. 
  Frozen rivers halted barge shipments of such products as fertilizer 
  and styrene, and ground transportation was unable to take up the 
  slack.
     </p>
     <p>
      Louisiana officials expressed concern about the possible impact of 
  continuing severe weather. New Mexico has been little affected by 
  the cold wave, but officials are concerned about their limited 
  natural gas supplies should severe weather spill into their state. 
  Efforts to allocate intrastate natural gas into interstate lines is 
  expected to reduce supplies and raise prices in all District states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Drilling activity in Texas, following the seasonal pattern, has been 
  very strong, and the number of offshore rigs has increased in 
  Louisiana. Industry experts expect 1977 to be a good year because 
  the prospects of higher prices for natural gas may stimulate more 
  exploration. The usual midyear downturn in rig activity may not be 
  as sharp this year as in 1976. Wildcat activity, in particular, 
  should be strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction continues to strengthen and appears to be 
  one of the most vigorous areas of business activity in Texas. 
  Housing starts in December were at the highest level since April 
  1974—with the exception of the spurt that occurred last September. 
  One Dallas homebuilder is planning to boost starts by a fourth this 
  year in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston. He also indicated that the 
  number of sold, but not yet completed, homes had soared nearly 
  fourfold from a year ago. Prices for new single-family homes are 
  expected to rise 6 to 8 percent this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Multifamily construction shows signs of slow improvement. Apartment 
  construction in Houston continues strong, and higher occupancy rates 
  in El Paso have led to a renewal in apartment building. A San 
  Antonio builder reported that high occupancy rates should stimulate 
  some apartment construction later this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of nonresidential building remains sluggish. Demand 
  continues weak with increased competition by builders for the 
  declining level of business. A commercial builder in Dallas 
  indicated that profit margins are under steady downward pressure due 
  to ever-increasing costs. Most builders, however, expect a moderate 
  pickup in activity this year as various planned projects get under 
  way.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonbuilding construction is gaining momentum, based largely upon the 
  expanded building programs of Texas utilities. One large electric 
  utility is planning to spend a record $38l million this year, and 
  other utilities are also boosting their construction budgets. 
  Additional spending may be forthcoming from proposed Federal public 
  works programs, according to some builders. Highway construction 
  continues to be the weakest area of building activity. But the 
  prospects for future highway construction in Texas will be 
  determined by a highway funding bill that is currently under study.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some supply shortages may develop for lumber, brick, cement, steel 
  products, plastic pipe, and wallboard with a strong expansion in 
  construction activity. Materials that require a large energy input 
  into their production may be the first to be in short supply. 
  Greater use of insulation materials may also lead to shortages of 
  those products. Residential builders in Houston and Dallas reported 
  that shortages of construction labor have eased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mobile home sales have strengthened considerably during the last 
  several months. A Dallas manufacturer reported that double-wide 
  units are selling well and expects shipments to increase a fifth 
  this year. Higher prices for conventional homes are expected to turn 
  more people toward the mobile home market, but a San Antonio dealer 
  indicated that new mobile home prices are up sharply because of 
  expanded Government regulations. Consumer financing has eased 
  significantly as ample supplies of funds are being made available by 
  S&amp;Ls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings inflows into Texas savings and loan associations continue to 
  rise, but at a slightly reduced pace. However, S&amp;Ls in Houston 
  reported that savings inflows were very heavy in January. Interest 
  rate reductions, lengthened maturities, the elimination of certain 
  maturities, and increased minimum deposit requirements on some CD's 
  by various S&amp;Ls in Dallas and San Antonio have dampened the inflow 
  of funds. The majority of respondents interviewed do not anticipate 
  a lowering in regular passbook savings rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for mortgage loans is expanding rapidly in some areas of 
  Texas. Mortgage demand in Houston and El Paso has remained brisk. 
  However, demand has also climbed sharply in Dallas and San Antonio. 
  A Fort Worth S&amp;L expects an increase in mortgage lending this year 
  of 10 to 15 percent above last year. Mortgage rates on conventional 
  loans currently vary from 8 1/2 to 9 1/4 percent. Most S&amp;Ls expect 
  mortgage rates to ease down a bit more before edging up by year-end.
