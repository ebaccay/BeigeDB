      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 12, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Summer vacations and the model changeover in the automotive industry 
  are hampering this quarter's production of autos, steel, and coal in 
  the Fourth District. Retailers are facing a larger than usual 
  liquidation of stocks of new cars and of general merchandise. 
  Capital spending still lacks a broad-based expansion, and demand for 
  mortgage credit continues strong despite higher interest rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers in the District are still cautious in their appraisals of 
  consumer behavior. Car sales have been sustained at near-record 
  rates since spring. Still, some auto producers expect annual rates 
  of sales this half to fall about 6 percent from the 10 million 
  annual rate of domestic sales last quarter. Inventories are large 
  and still imbalanced, but a larger than usual summer runoff of 
  stocks is expected (especially with a longer Ford shutdown for model 
  changeovers because of downsizing of Ford and Mercury cars). 
  Uncertain over sales prospects, officials with department stores 
  expect smaller gains in real sales for the second half of this year 
  as compared to the first half. Strength in sales has not been 
  broadly based, and inventories of summer goods are heavy. Thus, 
  retailers of general merchandise will be forced to vigorously 
  promote goods throughout the summer with the result that some 
  department and variety stores will likely experience either no 
  improvement or another decline in profits this quarter. Also, some 
  retailers apparently will be cautious in ordering fall and winter 
  merchandise. An official with a major appliance producer reports a 
  strong increase in unit sales of appliances, especially freezers. He 
  reports some excess stocks of ranges and laundry equipment at the 
  distributor level and believes stocks of appliances, except 
  freezers, are large, although masked by a high volume of sales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel production this quarter is not expected to fall as much as 
  usual during the summer months, and industry economists expect the 
  operating rate for the industry to hold close to 90 percent of 
  effective capacity. Order books for July are full, in part because 
  of another steel price hike at the end of this month, and order 
  volume for August and September is better than expected in view of 
  uncertainties over auto production and ample availability of world 
  steel supplies. Steel economists are somewhat concerned over an 
  unexpectedly large buildup of inventories held by distributors. 
  While this buildup has not hampered orders, inventories may be more 
  than ample later this year. Also, a common complaint is that the 
  trigger price system does not seem to be working as evidenced by the 
  much stronger than expected volume of steel imports in May. Steel 
  price differentials have narrowed in favor of U.S. producers and 
  have contributed to a sharply reduced volume of imports from Japan 
  and Western European producers. But imports this year from Third 
  World nations, including Korea, South Africa, and Spain, have risen 
  sharply from a year earlier. Unless imports in June and succeeding 
  months abate from the 18 million ton annual rate in May, some 
  domestic producers may consider filing dumping charges.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rebound in coal production following the long strike is being 
  temporarily hampered by usual summer vacation shutdowns of mines. 
  Production has failed to reach peak levels of late last year, which 
  according to an industry economist, reflects weaker than expected 
  demand for coal. Coal stocks apparently were not run down as badly 
  as reported during the strike, and utilities are not rebuilding 
  stocks as much as expected. According to some utilities, electric 
  power consumption since the coal settlements has not risen in line 
  with industrial activity because of conservation programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The continued lack of broad-based strength in capital goods 
  industries is hampering a robust expansion in spending. For example, 
  capital goods producers of rolling mills and steelmaking facilities 
  still see no meaningful strengthening in sales this year. They 
  report that their order backlogs so far this year have trended 
  downward. A producer of turbines, generators, and nuclear systems 
  reports sales to utilities are still soft, although industrial 
  equipment business continues to be strong. On the other hand, a 
  producer of computers, point-of-sale terminals, and electronics 
  business machines reports sales and backlogs continue to rise, 
  although not at an accelerating rate. A producer of printing and 
  communication equipment reports a spurt in orders in June following 
  a May drop and that backlogs are still growing but less rapidly than 
  last winter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Builders and mortgage lenders concur that demand for housing and 
  mortgage credit remains strong, although there are some scattered 
  signs of buyer resistance to high prices and tightened mortgage 
  terms. Consumer resistance to higher mortgage rates is not as strong 
  as during the tightness in mortgage markets in 1974, according to a 
  financial officer with a major national builder of new houses. He 
  expects housing starts to remain strong at least through the fourth 
  quarter of 1978 regardless of sales. His firm's backlog has been 
  stretched out because of bottlenecks in skilled labor and materials. 
  Mortgage lenders, particularly S&amp;Ls, report little sign of easing 
  in demand despite rising mortgage rates. In Cleveland, for example, 
  the rate of 80-percent loans is generally 9 3/4 percent, but a few 
  S&amp;Ls are charging 10 percent. Some are no longer making 95-percent 
  loans or investment loans on land, apartments, and multifamily 
  units.
       </p>
       <p>
        S&amp;Ls are quite pleased with response to the six-month savings 
  certificate and indicate no waning in consumer interest since the 
  initial offering in early June. These S&amp;Ls, however, have been 
  aggressively promoting certificates. Their view is that these 
  certificates helped boost deposits in June to the best volume so far 
  this year and have enabled these associations to meet strong loan 
  demand. Some report that at least 60 percent of the certificates 
  represent new money.
