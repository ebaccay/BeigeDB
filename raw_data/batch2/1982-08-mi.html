      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Previously reported weaknesses in district economic activity have 
persisted through the summer. So far, the only important evidence we 
see of the consumer-led recovery predicted by many economists is a 
strong showing in tourism and vacation spending. Consumers have 
remained unwilling to spur the district economy stepping up their 
purchases of merchandise, homes, and motor vehicles. Manufacturing 
orders and production have continued to shrink this summer, and the 
already depressed lumber and metal mining industries have suffered 
additional blows. While district crops have benefited from superb 
growing conditions., this has been a mixed blessing at best, 
primarily serving to aggravate farmers price problems. Confirming 
these weaknesses has been a continued decline in new bank loans. 
Demand to roll over existing credits has been strong, but much of 
this lending activity must be attributed to borrowers' liquidity 
problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism accounts for approximately 7 percent of district 
nonagricultural employment, and this summer it has been the one 
bright spot on our otherwise dreary economic landscape.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the western half of the district, tourism is oriented to travel 
and sightseeing (the Black Hills, Mount Rushmore, Glacier National 
Park, for example), and these activities have been expanding lately. 
In North and South Dakota, state tourism directors report that 
tourism in June and July was up about 3 percent from 1981 levels, 
and 1981 was itself a good year. In Montana, poor weather held down 
spending by tourists in May and June, but the state tourism office 
indicates that business in July and early August was much improved, 
well ahead of a year ago. These vacation areas are far from major 
population centers and primarily reached by automobile. Thus, 
industry sources attribute much of the improvement to the recent 
easing in gasoline prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism in the eastern half of the district has been respectable 
this summer, but not as strong as in the western half. Resorts, 
fishing, camping, and the like dominate the eastern area's tourism 
business. Resort operators and trade association officials in 
Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan indicate that business has been up from a year ago at some 
resorts, down at others. This spottiness is attributed largely to 
reduced group entertaining by corporations and, in some areas, to 
poor weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While consumers have been willing to spend on vacations, they have 
continued to be reluctant to make other purchases. An economist for 
a locally headquartered national retailer reports that his firm is 
"waiting but still hopeful." Major department and discount stores in 
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area report that weak sales (reported in 
recent Redbooks) continued into July. Specialty store revenues have 
also been flat. A national book retailer, headquartered in 
Minneapolis, terms its summer sales as "soft," and a large 
Minneapolis company with several specialty retailing subsidiaries 
characterizes recent sales as "weak." Federal Reserve Bank of 
Minneapolis directors report that merchandise sales outside the Twin 
Cities area have also been soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers have remained wary of big-ticket items such as homes and 
motor vehicles. According to the Minneapolis Board of Realtors, July 
home sales in Minneapolis and its suburbs were down 25 percent from 
the already depressed level of a year ago. Furthermore, after 
reporting in our last Redbook that motor vehicle sales had 
strengthened modestly in May and early June, regional sales managers 
indicate that sales turned down again in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Accompanying weak consumer spending has been a continuing decline in 
manufacturing orders and production. District manufacturers of toys, 
housewares, and cosmetics report that retailers have simply not been 
ordering this summer. Also, orders received by district paper 
manufacturers have been "weakening rapidly," according to a director 
associated with that industry. Until recently, this was one of the 
district's strongest manufacturing sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lack of demand has continued to reduce production as evidenced by 
more layoffs announced in early August: a Minneapolis clothing 
manufacturer, 30 workers; two Minneapolis-St. Paul computer 
manufacturers, 73 workers; a St. Paul manufacturer of heavy 
equipment, 270 workers; and a South Dakota meat-packer, 600 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumbering and mining have been further depressed this summer too. 
Not only has weak construction activity continued to hold down 
lumber production, but directors report that unseasonably heavy 
summer rains at both ends of the district have interfered with 
logging operations. Also, several iron mining companies extended 
their previously announced shutdowns, (discussed in our last 
Redbook). Iron ore production at district mines this year is now 
projected to total 35 million tons or less, well below the 50 
million tons that industry sources were estimating in early June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Good growing conditions in the district and elsewhere have driven 
down crop prices and exacerbated the problems confronting farmers in 
the district. The threat of cold and wet weather in the spring did 
not materialize, and prospects now are for record harvests in the 
Ninth District. However, local storage facilities are full to 
capacity from previous harvests, and many farmers are not eligible 
for price support loans on this year's crops. For example, only 25 
percent of Minnesota corn producers are eligible for price support 
loans. The threat of this fall's bumper crops forcing large amounts 
of grain on the market has sent corn and soybean prices tumbling 
from already weak levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      To compound district farm problems, farm stored grains in Minnesota 
are reported to have above average amounts of insect infestation and 
mold this year. If those reports are true, some Minnesota farmers 
will have difficulty getting even these poor prices for privately 
stored grains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent bank lending has reflected these weaknesses in the district 
economy. A Minneapolis-St. Paul banker indicates that new bank loans 
at metropolitan area banks have "drifted down" through the summer. 
Outside the metropolitan area, the poor farm economy has been 
slowing debt repayment. At the end of June, 43 percent of the rural 
bankers responding to our Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey 
expected the demand for farm debt refinancing in their area to be 
greater than normal in the third quarter. Moreover, 62 percent 
characterized the current rate of debt repayment as slow.
