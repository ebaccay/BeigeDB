      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recession in the Seventh District accelerated in the 
past six weeks. Virtually all sectors showed new weakness—producer 
and consumer goods manufacturing, construction, retail trade, 
transportation, services, and government. Perhaps the only sector 
reporting real growth is medical care, including the manufacture of 
hospital supplies and equipment. Signs of financial stringency in 
business and agriculture are widespread. Inventories are being 
reduced, because of poor sales in some cases, but primarily to 
reduce cash needs. Demand for workers may be at the lowest level 
since the 1930s. Price discounting is common in wholesale markets, 
but much less so at retail. Capital expenditure programs are being 
curtailed, and many equipment producers plan reduced operations and 
extended Christmas shutdowns. Retailers report disappointing sales
of both hard and soft goods. Auto and truck output is being slashed. 
Housing is near rock bottom and most nonresidential construction is 
weak. Excellent harvests are pulling downward pressure on farm 
prices and farm income. Recent declines in interest rates are 
helping to boost sagging morale, but substantial further declines 
are needed to stimulate depressed sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Pessimism prevails
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our last Redbook contribution emphasized the 
failure of expected improvements in demand to materialize. Now 
attention centers on cutbacks in output and spending plans. Fourth 
quarter shipments of motor vehicles, steel, building materials, and 
various producer and consumer durables will be significantly below 
last year's unsatisfactory rates. Reports of layoffs and plant 
closings, temporary or permanent, are widespread. The heaviest blows 
are scheduled for the mid-December/mid-January period, preceding and 
following the normal Christmas shutdowns. Unlike most earlier post-1945 slowdowns, declines are not balanced by increases in employment 
in services and government, or by prosperity in the farm sector. In 
fact, these sectors are reinforcing weakness elsewhere. Despite 
general pessimism, most businessmen and analysts expect a revival in 
the future, but the timing has been pushed back to next spring or 
early summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Foreign competition
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The high value of the dollar is encouraging 
imports and discouraging exports of various items, but particularly 
motor vehicles, steel, and machine tools. Demand from Europe for 
district producer goods is depressed. However, some companies, 
especially construction equipment producers, report increased demand 
from the Southern Hemisphere and the Middle East, partly reflecting 
stepped-up sales efforts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor negotiations
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many district employers are demanding 
concessions by labor unions on wages, COLAs, medical insurance, 
pensions and other fringes. Some are emphasizing changes in work 
rules to improve productivity. Results of these efforts have been 
mixed, with success usually dependent on a realization that plants 
would be closed or activities drastically curtailed if agreement was 
not reached. Foreign and nonunion competition play large roles in 
these negotiations. Confrontations will be frequent and prolonged, 
especially in trucking, motor vehicles, steel, and meat packing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price discounting is reported in various 
wholesale markets, notably in steel, nonferrous metals, and building 
materials. Company analysts insist that the "pipelines are virtually 
empty". With output reduced and capacity being withdrawn, a revival 
in demand could bring a resurgence in price increases in these 
sectors. Profit margins of manufacturers, retailers, and utilities 
are low or nonexistent, and prices will be raised as soon as supply 
and demand come into balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital expenditures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many companies are canceling or postponing 
major capital spending projects. Most prominent is the auto 
industry, where spending plans have been scaled down drastically. A 
sizable drop in interest rates would reactivate plans for many 
smaller commercial and industrial buildings, but the adjustment in 
auto industry plans reflects inadequate cash flow resulting from 
poor sales. Given an uptrend in demand the 1981 Tax Act will aid the 
eventual recovery in capital spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Cars and trucks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Motor vehicle sales in October dropped to new lows, 
and resulted in further cutbacks in production schedules for late 
1981 and early 1982. Output of heavy-duty trucks has been cut very 
sharply. The auto industry blames high interest rates for poor 
sales, but high prices, lack of appeal of heralded new models, the 
depressed economy, and consumer caution are probably more important.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of both hard and soft goods are weak except when 
pushed by heavy promotions and price cuts. Credit buyers are being 
screened more closely. Some analysts believe that All Savers CDs and 
the new IRA accounts will adversely affect consumption of 
nonessentials. Stores have ordered cautiously for the Christmas 
season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Builders see a ray of light in the recent, slight easing of 
mortgage rates, but even a substantial cut in rates will not help 
the extremely low level of construction activity this year. However, 
builders would begin to make commitments for materials for a fast 
start in 1982. Conventional financing is virtually nil. Most 
creative financing, in effect, cuts asking prices on homes by as 
much as 20 percent, but this does not show up in published data.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Government
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State and local governments have been postponing 
construction projects, curtailing services, restricting hirings, and 
even laying off workers, (unprecedented since the 1930s). The 
reasons include reduced tax collections, less federal aid, increased 
welfare claims, high interest rates, and union demands. On November 
3, moreover, voters rejected 75 percent of the proposed tax 
increases, usually by wide margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Corn and soybean harvests are rapidly nearing 
completion, and production estimates have been raised further. 
Prospects for a large crop carryover suggest no improvement in 
prices, now about 20 percent below last year. Soybean exports are 
above last year but corn is down. Market speculation centers on the 
probable size and composition of Soviet purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm land prices rose one percent in the third quarter and were 8.5 
percent above last year, according to our survey, but there are 
signs that demand for land is weakening. Bankers report slower 
repayment on production loans and more extensions and renewals. 
Credit is available to farmers at current rates, but loan demand is 
slow.
