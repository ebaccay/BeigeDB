      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 29, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents in the Fourth District still expect a recession in 
1980, but are less certain over the timing and depth than they were 
in recent months. Retail sales in December and early January, 
especially of non-durable goods continue to be somewhat better than 
expected, apparently in response to heavy sales promotions. Auto 
sales have picked up in the early weeks of January, although most 
respondents expect production in the first quarter to remain weak. 
Fixed investment, except automotive, continues to be a major source 
of strength in the economy, despite some loss of momentum noted by 
capital goods producers. Housing demand is weak, and S&amp;Ls report 
adequate funds to meet current levels of demand despite some decline 
in savings flows into thrift institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some economists are skeptical of recently reported estimates of 
consumption expenditures and retail sales for December. They are 
therefore uncertain about the timing of a recession. In view of 
unexplained behavior by consumers, some now feel a recession will be 
shallow and brief. A retail economist attributes much of the 
strength in retail sales to widespread promotions, which should 
continue to support sales through January. However, discount stores 
in Ohio did not do as well as those department stores that cut 
prices, according to an area retailer, and sales of smaller 
merchants were off 2%-3% from year-earlier levels. A consumer goods 
producer believes that durable goods sales have flattened because 
appliance prices have been rising below the rate of inflation, which 
lessens the buy-in-advance behavior of consumers. A major appliance 
producer reports sales are holding up better than expected, and that 
dealers in some areas report spot shortages of ranges refrigerators 
and a surplus of dishwashers. Sales of nondurable goods appear to 
have benefited from the slow growth in durables and lower-than-expected energy bills. An area clothing producer reports no drop in 
orders yet and expects sales to remain relatively strong for the 
next five months. Growth in real sales of food has slowed, according 
to an economist with a food store chain, in contrast to a decline in 
sales of fast-food restaurants. He expects food price increases in 
1980 to be in the 8%-9% range because of reduced demand associated 
with slower growth in disposable income and improved supplies, 
except for beef.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer buying of autos has picked up after several weeks of 
weakness, but production is expected to remain depressed until 
inventories are in better balance. A local auto dealer reports 
January auto sales have risen 10% from December, but are still below 
January 1979. Reasons for the increased sales range from advanced-buying brought on by the mild winter to increased supplies of X-body 
cars. However, an auto economist reports that dealers are ordering 
cars without special features for faster turnover. He expects total 
new car sales to be somewhat above 9.2 million in 1980. A tire 
economist reports that sales were poor in the fourth quarter of 
1979, and expects that the first quarter of 1980 will continue to be 
weak both in the original equipment and replacement markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fixed investment should continue to be strong at least through the 
first half of 1980. One official expects the strength in capital 
spending to come from relatively good profits and high utilization 
rates among most industries, especially aerospace and petroleum. An 
economist with an aluminum producer states that capital spending in 
that industry remains strong. A capital goods supplier notes 
weakness in agricultural and heavy construction machinery, and a 
steel economist states their order pattern suggests that electrical 
and non-electrical machinery industries may be losing some momentum. 
However, several respondents note a change in the underlying factors 
affecting capital spending which make it less susceptible to 
cyclical swings. Investments are more short-term because of 
increased uncertainty; many are limited to replacement for cost-saving in labor and energy which have a quick pay-off; and many are 
mandated by government regulations. Defense spending will eventually 
boost economic activity, but several defense subcontractors expect 
little significant upward thrust for most of this year. Defense 
goods suppliers are concerned that a skilled labor shortage and 
severe capacity constraints will hold down real spending for defense 
from the Administration's proposed 5.8% increase this year. An 
electronics producer cites bottlenecks in computer chips and 
aluminum castings that will stretch out production and delivery 
schedules.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing starts in December held up better than expected, but several 
S&amp;L officials and economists attribute the strength to a record 
level commitments built up earlier in 1980. Moreover, a mild winter 
may be distorting the housing numbers. An S&amp;L official states that 
the seasonal adjustment may have overstated actual starts in 
December and may understate strength in January. One S&amp;L official 
expects a drop in starts below 1.5 million units in January. He 
cites a persistent decline in sales of new and used houses that will 
lead to a drop in starts this quarter. Mortgage funds are generally 
available to meet the present low level of demand. Most of the 
weakness in housing is attributed to weak demand. Therefore, several 
mortgage lenders have lowered their mortgage interest rates in 
recent weeks. Officials do not expect rates to fall much below 
121/2% because of the high cost of funds associated with the 
steadily rising proportion of deposits held in savings certificates 
and "jumbo" CDs. One S&amp;L official estimates profit margins for most 
S&amp;L associations at 1% or lower and slipping fast. Some S&amp;Ls expect 
to show losses during the first quarter of 1980, and one S&amp;L 
official expects 1980 to be the "toughest" year for thrifts in the 
post-World War II period.
