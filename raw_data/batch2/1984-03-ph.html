      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy has shown unexpected strength over the 
last six weeks. Local manufacturing posted gains in February, and 
retailers continue to experience surprisingly high levels of sales. 
In the financial sector, C&amp;I loan activity is finally showing steady 
growth after months of disappointing performance. And, in the real 
estate industry, steady mortgage interest rates and some pent-up 
demand for homes have spurred sales since mid-January.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the next six months is marked by general optimism 
but with a touch of caution. Manufacturers expect increasing 
activity into the summer and retailers foresee continued strong 
sales. Both bankers and realtors, however, have expressed concern as 
mixed interest rate forecasts lead to varied outlooks for the two 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Third District manufacturing sector posted further increases in 
activity in February, according to the most recent Business Outlook 
Survey. While February's gains were not as robust as the previous 
month's, over 37 percent of those surveyed reported an improvement 
in activity over very healthy January levels, roughly 40 percent of 
manufacturers surveyed reported that new orders and shipments have 
continued to rise, while producers' backlogs and delivery times were 
unchanged. Inventories increased marginally, their first monthly 
gain since May 1981. As for employment, both payrolls and the length 
of the average workweek held steady at their January levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite less prevalent gains in manufacturing activity during 
February, the outlook for the next two quarters is even more 
optimistic than January's. Eighty percent of these surveyed expect 
their businesses to expand further by July, and the percentage at 
respondents planning to increase capital expenditures remains 
encouragingly high. Additionally, over 70 percent foresee continuing 
gains in both new orders and shipments into mid-summer. The 
employment picture also looks bright, with roughly half of the 
survey respondents expecting larger payrolls, and one-third 
forecasting a longer workweek by July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices continued their pattern of steady increases in 
February. Thirty percent of the executives polled said they were 
paying more for materials than in January, while only 16 percent 
reported receiving higher prices for finished products. The six-
month outlook was virtually unchanged from January's; 84 percent 
predicted higher producer costs by July, and 61 percent anticipated 
receiving higher prices for their own products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers are enjoying continued success as early 
March sales are up an unexpected 20 percent over a year ago. 
Merchants credit the performance to unusually mild weather, the 
continued strength of the consumer sector, and low sales at this 
time last year. Despite such surprising robustness, retail 
executives report no shortages of merchandise. Leading sellers 
include men's and women's sportswear and "soft" home furnishings. 
Several store managers note that credit sales have increased 
recently relative to cash sales, reflecting what they feel is 
perceived economic security on the part of the consumer and the 
anticipation of tax refunds. No area retailers expect to levy a 
surcharge on credit purchases if Congress votes to remove the ban on 
such fees. They feel that credit surcharges would penalize the 
majority of their customers and have a devastating effect on sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers say that current in-store promotions are typical for this 
time of year, but add that the general level of such promotions is 
on the rise as the industry becomes more competitive in the 
Philadelphia area. Many report that they are conducting extensive 
media advertising and will continue to do so in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, merchants are uncertain over late March sales due to 
the late Easter season, but generally forecast sales to be 10 
percent to 15 percent higher than a year earlier over the next six 
months. Accordingly, inventory plans, even those of traditionally 
conservative retailers, are very expansive for the same period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers report moderate but steady increases in 
overall loan activity since mid-January. Many contacts are pleased 
that, despite the prevailing strength in corporate liquidity, C&amp;I; 
loan activity has made steady gains since early January. Current 
levels of business loans outstanding generally range from 10 percent 
to 20 percent ahead of February 1983, although one smaller bank 
reports an 8 percent decline from last year. Reports on consumer 
lending are mixed; the majority of those contacted are experiencing 
a seasonal slowdown in retail loan growth, while others, who have 
been marketing consumer loans very aggressively and expanding their 
credit card operations, have experienced growth rates of up to 4 
percent over the past six weeks. Current reports of consumer loans 
outstanding range from 12 percent to 40 percent over year-ago 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Encouraged by the recent steady improvement in the C&amp;I; sector, 
bankers predict moderate, but consistent commercial loan growth 
throughout the year, with forecasts ranging from 10 percent to 15 
percent above same-period 1983 levels. Financial executives base 
their optimistic outlook on the continued strength of the economy, 
rising capacity utilization rates, and an erosion of corporate 
liquidity. The retail outlook is mixed, however, with buoyant 
consumer confidence offset to some extent by the spectre of higher 
interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area banks are currently quoting a prime rate of 11 percent, 
unchanged since August 1983, but contacts anticipate some upward 
movement in rates for 1984. Most predict, however, that rates will 
do very little over the next six months as economic growth eases and 
Fed policy remains steady. It is during the last quarter of 1984 
that local bank economists foresee increased borrowing demands, 
rising inflation, and tight Fed policy driving rates up by 25 to 100 
basis points.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate and housing activity in the Third District has been 
flourishing since mid-January. February housing sales are up between 
15 percent and 20 percent from a fair February 1983, although one 
major builder in New Jersey says his sales have tripled. Stable 
mortgage interest rates are cited as the primary reason for the 
recent surge in sales. Also mentioned as strong contributing factors 
are very mild mid-winter weather and significant pent-up demand from 
last fall when more widespread interest rate uncertainty kept many 
prospective buyers out of the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Homes in the $75,000 to $125,000 price range in the City of 
Philadelphia and in the $70,000-$85,000 range in suburban areas are 
exhibiting the strongest sales. Buyer traffic seems to be split 
along geographical lines; suburban contacts report that traffic has 
nearly doubled since early January, while Philadelphia realtors have 
seen the same number of, or fewer, customers. Inventories of unsold 
homes have remained at fairly constant levels despite the heavy 
sales, but contacts note that units are staying on the market for a 
much shorter duration.
