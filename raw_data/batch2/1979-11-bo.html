      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        More and more First District respondents are reporting signs of a 
  recession. Retail sales are soft. Manufacturers generally report 
  that business is fairly good but "good" seems to have been redefined 
  over the past few months. Previously it meant that unit sales were 
  growing, now it seems to mean that sales are holding even with last 
  year. In the financial sector, loan demand seems to have slowed 
  slightly although it still remains quite strong. Mortgage money 
  continues to be available although at high rates--lenders are 
  rationing by price.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales in New England are quite weak. There have been 
  occasional weeks in which sales have been vigorous but these have 
  been followed by periods in which sales have been very depressed. 
  The erratic nature of demand is making inventory management very 
  difficult. The head of a large department store chain with national 
  ties believes that sales in New England are considerably weaker than 
  those elsewhere. This same firm is reassessing its expansion plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports from the manufacturing sector are significantly less gloomy 
  but respondents no longer question whether we are really in a 
  recession. Thus, the head of a firm making graphics reports that 
  business has been quite strong but that he is reevaluating capital 
  spending plans and reassessing factory schedules in expectation of a 
  weak first quarter. A large furniture maker notes that attendance at 
  a major trade show was down 20-25 percent from last year; aggressive 
  firms fared well, but the weaker companies had very little business. 
  A manufacturer of building materials also reports that demand has 
  fallen off. Customers who normally stock up their inventories over 
  the winter month are not doing so this year. This firm, which sells 
  heavily to the rehabilitation market, believes that high interest 
  rates will mean that much less rehabilitation will be done in 1980 
  than customarily occurs in recessions. Repair and rehabilitation 
  activity is usually quite strong in recessions as contractors, who 
  normally prefer new construction, accept less attractive 
  rehabilitation jobs. Defense contracts continue to be a source of 
  strength. A number of businessmen report that collections from 
  customers have slowed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the financial sector, banking directors from northern New England 
  have seen some softening in loan demand, primarily on the commercial 
  side. However, a large bank from one of the southern states reports 
  that after leveling off loan demand has picked up again. None of the 
  business firms contacted was experiencing difficulties in securing 
  funds. In addition, a survey of small businesses, conducted in the 
  last two weeks of October by one of the area's large banks, found 
  that most small firms were still able to get funds at or slightly 
  above the prime rate. A majority of these firms expect funding to be 
  more difficult to obtain in the future, but at the present time they 
  still view inflation as the greatest problem. Home mortgage loans 
  are still available. Institutions in the region are taking advantage 
  of the secondary market to secure funds and are allowing the price 
  to ration demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Tobin, Solow and Samuelson were 
  available for comment this month. Eckstein supports the "new 
  monetary policy"; however, he believes the aggregates will not be 
  fully under control until the economy itself is under control. 
"Having embarked on this course of controlling reserves, we should 
  see it through, with the proviso that we watch the financial system 
  closely. With the impending business slump there are risks of 
  serious financial disturbances, especially for 'second tier firms 
  Eckstein suspects that the "real crunch has yet to come." He hopes 
  that the new policy will allow interest rates to fall as rapidly as 
  they rose when business activity declines in late 1979 and early 
  1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        Houthakker is pleased that the Fed is now concerned more about 
  controlling reserves than controlling interest rates. He believes, 
  for example, that a 15 percent funds rate is appropriate given 
  today's market conditions, but the rate should be free to change 
  when conditions change. He cannot fully endorse the new procedures, 
  however, until he knows which concept of reserves is now under 
  control and what reserve target the Fed is trying to achieve. 
  Houthakker believes we have been in a recession since the beginning 
  of 1979; the recession will be lengthy, but not deep. He expects the 
  growth of GNP in the early 1980s will be much like that in the late 
  1950s--business activity will expand slowly and unevenly. Because 
  the current consumer price index temporarily exaggerates the true 
  inflation rate, fiscal and monetary policy could reduce inflation to 
  7 or 8 percent by the end of 1980 "without undue damage," but the 
  unemployment rate may have to rise as high as 7.5 or 8 percent. In 
  any event, Houthakker thinks the eradication of inflation will take 
  years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tobin believes the benefits of the new control procedures have been 
  exaggerated. Because his research shows little or no connection 
  between short-term movements in reserves and money aggregates or 
  total credit, he is not convinced the Fed's control of the money 
  stock is now more reliable. Tobin believes that there is now a high 
  probability of a recession in 1980 and that it is dangerous "to keep 
  tightening until we see the whites of the recession's eyes. We 
  should get our bearings before embarking on another round of 
  restraint." The high inflation is not the fault of monetary policy, 
  in his opinion. If OPEC raises prices again, he hopes the Fed 
  realizes it cannot costlessly offset the inflationary shock. In the 
  event of an oil price increase attainment of a satisfactory 
  unemployment rate and inflation rate is impossible: higher real oil 
  prices must either depress production or increase domestic 
  inflation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Solow has mixed feelings about the October policy. The higher 
  marginal reserves on banks' "bought funds" is "unambiguously a good 
  step." He believes the sharp increase in interest rates was 
  exaggerated, however, perhaps to defend the dollar at the October 6 
  parity. He is not sure that this particular exchange rate is an 
  equilibrium rate. He questions whether maintaining the exchange rate 
  with high interest rates best serves our domestic needs or best 
  serves the interests of German exporters and German monetary policy, 
  a policy whose objectives certainly are not very sensitive to our 
  domestic problems. Before Solow can fully evaluate the new control 
  procedure, he must see it in action. To the extent that wider 
  tolerance bands for the funds rate reduce wide procyclical swings in 
  the money stock, the new policy is to be commended. To the extent 
  that smoother growth of the aggregates destabilizes GNP and 
  employment growth, however, the new policy is a "destructive step 
  backwards." Solow argues that stable money growth may not be 
  consistent with stable GNP growth; "the Fed needs to take a broad 
  view in forming policy, especially now that the money demand 
  function may have come loose at the seams."
       </p>
       <p>
        Samuelson also has mixed feelings about the new monetary procedure. 
  Now that interest rates may "float," in theory, the Fed may have 
  more success in attaining its money targets. In practice, however, 
  he notes that contemporaneous reserve accounting, among other 
  reforms, must be adopted before the Fed can achieve this goal. 
  Samuelson believes there are substantial dangers in any procedure 
  that has no "safety-valve": the old policy, though it had its 
  faults, could accommodate shifts in money-demand without disturbing 
  GNP. Samuelson is worried that the Fed may make stable money growthâ€”rather than high employment with low inflationâ€”the ultimate goal 
  of policy. Our experience of rising inflation does not prove that 
  counter-cyclical monetary policy has been a failure, rather it 
  suggests the trend rate of money growth has been too high. Now that 
  the consensus forecast anticipates an imminent recession, it is 
  prudent and rational to avoid further monetary restraint. "If our 
  goal is zero growth, we have overshot the target, not by accident, 
  and it is hypocritical to be surprised if we have a recession."
