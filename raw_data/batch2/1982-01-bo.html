      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The recession has taken hold in the First District. Retailers' 
reports of the Christmas season were mixed, ranging from 
"disappointing" to "strong"; but all made gloomy predictions for the 
first quarter of 1982. In the manufacturing sector, orders and 
backlogs have fallen. Manufacturers are responding by cutting back 
on inventories and overhead. One encouraging development was a 
report that sales are picking up in Europe. Also, despite the 
problems in retailing and manufacturing, banking directors report 
very good earnings in 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Among retailers contacted, December sales in New England as compared 
to December 1980 ranged from a "disappointing" seven-percent 
increase to "strong double-digit" growth. The seven-percent increase 
was disappointing because it was well below what was planned and 
supported; however, it still compared favorably with a 5 to 6 
percent inflation rate for merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year's timing problems were repeated this year, with 
considerable bunching of December sales into the week just before 
Christmas. Because of the soft retail market in October and 
November, many stores began holiday promotions and discounting 
earlier than usual in December to reduce their inventories. These 
efforts increased sales but cut profit margins. All respondents 
commented that consumers bought very selectively this year, focusing 
on value. Customers were said to buy items that were promoted and 
discounted, with little spillover to other merchandise. No one 
reported excessive or unusual post-Christmas returns or exchanges, 
and sales continued at acceptable levels during the week after 
Christmas. However, stores that did not adjust to the weakness in 
November found themselves at the end of December with larger 
inventories than they had planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even those who met or exceeded December plans said the momentum 
would not carry over. All expected poor January results, partly 
because of the extended bad weather already experienced in most of 
New England. One noted that large increases in the unemployment rate 
make all consumers more cautious. Not believing that the worst of 
the recession is over, all the merchants with whom we spoke 
predicted that their first quarter (February through April) would 
continue the pre-December weakness, probably yielding sales growth 
below the merchandise inflation rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions have deteriorated over the past two months for 
First District manufacturers. In a survey of local purchasing 
managers conducted in December, the number reporting that production 
and employment increased during the month fell sharply; fewer than 
15 percent reported increased orders, almost 60 percent experienced 
order reductions. Among firms contacted directly, business ranged 
from "grim" to "pretty good," but most reported some falloff in 
activity. The commercial aircraft business has been particularly 
hard hit. Financial difficulties have forced the airlines to 
postpone purchases of new aircraft and engines, and the lighter 
schedules since the controllers' strike have enabled them to cut 
back on replacement parts as well. Increases in defense work have 
not prevented substantial layoffs in this industry. However, defense 
remains one of the bright spots for many New England manufacturers. 
The problems of the auto industry are reaching back to their 
suppliers; several firms reported that sales of automotive products 
have fallen in recent months. A machine tool plant, heavily 
dependent on the auto industry, finds business very soft. A producer 
of heavy capital equipment reports that decreases in orders and 
backlogs in the automotive area are particularly pronounced; this 
executive believes that the auto companies are sharply cutting back 
their capital spending. Electronics is another weak area, although 
one manufacturer attributed his difficulties more to price 
competition from the Japanese than to the recession. Business 
remains poor for consumer electrical products and for electrical 
equipment installed in new industrial buildings. Because of the 
declining orders, firms are cutting back on inventories and 
overhead. One firm, on the other side of the inventory adjustment 
process, reports that he is getting the same number of orders as 
before but the orders are smaller.
     </p>
     <p>
      The one positive development in the manufacturing sector is an 
apparent improvement in European demand. Two firms, one a 
manufacturer of industrial machinery and the other a supplier of 
high technology printing equipment and supplies, have seen a pickup 
in European sales. In both cases these firms produce in Europe, so 
that the strong U.S. dollar is not a disadvantage. However, the 
manufacturer of heavy capital equipment had been operating on a 3 
and 4 day workweek in the United Kingdom and has now returned to a 
full schedule. A large manufacturer of electrical equipment also 
reports that new export orders are good, but this firm had not 
previously seen a downturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of three large manufacturers who were asked about labor strategies 
in 1982, one said they would be looking for concessions; one said 
they were not altering their bargaining strategy but they expected 
the settlement to be more moderate; and the third foresaw no change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Houthakker, Samuelson, and Tobin were available for 
comment this month. Houthakker believes the relatively low rate of 
M-1B growth last year and the relatively low M-1 target for 1982 
will restrain real growth in 1982 and 1983 more than is desirable. 
M-1B, at best, only attained the bottom of its target in 1981. The 
M-2 target was too low to be consistent with the M-1B target last 
year, so Houthakker is not consoled by M-2's exceeding its 1981 
target. In 1982, Houthakker believes the Fed should announce a 4 
percent to 6 percent range for M-1 growth. He believes midrange 
money growth of 4 percent is too low, and he fears that M-1 growth 
may fall below 3 percent, especially if the Fed once again pays 
attention to the inconsistent, relatively tight M-2 target. 
Houthakker believes "it is not unreasonable to expect the inflation 
rate to decline as much as 2 percentage points a year," but he 
believes "the announced targets would require more deceleration in 
inflation than we can reasonably expect."
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson was not surprised by real GNP's 5.2 percent decline in the 
fourth quarter of 1981. The current data suggest that production may 
decline only slightly in the first quarter of 1982 and may "hold its 
own in the second quarter before beginning a recovery in the second 
half of the year. Samuelson believes "there is no reason for the Fed 
not to adhere to the upper range of its money growth target in 
1982."
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson, Houthakker, and Tobin agree that the Fed should not be 
concerned about the large increases in the weekly money stock in 
early January. According to Samuelson: "The Fed is not pursuing a 
"money-out-of-control' policy—there is poor empirical evidence 
and no theoretical basis for believing the short-term variance of 
money growth is important. Domestic money growth has been much more 
stable and smooth than money growth in other countries. Now that 
money growth is so stable, the Madison Avenue residents of Wall 
Street are down to examining every minute entrail of the goose. But 
this preoccupation doesn't apply to Main Street or to Henry Kaufman 
and Albert Wojnilower who are capable of handling these generally 
offsetting changes in the short-term money stock."
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin is astonished by the contention that the demand for investment 
goods, housing, and autos could be stimulated by lower interest 
rates if only the government would increase taxes and cut spending 
to reduce its budget deficit. Such a restrictive swing in fiscal 
policy would lower disposable incomes and would ultimately lower 
interest rates only by depressing GNP. "There is no shortage of 
capacity in the real economy today; if there is any crowding out, it 
is due to a shortage of financial capital. The monetary targets are 
not sufficient to support a prosperous level of activity no matter 
whether it is the government or business seeking financing." Unless 
the money growth targets are relaxed, contractionary fiscal policy 
would only lower investment because this policy would lower the 
demand for business output. A business replacing the cash flow lost 
due to lower sales by increased borrowing—even at unchanged 
interest rates—suffers a financial setback, and its capital 
budget ordinarily is cut back.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin is also concerned that the Fed was misled by paying close 
attention to M-2 growth in 1981. "M-2 growth reflected the credit 
market's shift from the use of long-term financing (bonds) to short-
term financing (bank loans and commercial paper held by banks and 
money market mutual funds) which was a reaction to tight money 
itself and uncertainty about long-term yields. Long-term financing 
is not counted in M-2, but the liabilities of many institutions 
providing short-term financing are counted in M-2. In the coming 
recovery, as interest rates rise from already high levels, M-2 
growth probably will overstate 'money' growth in 1982 as the credit 
market continues this shift from long-term to short-term financing."
