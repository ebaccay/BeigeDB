     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic expansion continued during May and early June in the 
Eighth District but at a generally slower pace and with more 
exceptions to the upward course. Department store sales were 
somewhat greater than a year earlier, automobile sales were mixed, 
and housing sales decreased. Factory orders were up, but at a slower 
rate as businesses became more sensitive to possible inventory 
excesses. The general outlook is for further, moderate expansion for 
the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales at District department stores continued to rise in May and 
early June, but merchants reported a slowdown from the large year-over-year advances recorded in the January through April period. 
Merchandise at discount stores, however, continued to show large 
gains and most soft goods were in demand. Air-conditioners sold 
extremely well, reportedly because of higher incomes, memories of 
last year's hot season and the beginning of summer. Repair shops and 
other small service companies generally reported good receipts. 
Although convention business was improved, restaurants and 
entertainment businesses reported mixed results.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in the District varied among dealers in May and early 
June. Five dealers reported sales were sluggish; six dealers stated 
that sales were strong, with one noting that May sales established a 
record for the agency. Smaller cars sold better than larger models, 
and truck sales averaged about 8 percent above a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to builders and realtors, higher interest rates caused 
home sales to slow in May and early June. In addition, there were a 
few interruptions of construction by strikes which may have 
restrained sales. Must builders, however, will remain busy for 
several months filling back orders. There has been some new 
apartment building in the St. Louis area, financed by insurance 
companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rail traffic at two lines was 11 percent higher in May than in the 
same month a year ago. Most items hauled were up; however, "piggy 
back" traffic was up only slightly. One railroad reported ordering a 
new locomotive despite idle capacity because of new fuel efficient 
engines.
     </p>
     <p>
      River traffic at the Memphis port during May was about average, 
while in St. Louis a barge line was liquidated because of lack of 
business. Petroleum shipments were little changed but grain was 
slow. Several trucking companies reported that business was down in 
April and May from a record month in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Production
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New factory orders at District firms were greater in May and early 
June than they were a year ago, but they are net flowing with the 
same intensity as they were earlier in the year. There has been some 
softening in orders by auto parts stores and appliance dealers. In 
addition, a number of firms have trimmed orders with a view to 
slowing inventory accumulation. A lumber firm cut its production and 
idled 1,900 workers for a brief period to reduce inventories. 
Inventories, however, are generally considered near desired levels. 
Employment has increased moderately, and a few firms have marked up 
prices. An industrial loan collector reported fewer delinquent loans 
were being placed with the agency and a larger percentage of funds 
were being collected than in the comparable period a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since March 31, strikes over company attempts to restrain increases 
for both health benefits and cost-of-living have crippled Missouri 
lead mining production (nearly 80 percent of the nation's output). 
The strikes, however, have only had minor effects on the price of 
lead since there has been a worldwide surplus.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Because of rains, many farmers were late in getting crops planted, 
some had to replant washed out fields, a number of farmers shifted 
to soybeans from corn, and a few fields are still idle. Although 
production will be hampered by the adverse weather, total output is 
still expected to greatly exceed last year's crop which was reduced 
sharply by the PIK program and the severe drought. Since many 
farmers are reported to be in serious financial condition, 
especially those who were highly leveraged and suffered from the 
severe drought last summer and fall, this year's crops are critical 
to their survival.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial and industrial loans at 12 relatively large District 
banks rose at an 8 percent annual rate from the end of April to 
early June. Real estate loans rose moderately but consumer 
installment credit declined. Time deposits grew while demand 
deposits decreased. A few corporate treasurers have expressed 
concern about banking problems, and have lowered some balances to 
decrease exposure at any one institution.
