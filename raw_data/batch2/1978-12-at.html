      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 13, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business activity has slowed in the Southeast, with hesitation 
  generated by pessimistic attitudes and concern with high interest 
  rates. Consumer spending for apparel and new automobiles has been 
  weak; retailers will depend on heavy promotions and markdowns to 
  help clear inventories in what they expect to be an unspectacular 
  holiday season. Producers, too, are aiming at tighter control of 
  stocks. Commercial construction continues to advance, but home 
  building is waning. Many S&amp;Ls have shown reluctance in mortgage 
  lending. Demand for all types of loans remains strong; money market 
  certificates have been an important source of funds at both banks 
  and thrifts. Crop harvests have been very good, but problems linger 
  from the recently ended drought.
       </p>
       <p>
        Branch directors and their business contacts almost unanimously 
  foresee a slowdown or recession in 1979, a sharp contrast to the 
  expectations prevailing two months ago. High interest rates are now 
  the scapegoat for current and prospective economic ills, replacing 
  inflation as the most frequently mentioned problem. Recession talk 
  appears to have been a major influence on attitudes; many fear that 
  it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Still, most contacts 
  anticipate only a mild downturn, if any, and expect their areas to 
  weather it well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contacts generally characterize November retail sales as good, 
  especially of luxury and "better" goods, but nearly all noted some 
  weakness in apparel sales due to unseasonably warm weather. Reports 
  are mixed on Christmas sales thus far; expectations are that holiday 
  sales will be even to slightly ahead of last year. Heavy promotions 
  and discounts are expected to continue, evidencing retailers' fears 
  that stocks are on the high side and their pessimism for early 1979 
  prospects.
       </p>
       <p>
        New car sales are reported to be down, sharply in some areas, or 
  even with last year at best. Inventories appear to be adequate; 
  dealers blame the slowness on high prices, shrinking sizes, and 
  consumers' uncertainty about the economic outlook. Commercial sales 
  of trucks and cars for rental, however, have been strong, as are 
  sales of late-model used cars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers, influenced by prospects of slower shipments and the 
  rising cost of inventory financing, seem to have tightened their 
  rein on stocks. Although plant utilization is generally high, 
  materials shortages are minor. Complaints of slow deliveries or 
  tight supplies are less frequent than they were two months ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial and industrial construction generally remains strong, 
  with more on tap. In-migration of industry from outside the region 
  continues at a steady pace; Georgia-Pacific's relocation of 
  headquarters to Atlanta was noteworthy among last month's 
  announcements. Several areas, however, report that rising costs, 
  particularly of power and money, have resulted in some slowdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        While final demand for new homes continues fairly strong in all but 
  the highest price ranges, housing construction is suffering the 
  impact of high interest rates, tight money, and wariness of 
  prospects. Speculative building has virtually ceased in all but the 
  most active markets (south Florida); S&amp;Ls have moved to restrict 
  construction loans; lot sales are meeting resistance in some areas; 
  and planned projects are being delayed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Supplies of mortgage money appear somewhat strained. S&amp;Ls' sales of 
  money market certificates have been strong, but, overall, net 
  inflows have been weak to moderate. From throughout the District, we 
  hear reports of S&amp;Ls, both large and small, suspending or limiting 
  commitments. However, many of these are rebuilding liquidity by 
  investing in banks' large CDs, anticipating higher mortgage rates 
  (especially in states where the legislature is expected to consider 
  raising the usury ceiling next month). Some are requiring larger 
  downpayments; others are pushing up interest rates and/or points as 
  usury ceilings permit. Conventional rates range from 9 5/8 to 10 3/4 
  percent, points from 2 to 4 1/2 percent. In states where rates have 
  reached usury ceilings, there is some evidence that borrowers are 
  switching from conventional to government-insured loans. Still, 
  several directors report no problems with availability of mortgage 
  funds in their areas; in fact, many of the District's large 
  associations have been aggressively seeking new commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bank lending has accelerated in recent weeks. Except in Tennessee, 
  where national and state banks' rates are limited to one point above 
  the discount rate, most of the District's larger banks are posting 
  an 11 1/2-percent prime rate. One director noted that banks in his 
  area had become more selective and had raised interest rates in 
  their consumer installment lending. At banks as at S&amp;Ls, sales of 
  money market certificates have been heavy despite their costs and 
  there have been substantial outflows from passbook savings. ATS has 
  found few takers, and those are largely customers who normally 
  maintain high deposit balances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rains have improved pasture conditions somewhat, but pasture growth 
  is likely to be slow enough to delay feeding of stocker cattle to 
  full weight; one agricultural expert sees temperatures as the key to 
  cattle prices in the next few weeks. The recent downtrend in milk 
  production should continue, as hold-over effects of the summer 
  weather depress output per cow and high cattle prices promote 
  extensive culling of dairy herds. Florida's citrus growers are 
  disturbed by competition from Brazilian imports; year-end carryover 
  is likely to be large enough to press prices down from recent near-record levels. However, the lengthy drought has made citrus crops 
  more susceptible to freeze damage.
