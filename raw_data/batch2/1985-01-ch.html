      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 30, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The flat trend which has characterized economic activity in the 
Seventh District since last spring continues in early 1985. However, 
analysts with District firms do not anticipate a recession. Despite 
robust auto and truck sales and output, most sectors important here 
are about holding even, some at very depressed levels. There is 
little hope that the gap in the region's performance relative to the 
nation that developed in the 1980s will be ameliorated in the near 
future. Total employment has barely increased since last spring, and 
some lines, including farm, construction, and mining equipment, 
medical care, and financial institutions have cut staff and/or have 
scheduled extended layoffs. Continued gains in the value of the
dollar have defeated strenuous cost-cutting efforts of District 
producers to regain a viable position relative to foreign 
competitors. Steel output ended 1984 at a low level, and District 
steel producers anxiously await effective agreements to restrict 
imports. Sales and orders for heavy trucks and trailers have 
softened from the good level of last spring, but remain fairly high. 
Office and commercial construction prospects in the Chicago area 
remain vigorous, probably because of favorable tax treatment. 
General merchandise sales in late 1984 disappointed some large 
chains, and price cuts to move excess stocks have adversely affected 
profits. Price competition in cement, steel, paperboard, oil 
products, and airline fares is also intense. Depressed conditions in 
District agriculture are increasingly burdensome. Farmland values 
declined 5.5 percent in the region in the fourth quarter, and are 
down 27 percent from 1981 highs, with further declines probable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Jobs are hard to find in the Midwest. Through November, total 
payroll employment in the five-state area had risen less than 4 
percent (S.A.) from the recession low in December 1982, and less 
than 1 percent since last April, only half the U.S. rate. Reports of 
new layoffs, extended shutdowns, help-wanted ads, and reports of 
hiring intentions suggest no improvement since November. 
Manufacturing employment has been about unchanged since last spring, 
while growth of nonfactory jobs has been very small. Despite 
favorable press reports by university PR departments, many of last 
year's college grads, often with good records from top-rated 
schools, have failed to find suitable employment. Others hired in 
recent years are out looking again. Job freezes and efforts to cut 
surplus staff are almost universal, including state/local 
government, hospitals and medical supply producers, commodity 
dealers, and financial institutions-sectors that were hiring 
steadily in the 1970s. As a result of the collapse of the video game 
craze (with output centered in Chicago) employment in area firms has 
dropped from 7,000 to 1,400 since 1982. A recent report of 100 job 
openings at the main Chicago post office caused a mob scene of 
thousands of would-be applicants. Wage freezes and give-backs, often 
fiercely disputed, are occurring in a number of sectors, especially 
meat packing and food retailing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and farm equipment producers remain under severe 
stress, with an historic consolidation and retrenchment underway. 
Output of farm equipment in 1985 is expected to fall from very low 
levels, even if sales hold up, because inventories of a leading 
producer will be liquidated. Very weak mining activity means 
virtually no demand far equipment. Industrial markets for diesel 
engines (except trucks) remain soft. Competition from foreign 
producers, in domestic markets and abroad, remains a severe problem 
for a wide range of producers, in large part because of the high 
value of the dollar, but also because of poor sales worldwide. The 
leading construction equipment producer (with a commanding position 
worldwide a few years ago) has had three straight loss years and 
laments "our dramatic cost reduction efforts are being offset by the 
soaring dollar". Most investment is heavily oriented toward quality 
assurance and elimination of jobs. Often machines and components for 
these programs are imported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales improved in December as shortages of popular models 
eased. Further inventory building is planned in the first quarter of 
1985. Major producers expect small gains in sales in 1985 from last 
year's high level. Auto industry employment remains well below 1978 
levels, but new workers are being hired "off the street" at some 
District plants for the first time since the late 1970s, as workers 
on extended layoff have been rehired or exhausted their eligibility 
for recall. Orders for heavy trucks and trailers have slipped 
somewhat since last spring, but remain high. Heavy truck sales in 
1984 were 80 percent higher than the recession low in 1982, but well 
below the 1978-1979 pace. Deliveries in 1985 are expected to be near 
1984 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth-quarter steel output at District mills was lowest in 1984, 
and output fell more than usual at year-end as customers sought to 
cut inventories. A small rise in steel consumption is expected in 
1985. Steel for motor vehicles will remain at high levels, and bids 
on fabricated steel for office buildings continue vigorous. Orders 
from equipment manufacturers have increased only moderately. 
Questions regarding the timing and effectiveness of "voluntary" 
import restrictions overhang the 1985 outlook for domestic 
production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contracts for nonresidential building (floor area, F.W. Dodge) in 
the five states were up 33 percent in 1984 from a year earlier, but 
36 percent below 1979. The U.S. total was up only 19 percent, but 
within 13 percent of 1979. A surprising number of large office 
buildings are under construction or planned for downtown Chicago, 
and office and retail development continues vigorous in high-growth 
suburbs. Commercial construction activity may be artificially 
stimulated by the possibility that rapid depreciation for tax 
purposes will be ended. Car and truck makers plan new plants, mainly 
in Michigan and Indiana, with states and municipalities competing in 
offering costly incentives to promote local sites. Rehabilitation 
work continues at a strong pace, also encouraged by tax breaks. 
Highway improvement work is expected to rise through 1985 and into 
1986, largely depending on federal fund allotments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Permits for District residential construction slipped in the second 
half of 1984. Declines in mortgage rates since mid-1984 improve 
prospects. In 1984, housing construction permits in the five states 
were up 11 percent, but were down almost 60 percent from 1977. Used 
home sales held up well in late 1984, aided by lower mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise sales in December and early January were mixed, 
but mostly below expectations. Discounters performed best. 
Inventories are excessive despite reduced orders starting last 
summer. Aggressive markdowns have been common. The share of sales on 
credit has leveled, after rising in recent years. Delinquencies are 
up, but not "dangerous". Appliance sales were at record levels last 
year, led by a 55 percent surge in microwave ovens, half of which 
are imported.
