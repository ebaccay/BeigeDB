      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 31, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The big story from the Seventh District is the weather, severe cold 
    and unprecedented heavy snow concentrated in the Chicago area. 
    Through December and early January business activity continued 
    vigorous in the district. Businesses trying to comply with the 
    wage/price guidelines find the rules confusing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although Wisconsin and Iowa have been afflicted, the focal point for 
    bad weather has been the Chicago area with about 8 million people. 
    Major roads leading to Chicago have been impassable for varying 
    periods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Temperatures far below zero put many trains and motor vehicles out 
    of commission. Worse than the cold, Chicago has had over 60 inches 
    of snow, 50 percent more than the normal average for an entire year.
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Hare field with its heavy traffic of direct and connecting flights 
    has been closed or operating on limited schedules. Travel and 
    freight movements by road and rail also have been seriously impeded. 
    A large steel company has been particularly hard hit. Chicago's mass 
    transit system has been called a "rolling disaster" with many riders 
    taking hours to reach their destinations or failing to arrive at 
    all. A major trucking firm reports that freight movements to and 
    from Chicago have been cut in half in the past two weeks. 
    Absenteeism has ranged up to 50 percent on some days at some firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Chicago area produces a wide variety of services, finished 
    goods, and components. Also, components move through Chicago on 
    their way to their destinations. These components are vital to other 
    regions. The area has only one auto assembly plant, for example, but 
    it makes many stampings and other components used elsewhere. We have 
    heard reports that output in other regions has already been affected 
    by reduced shipments from Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail stores, especially in the Loop, say business is down sharply. 
    However, there has been a run on four-wheel drive vehicles, snow 
    tires, batteries and other accessories. Attendance at sports events 
    and trade fairs has been poor. Schools have been closed or have 
    delayed reopenings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many roofs have collapsed, mainly lumber yards, stables, and retail 
    stores—some of modern construction. Water damage in residential 
    structures has been severe. Insurance companies have been swamped 
    with claims. Many lawsuits doubtless will be filed. A booming 
    business has developed in roof clearing and emergency repairs. No 
    doubt the Chicago area will snap back rapidly once weather improves, 
    and many will profit from the troubles of others. However, incomes 
    of many individuals and firms will have been reduced while 
    inflationary pressures will have received added impetus.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from purchasing managers, trade associations, and business 
    executives indicate that output, employment, and new orders 
    continued to rise through December and into early January. Order 
    backlogs suggest the expansion will continue at least through mid-
    year. Producers of railroad equipment and machine tools believe they 
    will be operating at capacity for a year or more. Heavy trucks, 
    construction equipment, and related components are backordered. 
    Demand for autos and trucks remains vigorous, but output of less 
    popular models has been cut back to reduce excess stocks. 
    Inventories of most goods are moderate, and inadequate in some cases 
    where cautious schedules of output have been followed. High carrying 
    costs at present interest rate levels are often cited as a reason 
    for keeping stocks lean.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel shipments from U.S. mills and abroad have been exceeding 
    expectations. A large share of the imports are required to meet 
    demand because domestic capacity is inadequate. One steel company is 
    booking orders for April and May. Auto companies are ordering steel 
    in line with announced production schedules. Nonresidential 
    construction activity is certain to rise this year, with large 
    office buildings and auto factory buildings leading. Builders and 
    lenders expect a decline in housing starts ranging from 10 to 25 
    percent. Shortages of building materials, especially cement, are 
    expected to continue to hamper activity throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many non-union employers, including banks, say they are following 
    the seven percent guideline on wage increases. Some say they will 
    review the matter at mid-year and grant further increases if the 
    guideline is relaxed. Union bargaining is another story. A union 
    leader says "it will be a turbulent year".
     </p>
     <p>
      Increases in construction worker wages may be held to seven percent 
    but there will be great pressure for more generous fringes, 
    especially pensions and welfare. Construction bargaining deadlines 
    are likely to be delayed as long as possible to see what's happening 
    elsewhere. A trucking executive says flatly that the Teamsters will 
    not settle for seven percent, but may get nine percent or more. Most 
    unions are able to find some "tandem" relationship with another 
    group that obtained a favorable settlement recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      The guidelines for prices are even more confusing. Determining 
    average prices and profit margins for large, complex corporations 
    leaves much room for judgment. Accounting firms are pushing programs 
    which they believe will help clients comply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most, but not all, professional forecasts for the general economy 
    call for a moderate recession to begin in the third or fourth 
    quarters. However, the typical executive expects his own business to 
    avoid a slump. Conflicting views between forecasts of economists and 
    executives have been noted in the past with no clear pattern as to 
    which group was more accurate.
