      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      With the agricultural sector a notable exception, the economic 
outlook in the Seventh District appears to be generally healthy. 
Retail sales are reported to be vigorous in virtually all 
categories. Capital outlays are still increasing, and perhaps at a 
somewhat faster pace, but the picture varies greatly by product. 
Except for continued stringency in residential building materials, 
supplies of goods are ample. Agricultural credit conditions have 
deteriorated significantly in recent months. Demand for credit is 
generally strong except for large business loans. Interest rates 
have strengthened moderately.
      <p>
       Concern expressed in the third quarter that the expansion might be 
  at or near a peak has largely dissipated. Most executives and 
  analysts share the opinion that activity will continue to grow, at 
  least through the first half of 1978. Ready availability of 
  virtually all purchased materials is encouraging business firms to 
  closely control, even reduce, inventories. However, holdings of fuel 
  oil and propane are very large, and will be maintained at high 
  levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major retailers report sales to be at good levels, and they plan on 
  a strong Christmas season. Hard goods continue to lead, while 
  fashion-type apparel is relatively weak. Home improvement items, 
  automobile supplies, refrigerators, electric ranges, microwave ovens 
  (many from Japan), dryers, and disposers are doing especially well. 
  Installment credit is being used freely, indicating consumer 
  confidence, and delinquency experience is excellent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The slowdown in auto deliveries in September partly reflected the 
  delayed availability of some new models. These were introduced in 
  early October, and apparently were well received. The strength of 
  the auto market varies greatly by model. Periodic shutdowns of 
  various district plants have been required to control stocks of less 
  popular cars, while other models are in short supply. Inventories of 
  popular imports are down sharply, which may be holding back sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       The uptrend in sales of heavy trucks and trailers leveled in 
  September and October. Opinions differ as to whether this lull is 
  only temporary. Sales of light trucks, many to consumers, continue 
  strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The auto industry, at least the two largest producers, are in the 
  midst of massive programs to downsize cars. Orders from the auto 
  companies are largely responsible for strength reported in machine 
  tool orders, especially presses and transfer machines. Originally 
  concentrated in equipment, auto industry capital spending programs 
  now include a substantial commitment to new structures and 
  expansions of existing buildings to be ready in 1978, 1979, or 
  later. There are fears that the third and fourth ranking auto 
  producers cannot finance the capital outlays required to produce the 
  mix of cars that will meet federal rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most producers of capital equipment report orders to be "good but 
  unspectacular." Our impression is that the general picture is 
  somewhat better than a few months ago. Among the strongest types are 
  machine tools, construction equipment, freight cars, well-drilling 
  apparatus, fluid power, and electric motors. Farm equipment and 
  heavy mining equipment are very weak. Orders for mining equipment 
  and replacement parts have been hurt by the iron miners' strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many homebuilders complain that shortages of insulation have delayed 
  completions by a month or more. Some have been unable to provide the 
  extra heavy insulation they had promised home buyers. Housing 
  analysts expect that starts in 1978 will be about the same as this 
  year with apartments somewhat higher and one-family units somewhat 
  lower. Aside from insulation, there are complaints of shortages, or 
  poor quality, covering a long list of components. Substitutions 
  often have been necessary. There is a general shortage of really 
  skilled building trades workers, with consequent reports of "shoddy" construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real estate transfers continue at a high level, about 30 percent 
  above last year. A wave of condominium conversions of rental units 
  in buildings large and small, new and old, is in progress with a 
  substantial volume of funds required to finance purchases by (often 
  reluctant) renters. Meanwhile, rents are gradually rising to a point 
  that is encouraging promoters of new apartment buildings. Mortgages 
  funds continue to be generally available, but some S&amp;Ls; have raised 
  their basic rate from 8.75 to 9 percent. Usury ceilings are no 
  longer a threat in Illinois because a flexible formula is used now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonresidential construction activity is improving. Office buildings 
  lead the uptrend, but industrial building also is picking up. 
  Virtually all new plants or plant expansions are located in outlying 
  areas or smaller towns. Outlays to build or repair highways and 
  highway structures, and to build sewer and water systems, are rather 
  strong, but the rest of the public sector, especially school 
  buildings, is weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our latest quarterly survey shows a decline in farmland values for 
  the first time since 1960. In the past five years these values had 
  increased by 160 percent. The overall decline for the district for 
  the third quarter was 1 percent, but reports by states range from an 
  8 percent decline for Illinois to a 4 percent rise for Wisconsin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Farm credit conditions have deteriorated markedly in recent months 
  with rapid loan growth, slower loan repayments, increased loan 
  renewals, and reduced bank liquidity. Almost half of the rural banks 
  view their loan-deposit ratios (now averaging 64 percent) as "excessive." This is about double the normal proportion expressing 
  this view.
