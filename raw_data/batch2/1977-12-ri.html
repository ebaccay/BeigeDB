      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 14, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Advances in Fifth District manufacturing activity continued spotty 
in November. Responses to our survey of manufacturers were nearly 
evenly divided between gains and losses in shipments, new orders, 
and backlogs of orders. This essentially sideways movement 
apparently prevailed for most individual industries as well as for 
the entire sample. Initial indications are that the retail sector is 
experiencing a strong Christmas selling season. The UMW strike, 
should it persist, looms as a major factor in Fifth District 
economic performance. Coal mining is virtually shut down in the 
District, even in such non-union areas as Maryland. In addition to 
the coal industry, the effects are already being felt by District 
railroads, where layoffs began before the strike. Fifth District 
bank credit expansion continues strong, with robust business lending 
compensating for weaker expansion in consumer and real estate loans. 
Despite problems in the coal industry and the lackluster results of 
our latest survey of manufacturers, business psychology in the 
District appears to have improved substantially in recent weeks.
      <p>
       In the manufacturing sector the overall level of activity appears 
  little changed over the past month. Shipments, new orders, and 
  backlogs of orders were higher in some firms, lower in others. This 
  pattern was apparent within individual industries as well as across 
  the manufacturing group as a whole. Inventories of finished goods 
  are somewhat higher than a month ago while stocks of materials are 
  essentially unchanged. Approximately one-third of our respondents 
  now view current inventory levels as excessive. The diffusion of 
  manufacturers' responses suggests a decline in employment as well as 
  a reduction in weekly hours worked. Employee compensation and other 
  prices paid by manufacturers rose widely in November while prices 
  received were stable. Current plant and equipment capacity remains 
  in excess of desired levels and there appears to be little sentiment 
  for enlarging current expansion plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among District retailers the situation has brightened significantly 
  in the past month. All respondents indicated a pick up in sales and 
  in relative sales of big ticket items from a month ago. Inventories, 
  employment, and prices all rose over the month for these retailers. 
  Christmas related sales are apparently running ahead of last year's 
  heady pace. Sales are also substantial in a broad market for items 
  to keep warm and to conserve energy, including such varied items as 
  warm clothing, fireplace equipment and chain saws. Expectations of 
  retailers are more buoyant than at any time in recent months, with 
  respondents unanimous in expecting further improvement nationally, 
  locally, and in their firms over the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Optimism among our manufacturing respondents also appears to have 
  increased significantly after lagging for two months. A third of 
  these respondents now expect the level of activity nationally and in 
  their respective firms to improve over the next six months. Also, at 
  their latest meeting, both head office and branch directors of this 
  Bank expressed more bullishness about business in general than at 
  any time since early in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UMW strike represents the largest uncertainty in the Fifth 
  District. From preliminary figures, it appears that the strike is 
  directly affecting approximately 80,000 miners in the District. This 
  figure includes non-union miners in Maryland but not in Virginia. A 
  non-union walkout in Virginia could add 10,000 to the figure. In 
  addition, more than 1500 railroad workers have been laid off as a 
  direct result of the strike, and this figure could run as high as 
  3500-4000 by mid-December. Beyond these effects, the impact on other 
  activity in the District will depend on the duration of the strike. 
  Most manufacturers and utilities have stockpiled up to 90-day 
  supplies of coal. The most optimistic estimates of the length of the 
  strike are in the 2-3 week range. Other estimates run as high as 
  three or four months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business credit at large District Banks expanded at an annual rate 
  of 20 percent in the last month. Some of this expansion, estimated 
  at 15-20 percent of the totals is attributable to the dock strike, 
  as exporters have sought credit to finance unexpected inventories. 
  The greatest part, however, appears to be accounted for by middle-sized corporations representing a broad spectrum of activities. 
  Consumer credit is recovering from an early fourth quarter lull, 
  with some reports of special strength in the bank card area. 
  Although real estate lending has shown some recent weakening, 
  bankers feel that it will be strong in future months. The demand for 
  single family mortgage loans is seen as a primary source of 
  strength, with apartment lending increasing too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marketings of the 1977 crop of flue-cured tobacco were characterized 
  by smaller volume and lower quality tobacco, particularly the leaf 
  usually bought by exporters. The shortage of export grades resulted 
  in record prices for the better grades usually purchased for export, 
  bringing the season average to a record high $1.18 per pound, some 7 
  percent above the 1976 figure. Total value of sales was down $133.8 
  million or 10 percent below a year ago, however. The nation's 
  farmers apparently face another year of relatively low prices and 
  incomes in 1978. Consumers, however, seem assured of abundant 
  supplies of food at prices only moderately higherâ€”4 to 6-percentâ€”than in 1977. The November crop report revealed further declines in 
  the District cotton crop but slight gains in the tobacco, soybean, 
  and peanut crops. The District farmers are joining in nationwide 
  demonstrations against the cost-price-income squeeze in agriculture.
