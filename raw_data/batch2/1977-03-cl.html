      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic activity in the Fourth District is rebounding rapidly from 
    effects of the severe winter and fuel shortages that sharply 
    curtailed production, employment, construction and retail sales in 
    January and early February. Layoffs in manufacturing are now a 
    negligible portion of total manufacturing employment because 
    alternate fuel sources and some easing in natural gas curtailments 
    have improved energy supplies. Most financial officers and 
    economists who were consulted expect that losses in output and sales 
    will be recouped in the second and third quarters, providing extra 
    thrust to real GNP. Inventories are likely to spurt during the next 
    few months. Concern over inflation has intensified, as various 
    sources expect high costs of substitute fuels, coupled with expected 
    large increases in food and medical costs, to boost the rate of 
    inflation in 1977. Business loan demand is still relatively soft for 
    this stage of an expansion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although relaxed somewhat above plant protection levels, natural gas 
    curtailments continue to cause layoffs in manufacturing. Firms 
    without alternate or sufficient fuel supplies have not fully 
    regained in output and employment levels. This is especially the 
    case of small businesses, ranging from refactories to greenhouses. 
    As of late February, an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 manufacturing 
    workers, about 1.0 percent of total manufacturing employment in the 
    District, were laid off because of natural gas shortages, a vast 
    improvement over the estimated 110,000 workers laid off early in the 
    month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Industries hardest hit by fuel shortages, including steel, 
    automotive, appliances and glass, are rebounding rapidly and, with 
    few exceptions, expect losses in output to be recouped over the next 
    few months. Economists with three major steel companies indicate 
    that steel output has recovered to early January levels and losses 
    in output in the last two months will be made up in March and April. 
    Two economists expect first quarter steel shipments to increase by 
    about 5 percent from last quarter, although the improvement will not 
    be reflected in earnings because of high costs of alternate fuels. 
    All report that orders have increased sharply in recent weeks, which 
    should boost shipments and output next quarter. Most order pick up 
    can be attributed to a bottoming-out of customer inventories rather 
    than to higher steel consumption. Flat rolled products are expected 
    to be in strong demand at least through midyear. The economists also 
    expect that next winter's steel output will not be affected by fuel 
    shortages because dependence on natural gas is being reduced to 
    minimum levels. A major aluminum producer reports output has not 
    completely recovered from for January-February shutdowns, and that 
    inventories were drawn down sharply during that period.
       </p>
       <p>
        A major household appliance manufacturer has restored production to 
    capacity levels following a shutdown caused by natural gas 
    shortages. Inventories which were drawn down are expected to be 
    rebuilt to desired levels by late April.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto producers expect to make up most production losses during this 
    model year. One producer does not anticipate losses for this model 
    year because plants will be on overtime schedules, while another 
    expects losses of less than 10,000 units because plants producing 
    large cars have been operating at capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Major glass producers in the District have recovered fully from the 
    drop in output because of natural gas shortages. One of the largest 
    flat glass producers that had laid off half of its work force for 
    several days has recalled all workers and recouped production 
    losses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers and producers of consumer goods experienced a drop in 
    sales during the most severe winter months but generally expect a 
    revival in consumer spending. One major national retailer 
    headquartered in the District commented that retail sales 
    strengthened sharply in recent weeks and recovered all sales losses 
    of late January and early February. Current forecasts of gains in 
    total retail sales for 1977, about 10 1/2 percent higher than in 
    1976, remain virtually unchanged from those of late last year. 
    However, the retailers now expect larger gains in food sales and 
    smaller gains in department store items and auto sales. Automotive 
    producers apparently have not adjusted sales forecasts downward 
    because of possible effects of fuel prices on durable goods 
    spending. One economist does not believe higher fuel bills will have 
    much adverse affect on consumer expenditures for automobiles, and, 
    therefore, is holding to his forecast of 11.2 million new car sales 
    for 1977. Another expects consumers to reduce their saving rate 
    instead of cutting back new car purchases. A retailer with a major 
    national food chain reported consumer response to higher prices has 
    been to buy down rather than cut back spending. Moreover, he noted 
    that higher coffee prices led initially to stockpiling by customers, 
    who since have not shifted to coffee substitutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty financial officers who met at this Bank on March 4 viewed the 
    sluggish recovery in capital spending as stemming largely from 
    inadequate profits and cash flow and uncertainty over the rate of 
    return on investment. They acknowledged that the high cost of 
    capital may also be a deterrent but asserted that inflation and 
    environmental regulations have heightened business risk. They view 
    tax relief as a necessary stimulant to investment, but see little 
    long-term benefit from changes in accounting rules even though these 
    changes may tend to increase cash flows.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many economists and producers expressed concern that the rate of 
    inflation in 1977 has intensified, as suggested by strong upward 
    price pressures in metals, fuel, food, and medical costs. Steel 
    sources reported a price hike for tin mill steel products effective 
    this month and noted that alternate fuels and modes of 
    transportation sharply boosted costs this quarter. Retailers expect 
    consumer prices to accelerate this year, especially for apparel and 
    food. One source indicated that forecasts for retail food prices in 
    1977 were increased from 6.5 to 7.7 percent because of the drought 
    in the West. Another retailer does not expect leveling off of rising 
    prices for fresh fruit and vegetables until the California harvest 
    is marketed. Current moderation in beef prices should be followed by 
    higher prices later in the year. Health care costs are expected to 
    jump 15 to 18 percent this year, according to an executive with a 
    major health insurance agency in the District. Increased cost and 
    usage of medical services account for the expected acceleration in 
    health care charges this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business loan demand in the District remains soft and generally 
    below expectations of some of the Districts major banks. Several 
    bank officers expect only gradual pick up in loan demand until 
    recovery in capital goods strengthens. Consequently, most of these 
    banks have been actively soliciting business loans. An executive 
    with one of the largest banks explained his firm's relatively sharp 
    growth in both take downs and unused commitments is in response to 
    the bank's program to refinance cap loans that will begin to run off 
    early in 1978. Customers with the highest credit ratings are offered 
    5- to 7-year loans at rates somewhat above those of insurance 
    companies, which have stepped up solicitation in term loans over the 
    past year.
