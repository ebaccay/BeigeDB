      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 13, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District have generally revised 
their forecasts of real GNP upward for 1981 in response to first 
quarter strength, but still expect slow growth over the remainder of 
the year. Inflation may continue to moderate over the year, but the 
underlying rate is unlikely to change much. Capital goods producers 
still report a mixture of strengths and weaknesses. The steel 
industry continues to operate at a high level, but recent softening 
in orders suggests a typical summer slump ahead. Consumer spending 
in the first quarter was buoyed by auto rebates, and some economists 
expect a decline in the second quarter. The housing industry remains 
at a standstill, despite scattered reports of increased lending 
activity. Bankers expect continued strength in loans, accompanied by 
still higher interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several participants from the Fourth District Roundtable, 
held last March, have raised their fourth quarter 1980 to fourth 
quarter 1981 forecast of real GNP from about a 2% gain to about 3% 
as a result of a stronger-than- expected first quarter. A 
participant, who had expected a negative second quarter, now doubts 
that real GNP will show much change at all. A bank economist is now 
more optimistic than early last spring, because he believes that 
relatively rapid growth in the first quarter reflected earlier 
momentum in the economy and that auto and housing are still in 
serious trouble. Rising interest rates should not be a deterrent to 
economic activity, according to a bank economist, unless record 
interest rates are reached. Overall manufacturing activity, as 
measured by the Fourth District's Survey of Manufacturing, is 
expected to continue to expand into the second quarter, based on 
strength in new orders, shipments and employment. However, a loss of 
momentum is also suggested by the reduction in the number of firms 
expecting increases in each of these indexes, except shipments, 
during April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Moderation in the first quarter GNP implicit price deflator 
has not altered inflation expectations. Decelerating prices, 
anticipated by several Roundtable economists, have been enhanced by 
rebate programs in the auto industry and declining demand for 
gasoline. While most items except energy increased at a reduced rate 
in the first quarter of 1981, the underlying inflation rate remains 
about 9%-10%, according to an auto economist. A producer of consumer 
nondurables expects meat prices to increase during the summer, 
following the stepped-up slaughtering of cattle in recent weeks. 
Food prices in general may be helped by expected good weather, but 
rising costs could lead to upward pressures on prices by year-end. A 
trade economist expects inflation to move below double-digit rates 
by the end of the year, but he also expects slower progress over the 
longer term because of the insensitivity of wage costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production of producer durable goods continues to 
strengthen, but rising interest rates and a softening economy are 
likely to curtail capital spending this year. A producer of metal-
cutting machines reports that orders are strong, but a producer of 
consumer-related electronic equipment reports that orders are 
softening. A manufacturer of automatic controls reports strong sales 
and has expanded his production facilities. However, area 
construction activity so far this year is at best 10% below 
depressed levels last year, according to a materials supplier, 
partly as a result of state and local government cutbacks in 
building and road maintenance. Heavy-duty truck sales have been set 
back by rising interest rates, and the market now needs a strong 
economic recovery over the rest of the year to exceed 1980 levels, 
according to a major parts supplier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Second quarter steel shipments should be stronger than the 
first, but several steel economists report a definite slowing in new 
orders in recent weeks. The industry's relative strength continues 
to be associated with inventory building, with little gain in steel 
consumption, according to an industry economist. Also, a shift from 
imports to domestic steel has resulted from higher second quarter 
trigger prices. Therefore, steel production is currently moving 
toward full capacity, according to one industry economist. However, 
the third quarter should experience the usual summer slump in orders 
and shipments, because of a slow-growth economy which stalls steel 
usage, a sharp drop in auto sales, and a reversal of the favorable
import trend as the value of the dollar continues to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending, aided by auto rebates, was 
greater-than-expected in the first quarter, according to an 
economist for a national department store chain. Real spending 
should decline in the second quarter, but with a tax cut, spending 
should recover by the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total auto sales dropped to an 8.1 million rate in April, 
according to an industry economist. Area sales in April and early 
May have lagged national sales. A local auto dealer reports that 
auto sales are off over 50% from a poor level a year-ago, and 75% 
from 1979 levels. Area sales should benefit from the introduction of 
"J" cars, but an area dealer questions whether production will be 
high enough to make a significant difference in overall sales. An 
import dealer reports a 5% increase in area sales from year- ago 
levels. Waiting lists for imported cars may reappear because of the 
new import quotas, but one import dealer is skeptical that consumers 
will switch to domestic cars. The import dealer doubts that the 7% 
reduction in the volume of car imports is enough to benefit the 
ailing domestic industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area loan commitments for single-family housing in March 
showed less than nominal seasonal gains, according to area S&amp;L 
officials. Recent increases in mortgage rates, now averaging about 
16% for an 80% loan, and a substantial outflow of funds from S&amp;Ls 
have slowed activity further in recent weeks. However, one S&amp;L 
official reports success in lending to area builders with borrowed 
funds. Also, second mortgages are now being offered to existing 
customers at a variable rate, starting 25 basis points below the 
market rate of 18%. However, another S&amp;L spokesman states that 
available funds are being arbitraged into higher yield short-term 
assets. Hopes for a turnaround soon are fading in the housing 
industry, according to an economist with a regional FHLB, because 
mortgage rates are not expected to fall below 13% by year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand should remain firm at least through the second 
quarter because of substitution of bank loans for new bond issues 
and because some narrowing of the yield spread between commercial 
paper and the prime rate has made bank credit more competitive. 
First quarter weakness in loans may have been partly associated with 
overborrowing late in 1980, when fears of a credit crunch developed, 
according to a bank official. With those inventories depleted, 
businesses are now back in the market. A bank economist expects 
interest rates to rise further in the weeks ahead, before falling 
back by late spring or early summer.
