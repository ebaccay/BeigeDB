      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic intelligence available in the Seventh District suggests 
  that the general business expansion will not be halted in the near 
  future either by higher interest rates or accelerating inflation. 
  The President's inflation program outlined October 24. is viewed by 
  most observers as being of minor significance. Some analysts are 
  predicting a recession to start about mid-1979. Demand for capital 
  goods remains strong. Inventories are generally in good shape. Job 
  markets remain vigorous. Retail sales seem to be holding at a high 
  level overall, but results vary by establishment and product. 
  Mortgage credit has tightened further. Housing permits and 
  transactions have declined in major centers. Farmers are prosperous 
  and farmland values have increased further.
       </p>
       <p>
        Economic forecasts for 1979 vary substantially. Some predict a 
  continuing rise through the year, while others insist that a 
  recession is "inevitable," probably starting around midyear. Some 
  seek refuge in seeing a "50-50 chance" of a recession.
       </p>
       <p>
        Comment on the President's inflation program has been surprisingly 
  sparse. Executives willing to express themselves in public are 
  laudatory for the most part. They promise "full cooperation," and 
  say "Our company will follow the guidelines to the letter." These 
  views probably reflect the belief that the rules are flexible and 
  will not weigh heavily in decision making. Comments by economists 
  and financial analysts are often more critical with some suggesting 
  that the program, to the extent it is effective, will do more harm 
  than good. Many observers fear that the rules are really mandatory, 
  and will be followed by stricter formulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Executives in business and finance complain with some heat of the 
  rapid growth of controls, despite assurances to the contrary, and 
  the manner of their administration. The anti-inflation program is 
  expected to result in added paperwork and loss of tine spent in "educating" federal monitors. The energy bill is judged to be 
  difficult to administer without significantly affecting the supply 
  and demand for energy either for better or worse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most producers of capital goods continue to report rising shipments, 
  new orders, and backlogs. Various diversified producers report 
  orders up 20 to 50 percent in September and October, greater gains 
  than were achieved earlier in the year. Demand for farm and 
  construction equipment has continued very strong and above 
  expectations. Orders for castings, forgings, and types of steel used 
  by equipment producers indicate further increases in output of 
  producer goods.
       </p>
       <p>
        Output of heavy trucks is at record levels, and the largest producer 
  is "supplier limited." Demand for freight cars far exceeds capacity, 
  and some believe no letup will occur in 1979. U. S. plants could 
  produce 95,000 freight cars per year a decade ago, but only 65,000 
  now. Castings of various types are in great demand, and constitute a 
  major bottleneck. Some producers of castings have activated 
  expansion plans, a step that would not have been seriously 
  considered until recently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some analysts believe that orders for both heavy trucks and freight 
  cars are artificially high and that a reckoning lies ahead. Some 
  believe this is true of capital goods generally. Nevertheless, 
  various companies assert that they are controlling their backlogs 
  carefully to keep out "water." Some do not include orders with 
  cancellation clauses; some require stiff penalties in case of 
  cancellations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inventories are not excessive and probably will not become so unless 
  sales drop sharply. Companies insist they are watching the situation 
  carefully. Inventories of farm and construction equipment are judged 
  to be low. Petroleum products inventories are somewhat low, 
  especially gasoline. Leaders of a strike of steel haulers that began 
  last weekend (apparently to sever connections with the Teamsters) 
  believe they will win because user inventories are tight. Even a 
  large retailer whose sales have been running slightly below year 
  ago, in contrast to the industry, says inventories are in line 
  because orders to suppliers had been reduced promptly. Also 
  supporting the view that inventories are lean is the recent 
  stretchout of delivery times. The October report of Milwaukee 
  purchasing managers (a preeminent capital goods town) shows 49 
  percent with longer lead times, compared with 18 percent a year ago. 
  There has also been a significant rise in the proportion of these 
  managers reporting poorer dependability on deliveries and lower 
  quality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite reduced sales reported by a large chain, total sales of 
  general merchandise have been running 12-13 percent above year ago. 
  Appliance sales have leveled off at about the year-ago level. TV 
  sales have slowed recently. Consumers are spending more on 
  nondurables, gasoline, and air travel. Credit use has remained 
  strong with no rise in delinquencies. Sales of light trucks to 
  consumers have been limited by capacity, especially four-wheel drive 
  models. At least one major auto producer has shifted its production 
  of cars away from larger models with larger engines to help meet 
  mileage standards, regardless of consumer desires.
       </p>
       <p>
        Home mortgage rates moved up to 10 percent and more in various areas 
  in the past month. The impact of tighter credit is increasingly 
  evident. Permits were down 21 percent in the Chicago area in 
  September and 8 percent for 9 months. In the Milwaukee area permits 
  were off 42 percent in September and 23 percent for 9 months. 
  Transactions are also down.
