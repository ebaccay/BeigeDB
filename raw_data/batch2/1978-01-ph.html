      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Indications from the Third District are that economic activity 
  continues to expand unevenly. Respondents to the January Business 
  Outlook Survey say that manufacturing activity is essentially 
  unchanged for the third straight month, but retail sales are up for 
  the fourth month in a row according to executives in that sector. 
  Looking to the future, both manufacturers and retailers are 
  anticipating expansion. Area bankers say that business borrowing is 
  up, but still generally sluggish. They too look for expansion over 
  the next six months. The nationwide coal strike is having little 
  effect on the District economy at this time, but shortages could 
  develop if miners stay off the job through February.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers responding to this month's Business Outlook Survey say 
  that general business conditions are only marginally better than 
  last month, indicating that the slowdown that started in November is 
  now in its third month. In terms of specific indicators, employment 
  and the average workweek are unchanged, continuing a three-month 
  trend. New orders and shipments are higher in January, but 
  inventories are down for the first time since early last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The continued sluggishness appears to be having an effect on 
  manufacturers' expectations regarding the next six months. While 
  producers are still bullish overall, fewer are looking for 
  improvement in the first half of 1978 than in previous months. New 
  orders and shipments are expected to pick up, but again by a smaller 
  proportion of respondents than in the recent past. At the same time, 
  inventories are projected to remain at their current levels. Despite 
  this dampened optimism, however, manufacturers still anticipate some 
  gains in employment over the next six months. Thirty percent of the 
  respondents say they plan to add to their payrolls by July, and 21 
  percent anticipate a longer workweek by that time. Capital spending 
  plans have not been diminished either. Increases in expenditures on 
  plant and equipment are planned at slightly more than one-third of 
  the sampled firms—about the same as last month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Comments by a director of this Bank are consistent with these 
  reported expectations. He sees the outlook for 1978 as only 
  moderate, and claims that capacity utilization in his particular 
  industry won't approach the levels necessary to induce investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Price increases in the industrial sector appear to be picking up 
  steam. Over half of the executives surveyed this month report higher 
  prices for inputs, and about one-fourth say they're getting more for 
  the goods they sell. As for the future, three-fourths of those 
  polled anticipate paying more for raw materials by July, while about 
  half expect to hike the prices of their finished products.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nationwide coal strike is having little impact on the Third 
  District economy. Although about 18 percent of all bituminous coal 
  miners in the U.S. are employed in Pennsylvania, only about 4 
  percent work in the Third District. Moreover, utilities and steel 
  producers, the major users of coal, have stockpiled the fuel so that 
  no shortages have as yet developed. According to a director of this 
  Bank representing the energy industry though, with the strike now in 
  its sixth week, about half of those inventories have been depleted. 
  Should the strike last longer than 45 more days, supply may become a 
  problem as holders of inventories try to spread a limited stock over 
  a longer time. Coal officials contacted had no opinion on the 
  expected duration of the work stoppage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sales at area department stores are higher again in January 
  according to retailing executives. Current dollar sales, reported to 
  be between 8 and 21 percent above January '77 levels, are outpacing 
  expectations by about 5 percentage points in most cases. Downtown 
  Philadelphia and suburban stores are doing equally well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Merchants appear to be optimistic about economic conditions over the 
  next six months, and look for sales increases of 5 to 12 percent 
  over year-earlier levels. Consequently, most retailers say that 
  inventories are up, but that these higher levels are consistent with 
  the expected higher sales volume.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial bankers in the area say that business loan demand is 
  about 4 percent higher than it was at this time last year. This is 
  generally at or below planned levels. Bankers note that although 
  borrowing by local businesses is "as expected," the national market 
  continues to be depressed. They continue to cite alternative sources 
  of funds and uncertainty about future economic developments as the 
  major causes of sluggish loan demand. The demand for the consumer 
  loans remains strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the longer term, bankers foresee "moderate" growth in C&amp;I; loans. 
  They expect July loan volume to be 7 to 9 percent above the mid-1977 
  level.
       </p>
       <p>
        The prime rate at every bank contacted is at 7 3/4 or 8 percent. It 
  is generally expected to increase to about 8 1/4 percent by mid-year. Contacts say they have noticed some disintermediation owing to 
  higher short-term rates, but that it is not now a problem. One 
  banker noted that when interest rates started to rise, some 
  depositors shifted to higher-rate, longer-term certificates and are 
  now locked into those deposits, and claims that this is one factor 
  that has helped to keep disintermediation to a minimum.
