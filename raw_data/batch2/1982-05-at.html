      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Sixth District are somewhat mixed at this 
time. Limited signs of recovery are evident in tourism and 
construction, but other sectors remain depressed and firms are 
hesitant to expand employment and inventories. Heavy industries are 
more depressed than in years, and industry spokespersons are not 
optimistic about any near-term upturn. Higher prices for calves and 
hogs have improved cash flow for farmers, but a high level of debt 
remains difficult to carry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on retail sales in the District are 
mixed. Big-ticket appliance sales are up noticeably in Miami and New 
Orleans, and home entertainment products are showing widespread 
strength in the District. There are reports that Easter buying of 
clothing was lower than last year, and wholesale buyers say 
consumers are very quality- and bargain-conscious. Traffic in 
furniture stores remains slow and the floor-covering business is 
poor. Retailers continue to keep a tight rein on inventories, and 
wholesale clothes buyers are even delaying purchases for the fall 
season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales remain poor. Domestic car sales in most of the District 
are below year-ago levels but are stronger than foreign car sales. 
High interest rates still limit sales and squeeze profit margins, 
but dealers are hanging on. Dealer closings do not appear to be 
accelerating.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The behavior of loan demand is generally 
consistent with geographic differences in the severity of the 
recession. Bankers in the more depressed areas of the District told 
of weak demand for both consumer and business lending. By contrast, 
lenders in Georgia and Florida, where unemployment rates are well 
below the national rate, spoke of strong loan demand. A few bankers 
expressed concern that strong lending may be an indication of poor 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction is showing some sign of improvement. 
Permits issued to build single-family houses are up in April and 
early May in many areas of the District. Permits are being issued to 
home purchasers with cash in hand, ready to build. Realtors report a 
slight pickup in sales. Atlanta's "mini-boom" in sales is being 
supported by relocation of employees of Georgia-Pacific. Throughout 
the District, homes have been moved primarily with innovative 
financing; conventional rates are reported still too high for home 
buyers. Realtors feel the worst of the recession is over but remain 
cautious. Homebuilders remain very pessimistic, since sales are 
almost entirely existing homes and new home inventories remain high. 
Throughout the District, vacancy rates for both residential and 
commercial dwellings have increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates continued to drift 
upward in the District in March as employment contracted and the 
labor force continued to expand. The six-state average jobless rate 
reached 9.9 percent in March, 0.7 percent higher than the February 
rate and 0.8 percent higher than the national rate in March. Except 
for services and paper, job declines are still prevalent in many 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alabama has been particularly hard hit, with an unemployment rate of 
13.6 percent. The situation there may deteriorate even more as U. S. 
Steel Corporation is considering a temporary shutdown of its 
operations near Birmingham because of declining orders and 
competition from imported steel. The plant, Birmingham's largest, 
has 3,200 people currently at work with close to 7,000 of its May 
1980 work force on layoff. The state's important textile and forest 
product firms have hundreds of workers on layoff due to the weakness 
in construction and auto sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Layoffs have surfaced even in industries thought to be insulated 
from the recession. In Louisiana, orders for oil-field structures 
and drilling rigs, in particular, have taken a nose dive, prompting 
layoffs in the oil rig and equipment fabricating business. Phosphate 
mining has slowed noticeably in central Florida. Recent closing of a 
phosphate-based fertilizer plant in Savannah, Georgia, is indicative 
of weakness in the farming area. The region's largest manufacturer 
of satellite and telecommunications equipment has laid off workers 
for the first time in years. For Florida, a bright spot continues to 
be foreign trade. A new record was set in 1981 as the actual value 
of goods exported increased $1 billion over the previous year. South 
Florida has contributed heavily to these exports.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tourism industry appears to be reviving in Florida, following 
what was characterized as a ho-hum start to the season. Low 
hotel/motel occupancy rates for the month of February were reversed 
during March and April. Lower gasoline prices and discount air fares 
have stimulated travel to the state. Traffic counts are up and 
reports of heavy summer bookings at lodging places suggest a healthy 
summer for tourism. Attendance at the World's Fair in Knoxville, 
Tennessee, has not kept pace with projections in spite of heavy 
promotion. Officials predict a surge of visitors when school is out. 
The fair is scheduled to run for six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rising prices of calves and hogs have somewhat 
brightened the agricultural picture in the Southeast; however, crop 
prices are not yet offering much encouragement to farmers who need 
increasing profits to repay large debt overhangs from prior 
unfavorable seasons. Many farmers owe more than their assets are 
worth in current markets. However, lenders are continuing to work 
with borrowers if there is any hope of recovery from current 
financial straits. Foreclosure sales of farm property have produced 
few bidders for either land or machinery. In most cases, lenders 
have purchased property at the loan value in order to prevent losses 
of loan principle. There have been few actual sales of farmland, and 
a representative market value is difficult to establish. Estimates 
of the decline in land value from year-ago levels range from zero to 
as much as 20 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Economists
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bank and business economists polled 
this month agree that the FOMC is on the right track and should 
stick to its announced policies. They believe these policies will 
soon result in reduced inflationary expectations and help to lower 
interest rates. The panel is concerned that projected budget 
deficits will keep interest rates high in the coming expansion and, 
consequently, limit private sector growth. Some panelists argue that 
the relatively high current interest rates for this stage of the 
recession are causing more severe liquidations and pressure on 
profit margins than usual. They say the liquidations are, in turn, 
providing earlier-than-usual inflation relief.
