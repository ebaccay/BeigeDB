      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economic recession does not appear to have 
ended. The general pattern of economic activity since the last 
report has continued to be downward. Consumer spending during the 
Easter season was disappointing, with sales in April just about 
matching the year-ago pace, representing a decline in real terms. In 
the manufacturing and mining sectors, a number of industries are 
undergoing a new wave of production cutbacks. The only notable 
improvement in sales has occurred in electronic equipment. 
Homebuilding has picked up recently, but the continued decline in 
home sales suggests the recovery may not be sustained. Storms have 
inflicted serious damage on the California agriculture industry, and 
crop prices generally remain below the level of a year ago. Bank 
credit growth at Twelfth District banks has slowed considerably 
since February, as the weakness in the regional economy and the 
heavy debt burden of borrowers has stifled business loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents report that retail sales throughout the Twelfth District 
continue to be slow. Department store sales in April apparently just 
about matched the dollar volume of a year-ago, representing a 
decline in real terms. Easter business picked up seasonally but was 
disappointing relative to the level of a year-earlier. Not even 
price discounts and heavy advertising campaigns were effective in 
significantly spurring sales. Sales of durable goods, such as 
furniture and appliances, continue to be particularly weak, due both 
to the housing slump and the reluctance of consumers to incur new 
debt. Sales of nondurable goods have been holding up better, but 
even grocery stores have been feeling the effects of recession. An 
increasing number of small retail outlets are going out of business. 
Sales of new automobiles declined in April, despite offers of below-
market financing and free warranty programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District manufacturing and mining industries have been 
undergoing a new wave of layoffs and production cutbacks in recent 
weeks. While employment in the lumber segment of the forest products 
industry has stabilized, the paper industry continues to cut back 
production. Layoffs also continue in the construction, commercial 
aircraft, and metals industries. Due to numerous commercial aircraft 
order cancellations, the Boeing Company in Seattle now plans to 
layoff at least 8,000 workers by year-end, instead of the 5,000 
announced earlier. Partly as a result of these cutbacks, Pacific 
Northwest aluminum producers also are cutting production further. 
Other regional metals industries are sinking deeper into recession 
as a result of depressed demand from the national automobile,
appliance and construction industries. In mid-April, Phelps Dodge 
Corporation closed nearly all of its copper mines and smelters in 
Arizona and New Mexico for an extended period, laying off 3,800 
workers. Declining world oil prices also are forcing cutbacks in 
such energy programs as oil drilling, oil shale development and coal 
production. The only significant improvement in sales is occurring 
in the electronic equipment manufacturing industry, both as a result 
of a pickup in commercial orders and continued strength in defense 
business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Twelfth District is finally experiencing a pickup in 
homebuilding. But regional housing starts had dropped to a post-
World War II low in February, so residential construction remains 
extremely depressed. Moreover, sales of new homes have continued to 
drop, and since inventories of unsold homes are still high, it is 
doubtful the recovery can be sustained until those inventories are 
worked off. California realtors are concerned that the Supreme Court 
may rule that home buyers in the state may no longer assume existing 
low-interest loans. Such a ruling would further reduce sales of 
older homes. Meanwhile, the slump in sales is further eroding 
selling prices for both new and older single-family homes and 
condominiums. Nonresidential construction activity also is slowing 
substantially. Developers are canceling some planned commercial 
projects, such as shopping centers and office buildings. Due to 
soaring costs, utilities in Washington have been forced to terminate 
construction of three nuclear plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent storms in California have inflicted serious damage on the 
agriculture industry. Heavy rains and flooding prevented planting of 
an entire strawberry crop, delayed planting of such important crops 
as cotton, rice and tomatoes, and drowned much of the State's 
asparagus crop. Experts fear that the roots of a wide variety of 
fruit and nut trees may rot due to flooding. Thus, even if crop 
prices rise this year, California farmers could experience a decline 
in receipts. In other Twelfth District agricultural areas, crop 
prospects are favorable. The increase in livestock prices in recent 
months also is a welcome improvement. Nevertheless, district bankers 
express growing concern over the heavy debt position of the 
agricultural sector generally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank credit growth in the Twelfth District has slowed considerably 
since February. In particular, the pace of business lending has 
leveled off, as the weakness in the region's economy and the heavy 
debt position of borrowers has stifled loan demand across nearly all 
industries. Twelfth District banks report a sharp increase in 
business loan delinquencies over the past few months and expect loan 
losses to be double those reported in the last normal year of 1980. 
Bankruptcies are up in the forest products and construction 
industries, as well as for small firms generally. Furthermore, cash-flow problems that are generated by firms' inability to collect 
receivables on time are becoming much more widespread throughout the 
business community. Because of this increase in delinquencies and 
problem loans, as well as continued pressure on net interest 
margins, many banks in this region are undertaking programs to 
bolster earnings by cutting noninterest costs.
