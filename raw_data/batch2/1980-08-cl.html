      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The sharpness of the second quarter decline in real GNP has not 
altered the outlook among most Fourth District respondents that the 
recession will bottom out in the late fall and a sluggish recovery 
will begin in the fourth quarter. The increase in PCE during June is 
generally viewed as a sign that a trough for some types of consumer 
spending has past, but spending patterns may be irregular until 
early next spring. Residential construction appears also to have 
reached a trough in the District, but builders are still discouraged 
by high mortgage rates. The business sector has begun to feel the 
impact of the consumer-centered recession beyond the already weak 
steel-rubber-glass industries. Respondents expect a sharp slowing in
the pace of inflation during the next quarter, but see little 
abatement in the underlying rate of inflation. Layoffs, especially 
in the steel industry, appear to have peaked, with unemployment 
rates through June that were still below 1973-1975 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The current recession is in the process of shifting from the 
consumer and construction sectors to the business sector, according 
to several officials in the Fourth District. However, the need for 
long-delayed capital expansion and continued auto retooling should 
provide some underlying strength to the business sector. Despite the 
sharpness of last month's decline in real GNP, several business 
economists are more confident that the recovery will begin in the 
fourth quarter than they were early this summer. Although the 
recovery is generally expected to be sluggish, an auto parts 
supplier asserts that new car models will provide stimulus needed 
for a slow recovery. A steel economist cites the need to rebuild 
steel inventories by the fourth quarter, along with renewed orders 
from the auto industry, as providing additional strength to the 
economy. According to a bank economist, however, the current level 
of consumer debt, along with job insecurity and scheduled increases 
in social security taxes in 1981, will prevent a strong rebound in 
consumer spending, especially for housing and appliances, until next 
spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several consumer goods producers and retailers believe that the 
strength of the recovery in retail sales remains uncertain, but are 
more confident that the trough in real PCE is past. Some believe, 
however, that further declines in furniture, appliances, and 
housekeeping goods (such as paper products because of their soaring 
prices) are likely at least until Christmas. A major appliance 
producer reports that demand from dealers has been a little better 
than expected, partly because housing starts did not decline as much 
as expected and partly because hot weather induced sales of 
refrigerators and air conditioners. He expects the contraction in 
production and inventories of major appliances to end no later than 
next month. A supplier of packaging materials notes that nondurable 
goods and some durable goods, such as color TVs have held up better-
than-expected. An official for a major department store chain 
expects a 1-2% (annual rate) increase in real PCE during the fourth 
quarter as auto sales strengthen, but expects a mild recovery in 
real PCE because of continued high inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Record low levels in mortgage commitments in recent months suggest 
to several S&amp;L officials that residential construction in the 
District may have reached a trough. Although sufficient funds are 
available to meet loan demand, consumers are still unwilling to 
accept current mortgage rates. A bank economists believes that a 
rate below 11% is required to produce a significant improvement in 
home buying. An S&amp;L official notes that one home builder has been 
unable to attract customers with a 9.75% mortgage rate. An area 
banker expects construction activity to be limited to completion of 
homes in progress, with virtually no speculative building. Mortgage 
rates, according to an economist with a regional FHLB in this 
District, have stabilized between 11-12%. However, some S&amp;Ls have 
raised their rates slightly and more are expected to adjust their 
rates upward if demand rises much during the summer season.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business sector, especially capital goods, has begun to soften. 
Despite a five month backlog, a small machine tool producer reports 
new orders down 30% from year-ago levels and expects at least three 
more months of downturn. A producer of highway and nonresidential 
construction materials states that new orders in June were down 10% 
from year-ago levels and backlogs were 13% below last year. However, 
the declines seem now to be leveling off as the company moves into 
its peak sales period. An official for an industrial construction 
company notes that capital goods typically lag the business cycle, 
but the sharpness of the declines in April and May suggests the lags 
may shorten in this recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      New orders for steel probably bottomed out in May, according to a 
steel economist, and are now rising irregularly toward consumption, 
which has been weakening. Steel consumption should stabilize when an 
upturn begins in automotive production, probably in the fourth 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consumer price index is expected to moderate to as low as 8% by 
year-end, but several respondents expect accelerated inflation in 
1981. An official for a major food store chain expects the July CPI 
to be discouraging because of food price increases, although August 
through October should be steady. Industrial prices will be held 
down by the severity of the recession and may help offset food price 
increases. An S&amp;L official notes that increases in housing prices 
have slowed and some builders are offering rebates. Several business 
economists expect inflation to rise to 11-12% rates through 1981. 
Further increases in layoffs comparable to the second quarter are 
generally not expected. A spokesman for a steel company states that 
layoffs currently represent 30% of their work force that serves the 
auto industry and 10% for specialty steel. Layoffs continue in coal 
mining in southern Ohio where high sulfur steam coal is restricted 
by environment regulation, according to an area banker. Layoffs are 
also being affected by business closings among auto and real estate 
dealers, according to a bank official. However, a state labor market 
analyst reports that about 50% of unemployed workers in Ohio are 
receiving supplemental income. Unemployment rates among major 
District SMSAs ranged from 5.8% to 13.2% in May, but still average 
about a half percentage point below the highs in the 1974-1975 
recession.
