     <div>
      <p>
       <strong>
        April 12, 1977
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors and other Redbook respondents in the First District are 
    optimistic about continued economic recovery although several 
    expressed concern about inflation. Retail sales in New England 
    continue to improve, consumer durable producers are doing better and 
    construction is starting to recover slowly. While increased interest 
    in capital goods is reported, sales growth continues to be slow and 
    bankers report continued spotty commercial loan demand.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      A large retail chain reports that after a slight pause in late 
March, sales have resumed a strong upward trend. While gains are 
expected throughout the rest of the year, inventories are being 
watched very closely. One retailer expressed concern that the tax 
rebate if enacted may come at just the wrong time, provide a 
temporary boost in sales leading some stores to build inventories 
too much, necessitating a later correction. A thread producer 
reported strong increases in sales, particularly to the garment 
industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers of consumer durables in the First District indicate 
strong demand for major appliances and also for goods related to the 
housing market. Several respondents who sell to the automobile 
market also report very strong sales with a producer of an input to 
tire production indicating they were operating flat out.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers in New England report that while they have 
been asked for more price quotations, sales continue to be slow. 
Sales are particularly poor for big ticket items although purchases 
of smaller items such as milling machinery are reported to be 
increasing; ball bearing sales are also doing well. Commercial 
purchases of aircraft equipment are seen as improving and one 
supplier to the airline industry expects substantial increases in 
this area. Capital goods producers report that overseas sales are 
not improving as much as they had hoped.
     </p>
     <p>
      Southern New England bankers report continued slow growth of 
commercial loan demand although smaller banks in the northern part 
of the region indicate more substantial increases. Bankers across 
the district report that consumer loan demand is quite healthy and 
deposit inflows remain strong. Construction loan activity is 
starting to increase from depressed levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although most Redbook respondents were quite optimistic about the 
economic outlook, few reported any interest in undertaking major new 
investments of their own. Some respondents expressed concern that 
rates of return still do not justify major new plant and equipment 
commitments. Most expressed continued apprehension about inflation 
and some are worried about the possible reimposition of wage and 
price controls. Price increases in metals are seen to be sticking 
more now than a few months ago and chemical price jumps are 
expected. Several respondents also indicated they had increased 
their own prices recently or intend to do so soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Tobin and Samuelson were available for comment 
this month. All three focused on fears of inflation. Professor 
Eckstein believes that inflation fears have been blown out of 
proportion in recent months. The underlying rate of inflation 
remains between 5 and 6 percent. Last year's price increases were 
relatively modest, but so far this year's price increases have been 
much larger, due in part to the weather and to a desire to realign 
prices with costs in some industries. Eckstein suggests that April's 
wholesale price index will increase sharply reflecting recent 
announcements in the steel and aluminum industries. Nevertheless, 
with an average inflation rate of 5.5 percent, it is not startling 
to encounter periods of price increase as low as 2 to 3 percent or 
as high as 9 to 10 percent; neither development marks a trend. From 
discussions with clients, Eckstein infers that businessmen's 
inflation concerns are founded in the fear that the tone of demand 
for their products will not be sufficient to maintain profit rates. 
With regard to policy, Eckstein believes it may be appropriate for 
the federal funds rate to increase 100 basis points by this fall. 
However, should short-term yields increase as much as the futures 
market suggests, he claims his forecast of 5 percent real growth of 
GNP would be too high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Tobin also believes that monthly price indices contain a 
lot of noise, and expects inflation to average 5 or 6 percent 
although sensitive sectors may produce much higher or lower rates of 
price increase occasionally. "In any case, we shouldn't try to fight 
commodity price increases with macro monetary policy." Tobin 
observes that businessmen and investors remain very uncertain about 
future growth. Fears of tight money, wage-price controls, and soft 
demand have contributed to a collapse in stock prices, restrained 
investment spending, and produced strong fears that
      <br/>
      short-term 
interest rates will rise sharply. Indeed, now that the program of 
fiscal stimulus appears to be foundering, monetary policy must be 
prepared all the more to assist the economy in reaching 6 percent 
real growth during 1977. For now, Tobin advocates not changing the 
federal funds rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Samuelson contends that recent spurts in prices are not 
related to changes in business conditions; in fact, we have not seen 
great strength. Consequently, there is no rational cause and effect 
linkage to justify more macro demand restraint. The rapid growth 
rates forecast for the middle quarters of 1977 can be regarded as a 
healthy
      <br/>
      "catch-up." Inflation can unwind only very slowly, and the 
present goal of policy should be to accommodate the momentum of 6 
percent real growth. Major sacrifices in employment and real growth 
would be required to force the underlying rate of inflation 
substantially below 5 percent.
