      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 12, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business conditions in the Fourth District have shown evidence of 
  further inventory accumulations in August, but the consumer-centered 
  recession has not yet spread to the capital goods sector. Most 
  businessmen and economists forecast a shallow recession extending 
  into the second quarter of 1980. Manufacturers report that 
  inventories have been accumulating at a slow rate, but few are 
  concerned that inventory liquidation would pose a serious problem 
  for the remainder of this year. Bankers and retailers have mixed 
  viewpoints over prospects for a moderate comeback in consumer 
  spending, but even those more optimistic do not expect a comeback 
  that will be strong enough to reverse the downward trend of the 
  economy. The housing market has continued to show surprising 
  strength as mortgage loan demand has remained unchanged from last 
  month. The city of Cleveland has slipped deeper into default.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most manufacturers report that involuntary inventory accumulation 
  has been occurring in the Fourth District. However, most had 
  expected some accumulation to occur as consumer spending slowed, but 
  have been unable to alter production schedules in anticipation of a 
  decline in orders. The inventory buildup, so far, has been 
  concentrated in material parts and components related to the auto 
  industry. A producer of consumer items reports that his inventory 
  buildup resulted from special market conditions for those items. The 
  standard view remains that tight controls on inventories over the 
  past year have kept inventories at satisfactory levels which can be 
  adjusted by slowing the rate of accumulation into the first quarter 
  of 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods producers, in general, have experienced little direct 
  effect from the recession. An official in the machine tool industry 
  reports no major change in new orders, although the peak in orders 
  occurred early in the year. Some softness in machine tools is 
  expected over the next six to twelve months and one official expects 
  a "sudden" softening in the fourth quarter of 1979. However, because 
  delivery times are extended well into 1980 and backlogs are still 
  increasing, layoffs have not occurred. A manufacturer of truck parts 
  notes some weakness in heavy-duty trucks which can be attributed to 
  the general slowing of the economy. He also states that a rebound in 
  light truck sales could lead a recovery in the second quarter of 
  1980. A steel economist reports that new orders for steel dropped 
  sharply in August, but are not expected to get worse. However, he is 
  apprehensive that declines in the demand for metal building 
  materials may be a preliminary sign of the recession spreading into 
  the capital goods sector. The steel industries' operating rate is 
  likely to drop sharply next quarter to about 70% operating rate, 
  according to one economist. Most producers are concerned that 
  capital goods spending will soften over the remainder of the year if 
  availability of money tightens and the consumer recession spreads.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers report some improvement in consumer demand related to 
  back-to-school purchases, which are predominately seasonal, and to 
  new car sales. Although operating at a satisfactory level, one 
  manufacturer of apparel notes that unit sales are off 20% for the 
  Fall season and are expected to be about 6% off this year from last. 
  Sales of nondurables have been on a down-trend all year, but one 
  super market official expects that any further retrenchments by the 
  consumer will be concentrated in durable goods. Consumers have been 
  increasingly shifting purchases away from inflationary items and one 
  retailer is concerned about the effect of income redistribution in 
  consumer buying, especially from rising food prices. However, a 
  District banker reports that consumer loan demand has been strong in 
  his area and has suggested that final demand will remain strong 
  enough through the Christmas season to spark a temporary consumer 
  comeback. A few others have taken a less sanguine view. They expect 
  consumer spending to worsen, because of increased consumer 
  resistance to high prices. In response to declining real incomes, 
  one retailer expects GAF sales next quarter to show about a 4% year- 
  over-year increase, about half of the increase that he expects for 
  the third quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing market conditions have continued to experience relative 
  strength despite the recession. Building suppliers state that 1979 
  has been better than expected, but they are skeptical about 1980 
  prospects. A major regional builder of homes reports that housing 
  starts have been accelerating since June and are expected to be "rapid" through October. Although a banker is concerned about 
  housing inventories being increasingly financed through borrowing, a 
  builder reports no excess inventories at this time. Sales of 
  existing houses have continued to be slow in August, with a rising 
  number of requests by home owners for banks to finance both the old 
  and the newly purchased house until buyers can be found.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgage and consumer loan demand has been strong in August, but 
  S&amp;Ls are still having trouble competing with commercial banks for 
  loanable funds. Bankers report increasing funds flowing into the 
  banks, but S&amp;Ls continue to borrow heavily from FHLBs. Mortgage 
  loans over the remainder of 1979 are expected to be below last 
  year's peak and interest rates on 80% mortgage loans are set to 
  increase by another twenty five basis points to 11-1/4% in some 
  parts of the District early in September. Consumer installment loan 
  demand has picked up, according to one area banker, because of a 
  switch from vacations to home recreation purchases. A banker notes 
  that even auto loans have made a comeback from April to June levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        The city of Cleveland has gone into its second default after failing 
  to roll over $3.3 million in city-held waterworks notes. The first 
  default last December amounted to $15 million. A second default 
  became certain when City Council refused to allow the transfer of 
  general operating funds to the waterworks fund, because of the 
  questionable legality of the transfer. A third default on $14 
  million in city-held notes, also held by the waterworks fund, is now 
  probable in October. However, the city was able to pay about 
  $500,000 in interest payments on the original default.
