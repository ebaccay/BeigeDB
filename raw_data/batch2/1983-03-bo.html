      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      For retailers and manufacturers in the First District the recovery 
seems to have arrived at last. Retailers report that sales in the 
first months of 1983 were well ahead of year ago levels. Retail 
inventories are relatively high, but still satisfactory. 
Manufacturers are not as optimistic, but most have seen improvements 
in some facets of their business. Demand has picked up for housing-related products in particular. Exports are weaker than domestic 
sales, although several respondents have become more positive about 
prospects in Europe. Canada is a major problem area, as is South 
America. In contrast to the retail sector, inventories in 
manufacturing are low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in January and February were well ahead of last year, 
but quite variable. Inventories are said to be relatively high yet 
satisfactory. Prices are much more stable than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      A building goods specialty house closed out the 1982 fiscal year in 
January with their strongest quarter in several years. However, a 
snowstorm in mid-February cut year-over-year sales growth from 24 
percent in January to 6 percent in February. Even sales to 
contractors, which have been severely depressed for several years, 
have picked up in the last couple of months.
     </p>
     <p>
      A discount department store chain reported February sales gains in 
New England ranging from 30 percent in Vermont to 5 percent in Rhode 
Island. Another department store chain, which has been upgrading its 
merchandise, reported strong growth even in Rhode Island where the 
recession has been most severe; for this firm fiscal year 1982 was 
the best year ever in terms of sales and profits.
     </p>
     <p>
      A mail order supplier of clothing and outdoor equipment reported 
January and February sales 10 to 15 percent ahead of last year, 
considerably below the year's average growth of 30 to 40 percent. 
The slowdown was due to weakness in sales of outerwear caused by a 
very mild winter in the Northeast and poor skiing conditions. Sales 
of spring merchandise in the first part of March were back on 
budget, about 25 percent above a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      These merchants attributed their recent strength to consumer 
optimism about the incipient national recovery, the relative health 
of the New England region throughout this recession, and their 
individual appeal to customers on price or quality grounds. Several 
have adjusted upward their fiscal 1983 plans and budgets, but this 
has not involved any net hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most manufacturers contacted think they see evidence of a recovery. 
The evidence is strongest for such housing-related products as 
roofing, ready-to-install building parts, wiring, electrical devices 
and appliances. The pickup in other areas is much less vigorous. 
While several firms reported increased demand for automotive 
products, a major tire manufacturer has seen no increase yet in 
orders from the automakers. The tire-maker is confident that its 
competitors are in the same position. Orders have increased slightly 
for semiconductors and electronic components, furniture for data 
processing operations, strip steel, industrial wiring, some types of 
machine tools, and corporate aircraft. Orders remain very depressed 
for commercial aircraft engines, industrial tools, and many heavy 
capital goods. Domestic sales are stronger than exports. However, 
four firms in four different product areas noted that the European 
situation is no longer deteriorating. Canada, on the other hand, was 
reported to be a major problem, as was South America. Concerns about 
Canada have been voiced in previous surveys, but never with such 
frequency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are said to be in good to very good shape. None of the 
respondents plans significant inventory reductions. A couple are 
concerned about being ready to respond to increased orders. Two 
firms noted that increases in their own sales, industrial wiring and 
electronic components, may be attributable to their customers' 
restocking depleted inventories; these products usually start to 
pick up later in the cycle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Until the recovery is more firmly established, manufacturers are in 
no hurry to call back workers. Among the firms contacted, one 
reported a very large layoff in January. Two others reported that 
work forces are continuing to fall through attrition. However, these 
same two firms expect to begin hiring later in the year. Most firms 
are meeting increases in demand by having existing staff work longer 
hours; in the case of the machine tool firms, an increase in hours 
means a return to a more normal workweek. In the housing and 
automotive areas, a few workers are being brought back. Almost all 
the current and planned hires are direct labor; some of the higher 
technology firms are also hiring engineers. No one plans to increase 
administrative and clerical personnel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein and Houthakker were available for comment this 
month. Eckstein believes that real growth during the first quarter 
may have exceeded 6 percent. With such a strong start, growth during 
1983 should exceed 4 percent. "The core rate of inflation is heading 
downward to 5 percent." With continued good luck "the consumer price 
index may only increase 3 percent or less during this year, and wage 
inflation should continue to decelerate throughout the year." 
Eckstein advises the Fed "to continue to do absolutely nothing for 
some months." "As has been the case since last October, the Fed 
should devote much discussion to money aggregates and their targets, 
but the federal funds rate should not be changed." "It's too early 
to play the monetarist game for real because adherence to the 
targets may produce a 15 percent prime rate this year. With low 
inflation, real interest rates are already very high. The Fed should 
wait until the money numbers display some rational link to economic 
conditions before resuming its monetarist role."
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker believes that real growth will average about 3 percent 
this year. The outlook for inflation this year and next is very 
favorable. This year, unit labor costs and prices should rise only 1 
or 2 percent because of high productivity growth and decelerating 
wage hikes. Next year productivity growth will be much slower, but 
the rate of increase of labor compensation should be much slower 
also. Houthakker has been content with monetary policy to date, but 
he is concerned that rapid money growth should not be allowed to 
continue without explanation. Perhaps now is the time to return to 
money growth targets. Houthakker notes that the deteriorating 
current account in our balance of payments has not depressed the 
dollar dramatically because of strong capital inflows. A return to 
money growth targets will not necessarily entail rising domestic 
interest rates because these foreign capital flows will not allow 
domestic interest rates to get out of line with yields abroad.
