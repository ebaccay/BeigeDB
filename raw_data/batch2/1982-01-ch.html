      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The business recession continued in the Seventh District on 
a broad front through the fourth quarter and into January. Output, 
new orders, and employment declined further in most manufacturing 
industries. Severe weather in January caused hardship and hampered 
business operations in various areas. Sales of general merchandise 
firms improved significantly late in the Christmas season and in 
early January, in response to promotions and price discounts. (Bad 
weather depressed sales in some areas later in the month.) Price 
discounting also is widespread in wholesale markets for materials 
and components. Housing activity is almost nonexistent. Agricultural 
conditions remain very depressed, but there is hope that December 
marked the low point for farm prices. Farmland prices have softened. 
The upturn in interest rates since late November has depressed 
credit demands, but business borrowing at large banks was strong in 
December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While forecasts vary significantly, most analysts in 
the region believe the decline in activity will end some time in the 
spring, followed by at least a modest uptrend in the second half. 
Several reasons are offered. The lead role probably will be played 
by consumers with buying power augmented by tax cuts starting July 
1. Excess inventories are being eliminated by price discounting and 
production cutbacks. A slower underlying rate of price inflation, 
aided by union wage and benefit concessions, will improve business 
confidence. Defense procurement, although not a major factor in the 
district, will provide some stimulus. Backlogs of deferred demand 
for housing, consumer durables, and some producer equipment are 
building up. Accelerated depreciation under the new tax law will 
help capital outlays. Translating backlogs of demand into sales and 
orders probably will depend on a reversal of the recent upturn in 
interest rates, which most analysts anticipate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Published price indexes probably do not fully reflect 
recent price cutting, for both producer and consumer goods. But the 
recent slowdown in inflation may be temporary. Electric and gas 
utilities are seeking large increases, and many manufacturers and 
trade firms will raise prices at the first favorable opportunity. 
Inventories of materials and components are at such low levels that 
any upturn in demand would spark price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of vehicles, furniture, and appliances 
remain very weak, but most general merchandise stores reported 
significant strength in sales just before and after Christmas. 
Although consumers responded to bargain prices, inventories remain 
somewhat excessive. Airlines report improvement in traffic starting 
in December. Some analysts fear that vigorous promotion of IRA 
accounts will draw away consumer dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment has been declining faster in the district 
than in the nation. In November, wage and salary employment in 
district states was 3 percent below November 1978 and manufacturing 
was off 13 percent. Indiana, Iowa, and Michigan have suffered the 
largest job losses. Layoffs in the motor industry and construction 
have been most significant, but layoffs also have been mounting in 
capital goods industries. White collar jobs are affected 
increasingly. Some state and local governments are reducing 
employment, reversing a steady rapid rise in the 1960's and l970's, 
mainly because of cuts in federal programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Plant Closing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many industrial plants have been closed in recent 
weeks to cut finished goods inventories, and many others are on 
short workweeks. Hopefully, most temporary closings will end as 
scheduled later this month or in February. Some plants have already 
reopened. However, certain freight car plants have been closed with 
no schedule for reopening. Several plants in the meat packing, motor 
and cement industries have been closed permanently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Packaging Materials
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for steel and plastic strapping, and 
paperboard for boxes, were very weak in late 1981, and apparently in 
January as well. Demand for these products parallels manufacturing 
activity in a broad range of industries. Inventories of paperboard 
rose suddenly as demand dropped off.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Negotiations
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Management and unions in various hard-pressed 
industries are engaged in negotiations to scale down compensation, 
or at least to slow increases. Restrictive work rules are under 
review. So far, confirmed concessions have been most significant in 
the auto, meat packing, and airline industries. A bitter struggle 
lies ahead over industry "take away" demands. The most important 
discussions are in the bellwether motor industry where management is 
seeking drastic modifications of the existing contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contracts for new industrial buildings, and new 
orders for capital goods, suggest a sharper decline in capital 
spending in the district than the 0.5 percent decline indicated by 
the recent government survey. Faster depreciation and other new 
investment incentives will have an impact, but only after confidence 
improves and margins of excess capacity are narrowed. Capital 
spending programs are dominated by projects intended to cut energy 
costs, e.g. continuous casting installations in the steel industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of cars and trucks continue at severely 
depressed levels. The first quarter auto output schedule of only 1.4 
million, may be cut again. Inventories are at an all time high in 
terms of days supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After showing strength last spring, steel demand slowed in 
the second half of 1981, and December marked the low for the year. A 
pickup in demand expected for January has not materialized, and no 
improvement is now seen before March. User inventories of steel are 
low and would have to be replenished if durable goods sales revived.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After a slight easing in availability of mortgage 
funds in November and early December, the market tightened again. 
Very few new loans are being negotiated at quoted terms of 17-18 
percent or more, plus three points, with 20 percent down. New home 
construction is at a virtual standstill. Nonresidential construction 
prospects also are bleak, but permits have been approved recently 
for several additional large office buildings in Chicago's Loop 
area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Two years of depressed farm earnings, with little hope 
of a near-term recovery, has led to weakness in district farmland 
markets. Reports from many areas indicate little buyer interest at 
current prices. Our latest survey of agricultural banks shows an 
average decline of 3 percent in district farmland values during the 
fourth quarter, with weakness most apparent in Illinois, Indiana, 
and Iowa. However, with farmland prices in the region four times the 
level of 10 years ago, equity in land provides a basis for coping 
with a prolonged period of depressed earnings for most farmers.
