      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic atmosphere in the Seventh District has 
improved substantially since the turn of the year. This is the first 
time such a statement could be made unequivocally since the region's 
deep problems became manifest in the spring of 1979. Virtually all 
sectors have seen improvement or at least an end to the declines of 
the past year and a half. Orders have increased for building 
materials, steel, nonferrous metals, appliances, paper, paperboard, 
and various components. Retail sales of general merchandise have 
improved moderately and airline traffic is booming in response to 
bargain fares. Order leadtimes have lengthened and wholesale prices 
have increased for a broad range of hard and soft goods. However, 
demand for capital equipment remains very slow. Employment, overall, 
appears to have stabilized, but there is little hope for a 
significant near-term increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Caution Remains
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Signs of better times should be kept in 
perspective. Improved sentiment largely reflects a feeling of relief 
that the long decline has halted, and perhaps reversed, without the 
wholesale bankruptcies that some had feared. The entire region 
remains very depressed. The view is spreading that the problems of 
the Midwest are chronic, not just the result of another "cycle." 
Moreover, aside from residential construction and defense (a minor 
factor here), much of the improvement since December is associated 
with the aftermath of the rapid inventory liquidation of 1982, 
especially the fourth quarter. No general resurgence in final demand 
is anticipated in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Confidence
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Various surveys of business sentiment indicate 
improvement, but this may reflect more a feeling of relief that "we 
made it" through the crises than renewed confidence. Strength in the 
stock and bond markets has permitted many companies to greatly 
improve their balance sheets, and ruthless cost cutting has lowered 
breakeven points. But debt burdens remain high and most executives 
are very hesitant in making commitments. An "aversion to risk 
taking" is evident, to a degree unknown since World War II.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Managers' Reports Favorable
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In their February reports, 
purchasing managers associations in Chicago and Milwaukee showed 
gains in orders and output for the first time since the spring of 
1981. Also, voluntary inventory liquidation appeared to have ended. 
However, reports of declining employment continued to outnumber 
reports of increases. Perhaps the most striking development was a 
sudden surge in prices paid. Since early 1982 these reports had 
shown prices declining on balance, an unprecedented development 
since World War II.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wholesale Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Increases in prices are reported for steel, steel 
scrap, aluminum, copper, brass, nickel, silver, gypsum board, 
cement, lumber, building hardware, paper, and paperboard. Only oil 
products and petrochemicals have continued to decline. In many 
cases, earlier declines in prices and recent increases were effected 
by adjustments of discounts from list that will not be recognized 
fully in official indexes. Fierce price competition and very short 
leadtimes have reflected excess capacity and very low order books. 
Inventory policies, geared to immediate availability of goods and 
soft prices, are being modified as these conditions are reversed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A very large general merchandise chain reports a 
modest improvement in demand. Inventories are somewhat slim. Retail 
prices average only 2.5 percent above the year-earlier level, but 
may be firming. Airline travel in February and early March was at 
least 10 percent above the year-earlier level, and at a new 
seasonally-adjusted high. The surge in air travel was encouraged by 
bargain fares, 12 percent below last year in February.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In January, payroll employment in the district was 9 
percent below January 1979. Nationally, employment was about the 
same as four years earlier. In the same comparison, manufacturing 
employment was down 27 percent in the district, about twice the 
deficit nationally. It is unlikely that job markets will improve 
significantly in the months ahead. Help-wanted ad volume in Chicago 
in February and early March was 25 percent below the year-earlier 
level, and 60 percent below the 1960 base. Conditions in other large 
district centers are similar. Many employers will attempt to handle 
any improvement in business without new hirings. Severance of newly 
hired workers can be costly, especially if government regulators or 
private litigation become involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for capital equipment produced in the 
district remains bleak. A slight rise in sales of small backhoes 
used in homebuilding is the only improvement in the construction 
equipment sector. Logging equipment is also up modestly. If the 
Caterpillar strike (now almost six months old) is settled, output of 
earthmoving equipment and related components will rise. Large 
inventories on hand when the strike began have been depleted. Hopes 
for a revival in farm equipment have been dashed by the government's 
acreage reduction programs. Rail equipment demand has dropped to the 
levels of the 1930s. Some orders for trucks and trailers were placed 
to beat the April 1 tax hike. Machine tool order backlogs have 
virtually evaporated. This industry, described by its leaders as 
"severely crippled", is seeking protection from imports. Contracts 
for factories, warehouses, and commercial structures indicate a 
further decline in nonresidential construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of autos this year have not been strong enough to 
justify planned production schedules, which may have to be cut back. 
However, some analysts point out that a growing share of auto output 
is for individual orders. Orders are not counted in reported sales 
data until deliveries are made to customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for steel have risen sharply since year-end, but only 
for lighter products required for autos, appliances, and housing. 
Heavy structurals and plates remain very weak. Order leadtimes on 
sheet steel, near zero in January, are now out three months, a 
situation that may cause some users to order still further ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing upswing has considerable momentum. Large 
district realtors report that transactions for existing homes in 
January and February set all-time highs for those months. Contracts 
for new residential construction in January in the Chicago area were 
almost double the low level of last year. Repair and remodel work 
may be at new peaks. Some gypsum plants are operating six-day weeks 
with output above rated capacity.
