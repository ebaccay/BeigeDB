      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business activity in the Kansas City District is characterized by 
  rapidly rising prices, satisfactory materials availability, and 
  little improvement in real sales volume. Purchasing agents in the 
  Tenth District report substantial input price increases so far this 
  year and anticipate further increases in the final quarter. With a 
  few exceptions, however, input availability and inventory levels 
  remain satisfactory. District retailers note a recent strengthening 
  of sales, but, in real terms, sales have not improved over last 
  year. Bankers contacted report that loan demand remains strong for 
  most loan categories, especially construction and agriculture. In 
  agriculture, the financial situation is somewhat better than a year 
  ago, due to higher farm prices and improved cash flows.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Tenth District purchasing agents, prices for most major 
  inputs are up approximately 8 to 10 per cent over this time last 
  year. For the remainder of the year, input prices are anticipated to 
  increase for metal, clothing, and building materials. Cardboard is 
  expected to increase an additional 5 to 10 per cent. Input material 
  availability does not appear to present a serious problem for most 
  industries contacted. The transportation industry, however, reported 
  an increase in lead times as well as some difficulties in obtaining 
  an adequate number of rail cars and trucks. Also, the container 
  industry reported that lead times for steel-based input products 
  have been increasing and are expected to continue to increase for 
  the remainder of the year. In the building materials industry, 
  insulation and concrete are very difficult to obtain. Currently, 
  material inventory levels are at satisfactory levels for all 
  industries, with the exception of the metals industry where 
  inventories are too high due to a slack demand from the agricultural 
  sector. As a result, the metals industry will continue trimming its 
  inventories. Most industries contacted expressed no real problem 
  regarding labor shortages. Only firms in the transportation industry 
  and some in the metals industry appear to be near full capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers report that while dollar sales have been improving in the 
  past three months, they are up only about 10 per cent over last 
  year. Mild weather throughout the District was cited as having the 
  effect of delaying sales of winter goods. Other goods that have been 
  weak are home improvement items and major appliances. Clothing, 
  housewares, and domestic goods have been selling well. Retail prices 
  have recently been fairly stable. Most retailers felt that prices 
  may rise about 1 to 2 per cent in the fourth quarter. Inventories 
  have been characterized as "in line with sales" by most stores. 
  Those experiencing somewhat heavy inventories expect them to be 
  corrected by strong Christmas sales. Most retailers, in fact, were 
  optimistic about the Christmas season, though they felt it might be 
  a little slower than last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankers contacted in the Tenth District report that loan demand 
  remains strong, particularly for agricultural and construction 
  loans. Demands for consumer, real estate, and energy-related loans 
  are also reported as moderate to strong. All bankers contacted 
  raised their prime lending rates recently and expect further 
  increases before the end of the year. As of November 3, most had 
  prime rates of 10 1/2 per cent. Some of the bankers contacted 
  mentioned tightening other lending terms recently or possibly in the 
  near future. Despite these comments, most bankers do not expect to 
  have problems meeting future loan demand. However, some mentioned 
  cutting back on consumer, real estate, and new loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Deposit growth is moderate or down slightly at most banks contacted. 
  Demand deposits are up moderately, but savings deposits are 
  generally flat or down slightly from a year ago due to higher 
  interest rates and shifts to money market CD's. Time deposits are 
  generally flat or up slightly over a year ago. Deposits are expected 
  to grow moderately in the near future due to seasonal factors and a 
  strengthening agricultural sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Farm loan demand in the Tenth District has strengthened recently, 
  causing some renewed pressures on bank liquidity. However, due to 
  higher farm prices and significantly improved cash flows, the 
  overall financial picture for the District's agriculture is somewhat 
  brighter than it was a year ago. The upturn in loan demand pushed 
  average loan-deposit ratios at rural banks during the third quarter 
  to levels near the high ratios of a year ago. As of October 1, the 
  average ratio for the District was 63.4 per cent, and ranged from 58 
  per cent in Oklahoma to 73.8 per cent in Wyoming.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apparently, farmers are now borrowing to take advantage of profit 
  opportunities. While this development has placed new pressure on 
  bank liquidity, the prospects are good that the farmers will be able 
  to repay their loans as they mature. In the past year, farmers have 
  significantly improved their loan repayment performance. But because 
  of the strains on liquidity, bankers are maintaining collateral 
  requirements, and many continue to refer loans to other credit 
  agencies. Though referral activity does not appear to be increasing 
  very significantly, interest rates on farm loans are rising and now 
  stand about 40 to 45 basis points above year-earlier levels.
