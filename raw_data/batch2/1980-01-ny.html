      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 29, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Second District has been surprisingly 
resilient in January, according to recent comments of District 
directors and business leaders. One of the brightest spots has been 
retail sales which were generally substantially higher in the first 
three weeks of the month than most respondents had expected. Outside 
of retailing, business activity also appears to be holding its own. 
New orders at several industries posted modest recoveries after 
declining slightly in recent months; and inventories seem to have 
been kept in line with shipments. At the same time, however, cost 
increases have cut into the profit margins of some companies since 
they have been unable to raise their prices fully under current 
market conditions. Most respondents expect the Federal override of 
state usury ceilings on mortgage interest rates to have little 
effect on construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the Second District generally experienced higher-than-expected sales in the first three weeks of January. Merchants 
chalked up good to excellent gains in sales in downstate New York 
and in New Jersey. Stores in New York City appear to have done 
slightly better than those in the suburbs. Sales were mixed, 
however, in upstate New York. While consumer buying reportedly was 
"brisk" in the Rochester area, it was less sanguine in the Buffalo 
area. Inventories seem in balance with sales, with one major 
department store actually reporting them to be on the lean side. In 
this vein, many of those retailers contacted noted a lengthening in 
delivery times in some of their faster moving lines because 
suppliers had been caught with low stocks. Despite the healthy 
showing in recent weeks, most retailers expect a weakening in sales 
in the months to come.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales appear to have stabilized in the Second District with 
small cars continuing to outsell large ones. At the same time, truck 
sales are showing tentative signs of recovering from the doldrums of 
a few months ago. Despite the softness in certain automotive lines, 
domestic dealers in this area report inventories are close to 
desired levels. In sharp contrast, foreign car dealers have 
apparently been unable to increase their inventories which 
reportedly has hurt their sales. Customers do not appear to be kept 
out of the market by any tightening of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside the consumer sector, business activity for most firms seems 
to be holding steady or even improving slightly. Two upstate 
manufacturers of machine tools report that their orders and sales 
are continuing at high levels, although one did note that inquiries 
concerning prospective orders has tapered off a bit. Also reporting 
gains in orders or sales were companies in such diverse industries 
as chemicals, steel, and petroleum refining. One manufacturer of 
photographic equipment indicated that its sales had held up much 
better than it had been anticipated. The strength in consumption 
spending was cited by one upstate producer of paper boxes and other 
packaging containers for consumer goods as buttressing his business 
activity. A few firms, however, do report that they have been hurt 
by fall-offs in homebuilding and automobile sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Companies throughout the Second District report severe upward 
pressure on their costs led by higher energy costs and rising labor 
costs. One paper box producer, for example, reported that its costs 
had shot up 25 to 30 percent over the last six months. Most other 
companies indicated that their costs had increased by lesser 
amounts, on the order of 10 percent per year. The chemical companies 
contacted cited the rising cost of petroleum as a key element of 
their costs. In addition, labor costs have risen under new contracts 
as well as under the COLA provisions of contracts negotiated 
earlier. The higher cost pressures have led to price increases, but 
profit margins remain under pressure. Many firms are selling in weak 
markets and have been limited in their ability to raise their 
prices. Some firms, such as those in the photographic field, have 
been forced by the extraordinary explosion in certain commodity 
prices to raise their prices significantly just to cover costs. 
These firms may therefore be facing a particularly difficult period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite price uncertainties, the longer-term outlook for firms is 
not unfavorable. There is some feeling that recent speculative fever 
in commodity markets may have run its course, and oil supplies seem 
to be coming into balance with demand. Nevertheless, most firms 
still expect a recession early this year with a recovery later in 
the year. Still, capital spending plans have not been reduced. 
Further strength in the local economy may come from the projected 
boosts in defense spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      The temporary Federal override of state usury ceilings on mortgage 
interest rates is expected to result in only a limited increase in 
home-building activity. Several respondents felt that consumers 
simply could not afford the high costs of debt service. The amount 
of turnover in housing, however, was expected to rise as a result of 
increased availability of mortgage funds.
