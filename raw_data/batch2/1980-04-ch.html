      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 15, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Seventh District was hit disproportionately by the slump in 
motor vehicles and housing that began in 1979. Until recently, 
however, it was not clear that weakness was spreading to other 
sectors on a broad front. Now, accumulating evidence indicates that 
a general recession developed in the first quarter. Demand for most 
types of consumer and producer goods has been dampened, complaints 
from the rural areas have become strident, and nonresidential 
construction appears to be poised for a dropoff. Some observers 
detect an abrupt deterioration in their industries that began after 
mid-March. Finally, we no longer hear confident predictions that any 
general recession will be brief and mild. Confidence of consumers 
and executives has eroded noticeably, with no reversal likely in the 
near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reduced availability of credit and high interest rates have become 
paramount considerations in decisions to apply for or grant most 
types of credit, not only for long-term residential and farm 
mortgages, but also for consumer installment loans, business working 
capital loans, and farm production loans. This phenomenon has not 
been apparent since WW II.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conservative policies on carrying inventories and booking orders (in 
contrast to 1974) may have prevented a general recession from 
developing in 1979. In a number of industries—e.g., steel, 
appliances, and equipment components—order trends have followed an 
irregular path as periodic reordering has been necessary to maintain 
adequate working stocks. Similarly, the absence of multiple ordering 
prevented waves of cancellations when demand slowed. But inventories 
and bookings never appear conservative when demand declines sharply 
or is expected to do so. In late March a number of industries, e.g., 
steel and petrochemicals, experienced a sharp drop in orders. 
Reduced backlogs and shorter order lead times were reported widely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Favorable weather this past winter in contrast to the last three may 
have made the economy appear stronger in early 1980 than was the 
case. Road and rail transportation and construction activity were 
affected less by weather this winter than in a normal year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The industrial developments in the district have been confused by 
the aftereffects of strikes at Deere and Caterpillar late last year, 
and by the continuing strike at International Harvester that began 
November 1. The strikes have made demand for the products of these 
companies appear artificially strong because of the reduced flow of 
finished products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most producer goods industries report declines in demand, although 
in varying degrees. Production is being maintained in some cases, 
but backlogs typically are declining. Hardest hit have been trucks, 
trailers, farm equipment, and types of construction equipment 
associated with residential developments. Orders for freight cars, 
diesel engines, mechanical components, and castings are down 
sharply. Still strong are machine tools, various electrical 
equipment, and commercial aircraft—all represented to a degree in 
our district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for most types of domestic cars and trucks remains weak, 
resulting in further cutbacks in output schedules. Layoffs have 
increased again at the Big Four, at parts suppliers, and at 
dealerships. Sales are down more in this region than nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Closings of auto dealerships, often large agencies handling the 
strongest names, are increasingly frequent. Aside from depressed 
sales, dealers have been carrying inventories at interest rates 
ranging up to 20 percent. Interest alone averages $150 per car per 
month, and many higher-priced cars remain on hand for abnormally 
long periods. Also, some of the agencies occupy modern facilities 
with heavy mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large general merchandise retailers headquartered in the district 
reported March sales in current dollars at or below last year 
despite an earlier date for Easter. Prices average about 7 percent 
higher. Weakness was noted in all major lines, and in all regions. 
Credit delinquencies have increased, but not to an alarming level as 
yet. However, bankruptcy filings are building up rapidly, encouraged 
by last year's lenient bankruptcy act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Installment credit has been under increasing restraint for six 
months or more at banks (including bank cards), credit unions, and 
retailers. Outflows of deposits, usury ceilings, and operating 
losses on consumer loans have caused lenders to take one or more of 
the following steps: refusal of new lines and increases in existing 
lines, withdrawals of existing lines, raising of standards, 
increasing minimum payments, and changing methods of calculating 
interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity, both new construction and transfers, is at a 
virtual standstill in most areas of the district. Permits for new 
homes in the Chicago SMSA in the first quarter were at least 80 
percent below two years ago, and many of these permits may not be 
activated. Residential developments continue where loan commitments 
were made last year at favorable rates. Posted loan charges are 17 
percent plus three points, but very few new loans are being made. 
Usury rates have not been a factor because huge monthly payments 
required currently price virtually all borrowers out of the market. 
Some analysts believe that fixed rate mortgages may not be offered 
in the future. Transfers of existing homes usually reflect 
situations where people must move, and are ready to make substantial 
price concessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the district's farm sector have deteriorated 
significantly since mid-March, an abrupt change for the worse rarely 
matched in the past. Deep concern reflects lower commodity prices, 
reduced credit availability, and unprecedentedly high interest 
rates. The squeeze on farm profitability evident in earlier months 
has tightened. The terms "panic" and "distress" are encountered 
frequently in the local press and in our contacts with rural 
communities. Because of liquidity pressures, rural banks are 
policing farm credits more closely. Some borrowers have been turned 
away, and others have been restricted to amounts needed to get crops 
underway, with a clamp down on loans for equipment and capital 
improvements. Purchases of farm equipment are down sharply. Buyers 
of grain and livestock, also affected by tight credit, have scaled 
down purchases to hold inventories at minimum levels. A preliminary 
tabulation of our farmland survey shows prices down moderately in 
the quarter ending March 31, and observers believe that the 
downtrend has accelerated. Tight credit and bleak farm income 
prospects have had the double impact of reducing the number of 
potential investors and increasing the number of properties offered 
for sale.
