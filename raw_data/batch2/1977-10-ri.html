      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 11, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Responses to our latest survey suggest that Fifth District 
manufacturing activity made few advances in September. Shipments by 
District manufacturers increased, but by less than during the 
previous months New orders have weakened slightly and backlogs of 
orders have been worked down somewhat since August. Inventories 
continued to expand, albeit rather slowly, and remain above desired 
levels. The optimism which prevailed among District manufacturers 
until recently has now been entirely dissipated. The retail sector 
apparently did better last month as both total sales and relative 
sales of big ticket items picked up. Credit extended by large 
District banks surged ahead in the past few weeks, led by 
substantial gains in commercial and industrial loans. Much of the 
increase, however, appears to be of a seasonal nature as banks meet 
the credit needs of tobacco leaf dealers.
      <p>
       Survey results suggest continued slow growth in manufacturing 
  employment, although an increase in weekly hours worked was 
  indicated this month. Manufacturers' shipments continued to make 
  some gains in September, but apparently demonstrated less overall 
  strength than in August. New orders were virtually flat for the 
  third consecutive month and, as a result, backlogs of orders are now 
  somewhat below last month's levels. Manufacturers' inventories, 
  particularly of materials, continued to expand and more than one in 
  three respondents view current levels as excessive. Prices paid, 
  other than employee compensation, continued to advance with nearly 
  one-half of the manufacturing respondents reporting further 
  increases. Increases in average hourly earnings were less common 
  than those of other prices paid. On the other hand, respondents 
  reported virtually no change, on balance, in prices received.
      </p>
      <p>
       These recent developments have been rather general, not restricted 
  to any one sector. The only exception to this is a noticeable 
  slowing in the textile industry. Of textile manufacturers responding 
  to our survey, one-half reported a decline in the volume of new 
  orders in September, while 60 percent experienced a reduction in 
  backlogs of orders. At the same time, the outlook among textile 
  producers has deteriorated to the point where one-third of those 
  respondents anticipate further reductions in their production over 
  the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among all manufacturing respondents, the outlook is clearly less 
  bright than in recent months. Concerning the level of business 
  activity nationally, sixty percent foresee no change over the next 
  six months while the remainder are evenly divided between expecting 
  further improvement and expecting a worsening trend. Much the same 
  pattern exists in their views concerning the outlook for their 
  immediate market areas as well as for their respective firms. Among 
  retailers surveyed, there seems to be little indication that 
  conditions are expected to change over the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The retailers reported some improvement in September as total sales 
  and relative sales of big ticket items both rose somewhat. 
  Inventories were also higher than in August, but are generally in 
  line with desired levels. In addition, there were no reports from 
  retailers that indicated any change in prices from a month ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banks' experiences have been mixed regarding the sources of strength 
  in credit demand. While there continues to be overall strong demand 
  for consumer loans, some isolated weakness has nevertheless arisen. 
  This weakness, however, is seen to be temporary, arising mainly from 
  an extended model changeover period in the automobile market. In 
  addition to the recent increase in loans to tobacco leaf dealers, a 
  smaller part of the overall increase in loan demand is broadly based 
  across industrial sectors, continuing the modest cyclical rise that 
  has been underway for some months now. There has been a definite 
  slowing in growth of consumer time deposits. Rising short-term 
  market rates of interest are seen as contributing to this slowing. 
  Many District banks see short-term rates rising in the future, and 
  consequently there is growing interest in issuing longer term CD's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Widespread drought and a tightening cost-price squeeze combined to 
  weaken the financial condition of many Fifth District farmers during 
  1977. Some have been hard hit. Large numbers of farm operators are 
  reported to be in reasonably good shape, however. Similarly, the 
  overall quality of farm loan portfolios deteriorated at quite a 
  number of banks. But all bankers reported they would be able to deal 
  successfully with most cases of problem farm loans. Moreover, none 
  were expecting to have to absorb any losses from their farm loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Year-to-date cash income from farm marketings was below the year ago 
  level for the January-July period. The District decrease, all of 
  which occurred in the Carolinas, amounted to less than 1 percent. 
  With weaker demand and lower quality offerings, flue-cured tobacco 
  prices have begun to trend downward after holding at record levels 
  for about six weeks. The seasons s average price is 10 percent above 
  a year ago and at an all-time high, however.
