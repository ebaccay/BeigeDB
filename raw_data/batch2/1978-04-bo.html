      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Directors and other Redbook respondents of the Federal Reserve Bank 
  of Boston report continued healthy economic growth but expressed 
  much concern about inflation. Several respondents are of the opinion 
  that the economy is growing significantly faster than the published 
  data indicate. Production in the District's factories is expanding 
  and there has been a healthy increase in commercial loan demand. 
  Retail sales may be beginning to soften.
       </p>
       <p>
        The chief economist of a large electrical machinery manufacturer 
  reports that sales of all lines are very strong with back orders 
  growing. Orders for major appliances are up about 20 percent over 
  last year although some slowdown is anticipated if the demand for 
  housing declines. Orders and sales of producers durables are also 
  increasing strongly except for electrical power systems. Despite 
  this strong performance, this manufacturer is still operating at 
  less than 80 percent of capacity and has no major capital outlays of 
  its own scheduled. The chief executive officer of a diversified 
  chemical company reports that all industries he is associated with 
  had a vigorous March.
       </p>
       <p>
        The chairman of a large money center bank reports strong increases 
  in commercial loan demand both in New England and nationally. This 
  trend is expected to continue throughout the year. This banker 
  anticipates some upward pressure on interest rates but feels that 
  continued strong competition for loan business will have a 
  moderating effect. Deposit inflows remain healthy although there has 
  been some indication of a move out of savings by sophisticated 
  depositors. Northern New England bankers also report strong 
  commercial loan growth as well as significant increases in consumer 
  borrowing and in construction lending activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales present a somewhat mixed picture, remaining fairly 
  strong in some areas but beginning to slow in others. The Chairman 
  of the Board of a large department store chain expects the real rate 
  of increase in retail sales to fall by about one-half this year. He 
  expects auto sales to be affected most, with significantly smaller 
  drops in soft goods. According to this source, retailers expect a 
  decline in consumer confidence later this year caused by worsening 
  inflation, and as a result are becoming increasingly pessimistic 
  themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        All Redbook respondents expressed growing concern over inflation and 
  several reported that most businessmen they talk to are becoming 
  increasingly worried. Inflationary expectations are increasing and 
  some industries are said to be considering defensive price increases 
  because of a fear of controls. None of those contacted reported any 
  difficulties with bottlenecks or shortages, although there is some 
  concern about aluminum and paper next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein, Houthakker and Samuelson were available for 
  comment this month. None saw a contradiction in striving for both 
  further gains in employment and lower inflation. Samuelson and 
  Eckstein noted the relatively low capacity utilization rate, the 
  lack of shortages of materials or skilled labor, and the ready 
  availability of intermediate inputs as evidence against the view 
  that the economy is near full employment. Samuelson especially 
  deplored the practice of redefining the natural rate of unemployment 
  to always equal the current rate in the absence of confirming 
  indicators of labor market tightness. None of the three was 
  particularly concerned about the recent runup in the inflation rate, 
  noting that most of the increase is due to pressure from the highly 
  volatile food price sector and to adjustments emanating from acts of 
  Congress. They felt that the monetary authority should be careful 
  not to overreact to the inflation uptick, since neither of its 
  proximate causes are amenable to correction through aggregate demand 
  management policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Houthakker cautioned against intervention on the foreign exchange 
  market to support the value of the dollar, although he preferred 
  massive gold sales if a support operation were to be attempted. In 
  his view, monthly offerings of a few hundred thousand ounces of gold 
  would be useless, nor did he favor the sale of European currency 
  denominated Treasury bills as a support device. Houthakker is not 
  convinced that more inflation will result from the devaluation, as 
  evidenced by the stability of dollar prices of those raw materials 
  traded in international markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rebounding from a slow first quarter, the economy should grow at a 
  7.5 percent rate this quarter, according to Eckstein, although a 
  mild slowdown during the rest of this year and into 1979 is likely. 
  Eckstein sees a decline in housing as a virtual certainty at current 
  interest rates and, noting that there is no example of successful 
  gradualism, cautions that using monetary policy to produce a decline 
  in inflation would probably lead to a credit crunch and an even more 
  severe housing cycle. It is very dangerous for the Government to 
  pursue a one-objective policy, therefore Eckstein advocates top-of-the-range money growth as a balanced, cautious approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        Samuelson also fears that the next recession will be caused by a 
  preoccupation with inflation. He argues that the recent slow growth 
  in the monetary aggregates brought about by slow real GNP growth 
  allows the Fed some leeway to pursue a near term monetary policy a 
  little less tight than might otherwise have been appropriate. On the 
  other hand, Houthakker feels that further progress on both the 
  inflation and the unemployment front can be achieved with money 
  growth averaging near the midpoints of the current ranges.
