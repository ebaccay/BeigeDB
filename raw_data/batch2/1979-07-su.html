      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 5, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        On balance, a slowing of business activity in recent weeks has been 
  accompanied by a significant deterioration of businessmen's 
  expectations for the remainder of 1979. Reserve Banks' 
  characterizations of the current picture seemed to follow a 
  geographical pattern: the northeastern, Midwestern, and western 
  districts view it as largely positive with some trouble spots, while 
  negative factors dominate the reports of the north central, 
  southern, and mid-Atlantic regions. Tight gasoline supplies, on top 
  of more basic problems, have cut noticeably into consumer spending, 
  with pronounced effects on tourism and sales of large cars. To date, 
  the Independent Truckers' strike and diesel fuel shortages appear to 
  have caused only minor disruptions of manufacturing activity, but 
  the agricultural impact has been more severe in some areas. Apart 
  from the fuel-afflicted sectors, industrial activity seems to be 
  holding steady or coming off slightly from an elevated pace. Capital 
  spending, for both plant and equipment, is unquestionably the best 
  thing going, but many districts foresee some easing of growth there 
  as well. Inventories, both retail and manufacturing, are heavier but 
  seem to be of concern to retailers only. Job markets remain tight, 
  for the most part. Bank lending, particularly to businesses, is 
  almost universally described as strong; deposit growth has been slow 
  to moderate. Housing has continued to wane.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those districts commenting on the availability of gasoline regard 
  supplies as "generally adequate." Odd-even rationing, purchase 
  restrictions, reduced gas station hours, and curtailed driving have 
  alleviated the crunch and avoided long waiting lines. The travel 
  cutback has taken a heavy toll on the tourist industry—estimates of 
  year-over-year declines in tourist-related businesses, where given, 
  were double-digit. Philadelphia, however, reports increases at two 
  major vacation spots and sees other factors contributing to the 
  sharp fall in Jersey shore resort traffic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Diesel fuel stringencies and/or the Independent Truckers' strike 
  have resulted in relatively minor disruptions of coal mining 
  (Minneapolis), construction work (Chicago), and manufacturers' input 
  or finished product deliveries (New York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, 
  Dallas). Some farmers have been harder hit. Atlanta and Richmond 
  report cases of excellent crops of perishables rotting in the fields 
  or at shipping points; Chicago and Boston have seen reduced supplies 
  and unseasonably high prices of produce. Movement of animals to 
  slaughter has been curtailed, forcing temporary shutdowns of meat 
  processing plants in five districts. However, farm operations have 
  been relatively unaffected in most of the Kansas City and Dallas 
  districts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales have fallen, in real terms if not dollar volume, say 
  Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis; weakness 
  has been particularly apparent in the latest week or two. Other 
  districts (except Kansas City, which reports slowing sales gains) 
  convey an impression of "mixed," "spotty," or "flat" sales. Retail 
  stocks have crept above desired levels. A majority of retailers have 
  revised downward their sales projections for the rest of the year 
  and are likely to be rather aggressively thinning out inventories. 
  The gasoline situation has been widely blamed for at least part of 
  the sales slowdown, but those who believe that more plentiful fuel 
  will spur a dramatic revival are a small minority. Gasoline probably 
  does account for an apparent change in shopping patterns—several 
  districts noted that downtown or neighborhood stores are faring much 
  better (or less badly) than far-flung suburban or regional shopping 
  centers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The gas-related decline in sales of large cars, RVs, and light 
  trucks and resulting inventory overhang have reached troublesome 
  proportions. Production cutbacks and layoffs have occurred in the 
  Atlanta, St. Louis, and Chicago districts; San Francisco reports one 
  dealership closing and three others for sale in Portland. Three 
  Banks note a substantial drop in prices of large used cars. Small 
  economy cars are moving briskly, where available, but supply 
  constraints for the best sellers have probably meant a decrease in 
  total new car sales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although manufacturing activity is generally characterized as 
  strong, a number of exceptions were noted. Auto output, of course, 
  is off considerably, and some districts have seen or expect some 
  slowing in other consumer goods—appliances, jewelry, some types of 
  apparel—and in products auxiliary to production of new cars and 
  homes, like tires, glass, and furnishings. Capital goods producers 
  are enjoying vigorous demand, in general, but orders have slipped in 
  some product lines. Steel orders are down from a lofty peak and 
  other metals show signs of softening. There are conflicting reports 
  on the direction of activity in some industries: paper products, 
  heavy trucks, and chemicals. Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, 
  Minneapolis, and San Francisco depict industrial activity as 
  somewhat tighter than in other districts. By and large, producers 
  now expect further reductions in activity in the months ahead but 
  few seem worried by recent inventory accumulations; there were no 
  reports of radical changes in capital spending plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City report 
  rapid increases in industrial prices, particularly for petroleum 
  products or derivatives. Most expect more of the same, come rain or 
  come shine. Wheat, soybean, and other grain prices have advanced 
  sharply of late and livestock prices remain high, but an excellent 
  wheat harvest and favorable prospects for other crops should ease 
  food price pressures within the next few months. The combination of 
  strong prices and good production makes robust gains in farm income 
  probable this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except for layoffs by automakers, meat packers, and some tourist 
  businesses, labor markets still look pretty tight; Banks cite heavy 
  help-wanted advertising, vigorous recruitment efforts, and reported 
  shortages of some types of labor. Chicago indicates that recent wage 
  settlements have exceeded guidelines by a wide margin, but 
  Richmond's regular survey of manufacturers actually turned up fewer 
  instances of wage boosts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonresidential construction is advancing briskly in the Richmond, 
  Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts, and booming 
  on the West Coast. Home building, however, has continued downward 
  except in some rapidly growing Sunbelt areas. Substantial sales 
  declines and the prospect of a shift to a buyer's market were 
  mentioned by Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Virtually every district used the word "strong" to characterize loan 
  demand. Commercial and industrial borrowing, particularly short-
  term, has been especially heavy. Richmond and Kansas City suspect 
  that inflation (but not stockpiling) accounts for much of the 
  increase in inventory financing and/or constructions loans. Major 
  NYC banks are among the most optimistic about lending prospects; 
  they are joined by bankers in several other districts in their 
  forecast of no further increases in the prime rate. Requests for 
  consumer installment, mortgage, and real estate loans seem to be 
  tapering but apparently still exceed the volume that lenders are 
  willing or able to supply. Dallas reports an acceleration of deposit 
  growth but most other Banks view inflows as modest at best. Some 
  thrifts have been having problems as the drawing power of
  MMC's has waned. Recent increases in usury ceilings have freed 
  lendable funds in New Jersey and Tennessee, but New York State's new 
  mortgage cap, still below market rates, has had little impact. 
  Higher ceilings are scheduled to take effect soon in Texas and await 
  the governor's signature in Missouri.
