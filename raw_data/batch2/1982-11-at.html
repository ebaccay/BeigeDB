     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 16, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Autumn economic conditions in the Sixth District remain weak. Most 
sectors of the labor market continue to deteriorate. Consumer 
spending has risen only slightly, and the outlook for the Christmas 
season is mixed. Falling crop prices continue to augur lower farm 
income, but poultry prospects have improved. Tourism is still off in 
many areas, but EPCOT is generating widespread optimism. With 
sustained improvements in residential building and real estate, 
construction remains the brightest spot in the southeastern economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the Southeast 
remain grim. The District's September unemployment rate has returned 
to the April level of 9.9 percent, the highest rate of the current 
recession and the peak of the 1973-75 recession. Tennessee's 
unemployment benefits fund is reported near bankruptcy. However, 
media reports of sharply increased unemployment in Knoxville after 
the closing of the World's Fair seem exaggerated. The local Office 
of Employment Security expects only 1,500-2,000 of the Fair's 6,700 
employees to apply for unemployment benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonfarm employment is still declining. Even in "growth" sectors, 
including services, trade, finance, and transportation, job 
expansion is decelerating. Expressions of concern over the shutdown 
of the Woolco chain are widespread. Most retailers polled plan to 
increase hours of part-time employees rather than hire more workers 
for the Christmas season. Public sector employment, although still 
declining, is not falling as rapidly as earlier, but some of our 
contacts expect more reductions at the state level. Construction 
employment has yet to reflect lower mortgage rates. Anecdotes of 
applicants far outnumbering positions typically accompany reports of 
job openings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing shows virtually no evidence of a turnaround. The rate 
of year-to-year declines increased in September, and our directors 
and others report additional layoffs in October in chemicals, 
primary and fabricated metals, transportation equipment, and 
machinery, including computers and other electronics. The number of 
new manufacturing facilities over $0.5 million declined 40 percent 
through August compared to the first eight months of last year. 
Factory expansions were down over 45 percent. Contacts at state 
economic development agencies report that low utilization rates have 
prompted manufacturers to do only maintenance and efficiency 
construction and to shelve new construction plans until solid signs 
of recovery appear.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Taxable retail sales through September are 
slightly above last year in real terms in Florida, Tennessee, and 
Alabama but down in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Georgia. One new 
encouraging sign is the slight increase in sales of big-ticket home 
furnishings in certain areas. Purchases of men's apparel, cosmetics, 
auto supplies, and electronic games remain strong. District 
retailers report that consumers are still wary because of high 
unemployment. Although optimistic about the Christmas season, 
retailers continue to hold inventories taut. District auto sales are 
running far below depressed 1981 levels and behind those of the rest 
of the nation. Lower interest rates and new models have yet to spur 
sales in the Southeast. Reduced sales have resulted in a high rate 
of dealership attrition, particularly in rural areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most municipal and county governments 
contacted report that single- and multifamily building permits 
remain seasonally strong, but slower growth regions, especially 
blue-collar areas, still show little improvement. Realtors report 
more traffic and sales during October. The lower FHA rate has helped 
attract buyers outside high-income brackets. Still, since home 
buyers are making much use of seller financing, thrift officers find 
mortgage closings less strong than hoped. Housing industry spokesmen 
worry that lower mortgage rates may be the result of election 
engineering and thus only temporary. Realtors expect modest 
improvement in 1983 but only if mortgage rates drop further or 
stabilize. Despite improved housing sales, apartment occupancy rates 
remain high. The office and industrial building market is slow. 
Recession and high interest rates have substantially curtailed 
relocation and expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our survey of over 50 tourist industry representatives 
reveals little change in conditions since last month. Local and less 
expensive tourism appears to be holding steady or improving, whereas 
out-of-state and international tourism is down. Respondents state 
that fewer delegates are attending conventions in Georgia and 
Louisiana; international tourists in Florida are reportedly lodging 
with friends and relatives and spending less, thereby depressing 
hotel/motel occupancy rates, attendance at attractions, and retail 
sales, especially in South Florida. One bright spot is the October 1 
opening of EPCOT (Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow), 
which has already exceeded its own attendance projections and is 
expected by many to boost local tourism more than the Knoxville 
World's Fair, which closed on October 31. That exposition met its 
self-designated break-even point of 11 million visitors, but some of 
those polled dispute the profitability of its economic impact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Available evidence does not support the widespread 
pessimism and expectations of large-scale farm failures. Farm 
lenders suggest that a higher-than-normal liquidation rate is 
occurring, but the percentage of farmers affected is quite small and 
is likely to remain low. Interest rates are declining at farm 
lending institutions, providing some relief to farmers renewing 
loans. However, this decline will not affect farmers' cash flows 
until at least 1983 when loans become due.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for poultry, conditions in the livestock industry have 
changed little in recent weeks. Both egg and broiler prices have 
increased although egg prices remain 27 percent below year-ago 
levels. Lower feed costs and higher prices have improved the outlook 
for poultry farmers. Large supplies of corn and soybeans now being 
harvested continue to depress prices of these crops. Without high 
yields or low costs the prospect for breaking even on these two 
crops looks doubtful. Tobacco, sugarcane, and peanuts appear to 
offer the greatest opportunity for profit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Telephone interviews with District bankers indicate that 
many are making advance preparations for the new money market 
accounts to be authorized by the DIDC before mid-December. Bankers 
currently offering sweep accounts have a headstart because the 
mechanics of setting up the two accounts are the same. Although our 
contacts view the new money market account as necessary and 
desirable, they voiced two major concerns. First, they expect the 
new account to drive up the cost of funds and to put banks under 
greater pressure to price individual services. Second, banks' 
reporting and compliance burden could increase since the new account 
becomes reservable if the three non-preauthorized, third-party 
transactions limit is exceeded.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Panel of Economists
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our panel of economists believes that the Fed 
has eased monetary policy in recent months. Nearly all approve of 
this perceived change as a means of fueling recovery without 
reigniting inflation, although one urged a more straightforward 
acknowledgment by the Fed of its shift in policy. Our respondents 
detect much internal restructuring in lending activity since the 
drop in interest rates. Businesses are lengthening their debt 
maturity; builders are lining up construction loans; homeowners are 
refinancing mortgages. Other borrowing has not increased 
substantially. Most of those surveyed believe interest rates will 
continue to fall at least through Spring, 1983. Except for some 
improvement in construction, economists see no signs of incipient 
recovery in their states. There was no consensus regarding the 
timing and strength of recovery. A slight majority anticipates less 
than normal Christmas spending, but opinion varies widely on this 
issue.
