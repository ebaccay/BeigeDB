      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers are cutting production and employment in the Eleventh 
District. Inventories of oil field equipment are excessive and 
imbalances are expected to persist, although the number of active 
drilling rigs recently increased. Growth in business loans, which 
had been rapid, tapered off in May. Savings and loan associations 
report slower deposit outflows and increases in mortgage loan 
closings. The pace of commercial construction continues strong and 
housing starts are increasing. Department stores report moderate 
increases in sales, but sales at auto dealerships are down. Farm 
incomes remain depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Texas employment increased in May, but the number unemployed 
continues to rise because of layoffs in transportation equipment, 
and energy-related manufacturing and in mining. Job losses in these 
industries are partially offset by employment gains in 
nonmanufacturing industries, particularly services. The number of 
inquiries from other states concerning employment possibilities is 
down from recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The layoffs in mining reflect low drilling rates that have 
characterized the oil and gas industry for several months. But the 
number of drilling rigs operating in Texas increased slightly at the 
beginning of June, the first uptick since last year. Industry 
sources say that more time is needed to establish a trend. If 
drilling does increase, it is not expected to rise rapidly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Faced with low sales and excessive inventories, District 
manufacturers are cutting output. Producers whose chief market is 
the petroleum industry have made particularly large cutbacks. Some 
of these firms anticipate that their inventory problems will last 
all year. Suppliers of commercial transportation equipment are also 
reducing production. Output of petrochemicals, apparel, and 
commercial electronics remains low. Petroleum refineries report 
rising production and capacity utilization. Firms that produce 
electronics for defense have large order backlogs but report a 
decline in the pace of new orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial bank loans to businesses increased at a slower pace in 
May than in April, but the cumulative rise in loans this year to 
date is twice the average increase in the past five years. Loans 
increased for mining, services, petroleum refining, apparel 
manufacturing, and commodity dealers. The increases in loans to 
apparel manufacturers and commodity wholesalers were unseasonably 
large. Respondents at commercial banks attribute the rise in loans 
for mining to the takeout of previously committed funds by drilling 
companies responding to rises in gasoline prices. Loans to all other 
industries declined in May. The largest percentage decreases were 
for loans for construction and chemical manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposits at commercial banks increased faster in May than in April. 
The cumulative rise in deposits this year is more than twice that of 
the past five years. A rise in time deposits more than offset a 
continued runoff in demand deposits and a fall in savings deposits 
in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of decline in deposits at savings and loan associations has 
slowed since April. Mortgage loan closings are up moderately but 
remain below last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of commercial construction continues at a high level, and 
there are sufficient projects underway to sustain this pace for some 
time. But the cumulative square footage of new, additions, and major 
alteration projects for this year is well below last year's 
cumulative total, and the number of announcements of new projects is 
declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing  starts are up strongly from April, but remain 14 percent 
below year-ago levels. Builders describe the current level of 
activity in some areas as a "profitless boom" because they are 
providing reduced interest rates and other incentives to buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Department stores report moderate increases in sales from year-ago 
levels. Because of the unusual number of layoffs in Texas, they 
expect the pace of sales to change little this summer. Apparel sales 
are holding up well, but sales of home furnishings and appliances 
are slow. Inventories are trim, and price discounting and promotions 
proceed at seasonally normal levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car dealers report that sales declined after General Motors' low 
interest rate finance program ended in May. Foreign car dealers said 
that this program stimulated comparison shopping at their stores. 
The last of this year's models will soon be delivered, and dealers 
expect inventories to be sufficient for a moderate pace of sales 
this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm incomes remain low, in spite of rises in livestock profit 
margins. Prices for feed grains are 23 percent below year-ago 
levels, and heavy rains in May will further cut net revenues as 
farmers replant or absorb crop losses. Cattle prices are up as 
ranchers have cut back on the quantity of beef supplied to market.
