      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District are mixed in December. Activity 
in the industrial sector declined fractionally from November levels 
and manufacturing prices reflect that slump. Retailers say spending 
has risen slightly since the last Redbook but Christmas sales are 
still slow. Loan activity is mixed at area banks, but deposit flows 
are healthy. Most Third District business contacts are projecting 
some improvement in economic conditions over the next six months. 
Manufacturing executives are looking for increased activity by June 
but remain cautious nonetheless. Department store sales are expected 
to show modest gains, although the 1982 holiday season will be below 
average. Bankers are forecasting some gains for commercial and 
consumer lending in the first half of 1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturing activity has resumed its downward slide 
in December, according to respondents to the most recent Business 
Outlook Survey. Specifically, shipments are down at over one-third 
of area plants and new orders fared only slightly better. Although 
there has been further tightening of industrial stock levels 
recently, there are some signs that inventory run-down has abated 
somewhat. Setbacks for labor, on the other hand, continue with no 
apparent moderation. Reports of reduced payrolls and shortened 
working hours are as prevalent now as they were in November.
     </p>
     <p>
      Survey participants remain optimistic in their projections of 
industrial recovery over the next six months. Local manufacturers' 
outlooks have, in fact, brightened a little in December, in spite of 
the continuing slump. Respondents are expecting a strong push in new 
orders that will rebuild backlogs and allow employers to expand both 
payrolls and the average workweek by June. Fractional additions to 
inventories are forecast, as well. There are few plans for increases 
in plant and equipment expenditures, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices also show further softening in December. Prices of 
finished goods have been cut again and input costs have not changed 
from their November levels. Prices are expected to start climbing 
again between now and June, coincident with the projected rebound in 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      December sales at Third District department stores are building 
slowly as the holiday buying season ends its second week, but area 
sales volume is still fairly soft overall, according to retail 
contacts. Current dollar sales are ranging only 3 percent to 4 
percent ahead of last year; real gains are slim at best. Sales of 
Christmas related items, while pretty much in line with merchants' 
expectations, are considerably below past holiday experiences. Ten 
days of unseasonably warm weather following Thanksgiving put a 
damper on holiday shopping spirit and thus kept the lid on spending. 
In addition, local store officials say the Philadelphia retail 
market has become exceptionally tough over the last two years as 
economic conditions deteriorated. Seasonal sales are heavily 
dependent on promotions and price discounting, often at the expense 
of full price sales. As a result, merchants are starting their big 
holiday pushes earlier and more forcefully. Recently, one local 
retailer extended an 18-hour "one-day-only" sale to three days in an 
effort to encourage spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers predict that sales growth will remain slow but steady 
throughout the holiday season. Contacts believe that shoppers are 
watching their dollars closely though, and that the usual late 
season surge may be relatively minor. An extra shopping day on the 
retail calendar this year will help a little, but sales gains for 
the season and the year as a whole should remain in the 3 percent to 
4 percent range. Projections for 1983 show more of the same for 
retail sales. Next June's current dollar sales volume will be 4 
percent to 6 percent ahead on a year-over-year basis, according to 
merchants' forecasts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pickup in sales, though small, has helped bring inventories more 
in line. Stock levels are lean but generally in "good shape" and 
comparable to levels of a year ago. Industry representatives say 
they will keep stocks in check until the sales outlook improves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District banking contacts report mixed loan activity in 
December. Commercial loan demand, as expected, has softened even 
more since the last Redbook. Chiefly responsible is the move toward 
the corporate bond market. Distress borrowing has faded somewhat, as 
well. As a result, overall C&amp;I loan volume is now running only 
barely above last December. On the other hand, lower interest rates 
have made retail loans more attractive. Activity in consumer loans 
has increased since November, but, for the most part, volume still 
trails year-ago levels. One contact noted that some consumer loan 
dollars were being diverted away from automobile loans to new 
leasing arrangements because customers have been unwilling to make
large auto downpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasts of loan activity over the next six months are mixed but 
point to some improvement. Bankers agree that further retail loan 
growth is likely, especially if rates drop further. Projections for 
commercial lending range from flat activity, if economic recovery 
stalls, to a modest upswing if business conditions improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers are quoting a prime rate of 11.50 percent, 
down from 12 percent a month ago. The slide in the prime has slowed 
recently and caused many local seers to revise their outlooks for 
interest rates. A trough for the prime of around 11 percent is 
forecast for early 1983 and any movement in the next six months is 
likely to be "slow and modest."
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows are very strong again this month. Demand deposits have 
improved since November and are now running 3 percent to 4 percent 
ahead of a year ago. Time deposits gained strength as well, with 
unexpectedly robust growth in the 7 to 31-day time deposits leading 
the way. One reason cited for this burst of activity is that dollars 
intended for the new money market deposit accounts are being held in 
the 7 to 31-day accounts temporarily, until MMDAs are offered on 
December 14th. Bankers have high hopes for the MMDA, and expect to 
attract a significant amount of deposits away from the money market 
funds.
