      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Officials and economists in the Fourth District have expected a 
  surge in income, production and sales this quarter, but recent high 
  rates of inflation have raised uncertainty over continued expansion 
  for another year. Auto producers and suppliers anticipate some letup 
  in sales from recent high rates, and retailers see little prospect 
  for improvement in sales of nondurable goods. Steel production is 
  expected to rise to about 90 percent of capacity this quarter; coal 
  production has rebounded virtually to capacity. Mortgage loan demand 
  continues strong, and mortgage rates have firmed in response to weak 
  growth in deposits.
       </p>
       <p>
        A vigorous recovery in output is widely expected this quarter, with 
  some economists forecasting real GNP gains as high as a 9 percent 
  annual rate. Even at this higher rate, however, real GNP for the 
  first half would fall short of expectations held earlier this year. 
  One frequently cited reason for this anticipated shortfall is a 
  higher than expected rate of inflation. Some economists believe the 
  sharpness of the recovery is conducive to price increases in those 
  industries that have not been able to raise prices because of 
  relatively weak markets. Also mentioned as an additional factor in 
  inflation is the increasing use of marginal labor that has added to 
  costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recent sharp pickup in consumer spending has not been uniform. 
  While auto sales surged, consumer spending for nondurable goods has 
  been relatively flat. The March-April surge in new car sales is 
  explained as a make-up from the poor economy and severe winter 
  weather. Although pleased by the comeback in sales, economists with 
  major auto suppliers expect some letup from the recent 12 million 
  annual rate to about 10.8 million units for the year. An economist 
  with a major producer expects that sales this quarter will range 
  between 11.4 to 11.7 million units (2.0 million imports) and average 
  at least 11.1 million sales for the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strength in auto sales has not been matched by increased sales for 
  some other types of consumer goods. An economist with a national 
  retail chain states that despite recent impressive gains, sales 
  increases only equaled their earlier expectations for an 8 percent 
  year-over-year gain for the February-April period. There was little 
  recouping of earlier sales losses. Apparel and soft goods sales have 
  been sluggish for the past several months and inventories are more 
  than ample. In his view, retailers face a sharp reduction in profits 
  for the next few quarters with general merchandise sales increases 
  of about 3.5 percent in real terms from the fourth quarter of 1977 
  to fourth quarter of 1978. Similarly, retail sales of personal care 
  products and packaged foods have shown little if any gain in real
  terms compared with a year earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel industry economists expect production to increase to about 90 
  percent of effective capacity this quarter from last quarter's 80 
  percent rate. Order cutbacks are not evident yet, but one economist 
  expects a usual seasonal slump in orders and production next quarter 
  as steel consumers realize that inventories are ample and supplies 
  are readily available. Imports last quarter were at a record high 
  level for that quarter, and it is unlikely that the full impact of 
  trigger pricing of steel will be felt until the third quarter, 
  according to one steel economist. Profits are expected to improve 
  sharply this quarter following another weak performance last 
  quarter. Still, higher profits will not result in increased capital 
  spending.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coal production is rebounding rapidly from the strike. Output 
  recently has been boosted to more than 15 million tons weekly, 
  compared with a low of 5 million tons during the strike. An 
  economist with a major coal producer expects production will soon 
  reach pre-strike levels of 16 million tons weekly and may rise to 17 
  million tons by yearend. Coal stocks at the end of April were at a 
  67-day supply but should be much higher to meet seasonal demand in 
  July and August. Consequently, a shortfall in stocks would concern 
  utilities which may be forced to purchase coal at higher prices in 
  the spot market.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods producers are growing more confident over prospects 
  for 1978 and early 1979 than they were at any time in this 
  expansion. Expectation of at least a 7.5 percent real gain seems 
  common. Orders for electrical equipment, communication and printing 
  equipment have been rising more rapidly than shipments for the past 
  several months, although the rate of increase in new orders has not 
  accelerated. Machine tool orders revived strongly and set new highs 
  last quarter, according to machine tool builders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgage terms continue to firm in response to softness in deposit 
  flows and strong level of demand. S&amp;Ls raised rates at the beginning 
  of May by 1/4 percent to 91/2 percent for an 80 percent loan, and 
  some are charging 101/4 percent for a 95 percent loan. Some 
  associations no longer are making 95 percent loans and also are 
  cutting back lending in national markets. While a number of 
  officials state it is too early to determine whether double-digit 
  mortgage rates will curtail demand, some feel prospective homeowners 
  are willing to pay high rates because of inflationary expectations. 
  Deposit flows continue to fall short of projections, but some S&amp;Ls 
  have been aggressively attracting deposits by raising interest rates 
  to maximum levels on all types of deposit accounts. A major S&amp;L
  reported that deposit flows in April exceeded their projection and 
  so far in May deposits have equaled projections. S&amp;Ls have hesitated 
  to issue mortgage-backed securities because of the high costs 
  relative to lending rates in this region.
