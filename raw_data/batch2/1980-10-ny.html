      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 14, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Second District continued weak in 
September. Although retail sales were uneven for the month, some 
strengthening is anticipated in the coming months. Automobile 
purchases remained slow. The outlook for car sales is very uncertain 
because of rising interest rates and recent price hikes for domestic 
models. Outside the consumer sector, some increase in demand has 
been reported for machine-tool makers and is also expected for 
chemicals. The respondents, for the most part, do not expect any 
major economic recovery until the latter half of 1981. On the 
financial side, reports indicate that lending terms for automobile 
purchases remained unchanged during September. In the housing 
market, however, credit conditions have tightened considerably.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in the Second District was generally erratic 
during September. Sales for the month as a whole, both in New York 
City and nearby suburbs, were about in line with retailers' 
expectations. In contrast, retail sales upstate were somewhat 
stronger than expected. Throughout the District, inventories were 
generally satisfactory since most retailers have stressed the 
importance of following conservative policies. Credit sales appear 
to be running at about the same volume as last year. Retailers are 
generally optimistic that sales will strengthen as the Christmas 
season approaches.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales in the Second District were also mixed in 
September. Foreign car sales appeared better than in the comparable 
month last year, while domestic car sales were reported to have 
"declined drastically" since the beginning of the month. Used car 
sales also appeared to be depressed. The October 1 price increases 
combined with the high financing costs were cited as likely to hurt 
sales in upcoming months. Although the report from a major 
automobile manufacturer suggests a very sharp increase in sales by 
the third quarter of 1981, the present outlook is described as 
"nervous". Particular concern was raised over sales of leftover 1980 
models and of the 1981 models which are not in the new fuel-efficient lines. At the same time, however, it is believed that 
energy considerations are fading in consumers' minds. Both 
manufacturers and dealers are deeply concerned over the effects of 
rising interest rates on the costs of financing 1981 inventories. 
Some dealers are considering trimming their inventories again, 
although they fear the reduced selection of cars for potential 
buyers could hurt sales in future months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Manufacturing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Outside the consumer sector, a few signs of improvement are 
beginning to appear. Some machine tool-makers are reporting 
strengthening sales. Inventories in this industry are very lean and 
could result in slow deliveries if a large increase in demand 
occurs. Some pick-up in orders for chemicals is expected in the next 
month. Similarly, an increase in steel production is anticipated in 
1981 (although not enough to reverse the decline experienced in 
1980) in association with an expected rise in auto sales. In 
contrast, demand for construction materials has weakened and a major 
manufacturer of sewing machines is phasing out local production, 
idling 850 workers by the end of the year. Inventories in the oil
industry remain high and there are no plans for further additions to 
stocks. Elsewhere in the manufacturing sector, there has been 
further inventory liquidation reflecting continued uncertainties at 
the retail level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic outlook of most District respondents was rather 
bearish. Although retailers anticipate a strong Christmas season, 
other respondents expect consumer spending to remain weak at least 
through the remainder of this year. The principal reasons are high 
food and fuel prices and rising interest rates. The recent upturn in 
housing starts was widely viewed as temporary, and the rise in 
mortgage rates was expected to produce a downturn relatively soon. 
Respondents were divided in their outlook on auto sales. No one 
outside of auto manufacturing, however, expects a sharp increase in 
total car sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On the financial side, commercial banks in the Second District 
report no change in either lending terms or credit standards for 
automobile loans during the month of September. In the mortgage 
market, however, conditions have tightened appreciably. Commitment 
and application activity in September are reported to be 
significantly down from August levels. A number of lenders have been 
offering renegotiable rate mortgages (RRMs) or variable rate 
mortgages (VRMs) in addition to conventional instruments, and some 
institutions have even shifted to an exclusive RRM-VRM policy. 
Mortgage rates have increased by about 1 percentage point since 
early September. At present, the rate on new conventional mortgage 
commitments ranges from 13 1/2 percent plus 2 points to 14 1/4 
percent plus 3 points. Commitment rates of RRMs and VRMs are lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty 
Trust Company), Francis Schott (Equitable Life Assurance Society), 
and Albert Wojnilower (First Boston). Their views of course are 
personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: While wide swings in both interest rates and money supply 
figures should be viewed as normal for periods of high and volatile 
inflation, they were exaggerated this year by the imposition and 
subsequent withdrawal of the Credit Control Program. It is essential 
to the Fed's credibility and to curtailing inflationary expectations 
that the Fed hit its annual money supply targets. I see some 
tentative early signs that the move upward in rates may be having 
some effect on inflationary expectations: in commodity prices 
plateauing, stability and strength of the dollar, and better 
performance of the bond market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: The recent interest rate run-up is closely related to market 
perceptions of the deteriorating fiscal 1981 Federal budget picture. 
Precautionary business borrowing—short-term and long-term—is also 
again a factor. By standing firm now, the Federal Reserve may be 
able to nip in the bud the potential need for another crunch. The 
market may then realize that renewed rapid economic expansion is not 
actually in the cards.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: The tone of asset markets has become more strongly 
bullish. Now bond prices have joined, triggered mainly by reports 
that Chairman Volcker had asserted the market had overanticipated 
the rise in money rates. If Ml does not erupt again, concerns as to 
housing weakness and "double-dip" are apt to recede. My own forecast 
remains for a relatively robust business upturn with some tendency 
for inflation to reaccelerate.
