      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 11, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Fifth District remains spotty but does not 
show any clearly defined trends, either generally or within 
industries. Manufacturers' new orders continued to weaken slightly 
over the past month and order backlogs were further reduced, but 
shipments were somewhat higher and inventories were generally larger 
than in January. Still, fewer than a third of our respondents find 
current stocks excessive. Retail sales seem to have advanced in the 
past month despite some softening in big ticket lines. Inventories 
at the retail level are essentially unchanged and are generally in 
line with desired levels. It appears that aggregate credit demand in 
the District is holding steady, but its composition is changing. 
Business loan demand is now the primary source of overall strength. 
Installment loan demand is sagging while mortgage lending practices 
have tightened considerably. Recent snowstorms inflicted substantial 
and lasting damage on poultry producing operations in parts of the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the manufacturing sector new orders remain soft and order 
backlogs continue to be worked down; on the other hand, both 
shipments and inventories were up somewhat in the past month. 
Despite the rise in stocks on hand, particularly in finished goods, 
there was virtually no change in inventories relative to desired 
levels. Employment and the length of the workweek held essentially 
stable over the month. An overwhelming majority of manufacturers 
remain satisfied with current plant and equipment capacity and with 
current expansion plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent softness in new orders does not appear to be concentrated 
in any particular area or industry. Industries such as building 
materials, paper products, and electrical equipment have shown 
perhaps the least strength in recent weeks. Textile firms report 
basically stable orders, while some strength has appeared in the 
furniture group.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales continue firm across the District. General merchandise 
sales are providing much of this overall strength. Big ticket items 
have weakened, at least in relative terms. Inventories held by 
retailers were level, on balance, over the month, but apparently 
declined relative to desired levels. Most retail respondents are 
comfortable with current stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases remain pervasive and there is little evidence in our 
survey responses of any easing in this area. A large majority of our 
directors anticipate price increases, as measured by the CPI, to be 
at least as great in 1980 as in 1979. Expectations generally are 
less uniform than in recent months. District manufacturers, on 
balance, remain deeply pessimistic, although less so than in recent 
months. Most continue to expect a decline in national business 
activity over the next six months, but the number expecting declines 
in their respective firms and market areas is somewhat lower than a 
month ago. Retailers, on balance, expect little change in the level 
of activity over the next six months. Although our survey responses 
suggest that most firms are comfortable with current expansion 
plans, most of our directors foresee many firms canceling or 
delaying previously approved investment projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite sharp increases in the prime lending rate, business loan 
growth at large Fifth District banks has been strong recently. 
Factors contributing to this strength in commercial and industrial 
loans have been a demand for short-term bank loans for interim 
financing until long-term bond rates drop and demand for tax-free 
industrial revenue financing. Business loan growth would be even 
stronger if it were not for some prime rate loans having been paid 
early as borrowers shift to the commercial paper market as a source 
of funds. Area banks have become much less willing to make fixed-
rate loans of any maturity, and loans for speculative purposes are 
being discouraged. The demand for and use of loan commitments has 
not changed to any great degree. Moreover, the consensus among 
District bankers seems to be that over the near-term business loan 
demand will continue about as is or possibly weaken moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the past few weeks personal loans made by large banks have shown 
almost no growth. This appears to be due to slackening demand rather 
than limited supply. By and large, District banks remain active in 
the retail credit area. A number of reports have indicated that 
credit unions, however, are short of loanable funds. Installment 
loan rates are up sharply since the most recent discount rate 
increases and indications are that the increased cost of credit is 
discouraging consumer borrowing. The rate on home mortgages is also 
up sharply for those potential borrowers who can find funds. Our 
recent survey of lending practices at large banks shows half of the 
respondents less willing to make single-family mortgage loans. Two-
thirds are now less willing to lend funds for multi-family 
properties. Thrift institutions are much less active in the mortgage 
market, and our directors report that funds availability is tight 
around the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent winter storms resulted in severe losses to poultry producers 
in parts of the District, particularly eastern North Carolina. In 
one county more than 100 poultry raising operations were destroyed. 
Stock losses in that area may amount to one-half million broilers 
and 200,000 turkeys.
