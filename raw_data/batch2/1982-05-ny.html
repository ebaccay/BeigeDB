      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District remained lackluster during 
April. Major retailers reported that consumer spending was weaker 
than expected. New residential construction continued to languish 
although some brokers noted a few signs of modest improvement. 
Nonresidential building was still brisk but there was softening in 
the office rental market. Widespread layoffs were noted in the 
manufacturing sector. Except for the defense industry, few firms 
experienced any increase in new orders. While the region's 
unemployment rate remained below the nation's, business leaders 
expressed growing concern that the recession would spread to more 
sectors of the region's economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity in the Second District was weak during April, as 
most department stores failed to meet plans which had been 
considered to be conservative. Business appears to be getting 
tougher for many retailers. One symptom is the increasingly 
widespread use of markdowns and promotional activity; another 
symptom is the greater difficulty we have had in getting retailers 
to return our phone calls. One retailer who works for a department 
store in New York City which caters to a well-to-do clientele told 
us that this was the "most difficult period in his memory." While 
apparel, housewares, and other nondurable goods were reportedly 
doing all right, such things as sporting goods, horticultural items, 
and big-ticket products were selling poorly. Despite lagging sales,
inventories at most stores were at acceptable levels. Retailers—perennial optimists that they are—remain hopeful about their 
prospects for the second half of the year, expecting their sales to 
improve in response to the July tax cut.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction remained depressed, but there were a few 
signs of modest improvement in the housing market. In New York City, 
a broker reported that sales of existing homes in Queens increased 
markedly; he attributed the gains to wider acceptance of high but 
renegotiable interest rates. In Manhattan, a continued influx of 
very wealthy buyers, frequently paying cash, maintained high demand 
for luxury cooperative apartments. In suburban areas, a better 
understanding of "buy downs" was helping to bolster sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity remained strong with work 
continuing on many new office buildings. At the same time, however, 
the rental market for office space has softened throughout the 
District, perhaps foreshadowing a future fall-off in new 
construction projects. In New York City, for example, landlords 
granted more concessions to prospective tenants, including slower 
escalation of rents and more structural improvements. Space 
available for subleasing rose significantly as firms which had been 
holding the space deferred expansion plans. One just-completed 
building had been entirely pre-leased a year ago, but almost a third 
of its space was again available. Outside of New York City, rents 
also stabilized, and in western Connecticut, leasing during the 
first quarter was the lowest in five years. Respondents believed, 
however, that the slowdown was only temporary.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District continues to weather the recession relatively well, 
with the region's unemployment rate holding steady in April at a 
level below the nation's. The manufacturing sector, however, has 
been deeply affected by the recession. Layoffs were widespread with 
only scattered recalls. Except for the defense industry, few firms 
reported any pickup in orders. Indeed, capital goods producers in 
western New York experienced further cancellations. A producer of 
traffic and airport lights shortened its workweek apparently because 
cuts in state and local spending dampened public sector demand. A 
list of new capital projects compiled by the New York State 
Department of Commerce indicated that fewer major projects are being 
undertaken this year than last.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As we found last month, few respondents outside of retailing expect 
a general economic recovery to begin soon. Most expressed growing 
concern that the recession would spread to more sectors of the 
region's economy, including business services. The gloomiest 
assessment came from a business leader in western New York who did 
not foresee any turnaround there for another two years. Many 
observers were disturbed by talk of further bankruptcies in the 
manufacturing sector if conditions did not improve soon. Almost all 
respondents believed that a fall in interest rates was essential for 
a recovery. However, one Port Authority official did point to a
recent increase in piggyback rail traffic as a possible sign of an 
incipient upturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the price outlook, there was little feel for whether the 
recent price slowdown was cyclical or permanent. A number of 
respondents echoed the sentiment that, "We'd prefer to go back to 
the good old days when the economy was expanding even if that meant 
higher inflation." Wage settlements are now lower than a year ago; 
for example, central New York firms are projecting overall increases 
1 1/2 percentage points below last year's average of 9 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty 
Trust Co.), Francis Schott (Equitable Life Assurance Society) and 
Alfred Wojnilower (First Boston Corp.): Their views of course are 
personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: The Fed should begin to modify its monetarist approach 
because of the poor correlation between Ml as currently defined and 
nominal growth in the economy. An acceptable range of "real" 
interest rates should be developed as a policy guide in addition to 
monetary targets. Federal Reserve credibility would not suffer from 
this adjustment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: Institutional cash flow remains severely constrained by high 
interest rates. Improvement in Federal budget prospects is 
essential, although a modest decline in rates is widely anticipated 
anyway because of the recession and favorable inflation figures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Federal Reserve policy continues to be appropriate. Despite much 
carping over the level of interest rates and over technical points 
of monetary policy, responsible executives see no credible 
alternative to moderate restraint on the aggregates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: The contraction in business activity appears to be near 
a bottom. Capital spending is being cut sharply but the decline in 
other final demand has probably ended.
     </p>
     <p>
      Far too much is being made of the near term impact of the Budget on 
interest rates. The behavior of longer term interest rates over the 
next few months will be mainly governed by perceptions of the 
business outlook. It is unlikely that these perceptions will be 
significantly influenced by the Budget debate.
