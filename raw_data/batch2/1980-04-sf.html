      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 15, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Signs of more cautious approaches to buying, borrowing, lending and 
future planning are beginning to appear in the Twelfth District's 
economy. In the face of slumping retail sales elsewhere, consumer 
buying has remained firm to brisk in much of the West, with strong 
buying reported in Southern California and in the urban areas of 
Utah, Idaho and the Pacific Northwest. Countering this is a 
depressed home-construction and real-estate sector which has 
crippled the lumber and plywood industry in the Northwest—triggering mill closures, production cutbacks and rising 
unemployment. Banking and financial institutions generally are 
adjusting well to tighter limits on loan expansion, while noting 
that many consumers are adopting self-imposed credit restraints. 
Rising financing costs are crimping future plans of farmers and 
cattlemen, but good late-winter weather (except in rain-deluged 
Southern California) provided ideal planting and range conditions 
this spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in Southern California during February and March ran 
approximately 14-15 percent ahead of year-ago figures. In most other 
areas of the District, consumer buying fell below the annual rate of 
inflation, and further slowdowns are expected in coming months. 
Still, Southern California retailers noted some softness in sales of 
selected consumer durables, while Utah stores noted very good sales 
of big-ticket items such as electric ranges, dishwashers, dryers and 
home freezers. Meanwhile in Oregon, retail sales were labeled 
"disappointingly flat," and a major Oregon retailer restrained 
inventory accumulation and halted expansion plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Domino" effects of an ailing construction industry are being seen 
in rising unemployment, falling heavy-equipment sales and rising 
bankruptcies.
     </p>
     <p>
      But the District's diversified economy appears able to ward off a 
major recession. Bright spots in the area's business activity 
include: aircraft manufacturing and port business in the Puget Sound 
area, ski-resort business throughout the Mountain West, commercial 
and industrial construction in Southern California and the Pacific 
Northwest, and selected exports such as wood products, metals, and 
electronic components.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following a nationwide pattern, reporting directors called 
residential construction "a wet blanket" in Southern California, a 
"disaster" in the Pacific Northwest, and "practically nil" in the 
Intermountain area of Utah and Idaho. Among the casualties were 
fast-food outlets, which cut back considerably on expansion plans in 
Southern California. The falloff in housing starts even reached 
Alaska, despite stimulus to home-buying from a state lending program 
for owner-occupants. Housing starts in Oregon fell to their lowest 
level since World War II, and analysts predicted a 40-to-60 percent 
decline in residential construction this year in Utah, Idaho, Oregon 
and Washington.
     </p>
     <p>
      One third of Oregon's industrial base is concentrated in lumber and 
wood products, so the current downturn is placing heavy stresses on 
the state's economy. The American Plywood Association reports 18 
plywood mills closed and 16 with curtailed production in Oregon at 
the end of March. Also, about one-third of Washington's plywood work 
force has been idled. Spokesmen for lumber trade associations 
maintain the current slump is at least as bad as that of 1974-75. In 
Idaho, recent layoffs of more than 400 workers by Boise Cascade and 
the Van Camp Packing Company have triggered a 29-percent 
unemployment rate in several small towns.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports are mixed from the region's agricultural sector. In 
California's Central Valley, the fruit crop was "extremely good" in 
the southern end around Bakersfield but only "average" around 
Fresno. The Florida freeze has pushed up the price of California 
citrus. As a result of wet weather in Southern California, prices 
are expected to be up on almonds, green onions, avocados and citrus 
fruits. In that area's Coachella Valley, the carrot crop was 
reported ruined, but cotton production was relatively unaffected and 
cotton prices remained high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Higher energy and financing costs continue to plague agriculture in 
the Northwest. But decent weather and ground moisture during the 
spring planting season will aid production of hay, vegetable and 
seed crops in the area. In the Intermountain region, farmers 
withholding their wheat and corn from markets until they can obtain 
higher prices are experiencing storage problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farmers throughout the District are suffering from financing 
problems. Noted one observer: "They are having difficulty living 
within the present cost of money, which is their principal operating 
cost." To overcome this problem, many farmers are scaling down their 
loan requests to a bare minimum, foregoing major equipment purchases 
and repairing worn and broken equipment to last another year or 
more. Despite rising farm costs, employment in California's farm-rich San Joaquin Valley increased 2 1/2 percent in January and 
February following a 2-percent overall rise during 1979.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the banking and financial sector, loan demand appeared to be 
cooling in several areas. An Anchorage bank stopped issuing new 
credit cards, and reported a 16-percent decline in its consumer-loan 
portfolio over the past 18 months. The largest banking organization 
in the Mountain West announced that it is charging $20 a year for 
the use of its Visa credit card, with interest on those accounts 
starting to accumulate the day of purchase rather than 30 days after 
the billing date. "Consumers appear to be rationing themselves in 
the credit sector," said one Washington banker. Lack of loan 
business has forced some financial institutions in Southern 
California, Utah and Idaho to trim their staff and budgets.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to a Federal Reserve survey, bankers generally reported 
that total loan expansion at commercial banks this year could be 
limited to the 6-to-9 percent range recommended in the Fed's special 
credit-restraint guidelines. Several banks reported that real estate 
and installment loans have already been curtailed by high costs and, 
in some instances, usury law limits. To remain within the loan-
increase guidelines, some lenders are curtailing non-productive 
loans for business expansion, speculative purposes and unsecured 
personal borrowing. One banker had this to say: "We expect the 
curtailment to be borrower-imposed across the board. Businessmen are 
borrowing less to carry inventories, contractors (other than home 
builders) are curtailing the amount of work they are taking on to 
avoid borrowing in the 20-percent plus range, and mortgage demand at 
current rates is virtually nil."
