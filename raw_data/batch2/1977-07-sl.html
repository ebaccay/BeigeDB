      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 13, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eighth District economy continues to expand., but at less than 
the rate of gain achieved earlier this year. Consumer spending 
continues to rise in most areas of the District. Manufacturing 
activity, after large gains from February through May, appears to 
have leveled off somewhat. Home construction remains at a high 
level, but home sales have declined in recent weeks. Agricultural 
conditions are generally good. Inventories generally remain at a low 
level. Business loan demand remains relatively low at large banks, 
but loan demand at smaller banks is strong.
      <p>
       Consumer spending in June, as measured by retail sales, was about 10 
  per cent above the dollar level of a year ago, or about 4 per cent 
  above a year ago in real terms. One retailer noted that the 
  strongest selling items were weather-related goods, such as air 
  conditioners, fans, and watering equipment. Automobile sales are 
  still strong, but have apparently remained level in the past 2 or 3 
  months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rate of increase in manufacturing activity apparently slowed in 
  June and early July after sizable gains earlier this year. A 
  representative of a major chemical firm notes a relatively high 
  level of incoming orders, but finds little change from a month ago. 
  Some weakness was reported in a few items such as plastics. A 
  boxboard manufacturer reported strong sales gains in March through 
  May, but a leveling off in June. Firms producing consumer products, 
  including apparel, shoes, and appliances, also noted little change 
  in orders in the past 2 months. Steel shipments were reported to be 
  strong in the second quarter, but are expected to decline more than 
  seasonally in the third quarter and pick up in the fourth quarter. 
  Defense-related manufacturing is generally at a high level and 
  continuing to gain strength as real defense spending increases. A 
  representative of a paint and coatings firm reports good sales and 
  profit gains in recent months. On the other hand, a manufacturer of 
  telecommunications equipment has experienced weak demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Home construction remains one of the strongest sectors in the 
  District. The value of newly constructed single-family dwellings in 
  the St. Louis area is more than double that of a year ago. During 
  the spring, sales outpaced construction; however, builders report 
  that sales have declined in recent weeks. Single-family homes have 
  been the strongest part of the housing market, but apartment 
  construction has made gains. Much of the recent gain in the 
  apartments, however, involves projects with Government financing. A 
  construction representative noted that further increases in rents—will be necessary before a substantial boost in privately financed 
  apartments can be expected. Rent increases in the St. Louis area 
  over the past 5 years have been small relative to increases in other 
  major cities. Currently, apartment dwellings in St. Louis are 
  virtually at full occupancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "shortage" of skilled workmen in the home building industry 
  continues in the St. Louis region. Workers are now coming from out 
  of town and the number of apprentices is increasing. Builders also 
  report delays in procurement of certain building materials. For 
  example, the delivery time for bath tubs and a number of other 
  plumbing items has increased from 7 to as much as 30 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent rains have greatly improved crop production prospects over 
  most of the District, although a few areas continue to report 
  drought conditions. Cotton is reported to be in the blooming stage 
  and is generally in excellent condition. About 20 per cent of the 
  cotton crop is reported to be sold forward. Soybean plantings were 
  delayed in several areas and this crop is somewhat behind schedule. 
  The corn and tobacco crops are reported to be in excellent condition 
  in most areas of the District. The recent rains have caused a 
  slowing in cattle sales in the District as the pasture and hay crops 
  have improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both manufacturers and retailers report that inventories are being 
  maintained at very low levels. Retailers have been especially 
  cautious about the buildup of inventories during the current 
  expansion. A representative of a major steel company reported that 
  both steel manufacturers and steel fabricators were carrying a month 
  less than the normal supply of inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Representatives of the larger banks in the District continue to 
  report sluggish demand for business loans. However, some expect such 
  demand to gradually rise over the second half of the year as 
  business inventories are increased. Loan demand at smaller banks is 
  generally strong, reflecting rising demand for consumer, real 
  estate, agricultural, and small business loans. Bankers are 
  generally expecting a modest rise in interest rates of 50 to 75 
  basis points for short-term paper and 25 to 50 basis points for 
  long-term by the end of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Savings and loan associations report rising demand for mortgages, 
  reflecting the high demand for new and older homes. On the supply 
  side, however, these institutions have had sizable increases in net 
  savings in recent weeks, particularly since mid-June. One savings 
  and loan association, offering maximum interest rates, reported that 
  some funds are now being received through brokers on the East coast 
  where rates are below maximum levels. Mortgage interest rates have 
  generally remained unchanged over the past month.
