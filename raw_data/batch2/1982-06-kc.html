      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions in the Tenth District appear to be 
firming somewhat, and attitudes about the future appear to be 
slightly more optimistic. Retail sales gains have been stronger 
recently, and are expected to improve further in the months ahead. 
Inventories are well under control, with the possibility of some 
additions to retail stocks in the third quarter. Input prices are 
generally stable. Housing activity continues to be weak, as are 
savings inflows to thrift institutions. If excessive moisture 
conditions continue, it would have the potential of harming the 
winter wheat crop and hindering the planting of other crops. Loan 
demand at Tenth District commercial banks is generally flat. Deposit 
growth is mixed, with NOW accounts the primary source of growth 
beyond seasonal patterns.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers in the Tenth District report sales 
increases in the 2-9 percent range between the first five months of 
last year and the first five months of this year. Sales improved 
substantially in April and May of 1982, especially apparel and 
softgoods; durable goods sales remained weak. Merchandise costs have 
stabilized in recent months, resulting in few price increases at 
retail. Tight controls and improved sales have brought inventories 
well within desired levels. Some slight inventory buildup is 
anticipated in the third quarter of 1982, as purchases of 
merchandise increase to accommodate expected sales gains in the last 
half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of purchasing agents contacted in 
the Tenth District report input prices have remained stable or 
decreased slightly compared to a year ago. Prices are expected to 
remain stable for the rest of this year. All firms contacted are 
continuing to trim their inventories and plan to maintain very low 
inventory levels for the remainder of the year. Input availability 
is not a current problem in the District, but could become one if 
more suppliers go out of business or, in light of current capacity 
utilization, the economic recovery occurs at a greater pace than 
expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Realtors and builders in the Tenth District report 
generally weak sales and stable prices. Second quarter housing 
starts have dropped 25 percent in Kansas City from last year, but 
they have risen moderately in other areas-with an increase of over 
20 percent in Oklahoma City. Prices are stable or up moderately-3 or 
4 percent at most. Sales are generally moderately weaker than last 
year, varying from down 10 percent in Kansas City to up marginally 
in Oklahoma City. Sales are weakest in the $95,000 to $185,000 price 
range. Supplies of building materials are adequate and inexpensive. 
Builders warn, however, that a sudden rise in construction activity 
will cause severe supply bottlenecks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Officers at Tenth District Savings and Loan 
Associations lament the continuing decline of savings inflows-down 
as much as 50 percent from last year. The 30-month CD has proven an 
effective vehicle, however, propelling modest boosts for competitive 
institutions. Officers fear that the recent upsurge in interest 
rates forebodes a renewed exodus to money market funds. Most 
associations are sticking to portfolio loans, but some report an 
unexpected but modest pickup in market rate mortgages from very low 
levels. One officer, however, dismissed the upswing as a mere 
seasonal flurry, and most associations are unwilling to commit funds 
past 30 days. Loans made at market rates are at interest levels of 
16 1/2 to 17 percent, with little anticipation of a near-term 
decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some areas in the Tenth District have received an 
excessive amount of moisture from the heavy rains occurring over the 
past several weeks. This situation has delayed both the harvesting 
of the winter wheat crop and, in turn, the planting of some fall 
crops, particularly in southern Oklahoma. In northern Oklahoma and 
Kansas the harvesting of winter wheat is soon to begin. No adverse 
effects on the quality of the wheat are reported. Some hail damage 
has been reported, but overall wheat conditions are estimated from 
fair to good at this time. Bankers in Nebraska report favorable 
progress being made in the planting of spring crops despite the cool 
weather. Recent improvement in cattle and hog prices has had a 
positive impact on the income of livestock producers in the Tenth 
District. However, bankers report no signs of livestock producers 
increasing their production capability.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reported loan demand is generally 
characterized as flat throughout the Tenth District. Several banks 
in Oklahoma indicate that commercial and industrial loan demand has 
recently increased. However, in contrast to 1981 and the first 
quarter of 1982, the source of this strength is in nonenergy related 
businesses. Real estate lending is down throughout the District, as 
is agricultural lending. Consumer loan demand is mixed with most 
activity arising from credit cards. Several bankers note that the 
overall quality of their outstanding loans has deteriorated, and 
some are obtaining additional collateral and restructuring loan 
terms. Deposit growth at Tenth District banks is mixed. Most bankers 
contacted report some growth in NOW accounts, but few new accounts 
are being opened. Those banks expanding loans are also generally 
issuing large CD's. Virtually no growth is reported in all saver 
certificates, and most other categories of deposits are following 
their typical seasonal pattern.
