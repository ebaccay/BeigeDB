      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 11, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        At their most recent meeting several Directors of the Boston Bank 
  remarked that their own Roundtable discussion of business trends was 
  becoming monotonous because of little change in their view of 
  economic conditions. Directors and other Red Book respondents report 
  continued healthy but not rapid economic growth with retail sales, 
  employment, and commercial loan demand all doing nicely. Although 
  there is no evidence of widespread shortages, certain labor markets 
  are becoming quite tight and there are reports of stretch outs in 
  delivery times of certain materials.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Vermont banker reports that loan demand is very strong in his 
  state and that he is beginning to have to turn customers away. This 
  bank expects credit conditions to become considerably tighter and is 
  making plans for rationing available funds. A large Boston bank 
  reports that while commercial loan demand increased very strongly 
  earlier in the year there was some slowdown in August. The chief 
  executive officer of this bank believes that the August slowdown was 
  only a temporary reduction in the longer term growth trend. He 
  indicates that the bank has considerable liquid resources overseas 
  and expects to be able to meet the anticipated increase in loan 
  demand with no difficulty. Overall deposit flows remain fairly 
  strong, although there is some evidence of disintermediation in 
  savings and NOW accounts.
       </p>
       <p>
        A local manufacturing conglomerate reports some slowdown in the 
  sales of its household appliances subsidiary and expects a leveling 
  off later this year as a result of the anticipated drop in new 
  housing activity. A division of this corporation which produces 
  auto-related products is expected to see strong sales throughout the 
  remainder of this year and well into 1979. A chemical manufacturer 
  also reports that sales to tire producers have retained strong 
  momentum.
       </p>
       <p>
        An executive of a diversified local retailer indicates that sales 
  across most merchandise lines remain very strong and that she would 
  be very optimistic except for hearing continual forecasts for a 
  slowdown. The chief executive of a large dry goods chain reports 
  that although sales remain strong and above his firm's plan, he is 
  somewhat concerned about inventories. While his stores do not have 
  serious inventory overhang, it is higher than desirable and some 
  adjustment will be necessary. He feels this pattern is also the case 
  for other retailers, as well as for some manufacturers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although no Red Book respondents reported significant production 
  problems as a result of an inability to obtain materials or labor, 
  there are signs of a general tightening. A monthly survey of New 
  England purchasing managers found some difficulty in obtaining 
  certain types of steel and aluminum as well as electronic 
  components. The operator of an employment agency reports increased 
  difficulty in finding people. Similarly a Connecticut director 
  indicates that many labor markets in that state are becoming 
  increasingly tight because of expanded manufacturing activity, much 
  of it defense oriented.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein, Houtakker, Samuelson and Solow were available 
  for comment this month. With the exception of Houtakker, none sees 
  any justification for further interest rate increases at this time. 
  The majority argued that the Fed must allow for the lags in the 
  monetary control process by waiting for evidence of the impact of 
  past rate increases before pushing rates up further. While there was 
  general agreement among the respondents that a more stringent 
  voluntary wage and price control program is unlikely to have a 
  significant effect on the rate of inflation, opinion was divided on 
  whether such a policy should even be attempted. Solow feels that it 
  could be marginally successful if properly applied, but Houtakker 
  worries about its effects on the resource allocation mechanism and
  Samuelson fears it might induce a round of preemptive wage and price 
  increases.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Eckstein, the recent figures suggest that the economy 
  is passing through a phase of the credit cycle that in the past has 
  always preceded a credit crunch. Events are unfolding more slowly 
  than usual this time, but he warns that the present calm on the 
  money markets need not persist. Eckstein believes that rates are 
  already high enough to greatly increase the risks of a crunch due to 
  an exogenous shock to the system, so the Fed must be cautious about 
  increasing rates still further at the present time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Houthakker argues that the growth of the money supply has yet to 
  show any evidence of restraint. As a result, he feels that the Fed 
  is still accommodating inflation. Houthakker is dubious about the 
  effectiveness of wage and price guidelines, noting that inflation 
  cannot be reduced by a policy that suppresses competition. He finds 
  the August foreign trade figures
  most heartening, especially the strong growth in exports. It is 
  Houtakker's view that with the depreciation now showing up 
  significantly in the trade data, it is possible that the dollar has 
  finally bottomed out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Concerned that the Fed has been "painted into a corner" by its 
  emphasis on money growth targets, Samuelson urges the Fed to allow 
  some slippage in the money supply rather than risk a needless 
  recession. He thinks that an appropriate policy is to aim at no less 
  than 3 percent real growth, but that the recent interest rate 
  increases may prevent such an outcome next year. Samuelson is 
  critical of those advocates of incomes policies who see them as an 
  excuse for another dose of "wild cats" fiscal and monetary stimulus.
       </p>
       <p>
        Less critical of voluntary controls than the others, Solow believes 
  that a set of wage and price guidelines is worth trying. However, 
  since he expects the program's effectiveness to be directly 
  proportional to the President's commitment to it, Solow feels that 
  guidelines would prove harmful if announced and subsequently 
  ignored. With respect to interest rates, Solow can see no 
  justification for the recent increases, and is disappointed with the 
  Fed's continued fixation on M1, despite the wide range of 
  uncertainty surrounding the causes of its movements.
