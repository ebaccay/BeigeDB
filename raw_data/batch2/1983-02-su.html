      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook and Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook seems considerably brighter compared to the December 
Redbook. Most Districts report definite signs of improvement in 
economic activity, or at least judge that improvement is imminent. 
Least optimistic are Richmond and Dallas (both reported "little 
change" recently), Cleveland ("the bottom may be near") and Kansas 
City ("recovery to get underway during the second or third 
quarter"). Retail sales (ex-autos) are brisk and expected to remain 
strong in most Districts. Sales of domestic automobiles, especially 
large models, are improved. Manufacturing activity is mixed, with 
improved orders from the automotive, electronics and housing 
sectors, while only the business equipment sector continues to 
decline. Inventories appear to have fallen to desired levels in most 
sectors. While further declines are more likely than increases, 
there is no indication that declines would be sharp. Residential 
construction continues to improve as sales of new and pre-owned 
homes have been boosted by mortgage interest rate declines. 
Agriculture remains a weak spot with farm income down and many 
farmers in financial difficulty. Bank lending activity is generally 
flat; business loans are expected to stay flat while consumer loans 
are expected to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales (ex-autos) in most Districts are brisk and are expected 
to remain strong. January department store sales were especially 
good in Philadelphia ("off to a flying start") and in Cleveland ("a 
fundamental upswing in demand"). Exceptions were Kansas City, 
Dallas, and San Francisco, where either sales showed less strength 
or retailers were cautious about the outlook. Sales of non-auto 
consumer durables were generally weak except in Atlanta, where they 
have been spurred by a resurgence in housing. Some Districts report 
retail sales have benefited from unseasonally warm weather, but 
Chicago reports warm weather has hurt apparel sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales, especially of large domestic models, are improved 
in most Districts. Dallas reports sales of imported cars remain low. 
Atlanta notes that sales have been assisted by exceptionally low 
financing rates ("5.9-6.9 percent and even as low as 2.9 percent").
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial activity is mixed, suggesting that a trough may have been 
reached. Most Districts report orders and activity up at some firms 
but down at others. Orders have improved for automobiles and trucks, 
defense and consumer electronics, and products to construct and 
furnish new houses. Some improvement in orders for steel are 
reported but steel plant shutdowns continue to be announced. Mining 
continues very weak, with additional mine shutdowns reported. 
Business equipment manufacturing is probably the weakest sector, 
with additional declines in sales and production expected for 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inventories seem to have fallen to desired levels in most sectors, 
but declines remain more likely than increases. Retail inventories 
are lean and at desired levels almost everywhere but there is little 
sentiment for increasing them. Some manufacturers continued to cut 
inventories in January while others had already reached their 
desired inventory levels. Few manufacturers plan to build 
inventories, even those with rising orders. Inventories of oil 
drilling supplies remain excessive, and Richmond reports many 
manufacturers' inventories are well above desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction continues to improve. Most Districts report 
sales of new and pre-owned homes have been spurred by declines in 
mortgage interest rates, and permit issuance and housing starts have 
increased. Exceptions are Southern California, where the unsold 
inventory is still large; Philadelphia, where "housing starts remain 
stalled and new home prices continue to drop;" and Richmond, where 
the pace of the housing recovery has moderated in recent weeks. 
Chicago reports house construction has benefited from unusually mild 
weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are scattered reports of improvement in non-residential 
construction, but Chicago expects a downturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farmers continue under pressure. Farm income has fallen in several 
Districts and farmers are reported having difficulty repaying loans. 
Chicago reports agricultural land prices 20 percent below their 
late-1970s peak. The payment-in-kind or crop-swap program is 
expected to achieve a high farmer participation rate in several 
Districts, reducing production expenses in 1983 and increasing crop 
prices in 1984. Suppliers of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and fuel 
are expected to be hurt by the program.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank lending activity is mixed. Several Districts describe business 
loan demand as relatively flat, with little growth expected in the 
next few months. Consumer loan demand, commented on by only three 
Districts, is flat or up slightly, with near-term growth expected as 
consumer optimism improves. Minneapolis reports demand for new 
agricultural credit is low but demand for farm debt refinancing is 
greater than normal. Demand for mortgage loans is reported up in a 
few Districts, and the 30-year fixed rate loan is the most popular. 
Conventional mortgage rates edged up in January in Atlanta.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new deposit accounts differ sharply in popularity. The money 
market deposit account (MMDA) has been marketed aggressively and has 
achieved rapid growth. Atlanta reports very little attrition from 
these accounts following expiration of bonus interest rates. 
Estimates of the share of MMDA deposits that are "new: money" to the 
institution range from 15 to 60 percent. Public response to the 
Super NOW account seems to be uniformly unenthusiastic. Kansas City 
attributes the apathetic response to weak promotion, consumer 
confusion, and MMDA competitive superiority because of higher yields 
and lower service charges.
