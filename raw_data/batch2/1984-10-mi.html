     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Modest growth continues in the Ninth District. Unemployment rates 
and other labor market indicators seem to have improved lately. Some 
growth in consumer spending is reported, but not for homes. Also 
reported are scattered signs of commercial and industrial expansion. 
Indicators of recent financial activity are mixed—strong in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area, but weak in the rural areas, where 
farmers are facing low prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The latest available data indicate that labor market conditions have 
strengthened a bit. Minnesota's unemployment rate fell 0.1 percent 
to 6.3 percent in August, reversing two months of slight increases. 
Also in August, employment in Minnesota reached an all-time high. 
Improvement was particularly notable in the Twin Cities metropolitan 
area, where the unemployment rate dropped to 4.5 percent in August. 
Indicative of continuing strong labor demand, in August the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul help-wanted advertising index was still about 
47 percent above its level a year earlier and in September 
Minnesota's initial unemployment claims fell again. This Bank's 
directors continue to report that unemployment rates in southern 
Minnesota and the Dakotas are low and that rates in parts of 
Wisconsin and Montana have fallen somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the exception of sales in agriculturally dependent cities and 
towns, retail sales of general merchandise appear to be following 
the trend of modest growth reported last month. One large retailer 
in the Twin Cities reports that its back-to-school promotion went 
well, particularly in September. Its sales figures are still running 
ahead of plan. It and another large retailer in the Twin Cities say 
that apparel sold particularly well. Bank directors from diversified 
cities around the district report similar findings. Large chain 
stores in Rochester, Minnesota, report a good September, although 
smaller stores weren't doing as well. Mall business was up 
considerably in September in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, but only 
modestly in Bismarck, North Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mirroring reports for the nation, motor vehicle sales in the 
district seem to have picked up a bit since August. In September, a 
domestic manufacturer was surprised to find both its car and truck 
sales in this region up substantially over year-earlier levels. 
District inventories of vehicles are still low. Some Bank directors 
in agriculturally dependent areas report that cars and trucks have 
been moving well there, too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home purchases, while still up from levels of a year ago, appear to 
be falling off. Both Bank directors and district realtors indicate 
that housing affordability has deteriorated, with high financing 
costs, prices, and taxes mentioned as factors. Mortgage revenue 
bonds are helping to prop up sales in parts of western Wisconsin, 
though.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist spending in the district, which may have been somewhat more 
restrained this summer than last, picked up with the arrival of the 
fall color season. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the season 
started early and is lasting longer than expected. Travel to parks 
in Montana and the Dakotas has been lower this year than last. While 
some attribute this to exchange rates inducing Canadians to stay 
home, in fact more Canadians appear to be crossing the border this 
year. Canadian tourist dollars appear to be flowing elsewhere than 
parks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commerce and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Scattered reports have been appearing lately about commercial and 
industrial production and expansion in the Ninth District. Plans to 
build a $100 million office-hotel complex in Minneapolis have been 
announced. Some energy production facilities are being built in 
North Dakota, where petroleum-related activity is running at a 
record rate. However, construction permits are down in Bismarck, 
North Dakota. While an auto parts distribution center is being built 
in South Dakota, little other new expansion is reported there. 
Building products plants, which are benefiting from low lumber 
prices, are producing at high levels to meet building demand. While 
pulp and paper plants are still very busy, no expansion plans have 
been announced recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the agricultural sector continues to be plagued by low 
prices, low land values, and high debt service, none of which is 
likely to improve soon. In Minnesota alone, the farm price index 
fell 3 percent between July and August. Despite Soviet purchases, 
generally favorable crop conditions may push production up enough to 
lower prices further. For example, recent estimates indicate that 
the nation's corn harvest will be the fourth largest on record, and 
both soybean and wheat production are up substantially over the 
drought- and PIK-reduced levels of 1983. Corroborating this, 
district Bank directors report favorable crop conditions in the 
district, except in the dry areas of the western Dakotas and 
northeastern Montana. They also continue to report severe farm debt-
service loads. The only ag producers with some reason for optimism 
seem to be those selling meat animals. Lower feed prices are 
improving the profitability of hog and livestock operations, and 
cattle prices have picked up a bit recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The financial sector reflects the continuing trend of urban economic 
growth outstripping rural growth. Both deposits and loans at large 
Twin Cities banks have been growing faster than their national 
counterparts. From mid-August to mid-September in the Twin Cities, 
large bank deposits and loans grew 1.7 percent and 2.8 percent, 
respectively. The comparable national figures were only -0.1 percent 
and 1.1 percent. Consumer loan growth has been particularly strong 
in the Twin Cities. Financial activity in the rest of the district 
seem to be slower, though, according to this Bank's directors.
