      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The recovery in Twelfth District economic activity is gaining 
momentum, extending to a greater number of industries. Retail sales 
at department stares have been rising at an accelerated pace 
recently, while the recovery in Western homebuilding and sales 
activity has been even stronger than the upturn nationally. In the 
manufacturing and mining sectors, employment gains are becoming more 
widespread. Moreover, although the capital goods industries are not 
yet expanding their payrolls, employment has stabilized. The net 
inflow of funds into MMDAs at District banks has slowed but still 
remains substantial. Banks have been investing most of their excess 
funds in short-term Treasury securities since business and consumer 
loan demand remains weak despite promotional efforts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents report that consumers are imbued with a renewed sense of 
confidence and that retail sales have been increasing widely 
throughout the Twelfth District. Major department store chains in 
Southern California reported that sales rose sharply in May and ran 
nearly 13 percent above the year-earlier level, representing a solid 
gain in real terms. The only weakness is occurring in Utah where 
flooding, attributable to a record spring snow melt, is adversely 
affecting shopping. Competition for sales is reported to be 
extremely intense with department stores engaged in heavy 
discounting of list prices. These promotional efforts are being 
successful, however, and seasonal inventory is moving well. Sales of 
durable goods, severely depressed during the recession, are rising 
even faster than nondurables. In particular, the upturn in home 
sales is helping to spur sales of household goods, including 
furniture, appliances, and other big ticket items. Interest rate 
concessions by manufacturers have stimulated sales of automobiles. 
Retail credit delinquencies are returning to pre-recession levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recovery in Twelfth District manufacturing activity is becoming 
broader based. Until recently, gains in employment and prices were 
confined mainly to the important lumber industry which benefited 
early in the recovery from the pickup in national homebuilding 
activity. But in the past two months, employment also has begun to 
rise in a number of other important regional industries including 
primary metals, chemicals, apparel and food processing. Recent labor 
agreements in the aluminum and copper industries have removed the 
threat of strikes. The pickup in orders for those metals therefore 
is attributable to a fundamental increase in consumption by the 
automobile, appliance, container and housing industries, rather than 
to strike hedge buying. The West's major capital goods producing 
industries—including those that manufacture machinery, electronic 
equipment, trucks, aircraft and rail cars—have not yet experienced 
an overall pickup in orders. Although the defense and consumer 
markets for some of those products is growing, business demand for 
capital goods remains weak. Nevertheless, except for aircraft, where 
low commercial airline orders are still causing cutbacks, employment 
in most of those industries has stabilized.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The West is experiencing an even stronger recovery in homebuilding 
and sales activity than the nation as a whole. Housing starts in the 
West currently are running at double the level of a year ago and 
permit activity points to still further gains in the months ahead. 
Sales of new homes throughout the District apparently are rising at 
a strong enough pace to prevent an excess accumulation of unsold 
inventory. Sales of lower-priced homes have picked up especially 
rapidly. But in the Los Angeles area, single-family residences in 
the $200,000-$300,000 price range also are selling well. A large 
portion of the new homes are being financed through subsidized 
FHA/VA or state government mortgages. Although nonresidential 
construction activity remains below the year-ago level, respondents 
report a pickup in certain geographical areas for such non-office 
projects as shopping malls, hotels and hospitals. Moreover, the 
rising value of nonresidential construction permits issued suggests 
that spending will increase in the months ahead, provided interest 
rates do not rise sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The return of clear weather in the past two months has permitted 
California farmers to plant lettuce, tomatoes, onions and other 
vegetable crops, which had been delayed by flooding. As a result, 
vegetable prices have begun to moderate after rising sharply earlier 
this year. Similarly, fruit prices also are coming down. Prices for 
fruits and vegetables are still well above levels of a year ago, 
however, and California farmers are expected to experience a year-
to-year increase in net income from those products. California 
farmers also are expected to benefit from the Federal payment-in-
kind (PIK) program. In fact, cotton prices have been rising sharply 
recently and production costs for grains are down generally. 
Elsewhere throughout the District, smaller gains in net farm income 
are anticipated. One potential threat is the record snowpack which 
could damage California agriculture this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The net flow of funds into MMDAs at Twelfth District banks has 
fallen off considerably in recent weeks in keeping with the national 
pattern, partly due to interest rate competition from thrifts. 
Still, the inflows represent a significant source of funds, which 
has allowed banks to reduce their reliance on purchased funds, 
especially large CD's, and to actively promote both business and 
consumer loan products. Business loan demand remains flat to weak, 
however. Thus, most institutions are heavily promoting their 
consumer loan products—i.e., auto loans, installment loans, and 
credit card plans—to stimulate consumers' demand for shorter-term 
or variable rate credit. Aggressive advertising campaigns and lower 
loan rates are the most common efforts being employed by banks to 
attract borrowers. Despite these efforts, consumer loan growth has 
not accelerated rapidly because of competition from captive finance 
companies offering discount loan rates and increasing competition 
from other nonbank lenders. Since the volume of banks' mortgage 
loans outstanding has not been growing, these institutions have been 
investing excess funds in short-term U.S. government securities.
