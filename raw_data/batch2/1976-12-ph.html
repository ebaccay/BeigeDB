      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is faltering in some 
  important sectors. Retail sales are expanding, but conditions in 
  manufacturing have softened. This weakness is primarily in the 
  durable goods sector. While inventory levels in area factories are 
  higher, other major indicators of activity are lower. New orders, 
  unfilled orders, and shipments are each down slightly from November, 
  and employment has dropped for the third month in a row. 
  Nevertheless, the six-month outlook both in retailing and 
  manufacturing is for some strengthening. Capital spending plans show 
  no signs of softening despite the current slowdown. Price pressures 
  on manufacturers are about the same as last month, and prices 
  received are only marginally higher. Bankers report that business 
  loan demand is still weak, and they anticipate only a moderate 
  pickup in 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers responding to the current Business Outlook Survey 
  report that overall business conditions are not as good as they were 
  last month. Only 12 percent of the businessmen polled report any 
  improvement this month while 24 percent report a worsening of 
  business conditions. New orders and shipments are down fractionally, 
  employment has fallen, and the factory workweek is shorter. This is 
  the third month in a row in which work forces have been reduced to 
  some degree, and the second month in a row for a shorter workweek. 
  Inventories are slightly higher after being flat since August.
     </p>
     <p>
      The weakness in new orders, shipments, and employment, as well as 
  the increase in inventories is concentrated in the durable goods 
  industries. To some extent, the buildup in stocks results from slow 
  sales, but this is not the case across the board. A producer of 
  agricultural machinery indicates that much of the increase in his 
  inventory is seasonal, and a manufacturer of specialty steel 
  products notes that he has increased his inventory of nickel and 
  chrome to take advantage of price protection clauses. His firm 
  supplies steel to capital goods industries, and he is looking for a 
  pickup in orders by June.
     </p>
     <p>
      &gt;Despite the current weakness, manufacturers are looking for 
  improvement over the next two quarters. By June, better business 
  conditions are foreseen by two-thirds of those surveyed—about the 
  same as last month. New orders, shipments and inventories are 
  expected to increase over the period, and higher levels of 
  employment are projected as well. However, the proportion of firms 
  planning to hire additional employees six months out is down to 24 
  percent from 40 percent in November.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the next half-year, capital expenditures are expected to 
  increase at 42 percent of the firms sampled—a figure that has held 
  steady for the better part of this year. In general, producers of 
  durable goods are less bullish than those of nondurables. A 
  manufacturer of commercial air conditioning systems reports that his 
  firm is currently spending only for capital replacement, and he 
  foresees no increase in such expenditures six months from now. That 
  firm is currently producing at 70 percent of capacity, and he notes 
  that capital spending over and above replacement would not occur 
  until utilization reached 80 percent. This would require a 15 
  percent increase in real demand in 1977, but his projection is for 
  no increase in real terms next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the area report that while competition is unusually 
  intense, sales are performing just about as expected. Most indicate 
  that November turned out to be a strong month, but few are expecting 
  nominal sales this month to show any sizable gain over the 
  relatively high levels of December 1975. For the fourth quarter, 
  expected gains over last year range from 0 to 8 percent in real 
  terms with most of those contacted looking for 0 to 5 percent. 
  Merchants note, however, that while performance is strong thus far, 
  they are less than certain about their anticipations for the rest of 
  December. While a few are bullish, several are "cautiously 
  optimistic." There is no excessive buildup of inventories reported 
  despite the lull in retail sales earlier in the year. For the longer 
  term, most retailers anticipate moderate real gains in sales in 
  1977, but this outlook is accompanied by an attitude of caution. As 
  one merchant puts it, "We're not yet ready to commit ourselves to 
  large advertising expenditures or orders for merchandise."
     </p>
     <p>
      Inflationary pressures in manufacturing appear to be the same as in 
  November. Prices for supplies are moving upward and those for 
  finished products are only marginally higher. About a third of the 
  manufacturers surveyed report paying more for supplies and less than 
  one-fifth indicate higher prices for their own products—both the 
  same as last month. By June, 9 out of 10 expect to be paying more 
  for their inputs, and 2 out of 3 anticipate higher prices for the 
  products they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the area report that consumer loan volume continues to 
  increase, but business borrowing is virtually flat. One banker notes 
  an increased number of encouraging conversations with corporate 
  borrowers regarding additions to plant and equipment. This executive 
  feels that these inquiries may be the beginning of a more confident 
  attitude on the part of business borrowers. However, all of the 
  other bankers contacted say that any increase they see in such 
  conversations is below the normal seasonal upswing. With the 
  continued softness in business loan demand, bankers report that 
  lending competition is intensifying.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking to 1977, bankers expect consumer loan volume to continue to 
  increase, and they anticipate the beginning of a modest pickup in 
  business loan demand, although not before the second quarter. Local 
  bank projections of business loan volume (current dollars) by year-end '77 range from 6 to 15 percent over year-end '76 levels. At the 
  same time, a moderate increase in interest rates in '77 is 
  anticipated, with the prime projected to be 7-7 1/2 percent by the 
  end of the year. Before the upward movement begins, however, most 
  bankers anticipate a further drop in the prime to 6 percent, and, 
  according to one executive, possibly lower.
