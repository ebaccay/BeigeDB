      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is expanding. Retail sales 
  are reported to be good except in areas affected by the Philadelphia 
  transit strike. The manufacturing sector is on a clear upward trend 
  with expansion reported for the fourth month in a row. New orders, 
  shipments, and inventories are higher this month, and employment is 
  improving as well. Manufacturers foresee additional expansion over 
  the next two quarters. Price increases for finished products in this 
  sector are more widespread this month, but projections of increases 
  six months out are less widespread than in March. Sales of existing 
  housing are brisk, while new construction is limited. Commercial 
  bankers report that business loan volume is flat but see signs of 
  increased interest by potential borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers responding to the latest Business Outlook Survey 
  report additional improvement this month. More than half of those 
  polled say that business conditions are better than in March. This 
  is the highest proportion indicating expansion in a year, and the 
  fourth consecutive month in which gains have been reported. New 
  orders and shipments are higher in April, and inventories, which 
  declined in February and held steady in March, are up as well. This 
  expansion in industrial activity is giving a boost to employment. 
  Factory work forces are increasing at one-fourth the firms sampled, 
  and a similar proportion reports a longer workweek. This is the 
  second month in a row in which both employment and the workweek have 
  expanded.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, manufacturers look for additional growth. Three 
  out of four expect better business conditions by October. New orders 
  and shipments are expected to increase from their present levels, 
  and inventories are projected to climb as well. At the same time, 
  additional growth in factory employment is anticipated. For the 
  third month in a row, one-half the executives surveyed plan to add 
  to their work forces six months out. In addition, close to one-third 
  plan to lengthen the average workweek. This is down somewhat from 
  last month, but still well above the proportions reported in 1976. 
  Capital spending increases are planned at 40 percent of the firms 
  sampled--about the same as last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices in manufacturing continue to increase. Fifty-six percent of 
  the respondents report higher prices for supplies this month. This 
  is about the same as in March. On the output side, 40 percent of the 
  businessmen surveyed report higher prices compared to 31 percent 
  last month. By October, 84 percent look for higher prices for 
  supplies and 64 percent expect to be receiving more for their 
  finished products. Last month, these proportions were 86 percent and 
  74 percent respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for a public transit strike in the immediate Philadelphia 
  area, department store sales in the region are showing gains over 
  last year. Sales in areas served by the affected public transit are 
  down considerably, and merchants say the strike is an important 
  factor in this drop. The average guess by retailers contacted is 
  that the strike, which began on March 25, is reducing sales by one-
  third. Outside of the affected area, sales are up over the same 
  period last year with reported increases ranging from 6 to 11 
  percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers say they may be experiencing a slight drop in sales as a 
  consequence of the upcoming shutdown of a major competitor. Lit 
  Brothers, one of the four major Philadelphia department stores, has 
  announced its intention to close within a few weeks. The chain has 
  10 branch stores in addition to its downtown location, and employs 
  2,800 people. Since the last week in March it has been offering 
  hefty discounts on most of its merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, retailers say that soft goods are selling well, 
  especially spring and summer apparel. At the same time, inventories 
  are reported to be in "good balance," although some say that their 
  stocks could become excessive if the transit strike should last 
  through Easter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The market for existing housing is reported to be very active, but 
  construction of new units is limited. At one large MSB mortgage 
  lending is at its highest ever, and most of this is for existing 
  housing. Mortgage rates have firmed within the past two weeks after 
  being under downward pressure earlier in the year. The current rate 
  on conventional mortgages with financing between 65-80 percent of 
  purchase price is 8 3/4 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for NINOW accounts, which MSBs in Pennsylvania could offer as 
  of March 12, is said to be "slow but steady." Overall deposit 
  inflows are reported to be reasonably good, although they have 
  moderated recently. One MSB official looks for inflows to be fairly 
  good, at least until the third quarter when there are heavy CD 
  maturities. According to this executive, "I don't expect market 
  rates to move up enough to cause any problems by then, but if they 
  do, thrifts are going to lose deposits and people in the housing 
  industry will start screaming."
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the area report that business loan demand remains 
  basically flat, but a few indicate that they do see some encouraging 
  signs. One notes that, "We're seeing customers who haven't been in 
  to see us for some time." Two other bankers say they're receiving an 
  increasing number of inquiries about fixed-rate loans. One reports 
  that such requests are being handled "gingerly," while another says 
  that his bank has made commitments for fixed-rate loans of $50 
  million. These are to high-quality customers, and typically have no 
  balance requirement. Rates are in the 8 percent range and the 
  outside maturity is five years.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, bankers look for no more than a gradual pickup 
  in business loan demand over the next few quarters. Interest rates 
  are expected to rise gradually as well with a prime in the 
  neighborhood of 7 percent by year-end. Liquidity is reported to be 
  ample for expected credit demands and several banks have lowered 
  rates or extended maturities on their CDs. Bankers say they are 
  concerned about NINOWS, but add that it's too early to get a good 
  idea of their competitive impact.
