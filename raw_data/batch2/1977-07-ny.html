      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 13, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District continues to gain according 
to reports from directors and other business leaders contacted 
recently. While department store sales slackened in June, demand for 
consumer durable goods remained strong and merchants view the 
outlook as favorable. Real estate and residential construction 
activity have posted solid gains and inventories of unsold homes are 
in good balance with sales. Capital spending plans in the Second 
District appear to be slowly gaining momentum. Respondents 
apparently discount the possibility that wage-price controls will be 
reimposed in the foreseeable future. Current labor supplies are 
adequate for the most part, but a few shortages of skilled labor 
have emerged.
      <p>
       Department store sales were described as sluggish in June. The 
  chairman of a large apparel company characterized sales in the first 
  part of June as the worst in three months. Another retailing 
  executive attributed the sluggishness of sales to the warm weather 
  in May which had encouraged purchases of seasonal apparel that would 
  normally have taken place in June. For the most part, it appears 
  that the slowdown was concentrated in nondurable goods. Despite this 
  softening, all of the retail executives contacted were optimistic 
  about the outlook for merchandising. One retailer emphasized that 
  care would be required in interpreting July retail sales data. He 
  pointed out that July is traditionally marked by clearance 
  campaigns, and sales are thus more likely indicative of the size of 
  markdowns required to move unsold goods than of underlying demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside of department stores, strong demand for consumer 
  products was reported by several respondents. A supplier of 
  electrical components to the appliance industry reported shipments 
  running well ahead of the near-record pace of the previous year. In 
  addition, a major producer of components for writing instruments was 
  experiencing excellent sales and was operating at full capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The continued improvement of the regional economy was also reflected 
  in a pickup of real estate activity and residential construction. 
  According to the president of a real estate management company, 
  demand for Manhattan real estate has been recovering impressively. 
  Blocks of prime rental space are now scarce, with the large 
  vacancies concentrated in secondary or less desirable buildings. In 
  New Jersey, the president of a large mortgage banking firm held a 
  sanguine assessment of the outlook for single-family construction. 
  In his judgment, while housing prices are high, financing costs are 
  being met through the contribution of working wives and/or 
  moonlighting on the part of breadwinners. Barring an unforeseen 
  tightening in credit, deferred demand remains unsatisfied and 
  construction activity is expected to continue to advance. 
  Furthermore, builders' concerns about inflation appear to be waning, 
  so that cost escalators are no longer being built into sales 
  contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Businessmen continue to keep a close watch on inventories. As a 
  consequence, inventories generally remain in good balance with 
  sales. Petroleum inventories, which experienced a sharp rundown last 
  winter, have returned to normal levels and were reported to be well 
  above the level of a year ago. The chairman of an international oil 
  company felt that summer gasoline prices could weaken as a result. 
  Reports from the chemical industry suggest that inventories are 
  satisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital spending appears to be slowly gaining momentum. On the 
  negative side, the president of a major life insurance company 
  reported that businessmen are hesitant to increase their capital 
  spending plans because the outlook for profits remains uncertain. 
  More positively, a major automotive producer has a $22 million plant 
  under construction in the Rochester area. Elsewhere in Western New 
  York, capital spending by industry was described as moderate. 
  Reporting on the agricultural sector in Upstate New York, one 
  director indicated that investment in both fixed assets and 
  equipment was exceptionally strong. In New Jersey, a manufacturer of 
  plastic products is planning near-record outlays on machine tools in 
  order to meet robust demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contributing to the positive outlook, directors and businessmen 
  generally did not expect a reimposition of formal wage and price 
  controls. One industrial economist felt that the appointment of Mr. 
  Barry Bosworth as director of the Council on Wage and Price 
  Stability as suggestive of some greater, attempts to keep the lid on 
  prices. However, this respondent expected these to be more in the 
  form of "jawboning" than actual controls. In the view of the 
  chairman of a major New York City bank, an informal program of price 
  controls already appeared to be in effect. He expects to see a 
  reaction by the Administration to large price increases similar to 
  the reaction to recent increases in bank prime rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       While labor supplies were considered adequate overall, some 
  shortages of certain skills were noted by respondents. In the 
  upstate area, the Buffalo directors reported a slight shortage of 
  skilled workers—most notably qualified draftsmen and engineers. A 
  manufacturer of plastic products reported that production was 
  limited somewhat by an inadequate supply of skilled toolmakers and 
  mold designers.
