      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 29, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The expected upturn in economic activity has not developed 
in the Seventh District. Purchasing managers in Chicago and 
Milwaukee reported further declines in shipments, orders, output, 
inventories, and employment in August with no indication that 
September would see improvement. State and local governments are 
also cutting staff. Projections of demand for motor vehicles and 
steel have been reduced again for September and the fourth quarter. 
Although some producers report a leveling off in orders, most 
capital goods producers have laid off additional workers and more 
plants have closed. Retail sales remain slow with no help from 
"back-to-school" buying. Although lower interest rates have not 
helped housing materially, some improvement in "attitudes" is 
reported. Expected record corn and soybean harvests will keep prices 
low and increase financial pressures on the farm sector. However, 
mainly because of lower feed costs, the outlook has improved for 
livestock farmers, especially hog producers. Also on the upside are 
sales of grain storage bins and equipment to handle the excess 
production. A scattering of defense procurement orders is providing 
a few jobs. Inflation continues at moderate rates with heavy 
discounting in wholesale and, to a lesser extent, in retail markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Forecasts Reduced
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District businessmen and lenders are losing hope 
that a revival in activity will occur in the remainder of 1982. 
Particularly for capital goods and heavy construction, doubts are 
increasing that a recovery will be manifest before mid-1983 at the 
earliest. Lower interest rates will not have as large an impact as 
in earlier cycles because of substantial unused capacity, financial 
stress, and abysmal morale. Even service industries such as 
medicine, advertising, and law note the effect of hard times. 
However, firms specializing in bankruptcy procedures—accountants, 
lawyers, and liquidators—are doing a booming business. Complaints 
of past due accounts, business and consumer, are much more common 
than in past recessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New claims for unemployment compensation 
continue at high levels. Many employers, including governmental 
units, are cutting staff. New hires generally are held to the 
minimum necessary to fill essential slots. Help-wanted ads bring a 
flood of resumes and some employers prefer to fill openings by 
transfers from within or on personal recommendations. Many companies 
have frozen or reduced salaries this year. Where increases have been 
granted, the 7-8 percent range predominates, down from 9-10 percent 
in past years. Current plans are for much smaller increases in 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Expenditures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported disappointing sales of 
most soft and hard goods in August and September. "Back-to-school" 
promotions did not bring the normal response. Nevertheless, 
children's merchandise—clothing and toys—is generally doing better 
than adults' merchandise. Appliances, carpets, and other home 
furnishings are especially weak, a trend attributed, in part, to 
reduced sales of houses. Auto parts and service and video games 
continue to be star performers. Larger chains report favorable 
delinquency experience, but more careful monitoring of accounts has 
been necessary. Because of slow sales, retail inventories are 
adequate to excessive, and ordering of goods for the winter season 
is well below normal. Closings of stores and fast food operations 
are increasingly frequent, and few new outlets are being added.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Expenditures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recession in business equipment is in full 
swing. Layoffs in many plants have reached 20 to 50 percent of the 
peak force, with high seniority hourly workers and white collar 
types affected to a much greater extent than in earlier postwar 
recessions. Some farm and construction equipment plants will be 
closed for most of the fourth quarter with reopening tentatively 
scheduled for January. Most rail freight car plants are closed 
indefinitely. One heavy truck plant is closed and may not reopen. A 
machine tool producer sees no pickup in the current low level of 
demand until late 1983. Imports are taking a growing share of the 
markets for machine tools and farm and construction equipment, 
helped by the high value of the dollar. Export demand is restricted 
by limited availability of government financial aid, compared with 
foreign competitors. Low demand for services of plant location 
advisers, architects, and design engineers suggests that the capital 
spending slump will be deeper and longer than in earlier cycles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some auto and truck plants are closed to cut 
inventories at a time when production is usually at high levels to 
supply dealers with new models. On September 1 stocks of 24 domestic 
models exceeded 100 days supply, an unprecedented situation. Price 
incentives have been pushed to move the large carryover of 1982 
models--and some 1981s. Meanwhile, various imported models are in 
short supply. Even the new domestic compact trucks, strong sellers 
earlier in the year, have slumped in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      One forecast of steel shipments for 1982 has been reduced to 
the 60-65 million ton range, lowest since 1958. Demand for steel 
continues at extremely low levels. All products are weak, but 
structurals and heavy plates for capital goods are "terrible." Oil 
field steel has plummeted in an unprecedented fashion. The only 
improved demand categories are ordnance and grain bins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Defense Procurement
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The principal facilities devoted exclusively to 
defense procurement in the Seventh District are a tank arsenal, an 
electronic counter-measures plant, and the Rock Island Army Arsenal. 
In addition, District companies have obtained orders for small naval 
vessels, armored cars, personnel carriers, fuel trucks, special rail 
cars, communications equipment, aircraft engine parts, and a variety 
of other components. Overall, however, this region is not sharing 
proportionately in the defense buildup.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Projected record corn and soybean harvests, as in 1981, 
will exceed utilization and augment already burdensome carryover 
stocks. Corn and soybean prices have declined sharply in 
anticipation of the expected surplus production and are expected to 
remain well under the low year-ago levels. Many District crop 
farmers will remain in the grip of a cash-flow squeeze, partly 
reflecting the small proportion of farmers eligible for government 
price supports on their 1982 crops. Prospects for livestock farmers 
have improved. High prices and low feed costs have generated large 
profits for hog farmers. Cattle prices have weakened in recent 
weeks, but low feed costs and reduced finance charges suggest that 
cattle feeders will be able to cover production costs.
