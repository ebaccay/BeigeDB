      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District remained sluggish in August 
and September. The retail sector showed limited signs of recovery. 
Department store sales recouped some of July's decline, and rebate 
and interest rate subsidy programs spurred automobile sales. 
Lackluster conditions persisted in manufacturing industries, with 
high financing costs said to be discouraging new orders. Business 
economists do not anticipate any gains in real GNP until the end of 
the year despite small reductions in the prime rate. They expect 
real GNP to grow between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in 1982. On the 
financial side, consumer resistance to upward adjustment on 
renegotiable-rate mortgages was evident.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In August and September, retail activity in the Second District 
rebounded somewhat from the one-month drop that occurred in July. 
While the fall season began slowly due to the late Labor Day and 
school openings, most department stores are now achieving their 
sales goals. Products for the home exhibited weakness, with a 
retailer attributing the softening to the appreciation of the dollar 
and consequent fall-off in tourism and foreign business. Merchants 
believe the rest of the year will be "good." National retailers 
reported that sales in the New York area were generally healthier 
than in other parts of the country. In contrast to the relative 
strength of suburban locations evident in July, city and suburban 
stores are now performing equally well. None of the establishments 
foresaw any need to cut their inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales improved in August, matching the previous year 
levels which most of the dealers considered respectable. Strength 
appeared in both domestic and foreign automobile lines and across 
the price and size spectrums. Rebate and interest rate subsidy 
programs were credited for the upturn. Dealers expect a slowdown 
with the expiration of these programs. The higher prices of the new 
1982 models could depress sales further. Inventories are at 
acceptable to low levels, as the higher activity removed the 
excesses existing in prior months. The used car market has remained 
strong and truck sales have picked up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakness in manufacturing industries lingered into September. New 
orders received by capital goods producers stayed at the low levels 
of July, though one firm recorded an additional 40 percent to 50 
percent decline. Consequently, some companies have laid off workers 
and cut production from already contracted rates. Many businesses 
indicated that high interest costs have caused customers to defer 
purchases and reduce inventories. Two establishments noted an 
increase in returned items as clients sought to avoid payments. None 
of the respondents expected any immediate upswing, and even defense 
contractors were uncertain whether rising national defense 
expenditures would result in much new business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some firms have reacted to the sluggish activity by trimming 
inventories of final output, even to the extent of eliminating less 
profitable product lines. One concern has maintained sales by 
cutting prices, but its growth has fallen to a fraction of the 
earlier pace. Companies are trying to proceed with planned capital 
spending especially in high technology industries such as 
electronics. These expenditures are seen as essential to protect 
competitive positions. Increases in capital spending due to recent 
tax changes are not yet apparent. Negotiations on wage settlements 
are easing as job security is being emphasized over pay hikes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business economists foresee no growth or a small drop in real GNP 
during the third quarter and a flat fourth quarter. Real growth in 
GNP during 1982 is expected to be in the 2.5 percent to 3 percent 
range as some economists have revised their forecasts downward. 
Interest rate projections indicate a prime rate of 17 percent to 18 
percent by the end of the year, a more modest fall from current 
levels than some previous estimates. In reaction to a sluggish 
economy, the inflation rate is predicted to decelerate through 1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In recent years, a number of mortgage instruments containing rate-
adjustment provisions have been adopted by mortgage lenders. The 
paucity of experience with rate adjustments on these loans magnifies 
the importance of a recent episode in upstate New York. Buffalo 
Savings Bank recently abandoned plans to raise the rates on callable 
loans written in 1975 and 1976 from 8.5 percent to 14 percent. The 
loans had been made at below-market rates because of a binding usury 
ceiling, which has since been removed. In response to the public 
outcry, the bank extended the 8.5 percent rate for the full 25- or 
30- year amortization periods of the loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Francis Schott (Equitable Life 
Insurance Company), Robert Stone (Irving Trust Company), and Albert 
Wojnilower (First Boston Corporation).
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: Long-term financial markets are seriously depressed. 
Disintermediation is once again impeding the supply of institutional 
funds. But high short-term rates have only very recently become a 
deterrent to the use of short-term credit for long-term needs. 
Federal Reserve credibility is growing month by month as long as he 
move toward ease is very slight and aggregate targets are observed. 
I see no viable alternative to this well-judged policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stone: The short-run aim of policy at this juncture should, I think, 
be to maintain a posture such that interest rates continue to 
decline gradually to levels that would permit moderate real economic 
growth and that would not threaten significant undershoots or 
overshoots in the aggregates. In my view the tactic most likely to 
achieve that result would be to provide nonborrowed reserves such 
that "basic" borrowings (those exclusive of seasonal borrowings and 
extended credit) be maintained in the general area of $600 to $900 
million. To go much below that range for an extended period would in 
my view risk a troublesome overshootâ€”the last thing anyone wants 
under present circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: Business activity is weakening on a broad scale and this 
is beginning to affect investment planning. There is no reduction 
whatsoever in credit availability for large companies, even those of 
lower credit quality. The President's speech, in my judgment, will 
probably have a negative impact. In practical terms, cutting the 
budget will intensify rather than ameliorate economic and financial 
problems. Nevertheless, I still expect some modest upturn in the 
economy by year end. Our people believe that the tax benefit 
transfer provisions of the new tax law will have the result that 
many major companies will pay no corporate profits tax at all for 
several years.
