      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors and other business reports from around the District are 
generally optimistic and indicate solid growth. Retail sales are 
strong. The housing boom continues to spread and gather momentum, 
straining supplies of some building materials. Energy development 
activities are at record levels. But the agricultural outlook 
remains dim despite small improvements in production prospects. A 
recent Tennessee court decision, strictly enforcing the 
Constitution's 10-percent interest rate ceiling, has cut off funds 
from finance companies and reduced bank lending, threatening 
consumer spending. Directors cite uncertainties about the direction 
of government policy, particularly the possible elimination of 
investment tax incentives, as the main cloud on the horizon.
      <p>
       Consumer spending is strong in most areas, with record retail sales 
  reported in southeast Florida and along the Gulf Coast. August auto 
  sales were excellent following announcements of price increases on 
  1978 models; many dealers expect healthy demand to carry over to the 
  new models. Some softness is evident in sales of higher-priced fall 
  apparel, notably menswear, and is causing inventories to back up at 
  Georgia textile mills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tennessee banks, finance companies, and credit unions are in a 
  lending quandary since an August 22 State Supreme Court decision 
  invalidated a statute which allowed lenders to skirt the 
  Constitution's 10-percent interest rate ceiling by using add-ons or 
  discounts. A pending class action suit on behalf of all borrowers 
  demands repayment of all interest in excess of 10 percent collected 
  on loans made by the state's lending institutions in the past five 
  years. A constitutional convention is currently considering 
  proposals to modify or remove the usury provision but will not be 
  able to get the issue before the voters until May or August of 1978.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state's finance companies (there are nearly 500 with 450,000-500,000 borrowers), specifically affected by the decision, have 
  virtually ceased all cash lending and have laid off about 1,000 
  employees. Bank reactions indicate confusion as to interpretation of 
  the decision and fears that future challenges may extend strict 
  interpretation of the interest limitation. Interest charged by 
  stores and car dealers or on bank credit cards in financing specific 
  purchases has been exempted from the ceiling by an earlier court 
  decision, but the more recent ruling has been construed to apply to 
  bank loans for such purposes. Banks generally are making such loans 
  only to those established low-risk customers to whom they can 
  profitably lend at 10 percent or are offering 12-month, 10-percent 
  loans with final "balloon" payments, hoping the Constitution can be 
  amended in time to refinance. Some have cut off all small loans. 
  Most are still buying auto dealer paper. A few are escrowing 
  interest collected in excess of 10 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       State retail sales figures are not yet available to show the impact 
  of the credit dam. There have been some reports of lighter sales of 
  big-ticket durable goods; one director remarked on increased auto 
  sales by dealers just inside Kentucky. Displaced borrowers are 
  expected, wherever possible, to go out of state for financing; loan 
  activity has reportedly already risen at Mississippi banks in the 
  Memphis area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential real estate sales and housing construction have 
  accelerated to an extremely rapid pace in Florida's coastal areas. 
  New apartments and condos account for much of the latest surge on 
  the "Space Coast." Vacant land has grown scarce in the Miami area, 
  encouraging speculation. A Florida director notes continuing 
  moderate real estate speculation along the north Gulf Coast. 
  Mortgage money is plentiful throughout the District, and loan 
  closings at savings and loans are up sharply. Farm real estate 
  activity has risen in Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plans to construct new hotels and expand tourist attractions 
  highlight moderate advances in nonresidential construction. 
  Announcements of plans to build shopping centers and large 
  industrial facilities have become more numerous in the Gulf states. 
  The latest round of announcements included a phosphate mine 
  expansion in central Florida, a headquarters relocation and new 
  industrial complex for the Melbourne area, and large army 
  construction projects in Mississippi. Commercial and industrial 
  growth in the Atlanta area has not kept pace with other District 
  cities. A foundry owner finds encouragement for business spending in 
  rising orders from capital goods producers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intense construction activity has resulted in delayed deliveries and 
  climbing prices of building materials, particularly in Florida. 
  Lumber supplies are low, and prices have risen as much as 20 percent 
  in the past three months; one Tennessee producer has been turning 
  down orders. Atlanta and Florida builders report shortages of 
  insulation materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       August rainfall has improved crop production prospects, but harvests 
  of most crops will be considerably lighter this year than last. Pest 
  damage is unusually heavy; some pesticides are in short supply. 
  Despite extensive losses in some areas, the District's cotton and 
  soybean output should be abundant this fall, but sluggish demand and 
  soft prices for these and several other major cash crops will 
  restrain farm revenues. However, rising demand and expectations of 
  low supplies are allowing citrus growers to sell production in 
  advance of the season for the first time in years, at prices nearly 
  double last year's. Livestock liquidation has slowed as pastures 
  revived. Purchased feed costs have fallen, enlarging profit margins 
  of poultry and hog producers, but depressed local corn and hay 
  production will make beef cattle herds difficult to maintain through 
  the winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil and gas industry activity, both onshore and in the Gulf, is at 
  an all-time high. Some shipbuilders, benefiting from larger volumes 
  of oil-related jobs and preparations for East Coast drilling to 
  begin soon, are experiencing serious shortages of all types of oil-handling equipment. Others remain concerned about maintaining 
  sufficient work levels despite improvements; layoffs by New Orleans 
  and Pascagoula shipyards probably won't be as severe as originally 
  announced but will be substantial at best.
