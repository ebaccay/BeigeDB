      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The overall impression that emerges from this month's district 
  comments is that while the severe weather in many parts of the 
  country and, to a more limited extent, the spreading effects of the 
  coal strike, have somewhat weakened the economy's momentum, the 
  interruption is likely to be only temporary. The retail sale outlook 
  remains good, with merchants generally expecting a strong spring 
  season. The underlying demand for housing continues at a high level, 
  although some concern was voiced over an actual or potential rise in 
  mortgage rates. Business inventories generally are still in line 
  with sale expectations, and there were signs of a strengthening in 
  the business capital spending sector. Concern over inflation 
  continues, reinforced by the implications of the coal negotiations. 
  The demand for business loans seems to have strengthened, on 
  balance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The impact of the coal strike on production and employment appears 
  to be limited so far. Cleveland thus reports that electric power 
  shortages have affected employment in its district only "minimally" 
  and far less than indicated in widely publicized estimates, and 
  notes that its economic respondents were "unconcerned" about the 
  long-range effect of the strike. Richmond reports further 
  curtailment of energy supplies to commercial and industrial users, 
  but expects losses in terms of employment and production to be small 
  if coal shipments are resumed shortly. Atlanta notes that so far 
  only from Tennessee and Alabama have reports of strike-related 
"significant" disruption of production emerged, although it feels 
  further curtailments might induce massive layoffs if coal shipments 
  are not forthcoming quickly. According to Chicago, the coal strike 
  began to adversely impact output in late February, but the effect so 
  far has been "relatively minor", largely confined to Indiana, and is 
  expected to be quickly reversed after the strike is settled. St. 
  Louis also reports only "relatively minor" effect from the strike, 
  and, indeed, sees modest gains in manufacturing activity in recent 
  weeks. Minneapolis feels the strike is not affecting industrial 
  activity in its area, as do New York and Boston, although concern 
  was expressed in those two districts over the potential adverse 
  impact should the strike be prolonged much longer. That for the 
  present underlying manufacturing conditions remain firm, however, is 
  suggested by the number of reports of increases or continued 
  strength in manufacturers' shipments, new orders, and the growing 
  backlog of orders, emanating from, among others, Boston, 
  Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas and St. Louis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumer spending continued to be depressed by inclement weather 
  over large parts of the country, with more than half of the 
  districts mentioning this as a factor. Retailers, however, generally 
  remain relatively optimistic about the near-term outlook. Boston 
  thus reports that retail sales in New England have weakened, but 
  that bad weather was "undoubtedly" a contributing factor, while New 
  York notes that consumer spending in that District appears to be 
  shaking off its "winter doldrums" with retailers throughout the 
  District looking to a strong spring season. Similar sentiments are 
  expressed by several other banks, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
  St. Louis and Kansas City. Richmond sees continued improvement in 
  total sales, with retailers remaining optimistic. Atlanta reports 
  year-to-year sales gains of 10 to 15 percent in most areas of that
  District, and a rise in late February in retail sales is reported by 
  Dallas. Minneapolis characterizes consumer spending as "good to 
  normal", except in rural areas particularly hard hit by cold 
  weather, and while San Francisco reports that unusually heavy rains 
  have dampened sales in Southern California, consumer spending 
  remains strong in the northern part of the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        While bad weather also hampered construction activity in a number of 
  areas, underlying demand in that industry appears to remain strong 
  according to those banks that comment on this subject. Atlanta thus 
  reports that recent high rates of residential construction have not 
  been able to keep pace with demand, while St. Louis reports that 
  demand for new homes continues at a high level. Cleveland notes that 
  while bad weather has depressed housing activity in its District, 
  demand for mortgage money continues strong, as do Minneapolis and 
  Dallas. Some concern was expressed in several districts, however, 
  that rising mortgage interest rates associated with a weakening of 
  deposit inflows at thrift institutions might eventually reduce 
  mortgage demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business inventories by and large remain in balance. Retail 
  inventories thus are characterized as "well under control" by 
  Boston, and at or near desired levels by Richmond, Dallas, Kansas 
  City and St. Louis. Some respondents in the Chicago, San Francisco 
  and Cleveland districts felt inventories to be too high, but others 
  too low. Retailers' inventories in the New York district were 
  regarded as a bit on the high side. At the manufacturing level, 
  inventories in general appeared to be in line with expected sales, 
  although Chicago reports a buildup in farm equipment inventories and 
  there remains a widespread feeling among Richmond manufacturers that 
  current stocks exceed desired levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were indications of some improvements in business spending on 
  plant and equipment. Boston thus reports increases in machine tool 
  orders, while Atlanta notes that tool and diemakers are enjoying 
  excellent business. A steel economist in the Cleveland district sees 
  signs of "accelerating" orders from capital good producers. Chicago 
  reports an expected rise this year in business capital outlays, both 
  for equipment and structures, while Philadelphia characterizes the 
  capital spending plans of its respondents as remaining strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Concern continued to be expressed over actual and prospective 
  increases in prices and wages. More specifically, Chicago expects 
  the "very large increase" in compensation which the eventual coal 
  settlement will entail to stimulate wage demands in other 
  industries. Minneapolis reports that the coal negotiations have 
  already affected wage demands in that district, while respondents in 
  the Cleveland district expect a sharp rise in coal prices this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The demand for business loans is reported as strong or on the 
  upswing by several banks, including St. Louis, Dallas, Chicago and 
  Philadelphia, but as flat or below expectations by San Francisco and 
  New York. Reports on the demand for consumer and other types of 
  loans were mixed.
