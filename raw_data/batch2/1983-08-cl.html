      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

     <p>
      <strong>
       August 10, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Fourth District continue to improve. 
Employment is rising although unemployment rates show little change. 
Real incomes are rising, and retailers are experiencing broad-based 
sales gains. Manufacturing activity continues to grow but perhaps at 
a slower pace than in June. Demand is strong for aluminum but 
remains sluggish for steel. Retailers and manufacturers report lean 
inventories and caution about inventory growth. Builders, expect 
construction activity to slow when current contracts are completed. 
Mortgage lenders report declines in mortgage applications in 
response to higher interest rates. Banks remain highly liquid.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment continues to rise in this District but unemployment rates 
show little change. In Ohio, manufacturing employment rose in June 
for the sixth consecutive month and is 3.3% above last December's 
low. Nonagricultural nonmanufacturing wage and salary employment 
rose in June for the fourth consecutive month and is 3.1% above its 
February low. In May and June, total employment increased by 160 
thousand workers but the labor force expanded by 179 thousand, 
leaving Ohio's unemployment rate unchanged at 12.8% (nsa). 
Unemployment rates in the District's eleven largest SMSA's ranged 
from 9.3% to 17.3%. Local indexes of leading indicators for 
Pittsburgh and Cleveland have risen for seven consecutive months and 
point to continued improvement in those industrial centers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices, Wages and Earnings
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Incomes of production workers have been  rising faster than prices. 
Hourly earnings for production workers in manufacturing in Ohio have 
been rising at a 6.4% annual rate since last October. Average weekly 
hours worked have also been increasing so that in the same period 
average weekly earnings have been advancing at a 13% annual rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers in Cleveland rose 
9.3% in the last twelve months and 1.5% in the last two months. For 
Pittsburgh, the index advanced 7.1% and 0.l% and for Cincinnati 7.8% 
and 1.2% in the same two periods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retailers are experiencing broad-based sales gains. 
Most major general merchandisers report between 9% and 11% nominal 
sales improvement between the first and second quarters (a.r.). They 
anticipate continuing, albeit more modest advances in the third 
quarter. The July sales pace has moderated from June. Consistent 
with national trends, sales of cars, particularly large domestic 
models, are leading the sales strength in the District. Retail food 
sales are lagging, registering between 2% and 3% nominal growth from 
last year.  Retail sales growth is occurring throughout the 
District, although Northern Ohio retailers appear to be lagging the 
region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth of District manufacturing activity may have slowed in July. A 
survey of purchasing managers in the Cleveland area reveals new 
orders and production rose in July, but at a much slower pace than 
in June. Similarly, the pace of price increases slowed from June. 
Raw materials and finished goods inventories were stable in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of purchasing managers in the Cincinnati area shows new 
orders, production, and backlogs continuing to rise through June. 
Increased proportions of firms surveyed report prices paid for 
commodities, services, and equipment are rising while vendor 
deliveries are reported to be slower. Raw material inventories are 
stable while finished goods inventories continue to fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Primary Metals
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for aluminum is strong while demand for steel remains 
sluggish. Aluminum orders and shipments have increased substantially 
since December, boosting the price of primary aluminum ingots by 
about 50%. A major producer reports its U.S. smelters are operating 
at the highest level since 1980. Aluminum inventories are very low 
relative to current shipping rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers report new orders are slow, shipments are flat and 
order backlogs are falling. Product prices remain weak. At current 
prices steel producers would have to operate at over 70% of 
production capability to break even but they are operating at only 
about 50% to 60% of capability.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers and manufacturers report lean inventories. Retailers 
expect some inventory accumulation by yearend 1983 but less than 
typical for a recovery because of high carrying costs and skepticism 
about the durability of the recovery. Industrial firms generally 
report their inventories are at desired levels and are lean relative 
to sales. Plans to expand inventories as sales increase are 
cautious, as many firms plan permanently lean inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Builders expect construction activity to slow when current contracts 
are completed. Home builders report a substantial drop in new 
contracts following recent increases in mortgage rates. However, 
construction of new homes is likely to remain strong through the 
Fall as builders work down their backlog of orders. Office 
construction remains strong as work continues on projects underway. 
Realtors, however, report an excess of office space, and prospective 
tenants are being offered substantial incentives, such as several 
months free rent. Suburban office space and shopping centers have 
been over-built in recent years and developers expect very little 
new construction. Prices of building materials and supplies have
begun to stabilize following several months of sharp price 
increases, and  expected shortages have not materialized.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mortgage Lending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mortgage lenders report declines in mortgage inquiries and 
applications last month. Lenders offering conventional 30-year fixed 
rate mortgages report a substantial drop in mortgage activity, and 
without exception attribute it to an increase in mortgage interest 
rates. Rate increases ranged from 50 to 100 basis points bringing 
conventional mortgage rates into the 13% to 14% range. Lenders 
offering variable rate mortgages have not experienced a substantial 
drop in mortgage activity, and in several cases, lenders have had an 
increase in the number of loan inquiries and applications. The 
majority of loan inquiries and applications have been from existing 
home owners seeking to trade up to more expensive homes. Lenders 
report a significant decrease in their refinancing activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks in the District remain highly liquid. Continuing strong core 
deposit growth and relatively sluggish commercial loan demand are 
allowing banks to reduce their reliance on large denomination CD's 
as a source of funds. Banks are using deposit growth to increase 
investments in federal funds, repurchase agreements and U.S. 
government and agency securities. Some funds are also being used to 
satisfy the somewhat higher demand for consumer loans.
