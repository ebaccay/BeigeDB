      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      After many months of waiting, the Ninth District economy has finally 
begun showing a few definite signs of recovery. In response to lower 
interest rates, district home and auto sales increased in November. 
General merchandise sales improved also, and orders of some 
manufacturers increased. These positive signs are admittedly 
tenuous, however, and much of the district economy remained 
depressed. The district had less excess capacity in manufacturing 
than the nation, but orders continued to decline at many local 
manufacturers. Although most district farmers were able to complete 
the fall harvest, poor prices continued to trouble them. Lending at 
district banks remained weak, and most district financial 
institutions were slow to formulate plans for the new Money Market 
Deposit Accounts (MMDAs).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home and auto sales have picked up in the Ninth District. Our last 
Redbook report indicated that, in October, reduced mortgage rates 
had increased the number of people looking at homes--but not the 
number buying. In November, home sales actually picked up. According 
to the Minneapolis Board of Realtors, home sales in Minneapolis and 
its suburbs increased 20 percent between October and November, a 
period during which home sales normally decline. Also, regional 
sales managers for domestic auto manufacturers indicate that in 
November district car sales improved. One says that last month his 
company's 10.9 percent finance rate helped reduce inventories of 
1982 models 50 percent. A director reports that, thanks to the 
pickup in car sales, most Montana car dealers showed a profit in 
November, for the first time in many months.
     </p>
     <p>
      General merchandise sales have also improved somewhat. Two 
Minneapolis-St. Paul retailers report that their sales increased 
modestly between October and November, but that post-Thanksgiving 
shopping was slower than normal. They attribute this to changed 
shopping habits; consumers are now delaying purchases until 
retailers cut prices just before Christmas. Thus, these retailers 
are planning pre-Christmas sales and expect this December to be 
better than last year's. Directors, however, report that many 
retailers outside the Twin Cities hope to just match last year's 
holiday sales. This glum outlook in many parts of the district is 
directly due to the long- depressed iron mining and farming 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pickup in consumer spending has started to carry over to a few 
manufacturers. Reflecting the recent improvement in retail sales, 
new orders of microwave ovens increased markedly at one 
manufacturer. A spokesperson for a large meat packing company in 
southern Minnesota, which recently opened a new plant, reports that 
business has been better lately than expected. This firm plans to 
hire additional people. Due to the upturn in home sales, orders 
increased at a large manufacturer of windows and doors and another 
of ceiling tiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most district manufacturing concerns, however, have remained in the 
doldrums. Eleven of the 23 largest manufacturers headquartered in 
the district report third quarter sales below those a year ago. 
Particularly hard hit have been producers of industrial equipment. A 
firm making construction and material handling equipment reports 
that its order backlog shrank from $150 million at the beginning of 
the year to $50 million in early December. A representative for a 
company producing industrial controls and painting equipment 
indicates that an anticipated pickup in new orders has not yet 
materialized. In fact, new orders have declined, leaving its current 
inventories at higher than desired levels. Growth rates have slowed 
even at computer and other high technology firms, where sales are 
generally increasing, according to a Minneapolis security analyst 
who follows this industry group.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capacity utilization data can provide some insight on the 
performance of the manufacturing sector. These data aren't available 
at the district level, but we can infer some information from 
differences in the structure of manufacturing between the district 
and nation and from anecdotal evidence. Approximately 45 percent of 
district manufacturing is concentrated in two industriesâ€”machinery 
and food processingâ€”compared to 30 percent in these industries 
nationally. Moreover, within the machinery group, computer 
manufacturing is about three times more important to the district 
than to the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to our recent conversations with industry spokespeople, 
the district's capacity utilization rates are currently well above 
the nation's in both the machinery and food processing industries. 
In machinery manufacturing, where the national utilization rate is 
67 percent, the district rate is higher; our contacts indicate that 
most district computer manufacturers lately have been operating at 
near capacity. Conversations with representatives of large district 
food processors indicate that their capacity utilization rates are 
also above the nation's 80 percent capacity utilization rate for the 
industry. The district's remaining manufacturing industries are a 
diverse group, and for them, capacity utilization rates my not be 
too different than the national rates, at least not on average. 
Therefore, based on the structural differences between the district 
and nation and on the anecdotal evidence, the district's current 
capacity utilization rate for manufacturing is almost surely above 
the nation's 68 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      This same approach may be used to examine capacity utilization in 
metal mining. Iron mining accounts for 75 percent of metal mining 
locally, compared to 20 percent nationally, and copper mining 
accounts for much of the rest of Ninth District metal mining. In 
September, capacity utilization for district iron mining was around 
10 percent, when only two or three out of eleven mines were 
producing. Utilization is somewhat higher now because several 
additional iron ore mines resumed partial operation in October. And 
two more Minnesota iron mines plan to resume operation in early 
1983. Even so, an industry official reportedly expects capacity 
utilization in iron mining next year to average only 55 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Current capacity utilization in district copper mining is also very 
low. The one mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was 
indefinitely shut down in early October. And, in Montana, only a 
small amount of copper is being produced, because the state's one 
large mine was closed permanently earlier this year. Based on the 
local mining industry's heavy concentration in iron and copper 
(especially iron) and on the extremely low output levels for both 
metals, it is virtually certain that the district's capacity 
utilization rate in metal mining is well below the nation's 40 
percent rate. Moreover, it seems likely that this situation will 
continue well into 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although recent weather conditions were favorable, agriculture has 
remained depressed. Our last Redbook report said farmers were 
concerned that wet weather would interfere with the harvest. 
recently, however, the weather has been good for harvesting, and as 
of November 28, the USDA reports, 84 percent of the corn and 97 
percent of the soybeans were harvested in Minnesota. But 
agricultural prices remain troubling. In November, Minneapolis cash 
prices for corn and soybeans were, respectively, 4 and 9 percent 
below levels a year ago; and South St. Paul cash prices for feeder 
and slaughter cattle in November were down 5 and 1 percent, 
respectively. Hogs remain a bright spot in district agriculture: in 
late November their price was up 25 percent from a year earlier. 
Dairy farms have been doing relatively well also. According to an 
industry analyst, however, the federal government's assessment of 50 
cents per hundredweight of milk produced has put a "good dent" in 
dairy farmers' income. This assessment began December 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank lending has remained weak. In November loans at district banks 
and S&amp;Ls were essentially unchanged from their lackluster October 
level. Part of the reason for this sluggishness is that district 
corporations have increased their use of the primary securities 
markets, and in some instances, they have been using these funds to 
reduce bank debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sluggish loan demand may explain the response of local firms to the 
new MMDAs: most have not been aggressively promoting them. Another 
explanation, according to our telephone survey of district banks and 
S&amp;Ls;, is that they are waiting for the DIDC's directive on the Super 
NOW account. They are also frustrated with the short implementation 
period for the new MMDAs. In fact, most of the banks and S&amp;Ls; say 
they haven't decided yet about the new MMDAs or are "waiting to see 
what the competition will do."
