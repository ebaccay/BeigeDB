      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       Business activity in the Second District was mixed in October. 
Retail sales strengthened during the month, reflecting extensive 
promotional activity. Foreign car sales picked up, while the slump 
in domestic car sales deepened. No turnaround is expected on the 
domestic side until late spring. Outside the consumer sector, some 
signs of a weak pickup have been reported in chemicals, machine 
tools, and paper and packaging products. The respondents, for the 
most part, expect a slight upturn in the fourth quarter, but do not 
anticipate any major economic recovery until the second half of 
1981. On the financial side, business loans at New York City banks 
have declined since mid-October. In the mortgage market, rates have 
stabilized recently after rising sharply in September and early 
October.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales in the Second District have generally strengthened 
during October. Sales for the month as a whole, both in the New York 
metropolitan area and upstate, were in line with or in a few cases 
even exceeded retailers' expectations, and inventories were 
considered satisfactory. Although the heavy promotional activity 
during this period was cited as the reason for much of the brisk 
sales, some underlying strength in consumer spending was perceived, 
especially for soft goods. Comparisons between the city and suburban 
stores were mixed in most instances. Similarly, the volume of cash 
and credit sales did not follow any pattern with the relative vigor 
of each varying from store to store. Retailers voiced some concern 
over November sales because of the late Thanksgiving but are 
planning for a strong Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automobile sales in the Second District were mixed in October, with 
foreign car sales outperforming domestic. Foreign car sales were 
reported to be about as strong as in the comparable month last year 
with prospects for further improvement in November. In contrast, 
domestic car sales are below the volume a year ago, and the slump is 
expected to continue at least until late spring. Rising auto prices 
combined with shrinking discretionary income were cited as making 
consumer spending cautious so that only lower priced, leftover-1980 
models appear to be selling. Consequently, the domestic dealers 
contacted expect more dealerships to close. Wherever possible, 
inventories at the dealer level have been kept intentionally lean. 
Auto makers voiced concern that any further downturn in sales might 
place some capital spending plans in jeopardy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Manufacturing Sector
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Outside the consumer sector, there are slight signs of improvement. 
Some pickup in orders for chemicals has occurred, in part because 
improving conditions in the steel industry have increased demand for 
chemical products used as inputs in steel production. Orders for 
steel increased in August and September but remained flat during 
October. Further advances are expected during the coming months, 
principally for customers' inventory rebuilding. Some improvements 
were noted in paper and packaging products but this was felt to be 
largely due to advance buying to avoid expected price increases, 
rather than any strong recovery in underlying demand. Some machine 
tool makers are reporting strengthening sales, though for some 
companies shipments continue to outpace orders and full recovery in
the industry is not anticipated before late 1981.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Economic Outlook
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The outlook of most District respondents remains somewhat bearish. 
Although most expect some upturn in consumer spending in the fourth 
quarter, they still expect relatively weak growth through the first 
half of 1981. Several respondents suggested that this is going to be 
a W-shaped recession because the economic fundamentals do not 
warrant a sustained recovery. The second downturn is expected to be 
seen first in the housing sector where permits began to weaken in 
October. Higher interest rates were cited as the principal cause of 
a weakening housing market, but the decline is not expected to be as 
sharp as earlier in the year. Respondents also observed that capital 
spending has shown no definite signs of recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Business loans at New York City banks have been weak since mid-
October, in contrast to a large increase in loans at banks outside 
the Second District. In the mortgage market, rates seemed to have 
stabilized at about 14 percent. The Federal override of the mortgage 
usury ceiling has resulted in the first sale of pass-through 
securities by a New York mutual savings bank-a $10 million private 
placement with three life insurance companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Panel
       </strong>
       <br/>
       This month we have comments from Henry Kaufman (Salomon Bros.), 
James O'Leary (U.S. Trust), and Robert Stone (Irving Trust). Their 
views of course are personal, not institutional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kaufman: While real GNP will probably increase at an annual rate of 
at least 3 percent in this quarter, a slowing in the pace of the 
recovery is likely in the 1st quarter of 1981, reflecting the impact 
of higher interest rates and increases in the Social Security tax. 
In the credit market, another wave of new corporate bond offerings 
is likely to hit the market in the early part of next year when 
short-term interest rates are likely to decline for a short period 
of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. O'Leary: We are in the midst of a broad revolutionary change in 
the long-term capital marketsâ€”a sharp reduction in the availability 
of funds for investment in straight, long-term fixed-rate bonds and 
mortgages. Since most investors are convinced that the upward trend 
of inflation and of interest rates will continue, there will 
continue to be a very high-risk premium in the yields on these 
instruments and the long-term, fixed-rate markets will continue to 
be subject to great volatility. The need for the Federal Reserve to 
persist in its determination to pursue a policy designed to reduce 
the inflation rate and to defuse the expectation of inflation is
thus most urgent. It is imperative that the new Republican 
Administration aid the monetary authorities with real fiscal 
restraint and other long-term policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Stone: Member bank borrowings have now reached levels that 
should enable the Fed to achieve success in its effort to slow the 
aggregates sufficiently to meet its longer term growth target. 
Success could probably be assured by holding borrowings at or 
slightly above current levels for another three to four weeks. As 
markets begin to perceive such success, short rates will drop very 
rapidlyâ€”probably by 100 to 150 basis points, which I judge to be 
the amount of expectational fluff now in the market. Rates would 
then work lower over the balance of the year, closing well below 
present levels. I do not believe that the economy will experience a 
double dip. We are, however, likely to see a pause some time within 
the next months, and this will reinforce the decline in interest 
rates.
