      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Improving weather conditions brought a return to more normal 
    economic conditions in the Southeast. Restoration of natural gas 
    supplies to most industries returned most employees to their jobs. A 
    survey of manufacturers and distributors found only minor 
    disruptions of sources of supplies and raw materials. In addition, 
    only a few firms report alterations in their investment plans as a 
    result of the natural gas shortage. The effects of severe weather 
    lingered in some parts of the District economy, particularly in 
    agriculture. Port activity seems to be increasing in the Southeast.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the aftermath of the natural gas shortage, supplies were restored 
    in late February to 3,300 small- and medium-sized industrial users 
    who had been without gas supplies since January 19. About 500 large 
    industrial plants with interruptible service remained without gas. 
    As a result, U. S. Steel in Birmingham began recalling 1,250 
    employees, about one-third of its work force. In late February, only 
    about 7,000 persons remained unemployed in Georgia as a result of 
    the shortage, compared to a 55,000 maximum at the peak of the 
    crisis.
     </p>
     <p>
      A special survey of southeastern manufacturing and distributive 
    industries conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta finds 
    that few firms have experienced serious shortages as a result of 
    weather and gas-related production cuts. In most cases, delivery 
    delays for supplies and raw materials have been temporary or have 
    been alleviated by locating alternate sources. Some modest delays in 
    textile deliveries are noted. One manufacturer of ammonia for whom 
    natural gas is a feedstock experienced curtailed production and has 
    reduced allocations to customers. Few firms indicated any intention 
    to liberalize inventory policies. Manufacturers were also asked 
    whether they intend to invest in equipment to provide alternate fuel 
    capacity and if such investments would curtail previously scheduled 
    investments. Very few firms indicate that investment in alternate 
    fuel systems is planned. In Louisiana, this reflects the reliability 
    of natural gas purchased at higher prices in the intrastate market. 
    A few firms responded that they are planning to convert to coal. In 
    Mississippi, most large firms already have alternate supplies. Many 
    smaller firms indicate that their plan, in the event of a cutoff of 
    natural gas, is simply to shut down. There is little indication of 
    postponement of other plans for capital investment as a result of 
    investment in alternative fuel systems, except for the largest fuel 
    consuming plants. The necessity to invest in pollution-reducing 
    equipment is regarded as a greater deterrent to investments in 
    expanded productive capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The effects of harsh winter weather could also be seen in reports 
    from Mississippi and Louisiana of falling shrimp production due to 
    weather conditions which inhibited the growth and movement of fish 
    in the region's estuaries. In addition, fire damages have greatly 
    increased in Georgia's forests. The weather severity has killed most 
    of the vegetation in pastures and timberland, leaving vegetation in 
    an unusually flammable condition and contributing to the severity of 
    fire losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The livestock industry is another area of the District economy still 
    feeling the aftereffects of the weather. Reports from throughout the 
    District stress the increased cost of cattle raising. Winter 
    pastures have developed very slowly as a result of weather 
    conditions, necessitating high costs of purchased feed and increased 
    labor costs associated with feeding. Weight gains have been 
    subnormal. The outlook in some areas is now improving, as pastures 
    develop and permit transferring cattle to pastures from purchased 
    feed. Poultry producers are also feeling the pinch of higher heating 
    costs, lower gains in weight, and a reduced percentage of eggs 
    hatched. However, these declines may aid producers in stabilizing 
    their prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Florida report indicates that reduction of the anticipated bumper 
    crop of citrus fruit will benefit producers whose crops are still 
    salable and unsold. Considerable pressure on prices had been feared 
    before the freeze. Oranges, which froze and split open, are 
    providing lower juice yields due to evaporation losses. Damage to 
    trees is said to be light, so an average crop is foreseen for next 
    year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many cotton growers in Mississippi plan to reduce cotton plantings, 
    while only a small number intend to increase production, according 
    to soundings taken in recent agricultural meetings. However, the 
    relationship between cotton and soybean future prices as planting 
    season approaches remains a crucial determinant of actual planting 
    decisions. There is little current interest in forward contracting 
    for the 1977 crop as a result of farmers' belief that insufficient 
    planting will force the price upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity at ports in the Southeast is growing. Tonnage of cargo in 
    New Orleans has declined slightly in comparison to year-ago levels. 
    But Pascagoula, Mississippi, reports a new tonnage record set for 
    the fifth consecutive year, primarily because of increased handling 
    of petroleum and grain products. In Jacksonville, port tonnage is 
    also rising. The Port of Tampa is undertaking an ambitious expansion 
    program, beginning with widening and deepening the main channel into 
    Tampa Bay to accommodate larger ships. This enlargement is expected 
    to lead to large increases in phosphate shipments. Plans for the 
    next five years call for constructing a roll-on/roll-off berth to 
    allow easier loading of ships by trucking the cargo directly onto 
    them. Specialized facilities for ship repair and handling of dry and 
    liquid bulk cargoes are also envisioned. Within ten years, expanded 
    general cargo wharves and a bulk petroleum dock are to be added.
