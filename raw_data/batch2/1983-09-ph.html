      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District point to mixed economic conditions 
in September. The strength in activity remains centered in the 
manufacturing and retail sectors, where surprisingly robust growth 
has continued this month. Loan volume at area financial 
institutions, however, has weakened recently, and is mixed. Activity 
in the housing market continues to nose downward as mortgage rates 
rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District contacts foresee general improvement in business 
activity over the next six months. Both retail and manufacturing 
executives project healthy gains into 1984, although a slowdown in 
growth is anticipated. Local bankers are forecasting a sluggish 
upturn in lending activity and interest rates by next March. The 
outlook for housing is not bright, however, especially if mortgage 
rates continue to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District housing activity has slowed again in the last six 
weeks, but business is still well above last September's depressed 
levels. Housing sales and new starts are reported to be off by 
between 25 percent and 75 percent from their spring and early-summer 
highs, and traffic of prospective buyers has also fallen 
significantly. Builders and realtors contacted attribute the slide 
to a combination of seasonal pressure and the continued escalation 
of mortgage rates, which have risen about 50 basis points since 
early August. Many real estate brokers indicate that a drop of 
between 50 basis points and 200 basis points is needed to restore 
strength to the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to the September Business Outlook Survey indicate that 
Third District industrial activity has picked up the pace of its 
upward advance this month. September returns reveal the most 
widespread improvement iii general business conditions this year. 
Both new orders and shipments are up significantly over August 
levels, and producers' backlogs have increased at many factories, as 
well. Production activity has increased enough to prompt many 
employers to add to payrolls and to lengthen the average workweek.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the vigorous expansion currently underway in the 
manufacturing sector, survey respondents' outlooks have mellowed 
somewhat this month. Two-thirds of the participating businessmen 
expect further improvement in industrial activity over the next six 
months, fewer than at anytime in the last year. Climbing levels of 
new orders and shipments are still forecast, although not as 
strongly as in recent months, and further expansion of the factory 
workforce and working hours are planned. Capital expenditure plans 
are still fairly weak, but solid growth in inventories by the end of 
the first quarter is projected. Overall, survey respondents 
obviously expect the recovery to continue, but they seem to be 
indicating a slower rate of expansion over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices in the manufacturing sector continue to drift upward, but 
survey results indicate that, on average, the pace remains slower 
than in the past. Roughly one-third of the participating businessmen 
report paying higher input prices since August, and another sixth 
have raised their final products' prices this month. Further 
increases in industrial prices are likely by March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales activity at Philadelphia area department stores has remained 
in excellent shape through August and into September. In fact, the 
growth in the dollar volume of sales over year-earlier figures has 
once again pushed into the double digit range, much higher than 
merchants had anticipated. Very dry weather, rising consumer 
optimism, and timely promotional offerings have combined to step up 
the pace of retail spending. According to retailers, "back-to-
school" and other seasonal soft goods are moving especially well, 
and most other lines are not far behind.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area merchants predict that consumer spending will be healthy in 
early 1984 but that sales growth will settle down to more modest 
levels near year-end. Following a "reasonable" holiday season, gains 
of four percent to five percent over a year-earlier are expected for 
the first quarter of 1984. The cheery forecast has encouraged store 
operators to be less cautious about inventories, and stock levels, 
which are currently a little higher than a year ago, have notched 
some growth since August. Contacts indicate, however, that any 
further inventory growth will be carefu1ly controlled.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Local bankers say lean activity at major banks in the Third District 
is mixed again this month. C&amp;I loan activity has been "unexpectedly 
quiet" since early August. Current reports on business loan volume 
range from 11 percent below to 14 percent above a year ago, much the 
same as they were six weeks ago. According to contacts, increased 
corporate profits have sufficiently improved cash flow at many 
companies, permitting more internal financing and preventing any 
real firming of commercial loan demand. Loan activity on the retail 
side continues to improve, but recent gains are not as strong as 
earlier in the year. Although consumer lending is now as much as 11 
percent ahead of last September, lenders say rising interest rates 
have taken some of the edge off the demand for consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area banking officials foresee gradual improvement in overall 
lending activity over the next six months. C&amp;I loan demand is 
expected to gain strength slowly through next March as commercial 
investment expands beyond the funds available internally. Most 
bankers also predict that consumer demand for credit will expand 
further despite the likelihood of slightly higher interest rates. 
Many lenders plan to maintain their aggressive marketing posture.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate charged by major Third District banks has risen to 11 
percent in September from 10.5 percent in early August. Local seers 
are predicting that, because of positive reports on inflation and 
the money supply, upward movement in interest rates over the next 
six months will remain sluggish.. They are forecasting an increase 
in the prime and most other rates of between 50 basis points and 75 
basis points by the end of the first quarter as both private and 
government borrowing expand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows have weakened somewhat in September, but bankers 
attribute most of the decline to season factors. Demand deposits 
have slipped slightly, and are now only one percent to two percent 
ahead on a year-over-year basis. Growth in time and savings deposits 
has slowed as well, but deposit levels have maintained their sizable 
spreads over
      <br/>
      pre-MMDA levels.
