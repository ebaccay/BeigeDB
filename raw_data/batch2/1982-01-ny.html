      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District remained sluggish through 
the end of the year. Few respondents reported a further decline, but 
none believed that an upturn had begun. For retailers, the Christmas 
season ended on a surprisingly strong note, though with the recent 
bad weather sales have fallen off substantially. Manufacturing 
activity continued generally weak, with some firms cutting their 
work forces and capital spending. The only industry reporting 
additional declines in orders, however, was capital goods 
manufacturing. Conditions in the construction industry remained 
mixed, with the housing market still depressed and the 
nonresidential market buoyant. Looking to 1982, most business 
economists expect a first quarter decline, followed by a consumer-
led recovery in the spring. On the financial side, the demand for 
business loans stayed high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After a slow start, the holiday selling season picked up momentum, 
with a surprisingly strong surge as Christmas approached, and most 
department stores wound up exceeding their December goals. While 
merchants were worried that pre-Christmas promotions and markdowns 
would cut into January sales, inclement weather has proved to be a 
more serious problem, causing business to drop sharply at most 
establishments. According to the retailers contacted, only a small 
proportion of these weather-related sales losses are likely to be 
recouped. Nevertheless, inventories are generally considered to be 
in satisfactory condition, and respondents have become less 
pessimistic about the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing remained depressed, but there was some evidence that 
the bottom may be near. Electronics firms reported that sales had 
stabilized at a low level or increased slightly, and some other 
companies recorded small gains in orders. A manufacturer of 
aerospace equipment cited strong demand from the defense sector 
again this month. Only producers of machinery and machine tools 
experienced additional deterioration in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Work forces were reduced further by some concerns through attrition 
or layoffs. Despite press reports of widespread moderation of wage 
demands, the only respondent engaged in labor negotiations reported 
aggressive bargaining by its union. Other businessmen from upstate 
New York noted examples of wage settlements near 10 percent. 
Businesses have become more selective in their capital spending, and 
a few have trimmed their plans. Inventories have generally been held 
to desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity continued to be very low in the residential 
sector, yet generally strong in the nonresidential sector. 
Homebuilders were still reluctant to begin work without a signed 
order in hand. Sales of existing homes remained stalled, except for 
those in the very high- priced bracket. Housing prices were reported 
to have softened. As for nonresidential construction, one major 
project recently got under way in New York City and plans for others 
are apparently proceeding normally. Also in New York City, 
conversion of industrial lofts to office uses has not abated. In 
suburban areas, the healthy rate of commercial construction was 
maintained, although developers were relying increasingly on joint 
ventures among themselves to overcome financing difficulties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business economists continue to forecast a small decline in real GNP 
during the first quarter of 1982. Most feel that stronger consumer 
spending will fuel a modest rebound as early as the spring. 
Anticipated declines in interest rates are expected to spur 
investment, housing, and the automobile industry, adding momentum to 
the recovery. If interest rates do not fall, however, the upswing 
will likely be delayed, according to the respondents. Inflation 
projections have been lowered about a percentage point, with a 7 to 
8 percent rise now predicted for 1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending officers at the major New York City banks reported that last 
month's moderate to heavy demand for business loans has not 
subsided. Commercial and industrial loans booked at international 
banking facilities (IBFs) added to the growth. Although the sluggish 
economy has restrained overall credit demand, short-term bank loans 
are expected to remain strong as long as long-term bond rates are 
high. Corporate mergers have contributed to the steady activity at 
some banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from David Jones (Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; 
Co.), James O'Leary (U.W. Trust), and Donald Riefler (Morgan 
Guaranty): Their views, of course, are personal and not 
institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jones: The financial markets are in a highly unsettled state and 
near-term conditions are likely to get worse before they get better. 
Contributing to this volatile market environment are growing 
uncertainties over near-term Federal Reserve policy intentions. 
Increases in the Federal funds rate are serving to destabilize the 
bond market and to push longer term rates back up to record levels. 
Adding to the market gloom, are prospects for continued heavy 
Federal Government borrowing. At the same time, short-term business 
credit demand remains puzzlingly strong--perhaps reflecting 
unintended inventory accumulation, liquidity strains, and the 
inability to fund already excessive short-term debt in the bond 
market. The result could be an intensifying credit crunch for all 
but the most creditworthy business borrowers and for state and local 
governments.
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Leary: The national economy is in a "trap" caused by the inflation 
of the past sixteen years, with the expectations it has created, and 
the Federal deficit. The huge deficit for this year and apparently 
for years to come negates the helpful influence which the financial 
markets should be receiving from the promising decline in the core 
inflation rate. Volatility in the markets is bound to continue, with 
long rates on average remaining very high. Any recovery is apt to be 
weak and short lived, and for the foreseeable future growth is 
almost certain to be very low, at best, and unemployment very high. 
This spells rising political pressure on the Fed to pour money into 
the economy which would be a disaster. The only basic way out is a 
major change in policy which will offer real assurance that this 
year and beyond the Federal deficit will be reduced to more 
reasonable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: Loan demand has shown some signs of tapering off at Morgan 
Guaranty since the peak was reached late in November. Although we 
continue to view the economy as weak, we are reassured by the Fed's 
relative quick resistance to excessive monetary growth and believe 
this will have a positive effect on longer-term fixed income 
markets. We do not believe that short-term rates are headed back to 
1980-81 highs, but are keeping our fingers crossed.
