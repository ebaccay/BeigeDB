      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the third quarter well advanced it appears that 
economic activity in the Seventh District is still declining. Signs 
of improvement noted in the spring have evaporated. Consumer 
purchases are very slow in virtually all sectors. Capital goods 
producers, almost without exception, are cutting output further. 
More plants are being closed, many permanently. Motor vehicle sales 
continue well below expectations. Normal vacation shutdowns commonly 
have been extended. Financial problems are increasing for many 
lenders and borrowers. Residential construction is at a postwar low 
with no revival in sight, and nonresidential plans are being scaled 
down. Demand for workers is weak, but many unions adamantly oppose 
significant concessions, and most nonunion employers are increasing 
compensation. Analysts were shocked by recent USDA predictions of 
record crops, which threaten the financial health of agriculture. 
Farmland values are continuing an unprecedented postwar decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Stress
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Revelations of the extent of problem loans of the 
District's largest bank sent a chill wind through the financial and 
business community. Most large banks have special teams monitoring 
existing loans, and new loans are being scrutinized very closely. 
First-half losses of some of the largest S&amp;Ls would wipe out their 
book net worth if not checked in the second half. (Actual net worth, 
taking into account current market values, is rarely mentioned.) 
Many business and agricultural bankruptcies would result if lenders 
chose strictly to enforce loan contracts. Liquidations of retailing 
and manufacturing establishments without bankruptcy are frequent. A 
number of capital goods firms are planning to consolidate two or 
more plants, with the survivor likely to be a newer facility in the 
Sunbelt.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Expenditures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Machinery and equipment production is 
declining or remaining at very low levels, depending on the type. 
Demand for equipment for construction, agriculture, industry, 
utilities, and transportation is at very low levels. Orders for all 
types of capital goods were poor in the second quarter, and some 
producers reported a further drop in July and early August. Forging 
and casting operations are off 50 percent or more from last year and 
dropping further. Employees of 40 to 50 years experience at some 
capital goods companies "have never seen anything like this." Some 
firms that normally only manufacture complete machines are seeking 
repair or retrofit jobs. Over half of the freight car plants are now 
closed, and with orders near zero, the ratio may rise to 90 percent 
by year-end. Construction engineering firms have reduced staff, and 
plant location advisers have relatively few new projects. These 
developments suggest that the capital expenditure slump will be long 
extended.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumers are not leading the Seventh District 
out of its recession. Large general merchandise retailers report 
dollar sales about equal to last year in July and early August in 
dollars, and significantly lower in real terms. Customers generally 
respond only to price cutting and strong promotions. The only 
consistently strong line is auto repair and service, reflecting the 
fact that people are holding on to cars longer. Airline traffic in 
July was 8 percent below March, seasonally adjusted, because of 
reduced vacation travel. Resort areas have much larger vacancies 
than in past years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Negotiations
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unions are strongly resisting attempts of 
management to obtain concessions on wages, benefits, and work rules. 
On August 1, just after negotiations broke off in the steel 
industry, contract provisions automatically boosted average total 
compensation of production workers by about 75 cents per hour to 
$22.50. (Over one-third represents nontaxable benefits.) This 
multiplies out to almost $47,000 per year. For Ford and GM the 
comparable figure is almost $45,000. Chrysler workers have rejected 
virtually all new management proposals to cut costs and are 
demanding a return to "parity." Various managements dependent on 
autos and steel have decided that survival for their corporations 
requires scaling down operations, diversification into unrelated 
fields, and turning to foreign sources for major components such as 
engines and transmissions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction continues near rock bottom with 
the year 1982 now "written off for lost." New units being built, in 
the main, are either ordered by well-financed buyers or are 
subsidized rental units. Used home sales are very slow. One survey 
indicates that actual selling prices in the Chicago area, adjusted 
for special lending terms, are down 8 percent from last year, but 
there are reports of auctions bringing cuts of 25 percent or more. 
Average quoted mortgage rates on conventional loans are 16.5 to 17 
percent, but almost no loans are being made on these terms. Most 
lending activity involves short-term loans, "blended rates" and 
second mortgages. There are reports of "balloon" notes coming due 
with refinancing difficult to arrange.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Vacancy rates for first-class downtown 
Chicago office space increased sharply in the second quarter. New 
space is coming on the market rapidly, and needs of some renters are 
shrinking. Some proposed new buildings, put up for bids only 
recently, have been postponed or canceled. Leasing agents are 
offering attractive concessions to sign tenants, suggesting the 
downtown building boom is collapsing. The suburbs have had 
substantial excess office space for at least a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop prices had declined in recent weeks in 
anticipation of bumper corn and soybean harvests. Nevertheless, 
analysts were surprised by the very large production estimates 
released August 11 by the USDA. Excepting Iowa, record corn and 
soybean harvests are forecast for all District states. The five 
District states account for 55 percent of the nation's corn and over 
40 percent of its soybeans. The implications of the large crop 
forecasts for District farmers, agricultural lenders, and 
agribusiness are ominous. Already burdensome carryover stocks of 
corn and soybeans will rise substantially, and crop prices, at 
unprofitable levels for several months, are likely to decline 
further. Because of limited compliance with the government's program 
only a small portion of the corn crop will be eligible for CCC price 
support loans. District farmland values, off 10 percent in the past 
year, probably will decline further. Farm equipment sales probably 
will remain depressed.
