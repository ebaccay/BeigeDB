      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Recent business reports present a mixed picture. Car sales have been 
strong, but consumer spending for other goods lacks momentum. While 
housing continues to boom in Florida, residential markets are 
softening elsewhere. Deposit inflows have been sluggish and loan 
growth, moderate. Nonresidential construction and real estate are 
increasingly active, tourist traffic has been at or near record 
levels, and the agricultural situation is healthy. Tight oil 
supplies have caused some relatively minor problems in the most 
vulnerable industries. Other troubles have restrained production in 
some sectors but look to be temporary, and, in general, 
manufacturing output and employment are advancing. Inventories 
appear to be well in hand at all marketing stages.
        <p>
         Retail sales have been steady but unspectacular—slightly above the 
year-earlier pace in physical volume—and stocks of general 
merchandise are reported to be near desired levels. Several 
directors noted that consumers have grown more cautious in the past 
few weeks, particularly with regard to big-ticket purchases. 
However, new car sales have improved substantially after a stagnant 
January. Renewed interest in smaller, fuel-efficient models has 
brought record business to many import dealers. Except for shortages 
of some diesel models, auto inventories appear adequate and well-
balanced.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reports on housing markets have been widely mixed. The Florida boom 
continues virtually without let-up. Sales have been amazingly strong 
in 1979 to date, breaking records with extravagant gains from the 
year-earlier rate. Inventories are thin, acutely so for apartments. 
Condominium projects are sold before completion and command long 
waiting lists, encouraging speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Realtors continue to comment on the heavy volume of foreign money, 
particularly Latin American and Canadian, that is flowing into new 
residential ventures in the state. Permanent financing is readily 
available to qualified Florida borrowers; since the recent exemption 
of thrift institutions from a 10-percent usury cap, mortgage 
interest rates have risen rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Elsewhere in the District, observers note varying degrees of 
weakening in housing markets. Demand is holding up well in the 
Atlanta area, but the gradual decline in mortgage loan commitments 
is likely to continue until the legislature acts on the proposed 
liberalization of the interest rate ceiling. In Alabama, 
Mississippi, and Louisiana, markets have softened somewhat, with 
slight increases in inventories and continued tightening of 
financing terms. The availability of funds is more a problem to 
builders than to buyers, however. Tennessee has seen a rather sharp 
slowdown in home sales and starts. While its legislature continues 
to debate the raising of the usury ceiling, which is strictly 
binding only on savings and loan associations at the present, 
mortgage money has become rather scarce.
        </p>
        <p>
         Deposit inflows have been rather weak at both banks and thrifts, 
with only the most competitive instruments (CDs and money market 
certificates) showing gains. Loan growth has been moderate, with 
business credit requests steady and consumer demand for auto loans 
particularly strong.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonresidential construction activity is vigorous, and the list of 
recent announcements and contract awards is quite long. Demand for 
commercial properties, particularly retail outlets, has been brisk. 
All of the District's ports are presently undertaking major 
improvements, and expansion of tourist facilities is generating 
substantial construction revenues.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another record winter tourist season appears to be in the making. 
All parts of Florida report no vacancies, heavy advance bookings, 
and saturation of tourist attractions. Vacation spots in Louisiana 
and Tennessee are enjoying substantial increases in numbers of 
guests. The industry's outlook, however, has been clouded by 
uncertain fuel supplies. To date, the cancellation of a few air 
flights and spot outages of gasoline at stations affiliated with 
major oil companies have had little discernible impact on tourist 
traffic. Industry spokesmen feel that while a gas price increase 
would not take a serious toll, rationing or gas "holidays" would.
        </p>
        <p>
         An owner of a regional chain of independent gasoline stations 
complains that the present tight supply situation is the worst of 
all worlds, blaming the allocation and price control system. The 
disruption of Iranian supplies has cut his already low margins to 
half of last years s average or less. A real shortage, on the other 
hand, would be extremely profitable. A director reports that 
distributors in his area are filling their tanks to capacity when 
possible, a divergence from their usual practice of carrying a 
minimum and relying on dealers to deliver on short order. Some 
industrial buyers have been placed on allocation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Production levels have been well below capacity in a few operations. 
Alabama's coal industries have been on a short shift since its 
largest buyer, Alabama Power, met resistance from its regulators and 
pared its operations. Slow sales and a parts shortage have 
temporarily closed Ford's Hapeville, Georgia, LTD plant, idling 
3,400. A smattering of small plants in a variety of industries have 
been permanently shut down in recent weeks. However, the opening of 
new plants and strong orders has kept the industrial sector busy and 
hiring overall. Inventories are described as relatively low. Prices 
of raw materials, especially those derived from petrochemicals, have 
escalated alarmingly since the beginning of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The farm sector is possibly the brightest spot in the current 
picture. Weather conditions have been mostly favorable and prices 
strong. Farmers' borrowings have risen sharply, pointing to plans to 
expand acreage. Agribusinesses have large supplies which they fully 
expect to move.
        </p>
        <p>
         Businessmen's attitudes seem more divergent since the last report. 
The strong fourth-quarter 1978 performance has encouraged some 
optimism, especially among retailers. The oil supply question has 
been equally discouraging to others, adding to their continuing 
anxiety over inflation, high interest rates, and government 
regulations.
