      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions and the outlook in the Fourth District 
remain dismal. Unemployment is high and rising. Early December 
retail sales are sluggish. Little near-term improvement is seen for 
the automobile industry. The steel industry is in desperate 
condition. Survey results and leading indicators point to further 
contraction of manufacturing. House construction is showing only a 
little improvement. On the bright side, scattered indicators of 
disinflation continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment continues high and rising. The 
November unemployment rate was 14.2 percent (sa) in Ohio and 12.1 
percent in Pennsylvania. The District's eleven major SMSA's 
unemployment rates (nsa) in October ranged from 8.9 percent in 
Columbus to 19.7 percent in Youngstown, and averaged 3.2 percentage 
points above the national rate. The unemployment rate has reached 21 
percent in Lorain County, adjacent to Cleveland, as shipbuilding, 
automobile and steel industries have stagnated. The United Mine 
Workers union reports only 40 percent of active members in Ohio are 
working.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Two major department store chains in the Midwest 
report Christmas season sales are moderate to sluggish so far, 
perhaps because of unusually warm weather. Both expect real sales 
this season about 1 percent above the year-ago level. One chain 
reports inventories are somewhat high and expects it will take a 
record amount of price promotions to achieve their forecast; the 
other says inventories are smaller than usual and promotions won't 
be as aggressive as last year. Both expect sales volume to be 
concentrated closer to Christmas than in previous years because of a 
secular trend in that direction and because unseasonably warm 
weather has delayed sales of apparel. One chain expects real PCE to 
rise 4% (saar) this quarter from last and, assuming a continuation 
of automobile purchase incentives, to rise 2 1/2% in the first 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobiles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile inventory adjustment appears near completion 
but a near-term sales reduction is expected by industry economists. 
November sales were better than expected by one major producer, who 
believes some of the sales were borrowed from next quarter. The firm 
projects import and domestic sales at 7.4 million units (saar) next 
quarter, unless all domestic producers were to give sales incentives 
on 1983 models, in which case sales might reach 8.0 million. Current 
sales are divided about evenly between 1982 and 1983 models. 
Inventory will still be a little too high at year-end. The firm sees 
no change in inventory next quarter, and industry production will be 
only slightly above fourth quarter levels. Employee recalls to 
produce certain models will be offset by temporary layoffs from 
other model production facilities, so there will be little net 
increase in employment next quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another major automobile producer expects December sales will drop 
about 8 percent from November, partly because fewer of the popular 
1982 models are left. First quarter sales will be down slightly from 
this quarter, as sales incentives terminate at year-end. Production 
will rise somewhat next quarter to build inventories for second 
quarter sales, but seasonally adjusted, inventories will be flat. 
Some employees will be called back next quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      br&gt;
 Manufacturing activity continues to contract, 
although less rapidly than earlier in the year. A survey of 
purchasing managers reveals further reductions in inventories of raw 
materials, supplies, and finished goods. A record percentage of 
firms are purchasing production materials on a hand-to-mouth basis. 
The survey shows new orders, production, and employment continue to 
decline. A diversified producer of parts for cars, trucks, and 
materials handling equipment reports his orders are weak because 
many customers are canceling capital expansion plans. Orders for 
heavy trucks are the lowest since 1967. He expects no upturn in his 
business before 1983:IVQ. A producer of consumable equipment for the 
mining industry sees no sign of an upturn in orders. This bank's 
survey of Fourth District manufacturers shows December declines in 
new orders, shipments, backlogs, inventories, and employment, 
although the declines are expected to be somewhat smaller than in 
November. Indexes of leading indicators point to further decline in 
Pittsburgh but a bottoming in Cleveland. An index of leading 
indicators for the Pittsburgh area registered its 17th consecutive 
monthly decline in October, while the index for the Cleveland area 
has been advancing erratically and in September stood 2.5 percent 
above its April low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The steel industry is in severe distress. A major steel 
producer reports further declines in shipments, inventories, orders 
and employment. Fourth quarter shipments are expected to be less 
than 13 million tons for the industry, 29 percent below the 
depressed year-ago level, and orders received so far give no 
indication of first quarter improvement. Another major producer 
describes the market as ''unbelievably weak,'' and expects further 
drops in shipments and employment. The firm is operating at 20 
percent of capacity, with only one of twelve blast furnaces in 
operation, and is no longer certain of survival. The firm projects 
industry losses larger this quarter than last because shipments and 
transaction prices are lower. Steel mills are reducing inventories 
to generate cash as working capital continues to erode. Several 
firms plan to liquidate inventories, draw down lines of credit, and 
sell off assets to delay bankruptcy while waiting for economic 
recovery. Survival of some producers is contingent on economic 
recovery and strengthening of steel demand by mid-1983. Another firm 
reports stocks of oil country pipe are still high. Steel producers 
have sharply reduced capital expenditure plans, hurting steel mill 
equipment producers, who see no upturn in their sales before 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major builder of houses forecasts national housing 
starts of 1.3 million units in 1983, up from about 1.1 million this 
year. However, builders see a slower recovery in this District, 
where there are scattered reports of mild increases in house 
construction. In the Cleveland area, bankruptcies among contractors 
and building-material suppliers in 1982 are up 36 percent from last 
year, and will account for one-third of total corporate 
bankruptcies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Scattered indicators of disinflation continue. Retailers in 
Cleveland are offering unusually extensive pre-Christmas price 
reductions. Some Teamster Union locals in Cleveland have been 
bidding against each other with wage concessions to obtain 
employment, but steelworker union local presidents recently rejected 
concession adjustments to the current labor contract. Industrial 
vendors are reported to be offering deep discounts to obtain orders. 
A survey of purchasing managers reveals more price declines than 
increases, while a survey of manufacturers predicts prices they pay 
will not change from November to December.
