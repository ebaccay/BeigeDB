      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy continues on a firm upward path, according to this 
  month's district comments. Retail sales in general remain good, with 
  the sales of autos and other durables showing particular strength. 
  Factory orders continue to rise, and a building up of business 
  inventories could well be underway. At the same time, the capital 
  spending picture, while not exuberant, has brightened somewhat. 
  Residential construction remains very strong, but little evidence of 
  speculation is reported. The outlook for the 1977 harvest is, on 
  balance, favorable. In the financial area, the demand for consumer 
  and mortgage credit continues relatively strong, that for business 
  loans generally weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending generally continues to support the recovery, 
  although several districts report a mixed performance. Chicago 
  characterizes retail sales in its district as excellent, with sales 
  of appliances, domestic large cars and imported small cars 
  especially strong. Dallas reports department store sales as running 
  about 14 percent above year-earlier levels, with durable goods 
  selling especially well and retailers looking for a steady increase 
  for the rest of the year. Similarly, solid gains in consumer 
  spending were also reported in the New York, Minneapolis and San 
  Francisco districts. And Boston indicates that, after rather 
  disappointing performance in early May, retail sales gained 
  considerable strength in the second half of the month. On the more 
  restrained side, Cleveland reports a recent flattening in retail 
  sales, although new car sales remain strong if off somewhat from the 
  March and April pace. Richmond finds little change in total sales 
  during May, but some decline in sales of big ticket items, while 
  Atlanta reports that retail sales have turned spotty, although car 
  sales remain robust. Philadelphia finds the pace of sales mixed, but 
  generally below the expectation of retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing construction continues very strong, in virtually all 
  districts, and sharp increases in real estate prices, including 
  farmland, are widely noted. Against this background, district 
  reports address themselves to the question of the possible role of 
  speculation in the current real estate market. With few exceptions, 
  little or no evidence has been uncovered that speculation has been a 
  significant factor in that market. Comments from the San Francisco 
  district in general explain the sharp rise in housing prices as the 
  result of a surge of post-recession demand confronting a housing 
  supply reduced by the preceding recession. The influence of 
  speculation, however, is reported in Southern California, where 
  speculators may account for an estimated 20 percent of some markets.
  Scattered instances of possible speculation are also noted by 
  Philadelphia and Atlanta.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business sales and manufacturing activity continue strong. 
  Manufacturing respondents to the Philadelphia monthly survey report 
  that new orders and shipments are higher in June, and further 
  increases are expected. Similar sentiments were echoed by 
  respondents in the Richmond district survey. St. Louis reports that 
  manufacturing activity continues to register gains in sales and 
  orders over a wide range of industries, including the chemical, home 
  building products, and commercial aircraft industries. Dallas 
  mentions further gains in manufacturing output, and Minneapolis 
  reports that district manufacturing activity remains quite strong, 
  with manufacturers responding to its latest survey looking for year-over-year increase in sales of about 15 percent in the first half of 
  1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      Against this background, a period of modest inventory rebuilding may 
  be underway. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia district thus project 
  an increase in inventories over the balance of the year, and 
  Richmond reports that manufacturers? inventories, after remaining 
  flat for several months, are once again moving upward. San Francisco 
  reports that some industries, including aerospace and electronics, 
  are cautiously bringing inventories back to "normal" levels to 
  support higher production levels and sales. Minneapolis'
  manufacturers in general feel inventories to be in line with 
  expected sales, as are department store inventories in the Dallas 
  district. Similarly, Chicago reports inventories of some items, 
  mainly hard goods, to be below levels necessary to maximize sales. 
  Growing shortages of drilling equipment are mentioned by Dallas and 
  Atlanta.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reflecting the continued strength in manufacturing activity, 
  improvements in the labor market are reported by several Banks, 
  including Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago and Minneapolis. Growing 
  shortages of certain types of skilled workers are mentioned by St. 
  Louis (carpenters) and Dallas and Atlanta (oil drillers).
     </p>
     <p>
      Assessments of business capital spending generally remain cautious, 
  but on balance have become somewhat brighter. Among others, Boston 
  reports increased orders at machine tool manufacturers, as well as 
  an expansion in the investment plans of New England firms 
  themselves. Capital good producers in the Cleveland district expect 
  capital spending in 1977 to at least match that projected by the 
  latest Department of Commerce survey, in some instance to exceed it. 
  Chicago reports increased steel shipments to capital equipment 
  producers as well as a "well grounded" upswing in spending on such 
  equipment, although the strength of demand varies greatly among 
  industries, with construction leading the way. St. Louis reports 
  strong sales of machine tools, welding and cutting equipment, and 
  commercial aircraft. However, the proportion of manufacturers in the 
  Philadelphia survey anticipating increases in their capital spending 
  over the next six months declined somewhat. Several Banks including 
  Cleveland, Minneapolis and New York, mentioned the uncertainties 
  surrounding the energy program and/or environmental controls as 
  factors inhibiting capital outlays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the agricultural areas are generally good. Kansas City 
  reports that the wheat harvest now underway in that district is 
  expected to top the 1976 harvest by 15 percent, while Minneapolis 
  indicates that recent rains have eased concerns about the draught. 
  San Francisco, on the other hand, reports that the agricultural 
  sector in that district seems "resigned" to a less than good year, 
  while weather has adversely affected some crops in the Atlantic 
  district.
