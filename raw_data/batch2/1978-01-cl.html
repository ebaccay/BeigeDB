      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Nonautomotive retailers and steel producers in the Fourth District 
  are increasingly optimistic over sales prospects. Auto suppliers are 
  skeptical that domestic new car sales will pick up much from recent 
  rates. Steel production will be boosted this quarter partly because 
  of price hedge buying. Capital goods producers still expect a good 
  but not boom year. Continued slow growth in deposit flows is noted 
  by banks and thrift institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonautomotive retailers describe sales during December as excellent 
  and generally above expectations. Some department store officials 
  had expected year-over-year gains of 9 to 10 percent, but actually 
  recorded larger gains. An economist associated with a large 
  department store chain reported even larger gains for merchandise. 
  These retailers are increasingly optimistic in view of the sustained 
  rise in sales since last fall, but also point out that by spring 
  consumer preferences can again shift from general merchandise to 
  automobiles. Retailers are also pleased that sizable increases in 
  sales have pared inventories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prospects for new car sales and production are highly uncertain. Two 
  contrasting scenarios have surfaced: one views the reduced pace of 
  sales as temporary and associated with down-sizing of intermediate 
  cars by GMC; the other views the softening as a result of consumer 
  substitution of other goods for automobiles. According to the 
  former, as expressed by an economist with a major auto producer, 
  consumers are either buying smaller GMC cars or are holding on to 
  their cars a year longer. If sales in January do not pick up, auto 
  producers will sharply cut back production schedules for the balance 
  of this quarter. Some GMC auto dealers confirm consumer disinterest 
  for even the highly popular Oldsmobile Cutlass, which one dealer 
  described as smaller, lighter and 6 percent lower in price than the 
  1977 models.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto suppliers, especially steel and tire producers, have not 
  experienced major setbacks in orders from auto producers, except 
  from Chrysler and AMC. A major tire producer reported, however, that 
  GMC's January projection of car production this quarter was shaved 
  100,000 units to 2,485,000 cars. This tire maker has been skeptical 
  of sales and production projections by auto producers and has pared 
  the estimate to 2,250,000 million this quarter. They expect total 
  new car sales of 10.7 million this year and feel a comeback in auto 
  sales is unlikely because of the ample stock of new cars over the 
  past few years and the rapid buildup of consumer debt.
       </p>
       <p>
        The turnaround in steel operations that began last month has 
  accelerated under the impetus of price hedge buying. The February 1 
  increase in steel prices caused the bulge in orders for January 
  deliver. According to one steel economist, orders for February and 
  March shipments have not fallen as they usually have done after a 
  price increase. The steel price increases scheduled for February and 
  March have also had the effect of ending the most recent phase of 
  steel inventory liquidation. First quarter steel shipments are 
  expected to increase about 10 percent from the fourth quarter 1977. 
  Even at this higher level of shipments and production, however, 
  industry profits will probably be negligible this quarter. 
  Generally, steel economists were noncommittal about reference 
  pricing of steel, pending additional information. One executive with 
  a major steel producer, however, views the announced trigger prices 
  as low; and an industry economist is skeptical that these prices 
  will result in much of a rollback in steel imports. Another source 
  indicated that the talk about reference pricing may have deterred 
  some users from placing foreign orders beyond the first quarter of 
  1978. If anything, reference prices are more likely to have an 
  adverse effect on European steel producers than on the Japanese, who 
  still have a quality and price advantage over most steel producers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods producers expect business this year to be as good or 
  better than 1977, although there is still little sign that spending 
  for new plant capacity is accelerating. Exceptions are in 
  technically oriented industries, such as aerospace and 
  communications, where producers indicate a sharp step-up in spending 
  for new capacity. A communications and printing press producer has 
  been experiencing an order rate of about $1 billion compared with 
  sales of around $900 million and will boost capital expansion this 
  year. An aerospace and electronics producer expects to boost capital 
  spending by 40 percent from last year. On the other hand, a medium-
  sized chemical producer reported that they had no additional need 
  for capacity over the next few years in view of softness in prices, 
  ample capacity, and completion of expansion programs that were begun 
  a few years ago. Rubber producers will accelerate capital spending 
  this year because of need for additional radial tire capacity to 
  replace obsolete facilities and to improve productivity. A large 
  machinery producer reported the excavator machinery business is 
  still slow to recover and that increased orders for machine tools 
  are replacements for existing inefficient equipment with computer-controlled machinery.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no sign of early settlement of the coal strike. More than a 
  third of the industry in Eastern Kentucky, one of the largest coal 
  mining centers in the country, is shut down, and about 90 percent of 
  the mines in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania are down. A 
  director, who describes the strike as bitter, does not expect a 
  settlement before mid-February, although there will be growing 
  pressure to end the strike because pensions funds will be depleted. 
  Another source associated with a major coal producer expects the 
  union may drop the right-to-strike issue in return for increased 
  contributions by mine operators to the health and welfare fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Banks and thrift institutions report no signs of disintermediation, 
  although growth in time deposits and passbook savings accounts has 
  slowed. A large S&amp;L is concerned that outflows from passbook savings 
  accounts could occur if yields on 3-month Treasury bills exceed 7 
  percent. S&amp;Ls have been increasingly active in the secondary 
  mortgage market to support the high volume of mortgage loans. One 
  association reported that it sold over $50 million of mortgages in 
  1977, or 10 percent of its portfolio, in the secondary market. 
  Lenders, builders, and producers of home maintenance and building 
  materials continued to be cautiously optimistic over prospects for 
  new housing starts in 1978. One director expects new starts at 1.8 
  million units this year.
