     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity appears to have slowed in the Sixth District in 
October. Retailers' sales have weakened. The outlook for housing 
remains depressed, and foreclosures of builders and real estate 
firms have become more common. Industrial expansion continues for 
the District's high technology companies while other industries have 
registered little growth or are cutting back operations. Inventories 
are being kept quite lean. Bank lending has been anemic, businessmen 
seem wary of the volatile interest rate situation. Yield prospects 
for the District's late-growing crops have been further reduced due 
to continued dry weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity remains sluggish. 
Sales, for the most part, exceed last year's levels, but inflation 
has negated any real growth. A favorable trend that has persisted in 
the retail sector has been the apparent maintenance of a low level 
of credit delinquencies. Most merchants contacted are also 
experiencing a decrease in credit card sales. Retailers are stocking 
cautiously although we do hear some optimism about the approaching 
Christmas season. Some merchants, however, express fear that early 
shoppers will clean the shelves and reorders could be slow on 
delivery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparently, the incentive programs offered by the auto dealers have 
lost their effectiveness. New car sales have been extremely slow 
throughout the District. Most dealers were not optimistic about 
near-term prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for housing is bleak. Many 
builders do not expect substantial improvements over the next 8-10 
months. High mortgage interest rates continue to stifle the housing 
industry and builder foreclosing has become common. The public 
auction of the entire 85-house $7 million inventory of Atlanta's 
seventh largest builder is just one case in point. The seven-year-
old firm, which had 1980 sales of $14 million, had built a total of 
900 houses originally priced from $60,000 to $115,000. The president 
of the company said that "our situation became critical in August 
when a large number of buyers who had contracted to purchase homes 
already under construction could no longer qualify for mortgages or 
backed out of deals as interest rates climbed." Mortgage loans 
closed in Atlanta in September were down 82 percent from the year 
earlier figure. Moreover, in Atlanta, the apartment market is 
softening. Offers of $200 rebates, free microwave ovens, and 1978 
rent levels are being promoted to shore up rising vacancies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Severe financial stress in the thrift industry persists. Growth of 
the small savers certificates has been rapid and there is evidence 
that the all savers certificate is lowering the cost of funds to the 
thrifts. Nevertheless, savings and loans have continued to borrow 
extensively from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The latest information 
from the Fourth Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta shows that 
advances to Georgia savings and loan associations were up 30 percent 
in September from September of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business loan demand has remained low in most of the District. Some 
bankers attribute softness in loan demand to cut-rate loans offered 
by auto companies. Businessmen are skeptical of the recent drop in 
short-term interest rates. The high costs of carrying inventories 
has caused most businesses to keep their inventory levels at an 
absolute minimum.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The building materials industry continues 
at a low ebb. A cement plant in Tennessee has closed part of its 
production line and has reduced its labor force due to slack product 
demand. In north Florida, lumber mills are closing due to lack of 
volume. A brick plant reports a very unprofitable year so far. 
Building supply firms also report slow sales. September, October, 
and November are usually good months for building and supply 
companies-a period when contractors normally would be starting 
houses, hoping to have their crews under a roof before bad weather 
sets in. The lumber and wood industry has been particularly hard hit
in Alabama. Average weekly hours in the sector have fallen to only 
36.3 in September from 41.7 at the same time last year. In 
Mississippi, where the lumber and wood industry is the state's third 
largest manufacturing employer, hours worked in the sector have also 
fallen sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employment outlook for the Atlanta area is mixed at this time. 
Our survey of 14 of metropolitan Atlanta's largest employers gives 
some insight into recent economic conditions and prospects for the 
immediate future. It appears that the heavy durable goods industries 
(automobile assembly, cable manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing) 
have limited hiring plans at best for the near term. The service 
industries contacted report no hiring plans at the present time. In 
contrast, the high technology and communications industries are 
growing at a rapid pace. A manufacturer of satellite earth stations 
and communications equipment has added 1,200 employees in the past 
12 months and is still hiring. A manufacturer of word processing 
equipment has also had dramatic employment gains recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tourism industry is beginning to show signs of improvement 
following the usual post-Labor Day slowdown. Opryland in Nashville 
expects to equal or come close to its 1978 attendance, which was a 
banner year; hotel occupancies are up four percent from last year. 
Hotels and motels throughout Florida are receiving advance bookings 
for the winter season. Airlines also report heavy bookings. Because 
of the forced cutback of flights due to the air traffic controllers' 
strike, airlines are fully utilizing wide-body equipment to assure 
more seats in the Florida market than last year. In south west 
Florida, less expensive family hotels are full while large, 
expensive hotels have some vacancies-reflecting the fact that
visitors to that part of the state are vacationing on a more modest 
budget.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continued unusually dry weather has further reduced 
yield prospects for the District's late-growing crops. Reduced 
production combined with October's additional price declines for 
important crops indicate continued shrinkage in 1981's farm cash 
receipts and growing financial problems for farmers. Over 50 percent 
of the outstanding farm loan volume of the Farmers Home 
Administration in Georgia is currently in a state of delinquency. 
Prospects seem brightest for the region's citrus producers. 
Production is down less than was earlier expected and prices to 
growers are anticipated to be substantially higher than a year ago.
