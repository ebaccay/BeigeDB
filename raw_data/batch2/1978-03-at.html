      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        With the return of milder weather, business activity generally 
  resumed a moderately strong pace. Used car sales have spurted rather 
  suddenly as new auto purchases have risen falteringly. Fervent 
  housing demand has thinned inventories, aroused speculation (notably 
  by foreign investors), and broadened the rise in mortgage interest 
  rates. Several sluggish industries show signs of reviving. Weather-
  related supply disruptions and overburdened transport systems may 
  yet result in lost sales, however. If coal shipments are not 
  forthcoming quickly, TVA curtailments will induce massive layoffs in 
  a large portion of the District.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only from Tennessee and Alabama have we heard reports of significant 
  disruptions of production because of the coal strike. These include 
  shortening of work hours, the closing of a mobile home production 
  plant, and the idling of barges and tow boats. TVA seems to be in 
  the most dire position, holding 1.7 million tons. At one million 
  tons, it will impose mandatory industrial curtailments of 30 
  percent. Though its recent award of contracts for one million tons 
  of western coal gave cause for hope last week, the drain on its 
  supplies has accelerated and rail transport problems have dimmed 
  prospects for timely deliveries. The 30-percent cutback would result 
  in estimated layoffs of 75,000 workers in 1,200 industries, 
  spreading to 136,000 if it lasts longer than a month. Alabama Power, 
  with a 40-day supply, will curtail service by 10 percent if stocks 
  dip to 35 days by imposing a 20-percent reduction in the operating 
  hours of schools, businesses, institutions, and plants. Voluntary 
  curtailments requested by both TVA and Alabama Power several weeks 
  ago have been rather ineffective. No other District utilities have 
  asked for even voluntary cutbacks in consumption.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumer spending has improved with the weather, with most areas 
  recording year-to-year sales gains of 10-15 percent or better. 
  Several directors report that big-ticket sales are outpacing soft 
  goods, but at least one notes strong sales of soft goods, 
  particularly women's apparel, and some weakness in home fashions and 
  appliances. A food chain owner (director) comments on the lack of 
  consumer resistance to higher priced food items. Weather-related 
  production losses have put deliveries of spring and summer apparel 
  behind schedule and could result in lost sales with Easter so early 
  this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new car sales picture is still unclear. Florida directors 
  complain of sluggishness, blaming high prices and downsizing. But 
  demand has revived modestly in areas that were afflicted by harsh 
  weather, and two regional distributors of domestic makes realized 
  rather strong year-over-year advances in February. Except in 
  Tennessee, where usury restrictions have hampered financing, used 
  car sales have been universally described as very good.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reductions in savings inflows to thrifts are still relatively 
  moderate in the District, but the advance in mortgage rates has 
  spread; many lagging S&amp;Ls have moved to 9 1/4 plus two points. 
  Shrinking demand deposits have accounted for all of a recent slowing 
  of bank deposit inflows. In a constitutional referendum, Tennessee 
  voters elected to turn over the fixing of interest rate ceilings to 
  the legislature. More flexible statutory limits should permit 
  finance companies, who have virtually ceased lending in the past six 
  months, to operate profitably in the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent rapid rates of housing construction have not been able to 
  keep pace with demand. Home inventories are generally thin 
  throughout the District. In Broward County, Florida, a scarcity of 
  rental housing may force prospective renters to buy and thus deplete 
  stocks of midpriced condominiums to shortage levels by midyear. 
  Speculative buying of land and homes has accelerated sharply in 
  South Florida. Foreign buyers, largely Canadian and Latin American 
  (characterized by one director as "desperate to buy"), have provided 
  a sizable portion of speculative funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business leaders report signs of strengthening in several slow 
  industries. A large steel producer sees a revival of demand this 
  year, with the impetus to come from the oil industry and 
  manufacturers of home appliances. Phosphate shipments should be 
  heavy this spring, as backlogged deliveries to the North augment 
  rising orders, if the rail car shortage permits. Tool and diemakers 
  are enjoying excellent business. Truck sales have been buoyed by a 
  surge in foreign purchases. Three large companies badly in need of 
  work (Offshore Power Systems, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics, 
  Ingalls Shipyards) have been awarded contracts of late. Florida 
  hotels and tourist attractions have been unusually hectic as result 
  of northern storms and ad campaigns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Job growth continues to be substantial. Complaints of shortages of 
  skilled labor are becoming more common and widespread. However, 
  recently announced layoffs unrelated to either the weather or the 
  coal strike will displace at least 1,500 workers in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further increases in citrus prices have slowed sales; the Florida 
  Department of Citrus estimates that consumer demand is off from last 
  year by at least one-third. Still, carryover for next year's season 
  will probably be inadequate. The current crop is in very good shape, 
  but harvests are proceeding quite slowly (perhaps deliberately). 
  Strong cotton demand from the Far East has been taking up some of 
  the domestic slack; Mississippi growers are likely to expand acreage 
  by more than the USDA's January planting intentions survey 
  indicated. A director expects demand to support the rising level of 
  egg production despite sharply higher prices.
