      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Forecasters in this District expect a moderate national 
recovery with unemployment falling slowly and the inflation rate' 
rising by year-end. Personal consumption expenditure is improving 
slowly. Employment fell and unemployment rates continue to rise in 
this District but leading indicators suggest the bottom is near. 
Manufacturers in general expect little change in activity in March. 
Automobile production is expected to rise substantially this year. 
Steel producers had sharp order increases in February but expect no 
profits until late this year. Machine tool orders are improving but 
shipments and backlogs are still deteriorating. Loan demand is 
generally flat with a few indications of improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       National Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists who attended the Fourth District 
Roundtable Meeting on March 11 at this Bank scaled up their 
forecasts of economic activity from their October forecasts. The 
median of 27 forecasts now shows a 4.3% annual rate of increase in 
real GNP this quarter, 2.9%, 4.5%, and 5.0%, respectively, in the 
second, third and fourth quarters and 4.3% in the first half of 
1984. None of the 27 forecasts shows negative figures for any of the 
next six quarters. Industrial production is forecast to rise 8.2% 
this year (IVQ to IVQ). The median forecast shows the implicit price 
deflator rising at a rate of 4.6% this quarter, slowing slightly for 
two quarters, and then accelerating to 5.6% in the fourth quarter. 
The median forecast has the unemployment rate averaging 10.5% this 
quarter and falling steadily to 10.0% in the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Personal consumption expenditure is improving 
slowly. Spending growth on consumer durables this year is expected 
to be retarded by high unemployment, reduced unemployment benefits, 
and high real interest rates, but boosted by the rise in stock 
prices and consumers' improved ability to service debt. Car and 
truck sales are not expected to rebound as sharply as usual for the 
first year of a recovery, because sales incentives provided support 
during the bottom of the cycle. Also customers are reported to be 
hesitant about purchases because of uncertainty about changes in 
gasoline prices. One automotive industry economist expects sales 
incentives to be continued after March 31 only for small cars, 
because large cars are selling well.
     </p>
     <p>
      An economist with a major producer of consumer nondurables reports 
nondurable goods expenditures are well on the road to recovery. The 
improvement seems fairly widespread across the major components of 
nondurable goods and he expects the first quarter to show a 3% real 
year-over-year gain in expenditures, the largest since mid-1981. He 
also notes some return by consumers from generic and lower-priced 
brands to higher-priced brands. A major petroleum company expects 
very little near-term sales response to the drop in oil prices. 
Expenditures on services in the first quarter will be held down 
because of the mild winter's impact on sales of natural gas and 
electricity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment fell and unemployment 
rates in this District rose again in January but leading indicators 
suggest the bottom is near. Unemployment rates reached 13.2% (nsa) 
in Wheeling, 17.6% in Pittsburgh, and 18.1% in Erie. Twenty of 88 
Ohio counties have unemployment rates that exceed 20% and the state 
average is 14.9%. However, factory employment, particularly in the 
automotive industry, is rising slowly and announcements of factory 
layoffs are less frequent than three months ago. Leading indicators 
for Cleveland and Pittsburgh rose in December and January, 
indicating that the bottom is near in those SMSAs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Results of the March survey of Fourth District 
manufacturers indicate little change in activity from the previous 
month. Shipments are expected to rise in March, but backlogs, 
orders, and inventories are expected to show little change. 
Employment and hours worked are expected to remain at February's 
level.
     </p>
     <p>
      The median of ten automotive industry forecasts at this Bank's 
Roundtable Meeting shows domestic production of automobiles rising 
28% to 6.5 million units in 1983. Automobile inventories are 
reported to be low and, considering current rates of sales and 
production, are unlikely to rise excessively. Dealer stocks, which 
fell by 360 thousand units last year, are expected to increase by 
150 thousand units in 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel-making firms see some improvement in orders and production but 
are unlikely to earn a profit until late this year. Major steel 
producers expect domestic consumption of steel to fall by 1% from 
last year. One major producer notes that since 1948 domestic steel 
consumption generally has risen only in years when real GNP growth 
has exceeded 2.7%. Nevertheless, major firms expect industry 
shipments to rise by 20% and production to rise by 35% as both users 
and producers partially reverse their sharp inventory declines of 
last year. However, producers are likely to suffer losses again this 
year as transactions prices remain well below published prices and 
recent labor concessions reduce costs by only $15 per ton.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel firms had sharp increases in orders in February, mainly from 
the automotive sector, and expect further increases in March, but 
order levels remain low relative to capacity. Mills currently are 
operating at about 50% of capacity versus the 30% low during the 
1981-82 recession. Order backlogs are rising but producers are 
cautious about recalling workers and restarting idled facilities. 
The price of steel scrap is reported to be up sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      The machine tool industry remains depressed with shipments expected 
to deteriorate further in 1983 although orders should turn up. Order 
backlogs at current shipping rates are only five months, the lowest 
in the post-World War II period. Backlogs are low more because of 
the record length (14 quarters) of the industry's order downturn 
than because of its depth (87% decline). One firm forecasts no 
recovery in the industry's shipments in 1983 and only a small 
recovery in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of materials for the construction, automotive, and 
general industrial sectors whose output tends to be coincident with 
the economy reports sales were up in January but were flat in 
February, except for February sales gains in fiberglass for the 
automotive and construction industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Bank Lending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank loan demand is generally flat with some pockets 
of strength. Business loan demand has been generally flat this year 
but is showing some signs of strengthening in March. One banker 
reports little borrowing thus far to rebuild inventories. Some 
consumer lending rates have been lowered a little in the past 30 
days. Some banks note no strength in demand for new car loans and 
presume the financing is being done by the manufacturers' credit 
companies at incentive rates. Residential mortgage lending continues 
flat, except for strength in Cleveland. A Cleveland bank reports 
some strength in home improvement loans, only part of which is 
believed to be a response to unseasonally mild weather. Other 
consumer lending in the District is generally flat.
