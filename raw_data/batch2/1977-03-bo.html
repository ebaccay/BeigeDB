      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The economic outlook for the First District continues to be 
    encouraging. Industry in the region was relatively unaffected by 
    winter weather, although there were scattered slowdowns because of 
    bad weather and difficulties in obtaining parts. Some manufacturers' 
    sales may have been reduced because of production cutbacks elsewhere 
    in the country but many report high incoming order rates. A number 
    of major companies have just released very favorable earnings 
    reports for the fourth quarter of 1976. Retail sales in the region 
    appear to have slipped from the high levels of recent months but 
    this was expected. Construction remains very weak.
       </p>
       <p>
        New England industry escaped the winter relatively unscathed. There 
    were some difficulties in distributing fuel oil and individual 
    dealers ran short, but this was handled by reallocations among 
    dealers and there were no plant closings. Fuel supplies for March 
    appear adequate. Isolated production slowdowns took place because of 
    delays in receiving shipments from the Midwest, but such delays are 
    no longer a problem. For northern New England the winter has 
    actually had positive aspects. The recreation industry is having a 
    record season and retail outlets associated with ski areas are doing 
    extremely well.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of large New England firms have just reported very strong 
    fourth quarter earnings. These companies produce a wide range of 
    products from candy to precision instruments. New orders for 
    hardware, machine tools and appliances are particularly high. A 
    large supplier to the tire manufacturers reports very strong demand. 
    Capital goods orders, however, remain disappointing except for 
    automotive products.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales in New England appear to have slipped. This is not seen 
    as a problem because sales volumes had been very high. As indicated 
    above, retail outlets serving the recreation industry are an 
    exception in the northern states. Also, a representative of a large 
    department store with national affiliations reports that sales in 
    January and February were very good with solid real growth. He is 
    concerned that buyers for the fall line might overstock because 
    current sales are so strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction remains the weakest element of the New England economy. 
    One director indicated that he expects a pick-up in commercial 
    construction as soon as the weather improves but at present there 
    are no signs of increased activity. One banking director reported 
    that he observes moderate housing construction but very little 
    borrowing for commercial or institutional building. Another noted 
    that solicitations to bid on construction projects are drawing 
    unusually high response rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        In general, New England manufacturers are not concerned about supply 
    bottlenecks. However, several manufacturers expressed concern about 
    drought caused electric power shortages in the west and their 
    possible impact on aluminum production. Capacity limitations are not 
    a problem for most New England companies. At the national level, one 
    economic consultant indicated that capacity constraints are not 
    likely to appear in the major processing industries during 1977. 
    Utilization rates will be highest for paper. In the lower grades 
    adequate world capacity will prevent shortages but in fine papers 
    very strong economic growth or large hedging operations could create 
    problems. If housing demand is strong, very substantial increases in 
    lumber prices are expected. These would reflect increased costs not 
    capacity limitations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Houthakker, Samuelson, Solow, and Eckstein were available 
    for comment this month. Professor Houthakker believes the economy is 
    on the way to a balanced recovery. The winter may have been severe, 
    but it was short. Moreover, recent surveys indicate that the 
    investment recovery may be gaining momentum. Monetary policy holds 
    the key for the recovery. Because inflation has begun a gradual 
    decline and no major price rises are imminent, it is necessary for 
    the Federal Reserve to maintain its present policy so that inflation 
    may remain under control. Houthakker believes that fiscal and 
    monetary policy should seek continued manageable increases in 
    employment; the high elasticity of labor supply has made rapid 
    reductions in the unemployment rate an undesirable, if feasible, 
    policy target.
       </p>
       <p>
        Samuelson believes that the economy is fundamentally healthy, 
    despite the bad weather during the first quarter. However, he is 
    concerned that money growth may be insufficient to maintain the pace 
    of the recovery. Even though the weather has enhanced inflation 
    concerns, it is best that monetary policy be ready to accommodate 
    exogenous price increases. He believes "this is no time to put the 
    economy through another wringer. . .don't meet irrational 
    apprehensions by sacrificing real growth." He suspects that money 
    growth may have to exceed stated targets in 1977; otherwise, the 
    risks of jeopardizing real growth in 1978 are considerable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Solow believes that the permanent effects of winter will be small, 
    and, if interest rates remain fairly constant for the next 6 to 9 
    months, real growth during 1977 will average 5.5 to 6 percent. He 
    would be "appalled" if rising interest rates jeopardized even this 
    modest growth performance. Only if inflation were increasing rapidly 
    at the end of the year, should tighter monetary policy lead to 
    increasing interest rates. It would take another recession to push 
    inflation below the 5 to 6 percent range, and that is more than a 
    depressed economy should pay.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eckstein believes that an unremitting flow of good news is required 
    if conventional forecasts are to be realized. Hence, new investment 
    survey data merely support the outlook, they do not indicate a boom. 
    A major concern is that policy-makers should not get excited about 
    dilemmas until they are at hand. "Monetary policy should let the 
    economy move into a period of stimulus leaving the money and credit 
    system alone." Until there is evidence that fiscal policy threatens 
    an unmanageable boom, the Federal Reserve should accommodate growth. 
    This may require that the money aggregates exceed upper target 
    bounds, especially during the rebate period.
