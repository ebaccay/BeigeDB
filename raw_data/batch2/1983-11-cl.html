      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Improvement in labor market conditions in the Fourth District 
plateaued in September and unemployment remains high. Retail sales 
are improving. Orders, production, and shipments continue to rise 
for District manufacturers. Demand for steel continues to increase. 
New orders for single-family homes slowed in September because of 
high interest rates. Commercial and industrial loan demand increased 
at commercial banks while deposit growth stopped.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Improvement in labor market conditions stalled in September in this 
District, and high unemployment continues. In Ohio, nonagricultural 
wage and salary employment (nsa) rose 1.8% in September, but total 
employment fell, unemployment rose, and the unemployment rate (nsa) 
increased to 11.1% from 10.8% in August. Nevertheless, the 
unemployment rate is still below the 12.3% level of September 1982. 
Recovery in District employment has been similar to past recoveries 
but still lags the national recovery in both manufacturing and 
nonmanufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Food Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A national food retailer expects food price increases in 1984 in a 
4-1/2% to 5-1/2% range. Upward pressures on grain prices from the 
drought and PIK programs are being mitigated by huge carryover of 
grains from the previous year, and by the dollar's high foreign 
exchange rate that has hampered grain exports. He expects only 
moderate price increases for fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy 
products, and bakery goods. He expects meat prices to decline in 
this year's fourth quarter but to rise by next year's final quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers once again report broad-based sales gains in 
September and early October, after a rather unimpressive sales pace 
in August. General merchandise sales by major Fourth District 
retailers in September were 9% to 12% above year-earlier levels, as 
they have been during most of 1983. Sales of apparel and household 
furnishings were particularly strong in recent months. Sales by 
District automobile dealers were also well above year-earlier 
levels, and have generally accelerated from August as lean 
inventories eased with 1984 model deliveries. Sales of used-cars and 
import autos continue to suffer from lack of availability. Most 
retailers contacted expressed optimism over sales prospects for the 
fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continued to expand in September. A 
survey of purchasing manufacturers in the Cleveland area reveals 
production and new orders continued their strong increases in 
September. Inventories of raw materials and finished goods rose 
slightly, while employment fell slightly, the first decline since 
March. Moderate price increases were reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of purchasing managers in the Cincinnati area indicated 
production, new orders, and backlogs rose in September at an 
increasing pace. Inventories of finished goods ceased their decline. 
Employment rose substantially. Price increases continue at the same 
moderate pace as in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Bank's survey of Fourth District manufacturers shows shipments, 
new orders, and backlogs expanded in September and are expected to 
increase in October. Inventories and prices paid are stable. 
Employment rose a bit in September and is expected to increase 
substantially in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      A producer of machine tools reports orders continue to rise, but are 
still at a low level. The industry's order level hit bottom in third 
quarter 1982 at only 50% of the previous recession's low. Backlogs 
are growing, but from a very low level, and the firm is still 
operating at well below 50% of capacity and plans very little 
capital spending. The firm expects a minimal profit in 1984 and a 
good profit in 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      A producer of components for capital equipment reports a rising 
trend of orders from customers in various sectors of the economy. 
Backlogs are rising, as are production, employment and average hours 
worked. The firm is increasing its capital spending. Despite the 
increase in demand, list prices of its products remain flat, 
although discounts disappeared in spring and early summer. The firm 
reports prices rising for its purchases of corrugated boxes and 
aluminum ingots.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tire producer reports shipments are up strongly and are expected 
to rise further. Inventories are being built in anticipation of 
growing demand. Employment is rising at the plant level but not at 
the white collar level. There has been no acceleration of cost 
increases, and product prices are rising at about the retail 
inflation rate. Capital spending is for cost reduction but not new 
capacity in tire production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New orders for steel continue to rise. Demand improvements are 
primarily for flat-rolled steel but are spreading to bars and even 
pipe, which has been depressed by excessive inventories. Most demand 
is from producers of consumer goods, but improvement is starting to 
come from producers of business capital equipment and agricultural 
equipment, and from the construction industry. Some users are 
building inventory. Consequently, steel production and shipments are 
expected to continue rising in the fourth quarter. Some pressure on 
short-run production capability is being felt in certain product 
lines. Immediate capability to produce steel is less than 
theoretical capacity because the cash squeeze has led to low 
inventories and reduced maintenance of mills. Cash flow is expected 
to improve substantially this quarter, so that producers will be 
less willing to price at or below cost as they have in recent 
quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Builders of single-family homes report little change in construction 
activity from September as new orders continue to decline. Although 
the third quarter is typically a slow quarter for new orders, this 
year's third quarter new orders were off by about 15% from last 
year. Nevertheless, builders report their earnings are stronger for 
this third quarter than a year earlier because they are still 
working to complete the order backlog accumulated this past Spring. 
Realtors attribute the September decline in sales to high mortgage 
rates. The only bright spot in the housing sector, according to 
builders and realtors, is an increase in trafficâ€”interested buyers â€”which began near the end of September, and which may eventually 
result in actual orders and sales. Vacancy rates in commercial 
buildings remain extremely high with declines contingent on an 
improved local economy. Despite this high vacancy rate, construction 
is continuing on several office building projects throughout the 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks in the Fourth District reduced their holdings of U.S. Treasury 
securities, state and local government securities and federal funds 
in recent weeks. An increase in loan demand, in conjunction with a 
marked slowdown in deposit growth, may explain the reduction in bank 
investments. Virtually all of the increase in loan volume at 
district banks was in the commercial and industrial loan category. 
All categories of deposits were essentially flat. Banks in the 
District generally have not been aggressive about the new 
deregulated time deposits and hence have not experienced much 
shifting of deposits and have not attracted new deposits.
