      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 11, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The economic health of the West appears to be somewhat stronger than 
  reported last month. Retail sales are up due both to a back-to-school surge and a Boeing-led boom in the state of Washington. 
  Construction continues to expand in most parts of the District, and 
  perhaps a bit too strongly in southern California. Several 
  industries report increased export sales due to the decline of the 
  dollar. Mortgage interest rates have begun to move up another notch 
  in California and many observers feel that this will be the peak for 
  this phase in the cycle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Growth in retail sales is generally stronger than reported last 
  month, due partly to a back-to-school surge and a population boom in 
  the state of Washington. The largest department store chain in 
  southern California reports that sales in the first two weeks of 
  September are up 18 percent from year-earlier levels. Elsewhere in 
  southern California, retail sales were reported to be growing at a 
  rate of 10-15 percent over the past two months. Oregon also reports 
  strong consumer spending. But Washington appears to be turning in 
  the strongest performance with retail sales running 30 percent above 
  a year ago. Much of this is due to a Boeing-led economic and 
  population boom—car registrations are up 20 percent from a year 
  ago. Domestic auto sales are reported strong all over the District 
  and there is an actual shortage of new trucks in southern 
  California. Imported auto sales are somewhat weaker.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction is still booming in many parts of the district and is 
  felt by one director to be "too strong for a healthy industry" in 
  southern California. Most of the strength there is in non-residential, but there are still reports of condominium developments 
  selling out before the foundations are laid. One builder-director 
  expressed serious concern about construction costs which he claimed 
  to be advancing at 1 percent per month, due to declining worker 
  productivity and rising input (especially land) costs. Furthermore, 
  many labor contracts expire in spring and he fears substantial wage 
  increases. Shortages of skilled workers, cement, air conditioning, 
  electrical equipment, tile, wood and assorted other materials are 
  reported in this southern-California construction boom. While 
  construction elsewhere in the District remains generally strong,
  Idaho does report a slow-down due to a shortage of funds caused by 
  interest rates bumping against the State's usury ceiling.
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of the dollar's decline on western industry is mixed. 
  Naturally, a number of industries neither buy nor sell abroad and 
  have thus been fairly well insulated from international currency 
  movements. Others have been affected either on the input or output 
  side, or both. The aluminum industry notes increased costs for 
  imported raw materials but no stimulation of export sales. The 
  forest products industry has noticed a significant rise in their 
  sales abroad—much stronger than would normally be expected at this 
  phase in their export cycle. A major chain saw company related that 
  its foreign sales have increased nicely due to its increased 
  competitiveness with its chief competition, which is located in 
  Germany. An electronics firm also notes a strong increase in export 
  sales. In the opposite direction, a director involved in the media 
  related that foreign auto dealers in Washington are increasing their 
  promotional activities to counter resistance to higher prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most California S&amp;Ls have raised their prime loan rate for 
  residential mortgages from 9 3/4 to 10 percent. The former rate had 
  been in effect since mid-August. This move was explained as an 
  adaptation to the higher costs resulting from a significant transfer 
  of funds from passbook savings into the higher-interest money market 
  certificates. At this writing, banks had not joined in the increase, 
  but there is every indication that they will. Our bank directors in 
  California generally report stronger mortgage demand than they can 
  satisfy, so something must give in the near future—either a 
  weakening in demand or an increase in rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Elsewhere in the District a slight softening in mortgage demand is 
  noted and often attributed to high mortgage rates. Most feel that 
  mortgage rates have peaked, but there is a split between those who 
  feel that rates will remain at their present, high plateau for some 
  time, and those who see a decline before the end of the year. The 
  former group argues that the high cost of money will keep rates up 
  despite any weakening in mortgage demand. Some of this group also 
  doubts that any significant weakening in demand will continue, 
  because consumers continue to perceive home ownership as one of the 
  best hedges against inflation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our non-bank directors were generally unperturbed by high money 
  market rates. Both a large clothing manufacturer and a large forest 
  products producer claimed to be net lenders in the money market and 
  were thus positively affected by the hike in rates. Kaiser Aluminum 
  noted that its investment plans would be changed only in reaction to 
  a significant change in long-term rates. There were, however, 
  several reports of efforts to reduce inventory levels as a result of 
  high short-term rates. And one university noted that with the high 
  rates coming in summer, which is their peak seasonal borrowing 
  period, they had had to postpone several projects.
