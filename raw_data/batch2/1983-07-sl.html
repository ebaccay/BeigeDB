     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales and production in the Eighth District continued to expand 
during May and early June, and prices were nearly stable. 
Residential home sales, however, declined from the pace attained 
earlier in the year, and many manufacturing plants continue 
operating substantially below capacity. Although there have been net 
employment gains, unemployment rose from its already high level, as 
the labor force was bolstered by graduates and students seeking 
summer jobs. Most respondents anticipate that economic activity will 
continue to expand during the summer and fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Conventions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist and convention business in the St. Louis area was more than 
10 percent greater in May and early June than in the same period of 
1982. Continued gains are expected during the rest of the summer. 
Downtown hotels already are booked to near capacity for most of 
July. The Convention and Visitors Bureau has received twice the 
number of inquiries about St. Louis attractions in the past six 
weeks as in the same period last year. This summer, 65 conventions—more than during any other three-month period in history—will be 
held in the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales at six department stores in the District were 7 percent higher 
in May and early June than in the same period of 1982. The gains 
occurred despite unseasonably wet weather in many areas of the 
District. Furniture, appliances, rugs and "Father's Day" merchandise 
showed strength. Apparel did less well, allegedly because the 
weather in May was too cool for customers to be interested in summer 
fashions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales improved in May and early June at four dealers but 
slipped back at two dealers. One large dealer, with sales of both 
new and used cars about 25 percent ahead of last year, noted that he 
had difficulty maintaining adequate inventories for both autos and 
trucks. A dealer of foreign cars said he was readily selling all the 
cars allocated to him and could sell many more of the popular models 
if available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home sales in the Eighth District, which had been strong earlier in 
the year, decreased in May and early June. The unseasonably wet 
weather in May and some inching up of mortgage rates in early June 
contributed to the slowdown. Industry spokesmen, however, remained 
optimistic about future sales. Residential construction continued at 
a relatively high level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most industrial firms in the District reported an increase in orders 
and shipments since April. The gains continued to be largest for 
consumer-type goods and defense items. Firms producing business 
equipment and metals reported little change in sales. Capital 
spending plans of most firms remain unchanged and are not likely to 
increase until current facilities are more fully utilized. 
Inventories at most firms are near desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total Eighth District employment crept up in May and early June. 
Because of productivity gains, however, the rise in employment was 
less than the increase in production. Moreover, a few firms still 
are trimming their workforces, primarily through early retirements 
and attrition, in order to improve efficiency. Despite the net 
increase in total employment; the number of unemployed also rose 
moderately as the work force was enlarged by graduates and students 
seeking summer jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer loans rose during May and early June at large Eighth 
District banks, but commercial and industrial loans declined. Real 
estate loans changed little. Bank deposits increased, with both 
money market deposit accounts and super-NOW accounts rising rapidly. 
Savings and loan associations, also continuing to have an inflow of 
new funds, were able to increase their lending and improve their 
liquidity. The financial condition of savings and loans also has 
been strengthened by a slightly lower cost of funds and a higher 
average yield on assets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Price and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices have changed little, and wages have risen only moderately so 
far this year in the District. In general, expectations are that 
prices and wages will rise moderately during the rest of 1983. 
Projections through 1984, however, are more diverse: some analysts 
focusing on excess capacity believe wages and prices will accelerate 
only modestly; others, concerned about the huge Federal deficits and 
rapid monetary expansion, anticipate marked accelerations in wages 
and prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Planting of many District crops was delayed because of rains and 
flooding. A few fields were left idle, and some farmers shifted from 
corn or cotton to soybeans, which does not require as long a growing 
season. Weather turned more favorable in June, however, and much of 
the crops are now planted, and at this stage, most crops are doing 
well.
