      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 31, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in New England remain at a high level. Most 
    directors and businessmen see no signs of a slowdown. Manufacturers 
    continue to have large backlogs. Retail sales are fairly strong—autos are doing particularly well. Loan demand is generally vigorous 
    for this time of year. Lead times for some materials and components 
    are lengthening and skilled and semi-skilled labor is in 
    increasingly short supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      New England's manufacturing sector has just completed a very 
    successful year and most respondents see no signs of a slowdown. 
    Defense has been an important factor; one large defense contractor 
    and the government division of another large, high technology 
    company report that 1978 was their best year ever. Order backlogs 
    for these companies are very high. Machine tool companies also 
    continue to have large backlogs. Several firms in the instruments 
    category are planning major capital expansion programs. New capacity 
    is needed because of the high level of demand and because investment 
    projects were postponed in the past. Directors believe this is a 
    fairly common situation. On the negative side one large machinery
    company reports that consumer appliances have been moving slowly. 
    Lead times for materials and components are lengthening. Electronic 
    components, sheet metal, and machine parts are the greatest source 
    of concern. Skilled and semi-skilled labor continues to be in short 
    supply. Electronics engineers, computer personnel, and machinists 
    seem to be in particular demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the retail sector throughout the region are favorable. 
    Auto dealers in particular, are doing well and in parts of the 
    region are selling cars faster than they can be delivered. Sporting 
    goods stores are also experiencing very brisk sales although this is 
    partly a seasonal phenomenon. The head of a large department store 
    chain in southern New England thought that Christmas sales were a 
    little less than some had expected, but they still compare well with 
    a very strong 1977 Christmas season. It is somewhat difficult to 
    assess the retail sector's performance in January as the weather has 
    been much better this year than last; however, most retailers are 
    pleased with sales thus far. There is some concern about the effects 
    of high interest rates and the increase in the minimum wage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banking directors report that loan demand is good. There is usually 
    some falling off in demand at this time of year; however, the head 
    of one large southern New England bank reports that this seasonal 
    decline did not occur at his institution. All categories of loan 
    demand held up well. The director thought that other banks in his 
    area were having similar experiences. Two northern New England 
    bankers report that they have had a seasonal decline, particularly 
    for mortgages, but one of the two thinks that the fall-off in the 
    areas other than mortgages has been less than normal. Commercial 
    demand has been strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Houthakker, Samuelson, Solow, and Tobin were available 
    for comment this month. All agreed that the economy showed 
    surprising strength in last year's fourth quarter, especially in 
    view of the relatively low rate of money growth that has occurred in 
    the past few months. On the other hand, no clear consensus emerged 
    on the implications of these facts for the near-term course of 
    monetary policy, nor were the respondents unanimous in their view of 
    the outlook for the real economy in 1979.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Houthakker feels that the Fed may be "overdoing" its tight 
    money policy and is concerned about the consequences for the real 
    economy of two or three more months with low rates of money growth. 
    He believes that growth within the target ranges is compatible with 
    further increases in real GNP, albeit at a slower rate than 
    currently, but that the present restrictive policy probably makes a 
    recession inevitable. More optimistically, Houthakker expects the 
    current account to show a surplus by the end of the year whether or 
    not there is a recession; thus, he believes that tight monetary 
    policy can no longer be justified on balance of payments grounds.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to Professor Samuelson, the combination of strong real 
    growth with weak money growth merely reflects the effect of high 
    interest rates on velocity. For this reason, he sees no cause to 
    worry if the aggregates remain below their target growth ranges for 
    a prolonged period. Although he is not happy to make the 
    recommendation, Samuelson argues that since the real economy is 
    stronger than expected, another round of credit tightening is 
    probably necessary to fulfill the promise of a policy-induced 
    recession made implicitly last November 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the opinion of Professor Solow, the recent data provide no reason 
    to change one's "expected value" for the size, length, and timing of 
    the 1979 recession. He thinks that the outlook for the year depends 
    crucially on the economy s performance in the first quarter: if it's 
    too strong, then the ensuing downturn will be sharp; if the fourth 
    quarter represented only a "last gasp," then a mild "consensus-shaped" slowdown will occur, probably beginning late in the third 
    quarter. Solow cautions, however, that the economy cannot be fine-tuned—that there is always a non-negligible probability that a mild 
    downturn will cumulate into a severe one—so he advises the Fed to 
    follow Brainard's dictum: "If you don't know what you are doing, 
    then do it gently."
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Tobin reluctantly agrees with Samuelson that if the 
    actions of November 1 are to retain credibility, that is, if the 
"irrevocably decided" policy is to produce a recession, then further 
    credit restraint would be called for. Tobin is not particularly 
    pleased with this policy, though, because he would expect inflation 
    to decelerate this year as long as real growth is below the pace in 
    1978. Noting that what used to be considered a normal cyclical 
    increase in the price level is now being interpreted as a permanent 
    increase in the inflation rate, Tobin argues that 3 percent real 
    growth would probably produce about the same inflation outcome in 
    1979 as a full fledged recession.
