      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions remain dismal in the Fourth District 
but scattered signs suggest the bottom may be near. Unemployment is 
high and rising. Leading indicators and survey results suggest 
manufacturing activity may have reached its trough. Parts orders 
from the automotive industry are showing strength. Inventories 
probably have not yet bottomed. The steel industry remains in 
difficulty, but orders have improved recently. Retail sales were 
strong in January, but bank loan demand is mixed. Some gains are 
reported in construction but farmers continue in difficulty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment is extremely high and 
continued to rise through December. The December unemployment rate 
was 14.5 percent (sa) in Ohio and 12.9 percent in Pennsylvania. The 
District's eleven major SMSAs' unemployment rates (nsa) in November 
ranged from 9.4 percent in Columbus to 22.5 percent in Youngstown, 
and averaged 3.3 percentage points above the national rate. Ohio's 
employment is down 11 percent from a year ago in durable goods 
manufacturing and 5 percent in non-durable goods manufacturing. Some 
scattered rehiring is reported in consumer durable goods industries 
and primary metals, but additional plant closings continue to be 
announced.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Leading indicators suggest a further decline in economic 
activity in Pittsburgh but a bottoming in Cleveland. An index of 
leading indicators for the Pittsburgh area registered a tiny 
increase in November following 17 consecutive monthly declines. A 
similar index for the Cleveland area drifted down in October and 
November to a level only slightly above its April 1982 low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity may have reached its trough. 
This bank's survey of Fourth District manufacturers shows firms 
expected new orders and backlogs to increase in January after having 
been unchanged in December. Shipments were expected to rise after 
having fallen in December. Inventories were expected to fall after 
having been unchanged in December. Employment and hours worked were 
expected to rise slightly after having fallen substantially in 
December. A survey of Cleveland area purchasing managers shows new 
orders are flat while production and employment are falling less 
rapidly than a month ago. The survey shows inventories of raw 
materials, supplies, and finished goods continue to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Parts orders from the automotive industry are showing 
strength but capital goods industries are generally flat, and 
inventories probably have bottomed. A major producer of parts for 
the capital equipment industry describes its inventories as 
"extremely lean" and "below normal even considering the low level of 
sales". The firm says inventories "can't be cut further". Rather 
than rebuild inventories in anticipation of sales, the firm plans to 
"scramble to fill orders as they arise". The need to scramble will 
be strongest in auto parts, where demand is coming back sharply, and 
to a lesser extent in truck parts. Heavy duty truck orders bottomed 
last July and have been showing some strength in the last few weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, no turnaround is in sight for agricultural and 
construction equipment. The firm does expect a turnaround next 
summer in orders for equipment to manufacture electronic components 
for personal computers and defense items, because their customers' 
order backlogs are rising now. The firm is building a bit of 
inventory now in anticipation of that summer upturn. The company 
will recall small numbers of employees to its auto parts plants this 
quarter, and expects a large increase in employment in a plant that 
makes defense electronics equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another supplier to capital goods producers reports orders are 
increasing. Orders for refrigeration equipment components are up 
strongly in the last two months to 40 percent above the year-ago 
level. Orders for gaskets and seals for transportation and non-
electrical machinery are also up in the last two months. A division 
that supplies the machine tool industry remains flat at a very low 
level. Orders for automotive aftermarket and aerospace remain flat. 
Inventories will be increased some in the two divisions with strong 
orders but this will be more than offset by continued reductions of 
inventories in the other lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of bearings reports a modest upturn in orders in 
the last three to four weeks, most notably from the automobile 
industry but some also from other industries. Nevertheless the firm 
will continue to reduce inventories this quarter, although at a 
slower pace than in fourth quarter. The firm expects their 
employment to be flat this quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The steel industry remains in great difficulty. Producers 
continue to operate at very low rates and to report large losses. In 
continuing efforts to cut costs, additional production facilities 
have been closed, and a major firm has imposed its second 5% cut in 
non-union salaries in seven months. However, signs of improvement in 
orders and production have surfaced in recent weeks. A large steel 
producer that has been operating at only 30 percent of capacity 
reports a late January surge in orders from the automobile and 
construction industries at a rate equivalent to 60 percent of 
operating capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major department store chain reports strong January 
sales. The firm's real sales are up about 2 1/2 percent (quarterly 
rate) in the November-January fourth fiscal quarter from the third 
quarter. January sales apparently held at the November-December 
level, without seasonal adjustment and without unusual promotions. 
The retailer views this development as a "fundamental upswing" in 
demand. The chain's inventories are lean in all lines and the ratio 
of inventory to sales is lower than anytime since early 1981. No 
inventory building is planned for first quarter but there may be an 
unplanned inventory runoff if their suppliers can't keep pace with 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farmers continue in difficulty. An estimated 5% of Ohio 
farmers are on the brink of bankruptcy or foreclosure because of low 
crop prices, high interest rates, and falling land prices. Another 
5% are in difficulty but are being carried by their lenders, and 
another 15% will be in similar difficulty if low crop prices persist 
this year. Two directors express concern that the proposed crop swap 
program would hurt livestock producers and suppliers of agricultural 
fertilizers, pesticides, seed, and machinery.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some pickup in house sales and construction is 
reported. The stock market rise has strengthened the market for 
second homes. A construction company reports increased contracts and 
requests for bids on $25-100 million size projects for local 
governments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand is mixed. A large Cleveland bank 
reports a decrease in commercial loan demand in the last eight 
weeks, but lending officers expect improvement. Residential mortgage 
lending is showing a very small increase recently, but consumer 
lending is flat. Smaller banks report increases in consumer loan 
demand in response to lower interest rates. Banks in Cleveland have 
aggressively marketed the money market demand account and are having 
a strong response, but marketing of the Super-NOW account has not 
been aggressive.
