      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic activity continues very 
depressed. However, better weather conditions after mid-February 
aided a revival in some sectors. Retail trade continues slow. 
Further layoffs have occurred in a wide variety of employment 
categories. Equipment manufacturers report further weakness in 
orders. Construction industry prospects have deteriorated further. 
High interest rates, heavy debt burdens, and reduced cash flow have 
placed many business and financial enterprises in precarious 
positions. State and local governments are budgeting severe 
restrictions on spending. It appears that the general economic 
decline has moderated. A few sectors report gains in recent weeks, 
including steel, light trucks, office equipment, and airline travel. 
All types of goods and services are readily available, and price 
discounting is widespread. Pressures are strong to cut production 
costs, especially labor costs. Agriculture faces another year of 
depressed income, especially if crops are as large as expected. Bank 
loans to business remain strong, but more doubtful credits are 
requiring special attention.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Confidence Weakens
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent surveys of business and consumer 
attitudes in district centers show a further erosion of confidence. 
The region has been plagued by a three-year recession which has 
seriously depressed morale, especially for those who have never 
experienced an extended period of trouble. For the general public 
the main concern is loss of income and scarce job opportunities. 
Executives, in addition to worrying over their own companies' 
problems, are disturbed over huge prospective federal deficits and 
high interest rates. Low morale, even fear, is deep and widespread.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Oil Glut
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price declines for crude oil and most oil products, 
especially gasoline, have surprised many analysts. Ramifications 
have been profound. Pressures to develop alternative fuels have 
subsided. More refineries are being closed. A growing surplus is 
noted for line pipe and oil field equipment. Demand for diesel-
powered vehicles has eased, EPA-MPG may be deemphasized, and the RV 
industry's prospects have improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In January, payroll employment was 3 percent below a 
year earlier in the district, while the nation was about even. 
Compared with January 1979, when this region was relatively 
prosperous, district employment was down 5 percent, while employment 
in the nation was ~ 3 percent. All the district states compare 
unfavorably with the nation, but the hardest hit are Michigan, 
Indiana, and Iowa. The principal sectors accounting for the plight 
of district states are motor vehicles and agriculture. State jobless 
pay funds in Michigan and Illinois are heavily indebted to the 
federal government. Wisconsin borrowed recently and Iowa expects to 
do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Job Opportunities
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for workers is very soft. Information that 
a company is hiring brings a flood of applicants. State unemployment 
compensation offices open to long lines and operate at capacity. 
Help-wanted ad lineage in Chicago papers is running about 25 percent 
below last year, and more than 50 percent below two years ago. State 
and local governments are cutting staff, including employment 
service offices. Labor management negotiations similar to those 
publicized in the auto and trucking industries are widespread. 
Various companies have reduced compensation for white collar workers 
and executives, hoping to achieve the same changes in union 
contracts in upcoming negotiations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price inflation has slowed significantly. Trucking rates 
have been reduced, and the advance in rail rates has slowed. Auto 
companies have demanded 2 percent, across-the-board price reductions 
from suppliers who, in turn, passed similar demands on to their 
suppliers. Purchasing managers are asking price concessions and 
threatening to change sources, instead of accepting price increases 
passively. However, costs of shoes, medical care, tuition, and 
utility services have continued to rise at a very rapid pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inventories of oil, paper, general merchandise (at 
retail), farm and construction equipment, and some autos are 
excessive because of poor sales. Holdings of steel, nonferrous 
metals, building materials, and components are quite low. Buying is 
hand-to-mouth, to a degree unknown in recent years. A pickup in 
final demand could quickly tighten the lines of supply, increase 
orders to factories, and moderate intense competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction contracts, orders for producer goods, 
and announcements by various companies suggest a sharper reduction 
in capital spending than the one percent drop projected by the 
government survey. Various projects have been shelved in the steel, 
vehicle, and utility industries. Producers of pipelayers and 
bulldozers are protesting the ban on sales to Russia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales were very weak in recent weeks, despite 
rebates. Light truck sales responded to rebates and were up 20 
percent in February, but heavy truck sales were down 17 percent. 
Production of vehicles has declined more than sales and schedules 
appear somewhat firmer. The third quarter schedule is above last 
year's.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      March saw a slight improvement in steel shipments from the 
very depressed level of February. April is expected to continue this 
trend. Inventories of steel users are very low relative to usage. 
Normal lead times of 6-10 weeks are down to one week in some cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumers have been holding back on spending, either 
because of reduced income or increased caution as to future income. 
Installment credit use is below normal. Among the few lines selling 
well are video games, video recorders, auto supplies, and children's 
merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Permits for new residential units have been close to 
zero. There is much concern over problems of rolling over short-term 
home mortgage financing. While nonresidential prospects also are 
generally poor, at least three large new office buildings have been 
cleared for construction in downtown Chicago. Rehab work on older 
buildings has been stimulated by tax benefits. The public sector 
outlook is very bleak, for two years ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Pessimism in the farm sector is deep and widespread. 
This year's rise in farm production costs will be modest, but net 
farm income probably will decline significantly from the depressed 
levels of the past two years. Farmers are holding back on all types 
of outlays. Most farm lenders are confronted with loan collection 
problems, but these are generally considered to be manageable.
