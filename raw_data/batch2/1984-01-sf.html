      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 20, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Twelfth District the expansion is continuing at a rapid pace. 
Consumer spending during the Christmas and post-holiday season has 
been exceptionally strong, both at retail stores and automobile 
dealerships. Western homebuilding activity in November regained 
1983's August peak and nonresidential construction spending has been 
rising as well. In the manufacturing sector, employment gains have 
been widespread and especially strong in such defense and capital 
goods industries as electronic equipment and missiles and space 
vehicles. Agricultural prospects are improving. Adjustable rate 
mortgages are gaining increased borrower acceptance and helping to 
sustain housing. Consumer loans are growing rapidly due to 
consumers' increased creditworthiness and optimism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was extremely strong throughout the district 
during the Christmas holiday season, and buying apparently has 
remained strong in the post- holiday period, after allowance for the 
normal seasonal slowdown. The strength has been apparent both at 
retail stores and automobile dealerships. Major department stores in 
Southern California, for example, experienced an average 16 percent 
gain in sales in December over a year earlier. In Arizona, sales 
were up by a similar percentage. Even in Oregon, where the overall 
economic recovery has been lagging and weather was particularly 
severe, major retailers experienced year-to-year sales gains in 
December ranging from 12 to 18 percent. Stores have been discounting 
merchandise heavily and thus have been moving a large volume to 
attain these sales increases. In fact, due to their depleted 
inventories and optimism with regard to future sales, retailers are 
revising their inventory plans upward for the first half of 1984—although their attitude with regard to inventory building still has 
to be described as cautious. To finance their heavy expenditures 
consumers have been sharply increasing their installment debt. 
Nevertheless, financial institutions consider consumers' increased 
willingness to borrow as a positive factor affecting spending, since 
consumers do not appear to be overextended and delinquency rates 
actually are declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing employment has been rising rapidly throughout most of 
the district states, except in Oregon where the lumber industry has 
been cutting payrolls since August. Gains have been especially 
strong in the electronic equipment industry—which has been 
experiencing rising defense, consumer and business demand—and in 
the missiles and space vehicle category. California has been the 
location for most of this increased high-technology employment, but 
Arizona and Utah also have been experiencing rapid gains. The West's 
other capital goods industries—including those that manufacture 
non-electrical machinery, trucks and aircraft—also are 
experiencing a pickup in orders. In Washington, orders for 
commercial transport planes have risen so sharply since mid 1983 
that aircraft employment is expected to stabilize or perhaps rise 
moderately in 1984 after falling by about 9,000 during each of the 
two preceding years. With the notable exception of the Pacific 
Northwest aluminum industry, employment in the West's energy and 
metal mining and processing industries has stabilized but not yet 
begun to rise significantly. The copper, coal and oil industries 
continue to suffer from weak prices and excess worldwide supplies. 
Overall, respondents report that manufacturers intend to add workers 
to their payrolls very cautiously in 1984 so as to realize continued 
rapid productivity growth and hold down the increase in unit labor 
costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity has rebounded more strongly in the West than 
it has nationally. For example, Western housing starts in November 
regained the 1983-peak reached in August. Permits issued for new 
dwelling units in the region also rose more than nationally, 
suggesting that Western homebuilding activity in coming months will 
remain relatively strong. Sales also are reported to be holding up 
well, although housing prices are rising. Respondents attribute this 
strong housing market to buyers' increased acceptance of the newer 
adjustable rate mortgage packages which offer initial rates 
substantially below those of the current fixed-rate mortgages.
Nonresidential construction spending also is picking up. The upsurge 
in retail sales is encouraging modernization and construction of 
retail stores. The high-tech firms, especially electronic 
manufacturers, are building new plants. The decline in office 
vacancy rates, and the availability of pension fund and insurance 
company financing, are encouraging developers to plan and start 
construction of new office buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural sector is currently in the midst of its normal 
seasonal slowdown. Crop farmers throughout the district are 
optimistic about prospects for 1984, however. Grain farmers expect 
to benefit from the higher prices for wheat and cotton resulting 
from the Midwestern drought. California and Pacific Northwest 
farmers also expect higher prices and stronger demand for their 
citrus and other produce because of the freeze in Florida and Texas. 
They also are encouraged by the possibility that energy, interest 
and other production costs may only increase moderately. Farmers are 
concerned, however, that agricultural exports could fall again in 
1984 due to the high foreign exchange value of the dollar and 
foreign imposition of trade barriers. Livestock producers 
experienced a decline in net income last year and current conditions 
are not favorable. The drought-induced higher feed costs are forcing 
ranchers to slaughter their herds earlier than usual, increasing the 
availability of meat and reducing prices below year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The past few months have seen a significant increase in adjustable 
rate mortgages (ARMs) in most parts of the Twelfth District. 
Financial institutions have overcome borrower hesitancy with 
aggressive pricing and the inclusion of limits on potential 
increases in interest costs. Some are offering ARMs at differentials 
of up to 200 basis points under fixed rate mortgages, along with a 
below market rate of less than 10 percent for the first six months. 
Such pricing has opened up the market to those unable to qualify at 
the higher rates on fixed rate mortgages. The inclusion of caps on 
any future upward movement in rates also has contributed to buyer 
acceptance of ARMs, providing buyers at least a partial reduction in 
risk. The consumer meanwhile is showing signs of continued financial 
health, as evidenced by a sharp increase in consumer loans. In 
December, the amount of consumer loans outstanding (n.s.a.) at 
Twelfth District banks rose at an annual rate of 37 percent. The 
sharp increase in December boosted the annual increase in banks' 
consumer loans outstanding to 8 percent.
