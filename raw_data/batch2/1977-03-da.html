      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Eleventh District continues to improve, 
    although weakness in some industries still hampers overall growth. 
    The expansion in total employment that began late last year 
    continues and has reduced the unemployment rate for the District 
    states to 5.7 percent. Department store sales remain strong even 
    though some recent softness has been noticed, and automobile and 
    truck sales continue to rise. Increased demand for real estate and 
    consumer loans leads total lending activity, but business loan 
    demand has picked up slightly. Lower prices for grain and cattle and 
    rising costs of production—especially higher irrigation costs—continue to depress farm incomes. The growth in industrial 
    production in Texas is being held down by durable goods 
    manufacturing. Nondurable goods production, led by the chemical and 
    petroleum refining industries, continues to grow, while activity in 
    the oil and gas industry remains at a high level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Department store sales in the District continue to exhibit strength. 
    Sales picked up significantly in December and January, even though 
    the gains over a year ago have narrowed slightly in recent weeks. 
    Merchants are generally optimistic concerning the immediate outlook 
    for sales. Retailers report that bad weather has had only a very 
    limited effect upon sales. Sales of furniture and appliances in most 
    major cities are strong, but some recent weakness has been noted in 
    El Paso. Retail inventories are generally at desired levels, 
    although some firms in Dallas report them a bit on the high side. An 
    El Paso retailer indicates that his inventories are in good shape 
    after several months of adjustment to reduced sales caused by the 
    peso devaluation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales are rising with much of the growth in the full- to 
    intermediate-size models. Sales of trucks, vans, and recreational 
    vehicles also remain quite strong. Dealers continue to report 
    shortages of large cars and vans. Demand for small cars continues 
    sluggish, although inventories of these models are gradually being 
    brought into line. While some dealers indicate small car sales are 
    at a virtual standstill, an El Paso dealer reports some signs of a 
    slight improvement. Demand for optional equipment on all models 
    continues strong. Most dealers indicate that any loss of sales due 
    to bad weather last January was quickly recovered with the return to 
    more seasonal temperatures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chemical production in Texas has started to climb moderately. Demand 
    for plastics has strengthened, while fiber demand remains weak. 
    Fertilizer production in the state has not been appreciably affected 
    by the small number of natural gas curtailments at ammonia plants. 
    Inventories are higher than desirable but are being reduced as 
    transportation bottlenecks to markets east of the Mississippi are 
    cleared. The outlook for capital spending in the industry is mixed. 
    Some respondents expect substantial increases in capital spending, 
    but an industry consultant expects meager increases in capital 
    spending this year due to industry uncertainty concerning a national 
    energy policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output in petroleum refining has also begun to climb, and production 
    has shifted from primarily heating fuel to gasoline. Ample supplies 
    of gasoline are anticipated for the summer. However, gasoline prices 
    are expected to rise slowly this year due to the growing share of 
    higher-priced oil imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fabricated metals production has started to advance. Current demand 
    for metal cans is being spurred by previously announced price 
    increases which become effective this month. A San Antonio metal 
    fabricator reports that his current level of business has been 
    steady, but he is optimistic about the near future. New orders for 
    fabricated structural metal products have slowed in Dallas because 
    of sluggish nonresidential construction demand. Some future supply 
    shortages may develop for machine parts and steel castings. 
    Production of primary metals has failed to show real strength in 
    recent months. Demand for steel is beginning to improve as total 
    construction activity continues to pick up momentum. Demand for 
    aluminum has also strengthened, but production at individual plants 
    is directly related to the cost of electricity. A Texas refinery 
    that uses power generated at a lignite-fired plant is running at 
    full capacity, while a smelter that relies on a gas-fired generating 
    plant has remained idle for 17 months. A refinery line in Louisiana 
    was recently opened up because reductions in hydroelectric power 
    production in the Northwest (caused by the drought) are forcing a 
    reduction in production in that area of the country. Production of 
    lead has fallen short of demand, and prices are expected to rise 
    until balance is restored. Copper producers are faced with an 
    oversupply of inventories which will continue to hold down copper 
    prices. Capital spending plans in the primary metals industry this 
    year are largely for pollution control devices. Shortages of final 
    products are not expected because of the current high level of 
    unused capacity in the industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transportation equipment production in Texas continues to be 
    hampered by the slowdown in U.S. Government contract commitments for 
    aircraft and helicopters. Despite the falloff in domestic sales, 
    foreign orders continue to provide moderate to strong demand. The 
    Dallas-Fort Worth based Vought Corporation is cautiously optimistic 
    that Congress will restore budget funds cut recently by President 
    Carter for the ATE aircraft and Lance missile. If Congress fails to 
    restore funds, the company expects as many as 7,000 employees could 
    be laid off by early 1979. Nearly 90 percent of those who may be 
    laid off are located in the Dallas-Fort Worth SMSA.
