      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 13, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The level of economic activity in the First District remains high 
  and signs of a coming slowdown are limited. The retail sector, 
  particularly the automobile component, is doing very well. 
  Manufacturing production is well above last year's levels; new 
  orders are high by historic standards although there appears to have 
  been some slackening recently. While prices of industrial materials 
  are continuing to rise, no significant acceleration has been 
  observed. There are no serious supply bottlenecks although some 
  delivery lead times have lengthened and labor markets appear tight. 
  Loan demand remains high. Despite this generally favorable 
  experience, businessmen are deeply concerned about the future 
  direction of the economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumer demand continues to be a source of strength in the New 
  England economy. Northern New England just saw the conclusion of one 
  of its best summer tourist seasons. All the associated retail 
  outlets did very well. Back to school sales throughout most of the 
  District were very successful. The head of a major New England 
  department store chain reports that sales in August substantially 
  exceeded expectations and the early days of September look similarly 
  good. Sales of automobiles have also been stronger than expected. 
  The region's banks have seen no weakening in the demand for consumer 
  loans. There are, however, scattered indications of some slackening. 
  One retailer notes that consumers appear to be more cost conscious; 
  in food purchases there is greater interest in generic brands and
  the use of coupons. Another retailer has observed some slowdown in 
  the rate at which credit is repaid; however, the head of a large 
  utility reports that uncollectible bills are continuing to decline. 
  Several local consultants and the head of a large department store 
  expressed concern that retail inventories may be excessively high if 
  there is any softening in demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturing shipments are substantially above a year ago. Several 
  surveys of the region's manufacturers suggest that there has been a 
  slight fall-off in new orders in the past month; more firms reported 
  a decline in orders than an increase. However, most firms contacted 
  were very pleased with their recent performance. A large chemical 
  manufacturer said August shipments were the highest ever. Orders for 
  producers' durables and heavy capital equipment are also very 
  strong. Housing related products are continuing to do well, although 
  one firm has seen a weakening in the demand for major appliances. 
  Firms are not experiencing any serious difficulties in obtaining 
  materials although several report a slowdown in deliveries of steel 
  and aluminum. There has been no substantial change in the rate of 
  price increases. Manufacturers appear to be keeping inventories 
  under tight control. A large machinery producer reported that his 
  inventories were a little higher than desired; however, this was 
  based upon concerns about the future course of the economy, not 
  actual experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the financial sector, consumer loan demand remains high 
  throughout the region. For a large bank in southern New England, 
  commercial loan demand is strong and above expectations; in northern 
  New England, commercial demand is also strong but has fallen off 
  slightly during the past month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, and Samuelson were available for 
  comment this month. None of the three believes that monetary policy 
  is an appropriate tool to stabilize the exchange value of the 
  dollar, nor do they feel that the devaluation experienced so far is 
  sufficient justification for the sacrifice of domestic policy goals. 
  All agreed that the outlook for inflation is discouraging, and all 
  were critical of the government's present approach to dealing with 
  the problem. More optimistically, all three were pleased to see the 
  recent slowdown in money growth rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Eckstein noted that although the U.S. does have an 
  obligation to its creditors (particularly OPEC) to prevent an 
  excessive decline in the dollar, domestic interest rates are not 
  responsible for the dollar's current weakness. He fears that further 
  interest rate increases will produce a recession in 1979 without 
  eliminating the inflation or energy imbalances that are the source 
  of the dollar's problems. Given the large interest rate increases 
  that have already occurred, Eckstein feels that "it would be rash to 
  raise rates further before determining if the economy is or is not 
  slowing, if inflation is or is not decreasing, and if the trade 
  balance is or is not improving." It is Eckstein's view that the 
  government's time would be better spent gaining control of the 
  budget than worrying about stop-gap dollar support measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Houthakker agrees that the dollar should not be a 
  consideration for monetary policy. Arguing that the inflationary 
  effects of the weak currency are minor, he feels that appropriate 
  domestic policies will lead to a stronger dollar by themselves. 
  Houthakker is less than sanguine about the short-term inflation 
  outlook. He deplores the government's tendency to rely on "cosmetic" anti-inflation policies (jawboning) rather than to attack such 
  underlying causes of inflation as unnecessary import restrictions 
  and business regulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Citing the disappointing domestic results of the British pound 
  support. programs, Professor Samuelson feels that "little blood 
  should be shed" in a dollar defense effort. He is particularly 
  concerned that such policies could turn the "soft landing" expected 
  next year by many forecasters into a German- style soft economy with 
  a strong exchange rate but weak profit and output growth. Since 
  Samuelson believes that the economy will generate a minimum of 5 
  percent inflation through 1980 in any case, he sees little benefit 
  from a
        <br/>
        policy-induced recession at this time.
