      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District business activity, overall, is unlikely to 
show significant improvement in the second and third quarters, 
although many firms will report good gains from the depressed 
periods of 1980. This prospect suggests continued adverse 
comparisons with the national economy. Most business firms now 
anticipate lower sales in the near-term than they had expected a few 
months ago. Moreover, a smaller rise in farm income is projected. 
Construction plans, both residential and nonresidential, have been 
scaled down. Loans are available in virtually all credit markets, 
but high interest rates deter borrowing. With rising personal 
income, retail sales have held up well. There is a widespread view 
that an acceleration in general activity will begin late in 1981,
and continue into 1982. Such forecasts assume lower interest rates, 
tax rate reductions, a boost from defense spending, and further 
easing of inflationary pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for workers is weak. New layoffs or extended 
vacations have been announced recently for farm equipment, meat 
packing, and electrical products. However, claims for unemployment 
compensation are running well below last year's level. Indefinite 
layoffs reported by auto producers are down to 160,000 from 240,000 
last year. Summer jobs for youth are hard to find, partly because of 
cutbacks in CETA programs. Various state and local governments have 
frozen hirings. Many help-wanted ads in district newspapers attempt 
to lure skilled workers to the South and West.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Personal income and labor negotiations
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Worker compensation 
continues to rise at a rate of about 9 percent in the district, 
despite a surplus of workers. Efforts of employers to get organized 
labor to moderate new demands, or to renegotiate existing contracts, 
have been successful only under a threat to shut down the operation. 
Mass transit workers of the financially-strapped Chicago-area RTA 
system threaten walkouts over any move to adjust their liberal 
compensation and work rules. Building trades have negotiated 8.5 to 
11 percent increases this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some very large retail chains have been pleased by 
double-digit increases in sales in recent weeks. They are using 
heavy promotions and aggressive pricing. Consumer credit 
delinquencies remain high. Most big ticket items often bought on 
credit are not selling well. Most general merchandise chains are 
losing money. An old chain has filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 
11. Vacation travel and sales of recreational vehicles are being 
aided by ready availability of gasoline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most firms are holding inventories at low levels to 
reduce heavy finance charges. Expected price increases no longer 
spur anticipatory advance buying. In some cases product lines have 
been narrowed and delivery times have been allowed to stretch out in 
order to economize on working capital. Low inventories act as a 
buffer against any possible recession, but they also provide a 
springboard for faster inflation if final demand accelerates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for steel slowed somewhat in the past month, partly 
for seasonal reasons. Steel demand is very strong for "oil country 
goods", and is above last year for vehicles and appliances. Orders 
for structural steel have softened. More steel users are buying from 
service centers in order to keep their own inventories low. Total 
steel shipments from U.S. mills are now projected at 93 million tons 
for 1981, up from 84 million in 1980, but well below 100 million in 
1979.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most district producers of capital goods report new 
orders well below their capacity and below expectations expressed 
earlier. The weakest sectors are equipment for construction, mining, 
and railroads. Demand for farm equipment and heavy trucks has been 
disappointing. Equipment for oil and gas exploration is booked to 
capacity, but this sector is relatively unimportant here.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos and trucks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of autos and trucks have remained at low 
levels. Output of cars and trucks in the second and third quarters 
will substantially exceed last year s reduced levels, but will 
remain far below the prosperous levels of 1978. Inventories may rise 
in the months ahead partly to encourage concessions by the UAW.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing starts are running somewhat above 
last year's very depressed level in district centers. Home mortgages 
are offered at 16.5 to 17.5 percent or more, but with few takers. 
"Creative financing" is not helping much. Many S&amp;Ls; and banks are 
not making any mortgage loans. It is already too late in the season 
for lower interest rates to help housing construction in the 
district this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A large number of smaller shopping 
centers, office buildings, warehouses, and other nonresidential 
construction projects were postponed in May and June. Interest rates 
of 14 percent or more, often with equity participations, are too 
high to attract developers. Most life insurance companies and 
pension funds have halted all commitments on commercial mortgages. 
Public construction is very weak, especially road work.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rains eased remaining drought concerns in parts 
of Iowa. However, plantings, already unusually late in the Eastern 
cornbelt, were further delayed. These developments are dampening 
hopes for good crop yields in the Midwest. Farm income in the 
Midwest was especially suppressed in the first half because of low 
livestock prices. These prices have risen in the past two months, 
and are approaching breakeven levels after a prolonged period of 
losses. High interest rates and low farm earnings are blamed for 
sluggish capital spending by farmers. Revised industry projections 
put 1981 sales of farm equipment only modestly above the depressed 
level of 1980 instead of the strong rebound expected earlier.
