      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Developments of recent weeks suggest that economic activity in the 
Seventh District has plateaued, but few observers are apprehensive 
over an imminent general recession. Total employment in the five-
state area has shown very little improvement since early in the year 
and job seekers are abundant. However, surveys by consultants 
indicate increases in salaries of over 6 percent in 1985. Apparent 
settlement of the threatened auto strike removes a shadow over many 
District centers, but the terms of the agreement perpetuate the 
region's competitive disadvantage of high labor costs. Except for 
new cars, small trucks and vans, retail sales were disappointing in 
the third quarter. Steel output appears to have started up again, 
after a sharp slump, and steel executives here anticipate effective 
government actions to curb imports. Mechanical capital goods demand 
remains weak with new disappointments in farm and construction 
equipment, and slower sales of heavy trucks. Housing activity is 
slipping while most nonresidential construction has upward momentum. 
Delivery leadtimes on goods have shortened. Most inventories are 
under close control, but stocks of general merchandise are described 
as "high." Prices are fairly stable with competition restraining 
increases in most markets. Many District farmers are hard-pressed by 
heavy debts, unprofitable prices, and declining values of farmland 
and used equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       General Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite vexing problems, quite serious in some sectors, business and 
consumer confidence in the Seventh District remains generally sound—but not ebullient. It is now recognized that the national 
expansion has been slowing since last spring, but only a few 
isolated voices are apprehensive that a general recession is at 
hand. Relatively stable prices and lack of speculative buying by 
consumers and businesses have been welcome surprises. Recent easing 
of interest rates has allayed fears voiced earlier of a new credit 
crunch. Apparent settlement of the auto negotiations removes a storm 
cloud. However, there is widespread worry over huge federal 
deficits, enormous foreign trade deficits, and the shaky state of 
some financial institutions and some foreign debtors. Serious 
imbalances, in short, are seen to be financial rather than physical.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment Growth Slow
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Through August 1984, the rise in payroll employment since December 
1982 in the five District states was only half as great as in the 
nation. District employment has remained well below the level of the 
late 1970s. Since February, a large portion of the District 
including the entire states of Illinois and Iowa have witnessed no 
growth at all in employment. Hiring survey and projections of 
activity by industry indicate no significant improvement in the 
months ahead. Job seekers are abundant, although many are said to be 
poorly trained and qualified. Despite slack labor markets, private 
surveys indicate Chicago area employers plan average increases in 
salaries in excess of 6 percent for 1985, slightly more than in 
1984, and close to the national average. Employers are making 
intense efforts to curtail soaring costs of medical benefits, but 
have had only limited success so far. The new UAW pact retains 
medical benefits intact. Chicago teachers threaten a strike if their 
medical plan is made contributory. Strike threats loom in the 
trucking and airline industries where employers are trying to force 
substantial compensation concessions to get labor costs more in line 
with those of non-union competitors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Evaluating the Auto Settlement
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rank-and-file approval of the three-year UAW-GM pact and the 
tentative Ford settlement seem to remove the threat of a major work 
stoppage that had been overhanging the District economy all year. 
Unlike earlier years of auto contract renewals, there are no near-
term contract expirations of importance to be faced in the farm and 
construction equipment industries. Thus, the durable goods 
industries of the Midwest appear to be entering an extended period 
of labor peace. The new auto agreements, valued at roughly 25 
percent over three years (depending on actual costs of COLA, medical 
benefits, job security provisions, retirement improvements, etc.) 
have been greeted by some as "modest" and noninflationary, but other 
observers point out that they extend and reinforce the heavy labor 
cost differential that has been a major factor in the competitive 
disadvantage of the region relative to other regions and abroad. At 
the end of the contract, the average annual labor cost per active 
production worker in the auto industry will substantially exceed 
$50,000. Pressures for investments in labor-saving equipment and 
foreign sourcing can be expected to intensify.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel Slump Over?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Raw steel production in the Chicago and Detroit districts dropped by 
more than a third from mid-May to late September before turning up 
in early October. The accompanying decline in steel shipments in the 
third quarter was more than seasonal, in contrast to earlier 
expectations. Except for the hard-hit farm sector, steel consumption 
has held at, or near, expected levels. Therefore, the decline is 
attributed to increased imports and inventory liquidation. The 
fourth quarter is expected to see improvement, bringing industry 
shipments for the year to about 75 million tons, well above 1983, 
but several million tons less than expected earlier in the year. 
Higher mill shipments in the fourth quarter will reflect greater 
consumption in the motor vehicle industry and nonresidential 
construction, stabilization of inventories, and reduced imports. 
Industry leaders have been assured that the Administration "means 
business" in restricting imports from third-world countries, up till 
now uninhibited by restraints. Imports are expected to return 
gradually to 20 percent of domestic usage, down from the 26 percent 
ratio for the first 8 months of 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers of mechanical capital goods still report general weakness. 
Defense orders continue to expand, but are of relatively small 
importance in the District. Orders for oilfield apparatus and 
materials handling equipment have improved, but from a very low 
base. Light construction equipment is improved, but heavy items, 
such as outdoor cranes, remain severely depressed. Farm equipment 
sales are running well below last year's sad level. Orders for heavy 
trucks dropped in the third quarter, but demand for medium trucks 
and truck trailers remains vigorous.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding has declined from last spring, but remains near last 
year's level. Sales of new and used homes have held up better than 
expected, partly because the public has accepted the view that high 
rates are here to stay. Conventional mortgage interest rates quoted 
range from 13.5 to over 14 percent, plus 3 to 5 points, about 100 
basis points below the peak of last spring. Almost 70 percent of new 
home mortgages are ARMs, with initial rates ranging up to 12 
percent. Nonresidential construction of virtually all types, with 
office buildings leading, continues to increase with a steady stream 
of sizable new projects announced.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some major retailers express disappointment over volume in recent 
months. The two-year boom in appliances, furniture and other home 
furnishings appears to have peaked out. Soft goods have strengthened 
somewhat. General merchandise inventories are generally excessive. 
This has led to widespread price cutting to keep inventories from 
rising further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices Fairly Stable
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Competition, including a wide range of imported goods, is keeping 
inflation in check. A retail analyst estimates general merchandise 
prices average less than 1 percent above last year, the smallest 
rise in many years. In the wholesale markets, prices of many metals 
have declined in recent months. Increases in prices of paper 
products, gypsum board, and electronic components have been 
substantial, but may have leveled.
