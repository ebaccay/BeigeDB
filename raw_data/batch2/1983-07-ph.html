      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District point to further improvement in 
regional economic conditions in June. The vigorous expansion in the 
manufacturing sector has continued this month, pushing industrial 
prices up slightly, and local retailers report double-digit sales 
growth at area department stores. Loan volume has picked up 
unexpectedly in June, but deposit growth at area banks has 
moderated. Real estate sales, however, have slipped and construction 
activity has levelled off.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District businessmen predict continued gains through December. 
Manufacturers expect the industrial recovery to carry on at a brisk 
pace at least through year-end. Retail sales are projected to finish 
the year on a strong note as well, and merchants are beginning to 
rebuild inventories in preparation for a December surge. Bankers 
foresee modest improvements in lending activity, with better growth 
in retail loans but only slowly developing commercial demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the Third District housing market has backed off a 
little in June. Overall sales are still in good shape on a year-
over-year basis, about 25 percent ahead, but many real estate 
brokers fear that a recent rise in mortgage rates may have nipped 
rising demand in the bud. Rates have climbed 25 to 50 basis points 
since mid-May, and that rise has shown up in lighter traffic and 
slower sales, particularly of newly constructed units. Third 
District construction activity is flat in June and builders say new 
starts are not as numerous as earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers responding to the June Business Outlook Survey say 
local industrial activity has grown sharply again this month as the 
recovery in the manufacturing sector maintains its brisk pace. 
Overall business conditions have shown consistently widespread 
improvement in each of the last five months, which, according to 
survey results, is the most sustained strength exhibited by area 
industry in well over five years. Both new orders and shipments have 
increased substantially in June and employers have beet hiring 
additional workers and lengthening their average workweeks. Stock 
levels, however, have been reduced again at area plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      General activity is expected to show further improvement over the 
next two quarters. Respondents predict that new orders will play the 
lead role by climbing considerably, and producer backlogs are likely 
to increase. Manufacturers also expect to bolster factory payrolls 
and working hours by December. In addition, increases in capital 
expenditures are planned by nearly one third of participating 
businessmen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of industrial price hikes in June, though still not as 
widespread as in the late 1970s or early 1980s, are more prevalent 
than they have been in over a year. Whereas in mid-1982 very few 
Third District businessmen reported rising prices, one-fourth say 
they are paying more for raw materials in June than they did in May, 
and one-sixth report a boost in their own products' prices since 
last month. Survey results indicate that further increases are 
likely by the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Department store sales in the Third District have surged ahead in 
June, according to retail contacts. Gains in current dollar sales 
over a year ago are surprisingly strong this month, hitting double 
digits at many retail outlets. In the last six weeks, household 
furnishings and other durable goods have been moving especially 
well. Merchants cite improved consumer attitudes and favorable 
weather conditions as contributing factors in the better-than-anticipated business. Promotional activity, however, also continues 
to play an important role in generating sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area retailers are getting bullish in their forecasts and foresee 
big sales gains in the next six months. Rapidly rowing sales are 
expected to push December volume 8 percent to 10 percent over fairly 
strong year-earlier levels. Store operators predict that consumers 
will spend at least part of their July tax cut and expect rising 
employment to loosen purse strings even more. By most accounts, a 
banner Christmas season is in the making and the rosy outlook has 
prompted many merchants to add to stock levels, albeit cautiously. 
Inventories are now ahead on a year-over-year basis, and carefully 
controlled growth is planned for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers say loan activity edged upward in June. 
Commercial lending bounced back after dipping in May but volume is 
still only slightly ahead of a year ago. Although demand for 
traditional business loans for working capital and inventory 
financing remains weak, demand for short-term operating loans has 
been strong enough to result in the small and unexpected increase in 
overall C&amp;I loan volume. Retail lending has picked up again this 
month as well and, according to contacts, volume is now as much as 
10 percent above last June. Consistent economic recovery apparently 
has buoyed consumer sentiment and increased retail credit demand. 
Interest rates, however, remain high relative to historical 
standards, keeping consumer lending activity below the levels most 
bankers had been hoping for.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers do not foresee any major changes in present lending 
trends between now and the end of the year. Modest improvement in 
consumer loan activity is anticipated as the economy builds steam, 
but the recovery still has a long way to go before C&amp;I loan demand 
picks up significantly, lenders say. Corporate capital spending 
plans are expected to stay soft well into the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate at major banks in the Third District is unchanged at 
10.5 percent in June. The stickiness in interest rates over the last 
several months has led local seers to revise their forecasts and 
most now believe that rates have reached the trough of their cycle. 
Analysts predict that rates will average slightly higher in the 
third quarter than in the second quarter, and, by late in the year, 
expanding credit demands and large deficits are expected to exert 
further upward pressure.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows in the Third District are still healthy but they have 
softened in June as they did last month. Demand deposits slipped 
again and now only range from unchanged to 4 percent ahead of last 
June. Time and savings deposits remain well ahead on a year-over-year basis despite slower growth resulting from reduced activity in 
MMDAs.
