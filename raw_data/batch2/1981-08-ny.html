      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District weakened a bit in July. 
Retail sales slowed from the brisk pace of previous months, and 
automobile demand remained fairly lackluster. New orders for capital 
goods continued to taper off. The strength of the dollar is worrying 
exporters, but so far few specific comments on export sales losses 
have been picked up. The overall economic outlook is mixed. While 
personal tax cuts are expected to boost department store sales by 
the end of 1981, automobile sales and capital spending are expected 
to remain weak until interest rates fall significantly. On the 
financial side, major banks reported substantial increases in levels 
of credit lines intended for merger activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In July, retail activity in the Second District 
fell from the generally high levels of May and June. While several 
department store chains indicated that sales were at or above plan, 
performances at all retail stores were weaker than those of last 
month. Sales in the New York City stores were slower than in their 
suburban counterparts, in contrast to previous months when no 
geographic pattern emerged: The slackening in the overall sales pace 
has caused no change in plans, as respondents speculated that 
seasonal factors and the timing of holiday promotions were partly 
responsible.
     </p>
     <p>
      The demand for automobiles showed little change in July. Domestic 
cars sold at slightly above last year's lackluster pace, and foreign 
cars again sold poorly. Lower-priced lines continued to be weaker 
than more-expensive models. High prices and high interest rates were 
blamed for the poor performance of auto sales. While hope was 
expressed that manufacturers' rebate and finance-charge promotions 
would stimulate demand, the tax cuts were not expected to provide 
much help.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weakness of capital spending persisted in 
July. All capital goods producers in the survey reported that new 
orders fell below June's depressed levels, although the backlogs at 
some firms have been used to shore up production levels. One 
machine-tool manufacturer remarked that the firm s current three-month slowdown is the first in two years. A steel plant, much of 
whose output normally goes to the automobile industry, was said to 
be operating "at a pretty good rate." Nevertheless, capital 
allocations to this plant are being reduced because it is not as 
profitable as others located outside the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Exchange Rate Effects on Exports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For some time now we have been 
hearing general comments from business leaders to the effect that 
the strong dollar poses a threat to exports. The only specifics, 
however, have been on the one hand that most U.S. industries do not 
really feel the impact of exchange rate changes for two or three 
years, but on the other that export orders for chemicals are already 
being unfavorably affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      An informal survey of 10 large manufacturing firms conducted for 
this meeting brought out that so far there has been only a small 
adverse effect on export sales from the higher foreign currency 
exchange value of the dollar. The preponderant view was that it was 
still too early to assess the full impact of the dollar's 
appreciation. Although several companies have lost export sales 
especially in Europe, most believe that the export losses stem from 
a slowdown in economic activity abroad rather than the dollar's 
appreciation. However, two indicated that higher foreign currency 
prices for their exports have resulted in lower sales to Europe, and 
they seemed concerned about greater losses in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for the next twelve months is mixed. 
Some retailers look forward to continued strength, while others 
anticipate further weakness until the end of the year. The majority 
of business economists see a flat-to-weak third quarter, although 
one is predicting 1.8 percent real GNP growth. While economists and 
retailers in our survey expect the tax cuts to stimulate consumer 
spending by the first quarter of 1982, auto industry respondents 
anticipate little help. One corporate economist, however, sees the 
tax cut helping car sales late in the year. None of the respondents 
foresee business tax cuts boosting capital spending soon; the 
prospective strengthening in capital spending is seen as beginning 
as early as mid-1982 or as late as 1984. GNP forecasts for 1982 
indicate about 3 percent real growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Officials at six major New York City banks 
reported substantial increases in the volume of credit lines 
intended for merger activity. Most of these commitments are for 
unsecured loans with maturities ranging from three to twelve years. 
A majority of the banks interviewed offer various pricing options on 
the loans while the others charge the prime rate. It is not uncommon 
for about forty to fifty banks to be involved in the syndications, 
with a significant portion of the total dollar commitment (twenty-
five to fifty-five percent) provided by foreign banks. Some 
officials said that restrictions on the amount of money that may be 
lent to a single entity had limited the participation of U.S. banks 
in these syndicates. None of the officials interviewed anticipated 
any difficulty in funding these loans if and when they are taken 
down, and for this reason they did not expect to have to reduce 
credit availability elsewhere.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from James O'Leary (U. 
S. Trust Company) and Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty Trust 
Company). Their views of course are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Leary: The forces behind the upward movement of interest rates 
this year are: (1) the continuing strong fear that the decline in 
the inflation rate is only temporary; (2) continuing very strong 
private short-term business credit demand, caused importantly by the 
fact that long-term debt markets are still closed down; (3) the 
determination of the Fed to persist in its policy; (4) the impact of 
high short-term rates on the cash flow of life insurance companies 
and the thrifts; (5) heavy U.S. Treasury financing; and (6) a huge 
backlog of demand for long-term, fixed-rate financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The course [that] the Federal Reserve and the financial markets are 
now on threatens a mass failure of the thrifts which would 
undoubtedly cause a tremendous shock to the economy and would 
present very serious problems for public policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are risks in a Fed move to relax credit—and there are risks 
in not doing so. There is no easy choice. At this point, my own 
rather uncertain judgment is that a modest and guarded relaxation 
would be the wisest course of policy. I think the financial markets 
would understand and accept a moderate and careful relaxation of 
credit without concluding that inflation is off to the races again. 
(This paragraph was written before I saw the recent comments of 
Secretary Regan.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: Concern about the thrift industry is growing as market 
expectations for significantly lower interest rates are waning. We 
see evidence that savings bank deposit withdrawals are on the 
increase. Concern about other credit problems persist, and the 
passage of a few months time at these interest rate levels will 
probably bring more distress situations to the surface. The Fed 
should watch these developments carefully and be ready to adjust to 
any surprises that may occur.
