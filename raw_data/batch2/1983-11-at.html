      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The southeastern economy is showing renewed strength. Labor markets 
in most areas and industries continue to strengthen. Demand for 
durable and nondurable manufactured goods is increasing. Retail 
sales in autumn appear to be sustaining the momentum attained in 
late summer, and merchants foresee an excellent holiday season. 
Housing sales, aided by easing mortgage rates, pent-up demand, 
enhanced variable-rate mortgages, and government bonds, have revived 
somewhat after slowing in August and September. Deposit growth 
accelerated in September after rising modestly during the summer, 
and but the rate of increase in loans, particularly to businesses 
slowed substantially after several months of healthy growth.
Consumer lending, however, continued to expand. The tourist trade 
overall remains ahead of last year, but South Florida, middle and 
east Tennessee, and New Orleans have yet to enjoy significant 
improvement. Drought and reduced acreage have cut farm production 
and sharply curtailed business volume for farm-related businesses, 
but most farmers should fare better than in 1982 because of the 
Payment-in-Kind (PIK) program.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment is rising in a variety of industries, and jobless rates 
have fallen significantly in most states. After a long period of 
weakness, Florida's phosphate industry is recalling furloughed 
workers in response to apparent stockpiling by farmers who 
anticipate fertilizer shortages because of sharply increased crop 
plantings next year. Textile employment has been growing by a 
moderate but steady pace, and hours and earnings in the industry are 
up sharply from last year. Carpet shipments from Georgia mills have 
been quite strong. These trends portend further declines in 
Georgia's unemployment. Alabama respondents expecting recovery to 
stimulate the coal industry, believe that many closed mines will 
reopen soon. Huntsville's high-technology manufacturing base is 
expanding rapidly: two computer companies plan to hire a total of 
1,500 workers in the near future. Automobile assembly plants in 
Georgia are recalling workers, and two new auto parts plants will 
soon open in Tennessee. The aluminum industry's resurgence has 
sparked demand for refining and smelting products, thereby 
stimulating Louisiana's chemical industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending appears to be maintaining the growth evidenced by 
August taxable sales, which were more than 10 percent ahead of 
August 1982. According to many retailers, September and early 
October sales exceeded last year's levels and surpassed many 
retailers' projections. Moreover, unlike last year, promotional 
sales are playing a negligible role in current activity. Some 
merchants in Atlanta and north Florida report strong sales and 
increased profit margins on appliances and electronics items. 
However, most retailers indicate that the strong showing of fall 
clothing and back-to-school merchandise accounts for much of the 
recent surge in sales. Merchants anticipate an excellent holiday 
season. Despite the reported scarcity of new vehicles at 
dealerships, recent car sales figures continue to exceed 1982 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing sales, which fell in August when conventional mortgage rates 
approached 14 percent, rose modestly in September. Easing of 
conventional rates and stability. in the EHA/VA rate helped rekindle 
sates. Realtors cite pent-up demand and buyer adjustment to higher 
interest rates as other factors in the quick revival of housing 
sales. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) are becoming more popular 
because many potential purchasers are unable to qualify for 
conventional loans at the current rate and since lenders have 
incorporated rate ceilings into ARMs, thereby reducing the risk to 
buyers. In Knoxville, Miami, and Mobile, ARM s have recently 
outpaced conventional loans, according to several realtors surveyed. 
Home buyers in Alabama and Knox County, Tennessee, have been aided 
by special issues of local government bonds from which proceeds were 
dedicated to financing housing. Florida recently announced a similar 
measure to assist Jacksonville residents.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction is on the rise for the third consecutive 
month. Nashville and Atlanta lead the Southeast in the development 
of new commercial projects. Realtors in those cities expect a 
continued strong economy to facilitate corporate relocations and 
prevent a potential glut of office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After growing slowly in July and August, deposits at thrifts and 
large banks escalated sharply in September. Large denomination, or 
jumbo, savings accounts of more than $100,000 sustained the strong 
performance of August and, with 2 1/2-year small savers 
certificates, accounted for most of the growth in savings capital at 
S&amp;Ls.; Time deposits and jumbo CDs contributed the largest shares to 
September's deposit gains at banks. In contrast, loan activity at 
large southeastern banks slowed significantly in September after 
advancing throughout the summer. Business lending, which failed to 
register a gain from August to September, was the primary source of 
this deceleration. However, consumer lending increased in September
for the seventh consecutive month.
     </p>
     <p>
      A money center bank is backing Florida legislation to allow out-of-
state financial institutions to establish de novo operations in the 
state, thereby permitting out-of-state banks to enter the market 
without acquiring existing institutions. The proposal is a response 
to a legislative initiative by Florida bankers to limit out-of-state 
banking to institutions from regional states with similar reciprocal 
agreements.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The industry is entering its traditionally slow fall season after a 
summer that proved to be generally positive, except in south 
Florida, middle and east Tennessee, and New Orleans. Hotels and 
motels increased revenues in August even though occupancy levels 
were below comparable 1982 levels in many District cities. Hotel 
construction in central Florida and the apparently rapid absorption 
of expensive resort properties along Florida's north Atlantic coast 
augur continued growth in these areas. Attendance at most national 
park facilities and many private facilities also rose in the late 
summer relative to last year's figures; early fall attendance at 
private attractions that have added new exhibits, rides, or 
facilities is up over year-ago levels. However, heavy rains in 
August reduced visitation to state parks 5.7 percent below August 
1982 levels, and industry representatives indicate that fewer people 
visited many older Florida and Tennessee attractions than last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Air travel continues to strengthen from 1982 levels at most of the 
region's airports. Moreover, service to smaller cities continues to 
expand. Convention trade is reportedly rising compared to last year 
in New Orleans. The planned opening of more than 12 non-chain 
restaurants in the city during the remainder of 1983 betokens great 
confidence in the future of its tourism and leisure industry. The 
expansion and upgrading of a major hotel in Nashville should boost 
convention traffic after a sluggish summer, but contacts there 
expect little substantial improvement until 1984. In Miami Beach, 
increased business travel has helped offset the effects of fewer 
convention delegates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As a result of drought and idled acreage, revenue from major crops 
this year is projected to be $5.2 billion, or 7 percent less than in 
1982. The impact of the PIK program, however, should result in a 23 
percent ($307 million) increase in net revenue above operating 
costs. District soybean production has fallen 42 percent from 1982 
levels, but higher prices are likely to generate a 3 percent ($17 
million) gain in net revenue above operating costs. Soybeans are the 
prime cash income crop in the Southeast. Most other regionally 
significant crops suffered similar drought-related productivity 
declines, and farm-related businesses are experiencing severe losses 
in volume and income. Producers of peanuts and tobacco, two 
important crops not covered by the PIK program, sustained especially 
heavy income losses because of drought.
