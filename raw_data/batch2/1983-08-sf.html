      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 10, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In recent weeks, the recovery in Twelfth District economic activity 
has gained momentum, with nearly all manufacturing and mining 
industries experiencing some degree of improvement in orders. 
Consumer spending increased at an accelerated pace, widening year-to-year gains in retail sales. Western homebuilding activity also 
continued to pick up through June, in contrast to the national 
slowdown. In the manufacturing sector, even the capital goods 
industries are reporting increased demand. While the recovery 
appears to be extending into the third quarter, a slowdown in home 
sales in July suggests that the pace could slacken. Commercial and
industrial lending at Twelfth District banks continues to be weak, 
but the weakness is due to firms' improved cash flow and access to 
the bond and equity markets. Moreover, although District banks have 
begun to experience a slight outflow from MMDAs, that movement has 
been offset by a shift into longer-term and higher yielding consumer 
certificates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents throughout the Twelfth District report that retail sales 
have been rising at an accelerated pace. Major department store 
chains in Southern California reported that sales rose sharply in 
June and ran nearly 17 percent above the year-earlier level. In the 
Pacific Northwest, sales at some major stores were up as much as 30 
percent. Business apparently remained strong through July. Since 
competition for sales is extremely intense and prices are up only a 
few percentage points, most of the gain represents increased volume. 
Retailers report that inventories are low and they are not planning 
any significant buildup as long as the price increases realized on 
merchandise remain small relative to interest carrying costs. Sales 
of durable goods, including expensive items such as. furniture and 
appliances, are rising even faster than nondurables. Consumer credit 
outstanding is growing, but the delinquency rate is declining. Sales 
of automobiles have been rising far above year-earlier levels and 
would be greater if some models were more readily available.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recovery has now extended in varying degrees to nearly all 
Twelfth District manufacturing and mining industries, except those 
engaged in energy production. The important lumber industry, which 
was one of the first sectors to show improvement because of the 
turnaround in national homebuilding activity, continues to boost 
production and employment, despite some recent weakness in lumber 
prices. The aluminum, copper and other metal industries are raising 
their capacity utilization rates as orders continue to strengthen 
from such important metal consumers as the automobile, appliance., 
container and housing industries. Even the West's  major capital 
goods producing industries—including those that manufacture 
machinery, electronic equipment, trucks and aircraft—are 
experiencing a modest pickup in orders. Not only has consumer and 
defense demand for these goods increased, but business demand has 
risen. Improved airline profitability is finally enabling the 
world's airlines to boost orders for commercial aircraft.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Through June, indicators of housing activity in the West were 
exceedingly strong. Regional housing starts continued to rise to a 
level more than double that of a year earlier, and permit activity 
pointed to still further gains in the months ahead. But in the last 
month as mortgage interest rates have risen, home sales are reported 
to have slowed. As yet, there are no signs of overbuilding. 
Developers have, been proceeding very cautiously, building mainly on 
a pre-sold basis and holding their speculative units to a minimum. 
But many respondents fear that even a modest further increase in 
mortgage rates, say 50 basis points, could cause a substantial 
decline in residential construction during the second half of 1983. 
Even with the recent increase in rates, they expect the average 
level of starts during the last six months to be moderately lower 
than the hectic first-half pace. They point out that the majority of 
the new units started have been in the lower-price category aimed at 
the first-time buyer and that the recent increase in conventional 
mortgage rates to nearly 14 percent will price a sizeable  number of 
potential homebuyers out of the market. Some builders already are 
beginning to "buy down" mortgages once again to keep effective 
interest rates affordable. In the nonresidential construction 
sector, activity continues to lag behind the year-earlier pace as 
vacancy rates remain high for office and other commercial buildings. 
The rising level of permits issued points to increased spending in 
the months ahead however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      California farmers have been experiencing sharply declining prices 
for fruits and vegetables in the past two months as crops have been 
higher than had been predicted when flooding early in the year 
caused late plantings. Prices for these items are still above levels 
of a year ago, however, and California farmers are expected to 
experience a year-to-year increase in net income from fruits and 
vegetables. The heavy winter rains also have had a positive side 
effect in working down excess inventories of many tree crops at 
higher prices. California farmers also are expected to benefit 
greatly from the combined effects of the Federal payment-in-kind 
(PIK) program and the Midwestern drought in boosting prices for 
cotton and grains. The Federal government is having problems 
fulfilling its PIK inventory return obligation to California cotton 
growers, however, in that those farmers do not have sufficient 
cotton under loan to the government to compensate for the huge 
acreage taken out of production. Elsewhere throughout the District, 
smaller gains in net farm income are expected, except perhaps in 
Utah, where net income could be down because of recent flood damage 
to the farm sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial and industrial lending at Twelfth District banks has 
shown continued weakness in recent weeks, following the typical 
pattern in the early stage of recovery. Banks attribute much of the 
weakness to improvement in sales and cash flow, which is reducing 
their need for bank financing. The inventory liquidation which has 
accompanied increased sales has reduced their need. for short-term 
bank borrowing, while weakness in capital spending continues to 
depress businesses' need for long-term bank financing. In addition, 
the improvement in bond and equity markets has given large firms the 
opportunity to turn to those sources for long-term capital. Banks in 
the region also have begun to experience their first outflows from 
MMDAs which had risen to over 21 percent of their total deposits. 
Since mid-June, both industrial and business MMDAs at District banks 
have shown slight declines. However, the slight outflow appears to 
have been offset by a shift into longer-term consumer certificates 
as depositor's attempt to lock in relatively attractive longer-term 
rates.
