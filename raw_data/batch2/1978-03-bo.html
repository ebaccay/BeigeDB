      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        First District respondents remain encouraged about the performance 
  of the New England economy. There is, however, significant concern 
  about the national situation. Retail sales have weakened, but this 
  is attributed to poor weather. Inventories are well under control. 
  Manufacturers appear to be doing well. Loan demand is moderately 
  good and expected to improve.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales in New England have weakened but bad weather was 
  undoubtedly a contributing factor; so it is difficult to determine 
  the underlying trend in consumer spending. A representative of a 
  large department store chain believes he sees the beginning of more 
  long lived slowing in retail sales. However, in northern New England 
  the tourist industry and all the retail outlets associated with it 
  are faring very well. Also, New England telephone companies report a 
  very active installation business, a phenomenon which they feel is 
  indicative of general economic health. Retail inventories are low 
  and no problems are expected in this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the manufacturing sector, most reports are favorable. In northern 
  New England the electronics and plastics industries are enjoying 
  healthy demand; backlogs for machine tools continue to grow. Large 
  employers in the high technology fields in Massachusetts are also 
  reported to be doing well. One large producer of instruments has a 
  nine month order backlog. Another reports that they are still below 
  capacity but that order backlogs are significantly above this time a 
  year ago. The region continues to benefit from large defense 
  purchases. The one negative note, a mild one, came from a supplier 
  to the tire industry; sales of a key ingredient in tires are down 10 
  percent from a year ago. Other chemicals made by the same company 
  are also off slightly. As yet, New England has not seen any effects
  of the coal strike, although there is some concern about what will 
  happen next month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Loan demand at commercial banks is fairly good and is expected to 
  get better. According to one of the region's largest banks, domestic 
  loan demand is not as strong as desired, but there is substantial 
  optimism about 1978. A medium-size bank in northern New England 
  reports that commercial loan demand is very strong, although there 
  has been some seasonal weakening in construction loans. Installment 
  loan business after a brief slump has picked up.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conversations with consultants following national industries 
  indicate that, aside from the coal strike, shortages are not going 
  to be an issue in 1978. There are some shortages of fine coated 
  papers but these can easily be dealt with by turning to imports or 
  heavier grades. One manufacturer reports difficulties getting 
  electronics components, particularly those from California. In the 
  steel industry, cutbacks in capacity combined with continued 
  recovery could produce shortages of certain products after 1980; 
  however, at present only oil and gas drilling equipment is in short 
  supply. In addition, despite its dependence on coal, the steel 
  industry is not any more likely to be affected by the coal strike 
  than are other industries in the mid-west. Coke stockpiles are 
  substantial and electric power cutbacks will limit production before 
  coke availability becomes a constraint. In petrochemicals and most 
  of the paper industry the problem is overcapacity. Among these 
  consultants there is considerable concern about the impact of higher 
  interest rates on the housing industry. One lumber specialist claims 
  that when rates on Treasury bills reach 6 percent, there is a marked 
  effect on housing and consequently on the lumber industry. In the 
  energy sector, the natural gas situation has improved. Production 
  last year was better than expected and this experience combined with 
  price increases has led at least one energy expert to increase his 
  production forecasts for 1978.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Houthakker, Eckstein and Solow were available for comment 
  this month. All respondents agree that the dollar cannot be 
  successfully "defended" on foreign exchange markets unless the 
  imbalance in our trade and capital accounts is corrected. Moreover, 
  the recent decline in the dollar's exchange rate represent a normal 
  market response to our foreign deficit. In time, the declining 
  dollar will encourage foreign demand for our exports and discourage 
  our demand for imported goods; in this manner the recent 
  depreciation of the dollar will bring our accounts back into 
  balance. According to Eckstein, many businessmen fear that the 
  defense of unrealistic dollar exchange rates will ultimately lead to 
  exchange controls and further import restrictions. Although 
  Houthakker recognizes the need to temporarily settle disorderly 
  conditions which may arise occasionally on exchange markets, he 
  recommends selling gold rather than accumulating large debts in 
  foreign currencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Due to the coal strike and the winter weather, Eckstein expects 2.4 
  percent real growth during the first quarter of this year. Much of 
  the lost activity will then be regained in the second quarter when 
  growth will exceed 6 percent. Despite this acceleration, Eckstein 
  expects that real GNP will average only 4 percent growth during 
  1978, and there is a 45 percent chance that weak demands or a credit 
  crunch in the second half of the year could push the year's 
  expansion close to 3.5 percent. He believes it is important for the 
  Fed not to be misled by the "snap-back" in activity during the 
  coming months, the problem for 1978 is to avoid losing too much 
  momentum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Solow is surprised by the sharp decline in the reported unemployment 
  rate since the end of 1977. The slow economic growth suggests that 
  policy should not become tighter; with low rates of capacity 
  utilization and the modest growth forecasts for 1978, the Fed should 
  still be concerned about maintaining the recovery and regaining full 
  production.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither Houthakker or Solow believe that the recent behavior of the 
  wholesale price index and the consumer price index warrant reaction 
  from the Fed. It is inappropriate to address problems of food 
  shortages with aggregate monetary policy. Recognizing that food 
  prices are highly volatile, especially during periods of adverse 
  weather, Houthakker has not changed his forecast of inflation, 6 to 
  7 percent for 1978.
