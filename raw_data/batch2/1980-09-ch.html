      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 9, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite conflicting trends among industries, the tone of business 
activity has improved somewhat in the Seventh District during the 
summer months. In general, the consumer sectors have shown modest 
improvement, while most capital goods have weakened further. Recent 
increases in interest rates have dampened the incipient improvement 
in housing, and have reduced the availability of large commercial 
mortgages. C and I loan demand picked up at large commercial banks 
in August, but this is believed to reflect largely commercial paper 
facility credits. Prices have been soft in some wholesale markets, 
but this is believed to be temporary with the underlying inflation 
rate remaining at 10 percent or more. Layoffs have slowed down 
markedly, and workers have been called back in autos and steel. Most 
workers returned early in August from plant-wide vacations, which 
started earlier and lasted longer than usual. Farm income prospects 
have firmed up as farm prices rose, but there is substantial 
variability among individual farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Psychology of consumers, business executives, and lenders, which had 
fallen to a very low ebb during the credit squeeze of the second 
quarter, has improved noticeably. Fears of a very long and deep 
recession have been replaced by feelings that the downturn in 
general activity may be near its bottom. However, almost no one 
expects a return to full prosperity for at least a year and perhaps 
longer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending has revived somewhat for both hard and soft goods, 
but real volume remains below last year. Among the items that are 
selling better are cars, small trucks, recreational vehicles, and a 
variety of household goods. Most people are after bargains, and 
discounters, big and small, seem to be gaining at the expense of 
old-line general merchandise retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer credit is being used more freely again. Most installment 
lenders have dropped "customers only" policies. Interest rates have 
come down from their peaks, but remain well above last year's 
levels. Delinquencies have increased, but not to the worst levels of 
1974-75, except in certain hard-hit localities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Order backlogs of most capital goods producers have eroded rapidly. 
Producers of oil and gas exploration equipment, however, report 
insatiable demand. Producers of machine tools required by the 
vehicle and aircraft industries see high demand well into 1981. Farm 
equipment prospects have improved with farm income. Construction 
equipment remains very weak. The dominant construction equipment 
producer, which sailed through previous recessions without layoffs, 
has announced a second sizable furlough of indefinite length. Sales 
of heavy trucks and trailers are still declining with good buys 
available on the second-hand market. Railroad car deliveries remain 
at a high rate, but order trends point to a long, slow period ahead. 
Mining equipment and materials handling equipment also are slow. A 
producer of heavy castings for a variety of customers reports "no 
backlog," operations below 50 percent of capacity, one shift 
operation rather than two and a half, and no improvement in sight 
for any customer group except farm equipment. Foreign demand for 
U.S. equipment, which had been stronger than domestic demand, began 
to weaken in the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders for steel picked up in August (especially for cars and light 
trucks and appliances which had dropped most), but remain far below 
capacity. Steel buying is hand-to-mouth, and a significant pickup in 
demand could mean a stretchout in delivery times. Inventories are 
very lean at the mill, warehouse, and customer levels. Steel mills 
have been able to boost some prices recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for petroleum products, petrochemicals, and such items as 
heavy trucks and trailers, the view that inventories are low seems 
to be well substantiated. Deep-seated caution, high carrying costs, 
and weaker financial positions that inhibit borrowing help explain 
this phenomenon. Prices of residential building materials softened 
in recent months, but analysts are concerned that the failure of 
builders to order ahead for 1981 will limit residential activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worst of the car and truck dealer crisis appears to be over. 
Weaker dealers have gone out of business. Manufacturers have relaxed 
rules to allow their dealers to offer other lines, including foreign 
cars and trucks, and even the lines of domestic competitors-
previously an unheard of practice. Inventories of 1980 model large 
cars and trucks have been largely depleted with prices 
strengthening. The 1981 model line-up, featuring greater fuel 
economies, is expected to keep car sales moving up from depressed 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home mortgage rates in the Chicago area jumped to 13 percent on 
conventionals, and to 12.5 percent on RRMs in the past two or three 
weeks. As rates moved past 12 percent, builders reported a sharp 
drop-off in customer traffic. Plans of tract builders, which were 
starting to come to life, have been shelved again. The Chicago area, 
despite an apparent 4 percent loss of population 1970-80, is on the 
verge of a serious housing shortage. Despite the recession, sales 
prices of existing homes have continued to rise. New home prices 
have been even stronger. The situation is reflected in the 
conversion of better grade rental units to condos, against the 
desires of tenants who find alternatives scarce. New unsubsidized 
apartments are almost all condos with many units purchased by 
investors. A strong push is expected for expanded subsidy programs 
for both rental and owner-occupied dwelling units.
     </p>
     <p>
      About 8 million square feet of office space nearing completion in 
downtown Chicago is almost all leased. A new wave of large office 
buildings, hotels, and luxury condos will get underway soon. Since 
mid-August, however, new commercial mortgage commitments "have dried 
up."
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor unions have not moderated demands because of the recession. 
Offers of 10 percent first-year wage increases have been rejected, 
with demands for 12 percent or more, plus other "improvements." In 
addition, demands for "inflation protection," both for workers and 
retirees, are often dominant issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of increased competition from nonunion truck operators under 
deregulation, unionized truck operators have invoked the 
renegotiation clause in the 1979 Teamsters contract. With COLA, 
straight-time drivers' pay now exceeds $11 per hour. The main effort 
of the operators will be modification of work rules that impede 
efficiency.
