      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In recent weeks, the Second District economy showed a few more signs 
of improvement, suggesting it has hit bottom and is beginning to 
turn up. The retail sector experienced moderate gains in December, 
and January sales substantially outpaced the year-ago level. Lower 
mortgage rates stimulated home sales and builders were fairly 
optimistic about prospects for the spring. Some new nonresidential 
construction projects got underway even though the office market 
remained soft. Manufacturing continued to be generally depressed, 
but business leaders found some indications that activity in that 
sector may be starting to pick up. In sum, the outlook has 
brightened somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers finished December with stronger-than-expected sales, and 
the gains continued into the new year. Heavy promotional efforts 
helped boost January's volume substantially over the level of a year 
ago, when inclement weather severely depressed activity. Apparel, 
housewares, and consumer electronics all moved well, but big-ticket 
items like furniture still attracted little attention. Inventories 
were generally at desired levels for most stores. Merchants were 
somewhat cautious about the outlook, but some had increased their 
buying plans modestly in anticipation of gains in the spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Additional signs of recovery appeared in the residential real estate 
market. Sales at several large condominium projects were spurred by 
lower mortgage rates, as were the sales of existing homes. Citing a 
recent increase in the size of mortgages eligible for Federal 
insurance, developers announced plans to construct a large luxury 
rental building in Manhattan. The increased eligibility was also 
expected to make possible the construction of some long-planned 
residential complexes which had experienced financing difficulties. 
District builders were fairly optimistic about the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      The nonresidential real estate market also improved. Despite 
continuing softness in the office market, ground was broken for two 
new office towers, one in downtown New York City and one in 
Westchester County. Developers announced plans for other office and 
mixed use projects, although no starting dates have been set. In 
addition, construction was reported underway on a new resort 
development in one upstate New York community and plans for another 
are under discussion. Brokers did not report an increase in leasing 
activity but were hopeful that a pickup would materialize soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although the manufacturing sector generally continued to operate at 
a very low level, business leaders observed a number of signs that 
activity may be starting to pick up. Several of our contacts were 
encouraged by the recalls of automotive workers around the District. 
Tool and die producers were reported to be receiving a rising number 
of requests for bids. In other industries such as instruments and 
ball bearings, expanding production at some firms offset small 
workforce or pay cuts by others. While the planned shutdown of a 
major steel facility in one area threatened to send the local 
unemployment rate up sharply, plants in other parts of the District 
were being kept open by the transfer of ownership to local 
management groups or foreign companies. The nonmanufacturing sector 
continued to hold up well. In Buffalo, which has been particularly 
hard-hit by the slump in manufacturing, the financial and business 
services industries were doing quite well due to the area's growth 
as a regional banking center.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business leaders have begun to sense that the economy has finally 
hit bottom and are now hopeful that the recovery will get underway 
during the second quarter. One source of the rising optimism was an 
increase in average weekly hours in most of the District. Our 
respondents generally believe that longer workweeks will be followed 
two or three months from now by increases in employment. However, 
one employment official who forecast an upswing also expressed 
concern that the recovery could be weak and short-lived. As for 
capital spending, none of our contacts saw an imminent rebound, but 
one was encouraged by the record level of expenditures planned for 
1983 by a major manufacturer in upstate New York.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from David Jones (Aubrey Lanston &amp; Co.), 
James O'Leary (U.S. Trust), and Albert Wojnilower (First Boston 
Corp.) Their views of course are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jones: The economy appears to be poised for a stronger-than-expected 
bounce-back in the early months of 1983. The recent surge in new 
orders provides an upward momentum that will likely be strengthened 
by rising consumer demand, paced by spending on autos and housing. 
This should, in turn, trigger the restocking of business 
inventories, following an excessive inventory liquidation in the 
final quarter of 1982. At the same time, however, there is a 
possibility of near-term upward pressure on interest rates, 
particularly longer term rates. This will stem partly from the fact 
that a stronger-than-expected recovery and the related step-up in 
inventory accumulation will lead to an unanticipated pickup in 
consumer and business credit demands. More immediately, the Federal 
government's huge borrowing demands are likely to prove more 
difficult to manage, particularly if the Fed, as suggested by recent 
remarks by Chairman Volcker, moves to reassert monetary discipline. 
The expected near-term spurt in interest rates is likely to 
temporarily depress economic activity around mid-year. This could 
result in an uneven recovery pattern in 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Leary: The fear of an ultimate heating up of inflation remains 
strong in the fixed-income markets and it is a powerful force toward 
keeping real intermediate- and longer term interest rates high. This 
fear is nurtured by the huge Federal deficit and the conviction that 
political pressures for economic expansion will cause the Fed to 
keep credit excessively easy for too long a time. The markets are 
nonetheless impressed that so far the Fed is not following the 
feared pattern.
     </p>
     <p>
      We appear to be in the early stages of a general business recovery, 
but until there is clearer recognition that this is in fact the 
case, it would be appropriate for the Fed to continue cautiously to 
encourage lower interest rates and general business recovery. By 
spring or certainly by early summer, my guess is that the path of 
recovery will be sure enough that the authorities should begin to 
slow down the rate of increase of the monetary base and bank 
reserves. This will provide assurance that the Fed is not going to 
make the mistake of staying too long with an expansionary policy. 
Hopefully the move can be made gradually enough to avoid any run-up 
of short-term rates. Actually, it should help to reduce long-term 
rates somewhat further.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: Anecdotal contacts suggest, even more strongly than do 
the fragmentary statistics, that the economy has begun to expand. 
With the exception of capital goods manufacturers, attitudes among 
business executives have become distinctly more optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      This improvement in the economic climate, coupled with official and 
private statements warning of the danger of re-inflation, has 
produced widespread market sentiment that interest rates will not 
decline much more if at all. This makes interest rates prone to 
sporadic increases until it becomes clear that the economic recovery 
will be anemic or, even better from the standpoint of the bond 
market participants, nonexistent. A collapse in oil prices would be 
a countervailing force that would significantly depress interest 
rates and, in the shorter run, also the economy. Recent contacts 
with individuals having exceptional high-level familiarity with the 
situation suggest they share the general uncertaintyâ€”and the hope, 
but also lack of conviction, that an orderly and sustainable 
agreement on a lower market price in the $28 to $30 per barrel range 
might be reached.
