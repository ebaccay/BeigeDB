      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sharply rising interest rates have caused most respondents 
in the Fourth District to adjust their 1981 forecasts downward, with 
several now expecting at least one quarterly decline in real GNP in 
the first quarter. Capital goods producers continue to experience 
weakening orders, especially in machine tools. Orders in the primary 
metals industry continue to hold up surprisingly well, but industry 
spokesmen expect a decline next quarter in response to a weakening 
economy. Post-Thanksgiving day department store sales have been 
better than expected, but several area retailers are concerned about 
softening Christmas season sales because of rising interest rates. 
Bankers report continued weak loan demand. S&amp;Ls expect an 
intensified profit squeeze as costs rise and loan demand slackens 
because of rising mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although a sluggish recovery was generally anticipated at 
the Fourth District Economists' Roundtable meeting on November 7, 
most participants now expect a decline in real GNP in the first and 
possibly second quarters of 1981. Several bank economists envision 
the negative quarters as part of a continuation of the 1980 
recession. The release of pent-up demand following credit restraints 
provided a brief third quarter recovery in consumer spending and 
economic activity. Positive quarters during a recession are not 
uncommon, such as occurred during the 1973-75 recession. However, 
interest rates never went to double-digit levels, notes a bank 
economist, because inflation was viewed as a short-term problem. 
Now, inflation is viewed as a serious long-term problem. Several 
business economists anticipate at best a flat first half and a 
strong recovery in the second half of 1981 based on tax cuts, pent-
up demand, and falling interest rates. A business economist notes 
that, despite rising industrial production, inventories are still 
generally tight and inventory liquidation is unlikely to sustain a 
recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although capital spending remains weak, industry 
officials state that the decline in orders has not been as sharp as 
in some past recessions and the worst is probably over. While their 
overall order pattern was late in turning down (i.e., orders were 
strong until July), a machine tool producer notes that orders remain 
strong from energy and aerospace industries. Cancellations from the 
auto industry have not occurred, but softening of machine tool 
orders in the first quarter of 1981 is expected as major programs 
reach completion. A producer of trucks and heavy equipment reports 
that orders are not showing strength from recent very low levels. 
Investment in trucks is not taking place, except for replacement. 
Despite the unlikeliness of a strong recovery, a capital goods 
producer expects such positive factors as defense spending and an 
underlying need to modernize to provide a good recovery in capital 
spending, especially in the second half of 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Primary Metals
      </strong>
      <br/>
      November orders in the steel and aluminum industries 
have held up surprisingly well, according to industry economists. 
November's volume of steel orders was slightly above October's rate, 
although a steel economist reports signs of a tapering off toward 
the end of the month. Bookings in January remain solid, including 
flat-roll products, and even February has shown no letup. 
Nevertheless, orders in February and March are expected to slacken 
as effects of rising interest rates and tax increases dampen 
consumer durable goods, housing and producers' goods. The turnaround 
in steel this quarter to about 80% of capacity from a low of about 
50% last summer, largely represents a swing in inventories from 
substantial liquidation last quarter to a mild buildup in December. 
Aluminum orders, reports an industry economist, have been supported 
by the relative strength in defense, aerospace and auto sectors. 
Although normally a net importer, the country has been a net 
exporter for 14 months. However, with a worldwide slump underway, 
orders are expected to drop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several retailers report stronger-than-expected sales 
the day after Thanksgiving. A department store official states that 
sales are currently doing well, compared to last year, with the 
heaviest volume days yet to come. Inventories appear to be adequate, 
but in some cases are lean. However, pre-Christmas discounting may 
still be necessary to avoid an unwanted overhang. An economist with 
a major retail chain in the District expects an 8% year-over-year 
increase in December's GAF sales, and a slight increase in real PCE 
in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level. However, an 
apparel producer estimates a 5 to 6% decrease in company sales over 
the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      While several area automotive dealers are concerned about sales, an 
industry economist reports that small cars continue to sell 
relatively well despite rising interest rates. An area auto dealer 
states that rebates are essential to sales and notes that domestic 
producers are beginning to provide credit support for dealers. An 
auto industry economist states that production schedules are already 
being adjusted downward to minimize inventory overhang.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer and business loans are still relatively weak, 
according to several area bankers, partly because many consumer loan 
applications are being rejected. A bank economist notes that the 
volume of outstanding consumer loans declined in recent weeks, which 
is unusual for this time of year. Auto loans have been the most 
interest-sensitive consumer loans in recent weeks and declines in 
loan applications have been more than seasonal. A bank official 
notes that a disproportionate share of auto loans is for 1980 models 
at the expense of 1981 models, reflecting higher cost of new models. 
Loans for dealer floor plans are off because some dealers still have 
sizable 1980 inventories, which must be reduced before banks will 
risk financing higher inventories. Some pickup in business loans has 
occurred in the last month, according to a bank economist, as 
corporations avoid long-term markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mortgage Lending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weak mortgage loan demand and the rising cost of 
funds are causing serious earnings pressure on area S&amp;Ls. However, 
an economist with a regional FHLB in the District notes that the 
improvement in earnings that began in August has continued through 
October, and probably in November, although profit declines are 
expected by January 1981. Earnings next quarter could be worse than 
in early 1980, but the net worth condition of S&amp;Ls is strong enough 
to sustain profit declines. While conventional mortgage rates on 80% 
loans range between 14 and 15 1/2%, an S&amp;L official states that 
preferential rates are being offered by some banks to move unsold 
new homes. While savings flows have been good in November, mainly 
because of money market certificates, several S&amp;L officials state 
the funds are used either to repay advances or to invest in money 
markets.
