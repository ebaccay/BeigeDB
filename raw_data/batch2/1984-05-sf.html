      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy appears to be growing at a slower rate 
than earlier this year but still to be outperforming the nation. 
Consumer spending strengthened in April, with rising interest rates 
reported to have had no dampening effect or durable goods sales. 
Western homebuilding activity has slowed since January, but remains 
far stronger relative to a year ago than nationally. Nonresidential 
construction activity continues to pick up, but there is some 
concern that vacancy rates in office and commercial buildings are 
rising. In the manufacturing sector, employment and output generally 
continue to grow but at a slower rate, partly due to the effects of 
the housing slowdown on such industries as lumber and the near full 
capacity operations reached in a few industries such as aluminum and 
paper. In California, agricultural crop growing and demand 
conditions generally are considerably better than a year ago, but 
wheat farmers in the Pacific Northwest are experiencing another 
difficult year. Loan demand at Twelfth District banks has continued 
at a strong pace despite higher interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending appears to have increased more than seasonally 
during April. Major department stores in Southern California, for 
example, experienced an average 11 percent year-to-year gain in 
sales during the first half of April compared with a 10 percent rate 
of growth for all of March. In other Western states, sales also 
increased, although the year-to-year gain was not as large. Sales of 
apparel have been especially strong—up 25 percent at Southern 
California department stores. But furniture, appliances and other 
durable goods also are selling well and have not been adversely 
affected by higher interest rates. Auto dealerships have been 
experiencing much larger sales gains than department stores, even in 
rural areas, and sales would be even higher were it not for 
shortages of some larger-size vehicles. Auto financing charges to 
consumers have risen only slightly due to competition created by 
captive automobile financing companies. Except for autos, retail 
inventories are reported to be somewhat heavy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing employment continues to expand among a wide spectrum 
of industries but at a slower rate overall than during the fourth 
quarter. The most rapid gains continue to occur in the electronic 
equipment and missiles and apace vehicles industries located in 
California, Oregon, Arizona and Utah. Electronic firms have been 
benefiting not only from rising defense and consumer demand but 
business capital spending to enhance efficiency. Other capital goods 
industries adding to their payrolls include nonelectrical machinery, 
trucks and aircraft. In Washington, the nation's leading 
manufacturer of commercial transport planes has been adding workers 
since October but recently reduced its sales forecast for the 1985-
87 period. The Pacific Northwest lumber industry has been 
experiencing a decline in orders and prices recently due to the 
slowdown in national homebuilding. Two other Pacific Northwest 
industries—aluminum and paper—are reported to be operating at 
near full capacity, as is the California semiconductor industry. 
Apart from these industries, the manufacturing sector throughout the 
West generally still has ample unused production potential. After a 
period of stability in payrolls, the copper and coal industries have 
been laying off workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity in the West has slowed since January in 
response to the rise in mortgage interest rates. But as of March, 
Western starts still remained 22 percent higher than a year earlier 
compared with only a 3 percent year-to-year gain nationally. Housing 
sales remained strong through March, but are reported to have 
dropped 10-20 percent in April. This slowdown in sales, combined 
with the large number of new homes recently completed, has resulted 
in an increase in the inventory of unsold homes which suggests that 
Western housing starts could fall in the next few months. 
Respondents point to several factors which indicate that any such 
decline could be moderate however. These factors include the rapid 
increase expected in personal income in the West, the increased 
public acceptance of adjustable rate mortgage packages—which 
offer initial rates as much as 3 percentage points below 
conventional fixed rate mortgages—and the increased offerings of 
"buy-down" programs by builders. While respondents report a sharp 
increase in nonresidential construction activity, they express 
concern that the supply of new office and commercial space is 
already beginning to outstrip demand. Firms continue to be cautious 
about investing in new industrial structures, except for electronic 
equipment manufacturers, especially semiconductor firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions and prospects vary among the District 
states. In California, crop conditions generally are considerably 
more favorable than a year ago. Prices for most fruit and vegetable 
crops produced in the state are up sharply from those of a year ago, 
partly as a result of the winter freeze in Florida and Texas. 
Planting and growing conditions are far better due to improved 
weather. For example, planting of cotton is in full swing under 
excellent weather conditions. Tree crops are budding early, 
suggesting that yields of tree fruits and grapes will be moderate 
and prices higher. In the Pacific Northwest, farmers are 
experiencing another difficult year however. In Idaho, over 50 
percent of last year's wheat crop is in storage. Prices for the Fall 
wheat crop are expected to be only slightly above the break-even 
point for most farmers in Washington and Idaho. Farm property values 
are declining in the Pacific Northwest and a few scattered areas of 
California. Bankers estimate that around 5-7 percent of California's 
farmers are in extreme financial difficulty but that the percentage 
is considerably higher elsewhere in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rising interest rates over the last two months have been reflected 
in loan rates, but have not yet had a significant impact on loan 
demand in the Twelfth District. Commercial loan rates have shown the 
largest increase because they float in accordance with market rates. 
Consumer loan rates at the major banks in the region generally have 
risen by a smaller amount—25 to 100 basis points on most fixed-
rate loan products. Qualification standards, and other loan pricing 
terms at most institutions, generally have remained unchanged. The 
increase in rates has had mixed effects on loan demand among 
institutions. In some cases, the strengthening economy has overcome 
rising rates; other institutions report weaker loan demand. For the 
District as a whole, large banks continue to report rapid growth in 
commercial and consumer loans, and moderate growth in mortgage 
lending. Banks anticipate continued strength in demand for 
commercial loans, especially as borrowers accelerate their takedowns 
of the large loan commitments used to finance merger activity. 
However, institutions are concerned that further interest rate 
pressure could begin to have a significant dampening impact on real 
estate loan demand.
