      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 18, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions continue to improve. Employment is 
rising and unemployment is falling. Retailers report improving 
sales. Manufacturing activity appears to be expanding slowly. Prices 
and orders for primary metals are strengthening. Construction 
continues to be a bright spot. Demand for fossil fuels remains weak, 
and farm prospects remain uncertain despite the new program to 
curtail production. Banks are reported to be liquid, with 
residential mortgage lending the only sector showing strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment is rising and 
unemployment is falling in this District. Manufacturing employment 
in Ohio (nsa) rose slightly in January, February, and March, and 
average hours worked per week has a slowly rising trend. Recalls 
have begun at some firms as orders have improved but firms generally 
are cautious about expanding their workforce. Indexes of leading 
indicators point to recovery in Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Indexes 
for both areas have risen for five consecutive months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates in the District are falling but remain well above 
the national average. Unemployment rates in the District's eleven 
largest SMSAs averaged 14.0% in March (nsa), down from 15.4% in 
January, and the rate fell in every SMSA except Toledo.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major retailers report improving sales. Department 
store sales have been very good in recent weeks. One major firm 
reports sales up 4 percent in real terms from the year-ago level. 
Another reports April sales up 1.7 percent (s.a., monthly rate) from 
March, and similar gains in early May. Both firms report higher 
priced "upscale" goods doing especially well, and both are 
optimistic about the sales outlook. The intensity of price 
promotions has ebbed some in the last two or three months. 
Inventories are described as "clean and lean;" neither firm plans 
major adjustments up or down.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major automobile service and tire retailer reports unit volume of 
tire sales up 10 percent from last year and dollar volume of service 
sales up 7 percent. The firm describes the market as "extremely 
competitive," with more price cutting this year than last. Inventory 
levels are satisfactory and no adjustments are planned. Customers 
continue to replace tires only when absolutely necessary, except for 
buyers of "prestige" tires.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity appears to be expanding 
slowly, but capital goods production remains weak. A survey of 
purchasing managers reveals increases in orders and production, and 
stable employment. Inventories of raw materials, supplies, and 
finished goods are stable. Many orders are "rush," apparently 
because of lean inventories. Price increases outnumber price 
decreases by a growing margin but most prices are stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Preliminary results of this Bank's May survey of Fourth District 
manufacturers shows new orders, shipments and backlogs are rising 
while inventories are flat. Prices paid for supplies are generally 
stable, as is employment, but there is some increase in average 
hours worked per week.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of machine tools is very pessimistic. Except for 
those from the defense industry, he is obtaining practically no 
orders, not even for spare parts for which orders usually improve at 
this stage of a business cycle. He sees no sign of upturn in his 
business before 1984. A major producer of components for capital 
goods reports orders were flat in April and are likely to be flat in 
May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Primary Metals
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders and prices are strengthening for steel and 
aluminum. A major steel producer reports that orders for flat rolled 
steel had surged earlier this year as customers feared that supply 
might tighten, but that flurry of orders quickly died. Steel users 
have ceased liquidating inventory. Shipments to steel users have 
risen to equal steel consumption, which is rising slowly in line 
with the general business recovery. Steel mills are still reducing 
their own inventory to raise cash to offset losses from operations 
that are still below the break-even point. The gap is slowly 
closing, however, as volume and prices gradually rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of aluminum reports that orders have improved 
substantially since last fall, at times coming in at a rate that 
exceeded capacity. The strength in orders has come from customers 
hedging against rising prices and a possible strike in June, from 
refilling the supply pipeline after customer inventories had become 
too low, and from some strengthening in underlying demand, 
especially from housing and autos. Ingot prices have risen by half 
since last summer but remain below some producers' costs of 
production as there is strong competitive pressure for market share.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction continues to be a bright spot. House 
construction continues to rise and respondents are confident the 
improved level of house construction in the District can be 
maintained at current mortgage interest rates. House prices are 
firming and larger houses are being built and bought. House builders 
expect shortages of lumber, gypsum board, and skilled workers. 
Office construction is likely to remain strong in the District for 
another year or two as major projects already underway are carried 
to completion, but few new projects are being planned. Construction 
of shopping space is weak, but construction of general purpose 
industrial buildings is firm. Rental rates for non-residential 
properties are very soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for fossil fuels remains weak. A director reports 
spot market demand for coal is practically non-existent. Small mine 
operators are in difficulty and their numbers are shrinking. Oil and 
gas exploration is drying up. There is an excess of drilling rigs, 
and drilling is expected to be weak for at least another year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farm income is low and prospects remain uncertain 
despite the payment in kind (PIK) program. A director is concerned 
that the PIK program may not take enough land out of production to 
avoid another bumper crop. Prices are rising sharply for grass seed 
required to prevent erosion of idled land that has more than an 8 
percent grade. Commodity prices are recovering, but only because of 
speculation on PIK' s impact. Some farmers, expecting higher prices, 
are fertilizing crops more heavily than usual, and others are 
considering reducing the amount of land they will withdraw from 
production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some farms still are being sold at distress prices but others are 
now selling at reasonable prices. Another director reports farm 
equipment sales are rising and dealers are accepting PIK commodity 
warrants as payment for equipment. Fertilizer sales are reported to 
be slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks are very liquid, putting downward pressure 
on interest rates as residential mortgage lending is the only sector 
with strong demand. Inflows of deposits to MMDAs are reported 
slowing, especially as offered interest rates are lowered toward 
market rates. Business loan demand is soft, while consumer loans are 
up a bit. Bankers report getting a smaller-than-usual share of 
automobile financing business. Residential mortgage lending activity 
continues to grow rapidly, and the proportion of it used to 
refinance older high-interest rate mortgages is shrinking.
