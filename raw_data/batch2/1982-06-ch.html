      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Developments in the Seventh District provide little hope 
for near-term improvement. It is unlikely that the region will 
participate in the uptrend widely expected for the nation in the 
second half of 1982. Machinery and equipment output and bookings 
have been declining sharply this year in virtually all lines. Sales 
and output of motor vehicles improved in the second quarter, but 
remained at depressed levels. Increases in defense outlays have not 
been a significant factor here. Retail sales of nondurables rose 
somewhat in May, but remained relatively soft. Construction activity 
showed less than seasonal gains. Most employers have been reducing 
or, at best, maintaining staff. Unilateral cuts in nonunion 
compensation are common. Renegotiations of labor contracts continue, 
not always successfully. Some large corporations are shrinking or 
restructuring operations. Price reductions are still common, but may 
be moderating. Oil product prices have rebounded. Seventh District 
farmers are completing crop plantings, after a slow start in Iowa. 
Livestock prices continue at favorable levels, but corn and soybean 
prices remain depressed. Farm equipment sales remain poor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Declines Spread
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Few economic sectors in the District have remained 
untouched by the recession. Meat packing has been going through a 
painful adjustment. Electrical component manufacturers report 
substantial declines in orders, for some the worst in their history. 
Demand for office furniture, which remained strong through the first 
quarter, softened in the spring. Service industries also report 
reduced demand, including engineering, technical consulting, public 
relations, commodities trading, and recreation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Some companies now expect a 5 percent rise in average 
prices of purchased materials in 1982, only half as much as in 1980 
or 1981. But in some sectors prices are down dramatically. Bids on 
construction projects are running 10 to 20 percent below estimates. 
Sharp price discounts also are noted for steel products, nonferrous 
metals, cement and other building materials, and paper products. 
Many of these depressed prices would rebound rapidly if demand 
improved, partly because capacity has been reduced by retirement of 
older facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Corporate Restructuring
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial problems and reduced estimates of 
future demand have caused various District corporations to take 
steps to restructure their operations. Drastic actions are required 
in some cases to "ensure survival", and to get into position for the 
eventual upturn. Divisions are being closed or sold—some because 
they are unprofitable, others because they are readily marketable. 
Substantial reductions in corporate staff and unilateral cuts in 
nonunion salaries—up to 10 percent—are common. Negotiations with 
unions to adjust compensation and work rules in order to control 
labor costs continue, often without publicity. However, substantial 
increases in compensation continue to be announced in many fields.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continue soft in all portions of the 
District. In April, payroll employment in the five District states 
was down 5 percent from the prosperous level of April 1978 and 
manufacturing down 18 percent, a much worse performance than the 
nation. Unemployment averaged 12 percent in the District in April, 
compared to 5.6 percent four years earlier (when it was lower than 
for the nation). In addition to those unemployed, many workers are 
on short hours. Complete shutdowns for a week or more at a time are 
common. New hirings are at a low ebb as indicated by help-wanted ads 
and reports from job-finding agencies. Summer work for students is
less available than at any time since the 1930s. New college 
graduates with technical degrees are having unusual difficulty 
finding work.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Expenditures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Evidence from District companies suggests a 
much larger decline in capital spending than was indicated by the 
recent Commerce Department survey, both for projects to be located 
here, and for equipment produced here. Business equipment orders are 
off sharply this year, frequently by 20 to 30 percent or more. 
Components such as castings are off as much as 50 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto production was off 31 percent from last year in 
the first quarter, and 22 percent in the second quarter, but the 
third quarter is expected to be up 7 percent. Light truck output has 
been running well ahead of last year since February, but heavy 
trucks remain weak. Vehicle inventories are at comfortable levels 
and imports are under restraint. Industry leaders expect a 
continuing moderate improvement in sales and output of both cars and 
trucks, but not enough to return the auto centers to prosperity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although steel demand is running well below forecasts made 
earlier this year, District producers have increased their share of 
the total. Primarily, this is because auto industry demand for 
steel, an important market for these mills, is "less bad" than the 
total. Demand for heavy steel products for structures and equipment 
is "weak and getting weaker." Steel executives are pleased that the 
Administration has decided to take action to curtail steel imports, 
although imports are less of a factor here than nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of general merchandise improved in May according 
to major District retail chains, but no strong further advance is 
anticipated. Auto parts and apparel are moving well, but big ticket 
items, including household appliances and floor coverings, remain 
slow. While use of installment credit has increased somewhat, 
delinquency experience has been favorable, reflecting tighter 
standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction contracts for new commercial and 
industrial structures in the Midwest are running well below last 
year's depressed level. Work continues on large new office buildings 
for Chicago's downtown area, but new starts are being delayed 
because major tenants have not been signed and permanent financing 
has not been arranged. Rehabilitation work is relatively strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop planting is nearly complete throughout the 
District. Even west of the Mississippi, where rains caused delays, 
substantial progress has been made. As of June 20, soybean planting 
in Iowa was 88 percent complete (compared to a five-year average of 
100 percent), and corn planting was 98 percent complete. Despite 
heavy rains in some local areas, crop conditions are quite good.
