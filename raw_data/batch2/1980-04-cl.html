      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 15, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in the Fourth District now expect a somewhat deeper 
recession than they did in early March as signs of recession are 
spreading beyond residential construction. Business spending remains 
strong, but fixed investment is expected to decline if interest 
rates remain high. Although it is too early to tell how consumer 
attitudes on spending have been affected by the March 14 credit 
restraints, most respondents believe retail sales are in a 
contractionary phase. Bankers generally confirm that loan demand 
remains strong for business, but loan demand has declined for 
consumers because of credit constraints. Several banks and S&amp;Ls are 
withdrawing from the mortgage market until short-term interest rates 
stabilize or decline. Inflation appears to be on the verge of a 
steady decline over the next several months, although the underlying 
inflation rate is believed to remain unchanged at about 10%.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents associated with consumer spending and housing believe a 
recession is now underway. Several economists who attended the 
Fourth District Round Table on March 7 have lowered their real GNP 
forecasts because of higher interest rates and tightening credit 
conditions. Instead of a mild 1.0% peak-to-trough decline during the 
second and third quarters that they projected in early March, they 
now expect a decline between 2.5% and 3.0%. Although virtually all 
the respondents believe that interest rates have peaked, economic 
activity next quarter is expected to show the sharpest decline as 
business spending weakens along with the decline in consumer 
spending. However, a fourth quarter pick-up in real GNP is foreseen 
by most respondents as consumer spending strengthens in response to 
lower interest rates and expected tax cuts. Virtually all of the 
respondents expect a sluggish recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prospects that business spending will be relatively unaffected by 
the recession seem to be fading. Because long lead times are 
required, fixed investment programs already underway are unlikely to 
be cut, according to one capital-goods producer, even if new 
equipment is no longer needed for the near-term. However, rising 
interest rates and weakening cash flow positions will cause 
cancellation of many short-term spending programs. An economist for 
the auto industry states that fuel efficiency laws will prevent 
capital spending cutbacks that might normally have occurred in the 
industry. An economist for the machine tool industry reports that 
new orders are beginning to slow, although some businesses may be 
waiting to see if interest rates fall before placing their orders. 
Although a mild inventory liquidation may still occur in the second 
and third quarters, most respondents report that inventories are 
under control. Even auto inventories are under better control now 
than recently. However, a consumer-durables producer is concerned 
that small businesses are being squeezed by credit constraints and 
expects a rising incidence of returned goods and of bankruptcies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although some softening in PCE was expected, credit restraints will 
make financing of durables goods by consumers more difficult. March 
sales of department store type goods slowed sharply from the first 
two months of 1980. An economist for a major department store chain 
reports a 7.5-8.0% year-over-year gain in 'March compared to much 
larger gains in the previous two months. In real terms, sales 
increases did not match price increases (about 8%) for department 
store type goods for the first time since 1975. Also, the auto sales 
slump in recent weeks was widely attributed to the end of rebate 
programs. Most banks in the District will be eliminating free credit 
on credit cards by mid-year, while department stores will be 
increasing minimum monthly payments. Because credit in real terms 
has been sliding for the past year and a half and installment credit 
in nominal terms slowed even before the March 14 controls, one 
economist in the retail industry believes that controls are untimely 
and will worsen consumer spending prospects. A bank economist 
believes that the personal saving rate will rise shortly because 
consumers are faced with a cash flow squeeze and are becoming 
concerned about their ability to service debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several bankers indicate that loan demand is consistent with the 
current pattern of business and consumer spending. C&amp;I loans are 
very strong, although the rate of growth has plateaued. One bank 
economist expressed concern about the financial position of some 
borrowers, but does not expect heavy business borrowing to cause any 
unusual problems during the recession. Consumer installment credit 
has dropped sharply. Consumer loan demand, according to a District 
banker, has declined because consumers, concerned about the economy 
and higher interest payments, have reduced their spending and 
because banks, watching their profits decline, are discouraging some 
consumer loans that are currently unprofitable. However, a bank 
economist notes that customers are accumulating balances on their 
credit cards and are now paying the minimum balance more than ever 
before. Most bankers and retailers contacted will eliminate free 
credit, but one retailer is reluctant because 60% of his sales are 
based on credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lending has dropped dramatically in the last few weeks. One 
S&amp;L official reports that five rate increases since March 3 have 
raised his mortgage rates from 14% to over 17%. Several S&amp;Ls report 
continued weak deposit flows, although six month money market 
certificates still attract funds. Jumbo CDs are still required to 
meet past commitments. Still, pent-up demand remains high, according 
to an official in the housing industry, and a drop in mortgage rates 
later in the year could bring many buyers back into the market. 
Currently, for new construction, only builders having close ties 
with S&amp;Ls can borrow, according to one bank economist.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of inflation is widely expected to slacken in the next few 
months because of a peaking in mortgage rates and deceleration in 
energy price increases. The underlying rate of inflation, according 
to a steel economist, is still around 10%, but weights attached to 
mortgage rates over-emphasize the component in the CPI. Declining 
rates, perhaps 700 basis points by the end of the year, will reverse 
the process and reduce the pace of inflation by as much as two 
percentage points. Along with an easing in energy costs and food 
prices, several economists forecast consumer prices will increase 
between 10 and 11% by the end of 1980.
