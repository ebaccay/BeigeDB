      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 15, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      There are still no clear signs of a recession in the First District, 
but there are more reports of decreases in sales and output and 
fewer of increases than in the past. Depending upon the respondent, 
retail sales are either holding steady or softening. Manufacturers 
see no dramatic changes in the level of activity; however, a survey 
of purchasing agents shows an increase in the numbers with lower 
orders and production. The building trades are experiencing 
difficulties and there are reports of smaller contractors going 
bankrupt. The growth in loan demand has slowed. Several respondents 
expressed support for the credit restraint program and what they 
perceive as the Federal Reserve's leadership.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the retail sector sales seem to have weakened slightly during the 
past month. The head of a large department store chain reports that 
while sales are doing as well or better than expected in nominal 
terms, volume seems to be down. Sales are no longer keeping pace 
with inflation. Inventories remain under control with high interest 
rates providing an additional incentive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Host manufacturers contacted report that production and new orders 
remain fairly strong. Sales of industrial safety equipment, which 
should be related to national production, are very healthy. Heavy 
capital equipment for the chemicals, plastics, and auto industries 
is selling well; there has been no increase in cancellations. A 
producer of small capital goods also reports good demand, but there 
has been a shift from the direct purchase of the equipment to short 
term rental arrangements. He attributes this to the high cost of 
financing. The defense business is extremely good. This favorable 
picture is generally confirmed by a survey of purchasing managers 
taken just last week. Most respondents stated that production levels 
at the current time are the same or above those of a month ago. 
However, there was an increase in the number for whom production is 
lower and there was a sizable increase in the number reporting that 
new orders are down. One industry which is not doing well is the 
tire industry; a representative of one large manufacturer said that, 
from his standpoint, the recession began a year ago and the trough 
has still not been reached.
     </p>
     <p>
      The growth in loan demand appears to have slowed. There is very 
little demand for mortgages at current high rates. One of the 
region's largest banks reports that loan demand is stable at a high 
level; however, if adjusted for seasonality the increase over the 
past several months still exceeds 9 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, and Solow were available 
for comment this month. None of them felt that the credit restraint 
program by itself will push the economy into recession, although 
they agreed that it probably will have a marginal impact over and 
above the more constraining effect of high interest rates. Not all 
of them agreed that the economy is currently in recession, but all 
still expect slow growth in the year ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Eckstein welcomes the bank loan growth guideline. He finds 
the rest of the program dubious, however, describing it as a 
"counterproductive side show." Especially onerous in his opinion is 
the reserve requirement on growth of money market mutual fund 
assets. Eckstein thinks that the reduced yield on the funds may 
lower savings, an unfortunate development for believers in supply-side economics. He warns the Fed not to revert to its old policy 
during the recession and to avoid drowning the economy in liquidity 
as the demand for money falls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Houthakker does not think the credit restraint program is 
important, although he supports it if it helps the Fed achieve its 
money growth objectives. He urges the Fed to maintain its current 
objectives. Barring a major financial crisis, Houthakker believes 
there is an even chance the economy will escape recession and 
continue along a slow growth path. Because this outlook is 
consistent with lower inflation later this year and next, because 
there is a limit to the optimal diversification of international 
reserves, and because of growing balance of payments-deficits in 
Germany and Japan, he expects the dollar to remain strong for some 
time despite occasional setbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Samuelson characterizes the credit restraint program as a 
placebo, but he thinks it may have a beneficial psychological effect 
in the short run. He notes that the Fed "cannot hold back the level 
of the ocean by moral suasion" in the long run, however, so he 
believes the program is only a minor additional factor beyond 
earlier tightening. Samuelson thinks that the Fed should allow 
interest rates to fall as the economy weakens, but not to become 
overly aggressive in supplying reserves should money growth fall 
below target.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Solow believes that tile credit restraint program is 
mostly "stagecraft," although it may precipitate the long-awaited 
recession. He hopes it will be the widely anticipated recession and 
not a more serious one. While the jawboning of banks may help ease 
credit expansion, Solow argues that anticipatory borrowing in 
January and February may mitigate the impact of slower measured loan 
growth in the months ahead. He is concerned about the strength of 
the dollar, arguing that induced capital inflows and lower exports 
are an inappropriate way to balance U.S. trade accounts and that the 
real cost of weaker exports exceeds the anti-inflationary benefit of 
a stronger currency.
