      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The majority view among area businessmen and economists is that the 
  recession began in the second quarter and will continue through the 
  second quarter of 1980. The recession will be slightly deeper and 
  longer than previously believed, mainly because of recent energy 
  developments. Most manufacturers continue to operate close to 
  capacity on the strength of backlogs. Capital goods producers report 
  that capital spending has lost some momentum, but most do not expect 
  a decline in spending until the fourth quarter. A slight rebound 
  during the third quarter is expected in the consumer sector, but not 
  enough to reverse the negative second quarter numbers. Gasoline 
  flows are improving and may aid in the deceleration of price 
  increases. Mortgage loan demand remained strong over the last few 
  months. The city of Cleveland may be unable to meet its own 
  repayment schedule on defaulted notes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several area economists have revised their forecast to show a 
  slightly deeper and longer recession lasting through the second 
  quarter of 1980 in the absence of fiscal stimulus. They attribute 
  the downward revision primarily to recent energy developments. An 
  economist in the energy industry is optimistic that consumers will 
  adjust quickly to the higher energy costs. A producer of major 
  appliances expects that the decline will be gradual with a 
  relatively mild inventory adjustment occurring primarily in the 
  fourth quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among primary metals producers, production continued at "effective" capacity, but with emerging signs of a slowdown. Steel economists 
  report only small declines in production over the past few weeks and 
  backlogs are still high. However, steel orders booked three months 
  in advance have slowed considerably and backlogs are expected to be 
  declining by September. The aluminum industry has not experienced a 
  severe turndown in demand, but production is slightly slower than 
  last month. Modest declines have occurred in production lines 
  related to housing, auto and other consumer sectors. An aluminum 
  economist reports that the industry is still below its optimal level 
  of inventories and is expecting a record year in shipments.
       </p>
       <p>
        A mild recession forecast is based upon the capital goods sector 
  remaining strong at least until the fourth quarter. An official in 
  the machine tool industry reports that production at his plant has 
  returned to a more normal capacity with the recent elimination of 
  overtime. He feels that capital goods spending is no longer in an 
  expansionary phase, but that production should remain steady through 
  the third quarter on the strength of order backlogs. Most 
  manufacturers report that investment projects already underway 
  should continue, but projects where money has not been appropriated 
  are being postponed. Exceptions are aerospace and energy industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Fourth District, especially Ohio, fared better than most of the 
  U. S. during the energy crisis. An economist in the petroleum 
  industry explained that access to Alaskan crude oil provided 
  adequate supplies that could be traded for better gasoline-making 
  crude. Refineries have been operating over 100% of capacity for the 
  last six weeks. No closings or disruptions were reported by 
  industries due to fuel shortages.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prices remained strong, but many officials expressed optimism that 
  price pressures would be weakened by the recession. Improved 
  gasoline supplies should contribute to a slowing in the rate of 
  gasoline price increases. However, an economist in the consumer 
  durables sector calculated the underlying rate of inflation (less 
  food and energy shocks) at 10%. He expects double-digit inflation 
  for the remainder of the year, but some moderation in 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        The consumer sector may experience a marginal rebound in the third 
  quarter, but not enough to reverse the negative growth in the second 
  quarter. Retail sales started to soften in May and continued through 
  June. Although July sales are slow, they are still almost even with 
  the pace during July of last year. However, a supplier to the auto 
  and appliance industries feels that consumers are glutted with cars 
  and appliances because of heavy anticipatory buying between August 
  of 1978 and May of 1979. Manufacturers fear that auto inventories 
  are too heavy and that other durable goods will soon follow.
       </p>
       <p>
        District officials were encouraged by the strength of the housing 
  sector. A severe downturn is not anticipated because the underlying 
  demand f or housing remains strong. Although housing sales have 
  slowed and mortgage demand is down relative to last year, mortgage 
  demand has stabilized in recent months and still exceeds supply. 
  Consequently, S&amp;Ls report some tightening of terms of mortgage 
  loans. S&amp;Ls continue to report difficulty in raising money since 
  March, although the overall amount of savings has been quite strong 
  over the first half of 1979. Barring further rises in money market 
  rates and severe disintermediation, S&amp;Ls anticipate a relatively 
  mild housing turndown.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cleveland's financial situation has shown little improvement despite 
  the optimism after the March income tax hike. Rescue legislation has 
  slowed in the State Senate and is unlikely to emerge before the 
  mayoral campaign begins this fall. City financial records show that 
  four special divisions in the city's budget have overspent by $4 
  million so far this year. Most sewer and street repairs have been 
  halted. A special ordinance was required to allow a last minute 
  roll-over of city notes using Water Department improvement funds. 
  The city's own plan to repay the $14.5 million in defaulted notes 
  with $1.5 million installments beginning in August may have to be 
  abandoned due to the lack of funds on hand.
