      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 16, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing in the First District has weakened over the past month 
and a half. Many more firms than usual have announced shutdowns over 
the Christmas season. The retail situation is more difficult to 
assess; since Thanksgiving, sales have been strong in some areas, 
weak in others. Also, last year the Christmas season began slowly 
but ended on a strong note and the season as a whole was quite good; 
it is impossible to tell yet if this is happening again. Retailers 
are somewhat concerned about inventory levels; most manufacturers, 
despite the recent downturn, do not view inventories as a problem. 
The housing market remains weak, but mortgage rates are now 
beginning to fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Until Thanksgiving, New England retail sales in November continued 
to reflect the weakening economy. As a result, inventories are 
higher than planned. Since Thanksgiving, retailing has been very 
mixed. Some areas are showing unexpected strength, and in others, 
sales have fallen well below the usual seasonal levels. The picture 
in Massachusetts is complicated by a heavy weekend snowstorm that 
closed most stores for a day.
     </p>
     <p>
      One merchant cites particular strength in sales of high quality 
goods, partly a result of that firm's efforts to attract more high 
income customers and partly because the recession is affecting high 
income shoppers less. This is consistent with sales reports showing 
greater weakness for discount stores than for full price department 
stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the merchants are optimistic about Christmas sales. If last 
year's sales pattern is repeated, sales may fail to show real 
strength until the last week before Christmas. Retailers are 
currently uncertain as to whether to repeat the pre-Christmas 
markdowns and promotions they undertook last year in response to the 
sluggishness of the early holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      November brought a downturn in First District manufacturing. In a 
survey of local purchasing agents, the number of firms reporting 
that orders increased over the month fell sharply while the number 
reporting lower orders increased. There were also substantial 
increases in the numbers with lower backlogs and reduced employment 
levels. The downturn appears to be quite general; high technology 
industries have been affected and the region's leading computer 
manufacturer is shutting down plants for the Christmas week for the 
first time in its history. Only the defense business remains really 
strong. Areas which were weak have remained weak or weakened further 
- housing products, consumer hand tools and hardware, aircraft 
engines and parts. In addition, new areas of weakness are 
developing. A machine tool company has no backlog at all and orders 
are flat. A manufacturer of word processing equipment reports a 
gradual softening in sales. A producer of packaging equipment and 
materials has seen a downturn in capital goods orders in the past 
six weeks. For some the change has been very sudden: one high 
technology firm in the instruments industry reports that domestic 
business was very strong through the first three quarters of 1981 
but "on October 15 someone threw a switch."
     </p>
     <p>
      The downturn in orders will be reflected in a downturn in 
employment. The manufacturers of aircraft equipment have been laying 
off for some months; the producer of word processing equipment has 
recently cut back; a large camera manufacturer has announced 
publicly that workforces will be reduced by 1,000 in 1982; and the 
high tech instruments maker has instituted a hiring freeze. Many 
First District firms are choosing to shut down for two weeks over 
Christmas rather than reduce workforces indefinitely. Some firms 
have always shut down over Christmas but the number this year is 
unusually large and there are more shutdowns for two weeks. Because 
employment statistics are based on the week including the twelfth 
day of the month, the statistics will not pick up the Christmas 
closings and will not fully reflect the downturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even firms which are cutting back on employment feel that 
inventories are under control and generally satisfactory. Price 
increases and lead times are no longer seen as problems, although 
one firm claims that lead times for some products have lengthened 
because inventories are so lean and goods are not in stock. With 
respect to prices one executive, who previously expressed some 
bitterness about the restrictive monetary policy, made the following 
comment: "I foresee a return to a time when business raises prices 
only with great care."
     </p>
     <p>
      The only positive development other than the improving price 
situation was one firm's statement that the overseas market has 
improved slightly as buyers have become accustomed to a stronger 
dollar. Other respondents have not observed any change abroad.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, and Samuelson were available for 
comment this month. Eckstein continues to forecast that this 
recession will be "routine"—the peak to trough decline in real GNP 
will be 2 percent and the recession will last ten months, ending in 
May. Eckstein also expects a "routine" recovery in 1982 and 1983. 
Although he previously recommended that the Fed not allow short-term 
interest rates to fall below 12 percent, Eckstein now feels that 
short-term yields should be allowed to fall to 10 percent as quickly 
as possible. This lower "floor" is justified because the important 
longer-term yields have not fallen all that much recently," Ml-B 
remains below its target range, and short-term yields of 10 percent 
"are consistent with" the current state of the economy. Eckstein 
does not now advocate yields as low as 7 or 8 percent, but he is 
prepared to reduce his 10 percent floor for interest rates if the 
economy should become weaker than he now expects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Houthakker and Samuelson believe there is no good 
justification for an interest rate "floor." Houthakker contends that 
such an interest rate target is a return to a discredited policy. By 
observing such a provisional floor or ceiling, monetary targets are 
abandoned when they matter most—when real GNP is falling or rising 
too rapidly. If the Fed believes it can buy a degree of interest 
rate stability by increasing the volatility of money growth and real 
GNP growth, then "it has taken a big step backwards." By restricting 
the movement of short-term yields the Fed can only exaggerate 
cyclical swings in economic activity, thereby disrupting capital 
markets and capital market yields all the more. The Fed switched to 
monetary aggregates targets because interest rate targets ultimately 
failed to stabilize either GNP growth or interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson contends that the Fed needs to defend any deviation from 
its avowed "monetarist policy" with good reasons, otherwise the 
credibility of monetary policy is eroded. There seems to be no good 
reason to suspend the monetary targets at this time because the 
economy is weak, Ml-B is below its target (despite the all-savers 
rush, M2 is only at the top of its more restrictive target), and 
credit market yields remain high. "Those who would observe the money 
growth targets when interest rates are high and then suspend the 
targets when yields are low are not true friends of monetarism, they 
are shoppers for arguments for restraint." No one has accused the 
Fed of "chickening out" in 1981, and it should not allow provisional 
interest rate targets to create procyclical swings in policy which 
may exaggerate the current recession and the ensuing recovery. 
Indeed, interest rate forecasts are most error prone during economic 
swings and the corresponding interest rate targets are most 
unreliable. Samuelson never understood the argument that low yields 
early in 1980 caused the overly vigorous expansion that ensued. If 
the Fed made an error, it may be accused of allowing yields to rise 
too slowly during the expansion.
