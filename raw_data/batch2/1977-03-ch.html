      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Since mid-February economic activity in the Seventh District has 
    returned to relatively normal levels following the most severe deep 
    winter of modern times. Many manufacturers, particularly steel and 
    motor vehicle producers, have been working full speed to overcome 
    shortfalls in output. Many manufacturers and some retailers have 
    begun to rebuild depleted inventories, and order lead times have 
    lengthened, at least temporarily. Retailers continue to report 
    excellent sales of both durables and nondurables. Employment appears 
    to be rising in most areas. Projections of price inflation through 
    year end have been raised. Capital expenditure programs probably 
    have been increased overall, but uncertainties continue to hamper 
    business decision making. Residential construction projections have 
    been increased. Farmers and rural bankers are much disturbed by very 
    low levels of subsoil moisture, but the situation could be corrected 
    by adequate spring rains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtually everyone agrees that losses in output and work time 
    reported in January and February will be largely made up in the 
    months ahead. Activities related to producing, storing, conserving 
    fuel and energy are being accelerated. For example, programs to 
    reduce or eliminate dependence on natural gas by converting heating 
    systems and increasing storage capacity for fuel oil and propane are 
    moving ahead at a faster pace. Companies will be increasingly 
    secretive concerning their fuel resources because of certain 
    unfortunate incidents during the recent crisis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Indiana was the only district state that had significant layoffs 
    directly because of natural gas cutoffs. The last restrictions on 
    large gas users in Indiana, including the steel mills, were lifted 
    in mid-February, but some companies did not regain normal operations 
    until late in the month. Some output was lost in Michigan, Illinois, 
    and Wisconsin because supplies from vendors were curtailed, 
    reflecting fuel shortages elsewhere, because of transportation 
    problems and other weather-related factors. Much construction work 
    scheduled for the winter was postponed. Damage to roads and other 
    structures from frost is much greater than in past years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Frozen waterways hampered transport in the district from mid-January 
    to mid-February. The important Illinois Waterway from Chicago to the 
    Mississippi reopened on February 22.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although there was a tendency to exaggerate the impact of weather on 
    activity, the dangers were very real. If February had been as bad as 
    January, as was predicted, fuel oil and propane shortages could have 
    caused great hardship. Moreover, district utilities feared forced 
    diversions of gas to the East.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bad winter, rising fuel costs, use of more expensive alternative 
    fuels and transportation, absenteeism, and other related problems 
    have adversely affected profits of many companies. The drift of 
    Midwest industry toward the "Sunbelt" doubtless will be accelerated. 
    A constant refrain among important business executives is that ''now 
    we must have a sensible national energy policy."
     </p>
     <p>
      Users of natural gas emphasize that some processes, particularly 
    annealing and heat-treating, require natural gas. They urge that 
    these special needs for gas be considered in the future, instead of 
    restricting usage purely on the basis of total requirements. Most 
    interruptible gas users may not obtain usual summer supplies. The 
    real shocker in the recent curtailments was the suddenness with 
    which firm customers were cut off. Some of these companies had 
    entered into more expensive contracts to assure essential supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The auto and truck markets are very strong. Motor vehicle assemblies 
    will be at near-record levels in March and probably in April as well 
    to make up for lost production. Almost one million people attended 
    the Chicago auto show last week and potential customers appeared 
    enthusiastic, at least for the larger more fully-equipped models. 
    Domestic small cars continue to sell very poorly despite 
    inducements, and output has been restricted in a series of steps.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders for heavy trucks and trailers continue to strengthen. 
    Unfortunately, one major producer of heavy trucks located in Indiana 
    lost substantial output in February, mainly because of fuel 
    shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel orders increased in February, especially from auto companies. 
    Purchasing managers say lead times on steel have lengthened by about 
    a month. Demand for "oil country goods" has picked up sharply, and 
    there has been some increase for other capital goods. Inventories 
    are low. If steel for construction and heavy capital goods also 
    increases, shortages are possible later in the year, despite 
    increased imports from Japan. Trouble for future years may arise 
    from the fact that half of the 25 million ton increase in raw steel 
    capacity scheduled for 1980 has been canceled or postponed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for housing is very strong, especially single-family homes. 
    Prices of both new and well-located existing homes are increasing 
    about 10 percent per year with no slowdown in sight. Increases in 
    compensation for the building trades moderated last year, but this 
    was offset by more rapid increases in prices of virtually all 
    materials and components. Lumber, gypsum board, insulation, and 
    various housing components may limit production of new units. Credit 
    is in ample supply and this is expected to continue to be true 
    throughout the year. Residential tract developers are becoming 
    active again. Some work has been delayed by bad weather. Industrial 
    plant construction prospects are still poor in this district. Light 
    commercial building activity has improved, however.
