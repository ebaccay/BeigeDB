      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Twelfth District appears to have slipped more 
deeply into recession. Unemployment rates generally rose during 
November and the District as a whole posts a higher unemployment 
rate than the national average. Although declines in interest rates 
have spurred residential construction permit activity (substantially 
in some cases) the industry is operating at such levels that little 
absolute stimulus has been felt as a result. The lumber mills in the 
District are suffering from the combined impact of the continued 
reduced domestic and foreign demand, and costly timber cutting 
obligations. Retail sales have been disappointing thus far and 
conventionally strong industries—such as aerospace and electronics—are experiencing major layoffs. Motor car manufacturing is sagging 
under the announcement of further plant closures. Financial 
institutions in the region report deposit outflows or only weak 
deposit growth except in the high-yield money-market type accounts 
and loan demand has been flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from major department stores and other retailers indicate 
"disappointing" sales growth over last year, which was itself a weak 
year, although there is some early optimism about Christmas season 
activity. Several major Southern California department stores, when 
surveyed, indicated that nominal sales growth was up only about 7 
percent, barely matching the inflation rate. Penny's and Sears 
report sales volumes below that of a year ago. In the restaurant 
industry, the picture is much the same with nominal sales growth of 
about 6 percent; even that modest growth is attributed to stable 
food costs and no increase in the minimum wage allowing restaurants 
to induce continued patronage with relatively low prices, volume is 
flat for one California retail grocery chain and net income is below 
the level of a year earlier. Only tourism in Hawaii and Oregon are 
consistently reported as bright spots in the consumer spending 
picture. Hawaii expects to top its all- time tourism volume record 
this year, helping to make the Hawaiian unemployment rate one of the 
lowest in the District and considerably below the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There are few good reports concerning the condition of the 
District's manufacturing and mining enterprises. Aerospace and 
electronics report falling orders and reduced margins on foreign 
sales because of the unusual strength of the dollar. Boeing's new 
equipment sales, for example, are at the lowest annualized volume in 
20 years. Manufacturers of electronic equipment are experiencing 
reduced domestic and foreign sales; so many retailers returned 
merchandise to Atari, Inc., for example, that the price of its stock 
experienced an unprecedented plunge in early December. The mining of 
the region's copper, silver and molybdenum remain at low levels of 
activity, with 10,000 of Arizona's mining employees out of work in 
copper mines alone. Depressed world oil and gas prices have also 
affected the economies of Alaska, California and the intermountain 
states, although Utah's relatively more diversified economy has 
allowed it to experience "flat" growth rather than absolute declines 
in overall activity. Although declining interest rates have helped 
some corporations' profit positions, many remain "locked in" to long 
term financing agreements at much higher rates, causing a spotty 
pattern of profit margin changes. Automobile manufacturing in the 
District was dealt another blow with Ford's announcement that it 
would close its Northern California assembly plant. Car sales, 
however, have picked up in the District, primarily in response to 
the special interest rate concessions offered by General Motors and 
Ford.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lower interest rates have undoubtedly provided some stimulus to the 
housing industry; there have been surges in activity reported 
throughout the District, with permits increasing as much as 80 
percent in some parts of Utah. Homes are selling more rapidly in the 
low and high-priced ranges than in the medium-price range; the base 
level of activity is so low, however, that recent upsurges can 
hardly be called a recovery. Commercial real estate is also 
beginning to suffer as the traditional overbuilding cycle takes hold 
and demand for office space weakens. District architects report the 
lowest levels of backorders in years, an ominous leading indicator 
for future activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although early rains damaged tomato and wine and raisin grape crops 
in California, in general the harvest season yielded bumper crops, 
leading to depressed prices and farm incomes. In addition, there is 
a growing move toward protectionism among the District's farmers who 
feel that certain foreign products—particularly cotton and raisins—enjoy the benefit of government subsidies and are hurting domestic 
producers. The problem is amplified by the relative weakness of 
foreign currencies. The timber products industry is suffering a 
three-pronged effect of weak domestic demand (with most mills 
operating at less than 40 percent capacity), weakened European and 
Asian demand for stumpage, and costly public timber harvesting 
obligations. It is estimated that Northwest timber producers will 
suffer a $2 billion loss if they are required to comply with earlier 
contracts to harvest 10 billion board feet from public lands during 
this period of weak demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions report flat loan demand and either 
flat deposit in-flows or continued outflows; the latter is 
particularly true of the beleaguered savings and loan industry. 
Preliminary evidence from October indicates that the outflow from 
maturing All Savers Certificates may be in the $6 to $8 billion 
range for savings and loan associations. Roughly 25-45 associations 
are disappearing through consolidation each month. Falling interest 
rates have improved spreads for some associations, and some will 
report second-half profits. However, much of the profits are due to 
sales of loans or trading profits and the picture still remains 
bleak. The high-yielding money-market type accounts are the only 
major source of funds inflows to banks and savings and loan 
associations. The largest Western banks report continued 
deterioration in the financial positions of a sizable number of 
existing commercial loan customers, as well as in the condition on a 
major portion of applicants for new business loans. Until firms have 
seen a significant improvement in the business fortunes and have had 
time to resolve their current financial difficulties, near-term 
improvement in business loan demand seems most unlikely.
