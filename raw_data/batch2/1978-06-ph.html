      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Indications from the Third District are that the local economy 
  continues to expand. Manufacturers report a fourth consecutive month 
  of improvement in the industrial sector, and department store sales 
  have surged ahead so far in June. Retail inventories are at desired 
  levels, with no shortages reported. For the longer term, 
  manufacturers continue to look for gains over the next six months, 
  although such expectations are now less widespread than at any time 
  since January 1975. Retailers foresee continued increases in sales 
  volume throughout the second half of the year. Area bankers report 
  some growth in business borrowing, but say that the underlying "hard" demand for conventional domestic business loans has changed 
  little. The new six-month variable-rate CDs are being met with 
  little enthusiasm by the public. Bankers differ in their views 
  concerning the effect of certificates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers responding to the June Business Outlook Survey 
  indicate continued economic expansion in the industrial sector. This 
  is the fourth consecutive month in which substantial gains have been 
  reported. Respondents indicate higher levels of new orders and 
  shipments, while inventories are down for the second month in a row. 
  At the same time, continuing improvement is noted on the employment 
  front. In the current Survey, 29 percent of the respondents report 
  larger work forces at their factories—the highest this proportion 
  has been in a year—while 17 percent report a longer workweek. 
  Manufacturers report that they are experiencing no tightness in the 
  labor market at this time and no difficulties in obtaining supplies 
  or equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the current strength, however, Third District manufacturers 
  continue to become less bullish. While 46 percent of the respondents 
  to the June Survey look for business conditions to improve in the 
  second half of 1978, 23 percent expect conditions to deteriorate. 
  This "margin of improvement" of 23 percentage points is at its 
  lowest level since January 1975. And, while Survey participants 
  still foresee gains in new orders and shipments, the "margins" in 
  these categories are also at their lowest in the current economic 
  recovery. A Director of this Bank, whose business is in 
  manufacturing, reports that much of the strength he sees in the 
  second quarter is a result of inventory rebuilding. He foresees a 
  slowing in demand as inventories reach desired levels. Nevertheless, 
  local businessmen still project increases in both the size of their 
  payrolls and capital expenditures over the next six months. About 
  one-fourth of the executives polled say they expect to expand their 
  work forces by December, while one-fifth plan to be spending more on 
  plant and equipment by that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Price increases in the industrial sector appear to be slightly less 
  prevalent this month. Of those surveyed, 40 percent say they're 
  paying higher prices for raw materials than they did in May, and 30 
  percent say they're charging more for the goods they sell. For the 
  longer term, 86 percent expect to be paying more for inputs by year-
  end, while 60 percent plan to hike the prices of their finished 
  products by that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Area retailers say business is off to a good start in June, with 
  reports of current dollar sales ranging from 6 to 16 percent ahead 
  of year-ago levels. Sales volume is generally at or slightly above 
  anticipated levels for this period. Merchants expect sales to 
  continue to grow through December with projections of year-end sales 
  5 to 12 percent ahead of December '77 levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail inventories are unanimously declared to be in "good shape," having thinned a little after the unplanned accumulation in the 
  first quarter. Merchants contacted say there is no evidence of 
  chronic or acute shortages in any lines. Retailers expect to 
  maintain current inventory levels throughout the rest of this year, 
  and foresee no change in the inventory-sales ratio.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial bankers in the area say business loan demand is up 
  between 4 and 15 percent from a year ago. However, the gains may be 
  the direct result of efforts to increase volume through 
  unconventional methods (such as fixed-rate term loans and off-shore 
  loans), indicating that the demand for conventional business 
  borrowing is essentially flat. But, because initial projections for 
  this time period were not "overly optimistic," volume is just about 
  as planned. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, bankers 
  anticipate gradual improvement in the demand for conventional C&amp;I 
  loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        The prime rate at all the banks contacted was recently boosted to 8 
  1/2 percent with further hikes projected by year-end. All bankers 
  contacted expect the prime to top out at 9 percent in 1978, but 
  differ in their projections of when it will peak. (One contact sees 
  the peak as early as September 30th, with a slight decline in the 
  fourth quarter.) Rising short-term interest rates have resulted in 
  little or no disintermediation at commercial banks up to this point, 
  although S&amp;Ls have experienced a significant slowing in deposit 
  growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new six-month variable-rate certificates of deposit are 
  currently carrying an interest rate of 7.1 percent. Yield 
  differentials do exist in the area, however, as some banks are 
  compounding interest daily and others are not. Advertising has been 
  light, in some cases nonexistent, and response to the new instrument 
  has been less than overwhelming. One bank with total deposits of 
  more than $600 million has sold only 3 CDs totaling $70,000, $50,000 
  of which was rolled over from a maturing certificate at the same 
  bank. Although most bankers did not have such accurate figures this 
  early, the general feeling is that a large portion of the new 
  certificates will be transfers from other instruments within the 
  same institution. Bankers differ in their views on what the effect 
  of the certificates will be. Responses cover the entire spectrum, 
  running from "a big impact—should sustain the housing market" to 
"no impact on deposit flows at all."
