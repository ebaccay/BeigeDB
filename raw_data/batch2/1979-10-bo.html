      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 10, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Reports from the First District are mixed. A growing number of 
  respondents see signs of weakness but there continue to be areas of 
  strength. Retail sales are disappointing but have recovered somewhat 
  from the very depressed levels of the summer. More and more 
  manufacturers are reporting a deterioration in orders but most have 
  some product lines which are still doing well. In the banking sector 
  loan demand remains strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales seem to have picked up recently but they are still 
  quite weak. In northern New England a resurgence of the tourist 
  industry has boosted sales volumes. One director from an area 
  heavily engaged in tourism thinks that the current strength may 
  completely offset the losses caused by the gasoline shortage. In 
  southern New England, the head of a large department store chain 
  reports a significant improvement in sales during the last couple of 
  weeks; a major promotional effort seems to have been an important 
  contributing factor. This retailer thinks that inventories are too 
  high but a large correction will not be necessary if the present 
  level of activity continues. State sales tax collections are 
  generally lower than expected because of the slow growth in retail 
  sales.
       </p>
       <p>
        The experience of manufacturers in the First District is highly 
  varied. On the positive side, a recent survey of purchasing agents 
  in the region indicates that production, new orders and backlogs all 
  picked up in September. This was at least partly a seasonal 
  phenomenon; but even taking this into account, the responses were 
  still positive. A manufacturer of heavy capital equipment for the 
  chemicals and rubber industries reports record new orders. Orders 
  for non-automotive transportation equipment are also strong, with 
  exports responsible for much of the strength. One company in the 
  instruments industry which had reported a downturn last month has 
  since seen demand pick up; again export sales are a contributing 
  factor. Defense orders are very strong. More negatively, a 
  manufacturer of consumer appliances reports a substantial weakening. 
  Orders for electrical equipment associated with housing construction 
  are down, as are orders for shoe manufacturing equipment, fasteners 
  and instruments associated with investment in the process 
  industries. Some of the manufacturers with declining orders are 
  beginning to lay people off. These same firms also feel that 
  inventories are higher than they would like, although not yet 
  seriously out of line. The chief economist for one of the nation's 
  largest companies, headquartered in New England, reports an easing 
  in the prices of a number of commodities, particularly cobalt, 
  copper and sheet steel. Price premiums are coming down in some 
  cases; discounts are being offered in others.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to banking directors, loan demand is still strong in all 
  categories. Demand deposits are growing quite rapidly at a large 
  bank in southern New England and a small bank in the northern part 
  of the region reports a strong inflow of large CDs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, and Solow were available for 
  comment this month. All three respondents agreed that the moderate 
  third quarter rebound does not signal the end of the recession, 
  although there is disagreement about the appropriate course for 
  monetary policy at the present time. They are puzzled about the 
  recent turmoil in the foreign exchange, gold, and commodity markets, 
  and they offer conflicting advice on how to deal with it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Eckstein believes that the third quarter's growth was 
  achieved at the cost of a more severe downturn in the months ahead. 
  He expects inflation to continue near its current pace for several 
  more months, however, despite the imminent slowdown. In Eckstein' s 
  view, the decline of the dollar on foreign exchange markets is 
  primarily the result of domestic economic performance. He cites the 
  high U.S. core inflation rate as one important contributor to the 
  dollar's weakness. Eckstein is as "uncertain as everyone else" about 
  the "spooky" international situation, although he is concerned that 
  the weakness of the yen is more damaging to American interestsâ€”particularly those of automobile producersâ€”than is the speculation 
  in gold and other commodities. Warning that further funds rate 
  increases will only make the recession worse and lead to 
  overreaction later on, and that the attempt to use monetary policy 
  to support the dollar is doomed to failure, Eckstein would like to 
  see the funds rate held in the 10-11 percent range throughout the 
  slump.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Houthakker believes that the excitement in the foreign 
  exchange markets has been "overdone." In his view a sharp increase 
  in gold sales by the Treasury would be effective in calming 
  international currency and commodity speculation. Houthakker argues 
  that a primary goal of domestic policy must be to reduce 
  inflationary psychology. Accordingly, he is sympathetic with the 
  present stance of monetary policy. Concerned about recent rapid 
  growth in the monetary base, Houthakker thinks that significant 
  further funds rate increases may be necessary. He believes a rate as 
  high as 15 percent would not cause major problems for the economy 
  and may be warranted unless money growth begins to fall fairly soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Solow thinks that the third quarter uptick is due mainly 
  to involuntary inventory accumulation. As a result, he now expects 
  the recession to be longer and deeper than he did formerly, not as 
  bad as in 1973-75, but somewhat worse than the postwar average. 
  Solow is disturbed by the "minor hysteria" over the exchange value 
  of the dollar. He argues that the November 1 package was a good risk 
  given the fundamental factors at the time, but that subsequent 
  eventsâ€”weak productivity and relatively high inflation in this 
  countryâ€”may have lowered the equilibrium value of the dollar. Solow 
  is uncertain whether or not the dollar's current value is 
  appropriate, but he finds foolish the spectacle of the United States 
  trying to attract a capital inflow in order to shore up its balance 
  of payments. Arguing that there currently is little to be said for 
  tighter credit, Solow warns against sacrificing domestic policy 
  goals by succumbing to foreign efforts to improve their exports.
