      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Overview
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from the twelve Districts suggest that on balance 
the economy may have reached its trough but few signs of recovery 
are seen. Only Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City report signs of 
improvement. Other Districts report either flat or deteriorating 
conditions. Retail sales improved in May but were mixed in June, and 
retailers remain very cautious. Manufacturing activity remains 
depressed with new production cutbacks seeming to outweigh the few 
production increases. Additional, although slower, inventory 
liquidation seems likely. Construction, mining, and agriculture 
remain weak. There are some signs that inflation continues to abate. 
Consumer and real estate lending is weak, while business loan demand
is mixed. Bankers are concerned about delinquencies and loan 
quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales improved in May but were mixed in June 
and retailers are cautious about the second half. The May 
improvement reported by most Districts was mostly in non-durable 
goods. Sales of household durable goods generally are weak, except 
in San Francisco. Several Districts report sales gains were achieved 
only because of strong promotions and large markdowns. Discount 
stores are doing better than full-price stores. San Francisco, St. 
Louis and Minneapolis report improvement in car and/or light truck 
sales, but Dallas reports car sales fell after GM's low interest 
rate promotion ended. Some Districts report continued improvement in 
early June while others report retail sales falling back from their 
May levels. Retailers are at best cautiously optimistic about sales 
for the second half. They are reported to be conservative about 
ordering goods and keeping a tight rein on inventories. While some 
look for sales to increase in response to the tax cut and social 
security increase, others expect consumers to emphasize saving and 
paying down debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Mining
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity generally remains 
depressed, with new production cutbacks seeming to outweigh the few 
production gains. Most Districts report either declining or flat 
orders, shipments and backlogs. Some increases in motor vehicle 
production are reported, but production of steel and machinery is 
depressed. Dallas reports firms selling to the petroleum industry 
are making particularly large cutbacks. Paper production is still 
being cut but lumber production has stabilized at a depressed level. 
San Francisco reports cutbacks in commercial aircraft and electronic 
equipment production more than offset gains in aerospace defense 
equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reductions in mining activity are widespread. Minneapolis reports 
sharp curtailment of iron and copper output, a modest reduction in 
coal production, and oil and gas drilling activity at less than half 
the year-ago level. Dallas reports oil drilling rates are low, but 
increased slightly at the beginning of June. San Francisco reports 
copper and silver mine production at 50 percent of capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Inventories
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Many firms have reduced their inventories to desired 
levels, but there are widespread reports of continued liquidation, 
and few reports of plans to build inventories. Most Districts report 
retail inventories are at desired levels but some suggest 
inventories are still on the high side. Retailers are reported to be 
extremely cautious about building inventories. Cleveland reports 
that liquidation of inventories of consumer goods and some 
industrial products "has probably run its course" but further 
liquidation of inventories is likely in primary metals and capital 
goods. Other Districts generally report significant proportions of 
manufacturers still planning further reduction of inventories. 
Richmond reports nearly one-third of manufacturers still view 
inventories as excessive, and Boston reports many manufacturers plan 
to reduce inventories over the next three to six months. Dallas 
reports many firms have excess inventories, particularly those 
selling to the petroleum industry. Philadelphia reports the pace of 
inventory liquidation is tapering off from May's peak rate of 
reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most Districts that commented on residential 
construction report very low levels of activity with no indications 
of improvement. Two exceptions are Dallas, where starts are "up 
strongly from April," and San Francisco, where homebuilding "appears 
to be picking up," albeit from a post-World War II low.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook for commercial construction is weakening. New York and 
Chicago report postponements of new projects and Dallas reports a 
decline in the number of new project announcements. Softening in 
office rental markets is reported by New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and 
San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The situation in agriculture is generally gloomy. Grain 
prices are depressed while input prices continue to rise. Low farm 
income, high interest rates, and falling land prices make financing 
difficult. Financial strains are reported by Atlanta, St. Louis, 
Dallas, and San Francisco. Several Districts report spring planting 
delayed by wet weather. A bright spot for farmers is livestock 
prices, reported up by St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, 
and San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Inflation
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There are some signs that inflation continues to abate. 
Prices in department stores are reported to be sharply discounted in 
most Districts. San Francisco reports food supermarket price wars. 
Commercial property rental markets are soft in some Districts. 
Chicago reports construction project bids "10 to 20 percent below 
estimates," and sharp price discounts in building materials and 
paper prices. Prices for basic metals and grains also are weak. 
Manufacturers in the Richmond District report declines in prices 
paid and received in the past month. Chicago reports "unilateral 
cuts" in salaries of nonunion employees and negotiations with unions 
to adjust compensation and work rules. Philadelphia reports 
industrial prices stabilized in May and June. However, prices of 
livestock and crude oil are rising.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Conditions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer loan demand is generally weak and 
business loan demand is mixed. Bankers are concerned about 
delinquencies and loan quality. Little, if any, growth is reported 
in bank consumer lending. Loans to finance purchases of automobiles 
are reported to be constrained by usury laws. No strength is 
reported in real estate lending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business loan demand is reported strong in some Districts and weak 
in others. Where strong, it is variously described as distress 
borrowing and as a substitute for tapping the bond market, but there 
is little indication of borrowing for plant expansion. Several 
Districts report bankers are concerned with the quality of existing 
loans and are very cautious about the quality of new credits. 
Delinquencies have risen, and San Francisco reports concern about 
the "level of nonperforming business loans, particularly to the 
construction, forest products and aerospace industries."
