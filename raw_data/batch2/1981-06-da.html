      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The expansion of the Eleventh District economy continues at a 
moderate pace. Mining, equipment manufacturing, and commercial 
construction are spearheading the District's growth. Some 
manufacturing firms have laid off employees, but overall employment 
is up. The growth in department store sales is down slightly from 
pre-Easter levels, and auto sales are weak. Housing starts are 
declining. Total loans and deposits at commercial banks show little 
growth. S&amp;Ls report lower deposit outflows, but they are making few 
loans. Heavy rains have reduced some crop yields in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total employment in Texas has increased steadily throughout the year 
and is up 6 percent from year-ago levels, despite layoffs in 
electronics, commercial aircraft, and residential construction. The 
unemployment rate increased 1.1 percentage points from April to 5.3 
percent, comparable to the May 1980 level. Much of the growth in 
manufacturing employment is associated with the increase in 
production of oil field equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing output is rising. Makers of oil field equipment report 
increasing sales and are operating at full capacity. Delivery 
schedules continue to lengthen—especially for high-technology 
items. Respondents expect current conditions to continue at least 
through 1982. The high level of steel production is stable, and 
sales in the apparel and furniture industries are increasing. Weak 
sales in consumer electronics have led to layoffs by a few large 
electronics manufacturers. Texas Instruments reduced the work force 
in its consumer products division by 2,800 in May. Most 
manufacturers reported a moderation in the increase of materials 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of drilling rigs operating in the District is at a record 
high. Additions to the fleet of rigs in Texas have exceeded a rate 
of one per day since the end of April. Shortages of well casings, 
drill pipe, and experienced drilling crews persist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction in the District remains active due to the number of 
large office projects under construction. Residential construction 
is falling, and the pace of highway, municipal, and utility 
construction is unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total loans and deposits at commercial banks show little increase 
since April, but business loans and large certificates of deposit at 
large District banks are significantly higher. Mining is the fastest 
growing C&amp;I loan category. Bankers report a rise in the number of 
small firms on their "concern" list. The volume of the consumer 
loans dropped sharply after the Texas usury ceiling rose to 24 
percent. Consumer loan rates are currently 18 to 19 percent. The 
decline in demand deposits is offsetting the growth in time deposits 
(NOW accounts and large CDs). Large certificates of deposit are the 
major source of funds at commercial banks at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      S&amp;Ls report their deposits outflows slowed in early June, and they 
are maintaining their restrictive lending policies. The decline in 
outflows is attributed to the narrowing in the difference between 
yields of money market funds and money market CDs and a savings 
buildup following tax refunds. The number of NOW accounts are 
described as increasing steadily. S&amp;Ls are investing in money market 
instruments and in commercial projects. Liquidity levels are down 
from the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The growth of department store sales in nominal dollars has slowed 
since April, and the level of sales is 11 percent over a year ago. 
Strong sales were reported in the week before Father's Day, and 
retailers expect sales to increase through the fall and Christmas 
seasons. Apparel continues to sell well, and furniture sales are 
recovering from their low levels earlier in the year. Inventories 
are slightly over plan, but are not a source of concern. Price 
discounts are greater than originally planned, but promotional 
activity is otherwise normal for this season. Retailers have not 
altered their credit card policies following the change in the state 
usury ceiling, but they anticipate changes within a year. The 
proportion of sales purchased on credit is stable and below last 
year's percentage in the months before the credit constraint program 
was put into effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales are up slightly from April but remain below 
seasonal levels. Dealers attribute some of the current weakness to 
advanced purchases made during the rebate programs and a rise in new 
car loan rates to 18 to 19 percent. Traffic is described as good at 
dealerships, and sales are expected to improve. Domestic models are 
selling slightly better than imports. Used cars are selling 
extremely well even though loan rates on used cars are about 21 
percent. Dealers are building inventory for sales through fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heavy rains have reduced wheat yields by as much as 10 percent 
across much of the District. However, total wheat output will still 
be relatively large because more acres were devoted to wheat this 
year. The increase in soil moisture has improved the outlook for 
most spring-planted crops. Southern New Mexico is the only major 
area of the District that remains abnormally dry. The added moisture 
has not improved the financial condition of farmers and ranchers, 
however. The ability of many to repay their loans remains a source 
of concern.
