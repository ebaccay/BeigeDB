      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Fourth District continues to expand 
moderately, except for recent flattening in retail sales. Retailers 
have experienced some slowing in sales, including new cars, although 
producers are still optimistic about prospects. Capital goods 
producers expect spending in 1977 will rise at least in line with 
the latest Department of Commerce survey on capital spending. The 
recent surge in steel output, supported by a high level of auto 
production and inventory buildup, is expected to end shortly. 
Economists who met at this Bank on June 3 expect the rate of growth 
in real GNP to slow to an annual rate of about 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 
percent from 1977-III to 1978-II. Bank and savings and loan 
officials see little evidence on speculation in housing, but savings 
and loan associations have been expanding the use of second 
mortgages as a source of consumer financing.
      <p>
       Retailers indicated a mixed pattern of consumer spending over the 
  past several weeks. Some department store officials are concerned 
  about near-term sales prospects. One reported sales in May were a 
  bit better than in April although still below expectations in real 
  terms. In his view, consumers are still paying for high fuel bills 
  and buying new cars; therefore, sales promotions might be necessary 
  to stimulate department store-type goods and to hold inventories to 
  desired levels. Another executive fears consumers will retrench 
  because of the rapid buildup in debt in recent months. An official 
  with a producer of nondurable housewares, including wall coverings 
  and window shades, indicated a flattening in sales in recent weeks. 
  Others are still relatively optimistic about sales prospects. A loan 
  officer with a major bank commented that increasing demand for loans 
  to finance autos, boats and recreational vehicles suggests greater 
  consumer confidence in economic prospects than indicated in the 
  latest consumer surveys. While somewhat off from the pace of March 
  and April, new car sales in recent weeks remained strong, according 
  to several new car dealers. One dealer stated that consumer interest 
  in large cars stems from the belief that buyers get the most for 
  their money from large cars. An economist with a major auto producer 
  expects an average annual rate of new car sales in the second half 
  of 1977 of about 11 million units, compared with an average annual 
  rate of about 11 1/2 million units during the first half of this 
  year. He does not regard the runup in consumer debt as a major 
  concern and believes that consumers are unlikely to step up their 
  rate of personal savings much above 6 percent of disposable income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital goods producers generally expect that the increase in 
  capital spending this year will at least match the 12 percent 
  increase indicated in the latest Department of Commerce survey. An 
  economist with a major capital goods producer expects a 14 percent 
  increase in capital spending this year and 15 percent in 1978 (about 
  8 percent in real terms each year). A producer of transmissions, 
  axles, and other equipment for trucks expects a 12 percent increase 
  in capital spending this year and continued strength in heavy-duty 
  truck sales, although they are likely to slow by mid-1978. Small 
  gains in capital spending are expected in a few industries. An 
  economist with an oil refinery in the District expects refinery
  capacity in the U.S. will expand by 500,000 barrels this year but 
  only 200,000 barrels next year, because of uncertainty over the 
  Administration's energy program. At a meeting of sixteen financial 
  officers from Cincinnati-based firms held by this Bank on June 10, 
  several officials commented on the difficulty of devising projects 
  that will meet a satisfactory return in investment. Contributing to 
  these difficulties are such factors as changes in environmental and 
  OSHA regulations, inflation and other shocks in the economy. Some 
  say that the target rate for return investment has been increasing 
  in recent years, while others feel the target may not have increased 
  but that it is more difficult to achieve the same target rate. 
  Several asserted that despite a need to replace some existing 
  inefficient capital stock occasioned by higher costs of energy, new 
  spending projects are hindered because of uncertainty over return on 
  investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economists who met at this Bank on June 3 expect that the expansion 
  will continue at a relatively moderate pace at least into the second 
  quarter of 1978. The median forecast of 29 economists indicates an 
  increase in real GNP at about a 6 percent annual rate for the second 
  and third quarter of 1977, followed by a rate of increase of from 4 
  1/2 to 5 percent (annual rates) from the fourth quarter of 1977 to 
  the second quarter of 1978. The slower pace of growth expected for 
  the first half of next year is attributed largely to a slower 
  buildup in inventories than in 1977 (annual rate of about $16 
  billion for the first half of 1978), and to a reduced level of 
  domestic new car sales (9.0 million annual rate). The group also 
  raised their forecasts of the implicit price deflator to about a 6 
  percent annual rate from the second quarter of 1977 to the second 
  quarter of 1978, compared to the 5.6 percent annual rate expected 
  last February. Consistent with the median forecast, a bank economist 
  expects continuing strength in business loan demand to finance 
  working capital needs, an increase in short-term interest rates of 
  100 to 150 basis points by year-end 1977.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan demand continues to be strongest for residential and consumer 
  credit, but is still mixed for business loans. Banks and thrift 
  institutions have indicated strong mortgage loan demand, especially 
  for single-family dwellings, while apartment construction remains 
  generally weak in the District. Several savings and loan officials 
  expect their liquidity will be reduced by the end of this summer, 
  and some expect to increase borrowings from the Federal Home Loan 
  Bank to support a high level of mortgage commitments. Several large 
  district banks indicate a strengthening in demand for business 
  loans, although some still report an irregular and mild upward 
  trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers and officials with savings and loan associations see little 
  evidence of speculation in housing, that is, purchasing of non-owner 
  occupied housing. Responses generally indicate builders and lenders 
  have stepped up construction in anticipation of continuing rising 
  demand for single-family dwellings. Some attribute lack of 
  speculation in housing in this area to a relative balance between 
  supply and demand for housing, a relatively stable population, and 
  price increases in housing that have recently averaged about 10 
  percent annually, considerably less than in some other parts of the 
  country. One builder, however, pointed out that speculation has 
  increased for land in some non-urban areas where values have been 
  rising rapidly, especially as residents leave locales where schools 
  have been or will be desegregated.
      </p>
      <p>
       There appears to be considerable difference between District banks 
  and savings and loan associations in the use of equity loans and 
  second mortgages. Banks do not seem to be promoting equity loans. 
  Moreover, few banks seek or make second mortgage loans. Those 
  advancing second mortgage loans do so only if the bank holds the 
  first mortgage and if the loan is for home improvements. Some banks 
  prefer to rewrite the first mortgage as an alternative to making a 
  second mortgage loan. Where made, second mortgages are used for 
  swing loans, for periods of 3 to 6 months. On the other hand, 
  savings and loan associations contacted are involved in equity loans 
  and second mortgages, which have been gaining in use in recent 
  years. Savings and loan associations seem to be more aggressive in 
  the use of second mortgages as a source of consumer finance. One 
  official explained equity loans are made when used as a swing loan, 
  but second mortgages have a variety of purposes, ranging from home 
  improvement to financing a college education. Another official feels 
  a second mortgage involves no greater risk than the first; the 
  amount of a second mortgage is restricted to the difference between 
  the original loan less the unpaid balance, and for a home 
  improvement loan to the difference between the original value of the 
  mortgage and the appraised value of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several bankers have suggested that District farmland prices have 
  continued to increase despite lower grain prices and the associated 
  effect upon returns in farming. Cash rents are also reported as 
  rising in line with farmland prices, a matter of concern to rural 
  bankers. Often times landholders have purchased farmland to enlarge 
  their present holdings which were purchased at significantly lower 
  prices. In these situations, the equity stemming from past increases 
  in farmland prices provides the base for enlargement. Other bankers 
  noted some effect on land prices by buyers who are not presently 
  engaged in commercial agriculture.
