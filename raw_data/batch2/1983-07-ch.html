      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Things continue to look up in the Seventh District with prospects 
favorable for a recovery through the year. Even so, operating levels 
in durable goods manufacturing will remain low relative to 
prosperous levels. Summer declines in steel and autos will be 
smaller than usual. Hiring intentions are significantly stronger 
than last year at this time, and claims for unemployment 
compensation are lower. Increases in worker compensation will be 
smaller this year, but price inflation is accelerating slightly. 
Productivity gains have been large this year, but are likely to slow 
down. Retail sales continue to improve, helped by a heat wave since 
mid-June. Demand for capital goods is showing some life, but mainly 
for replacements. Closings of marginal manufacturing plants 
continue. Housing remains vigorous, but rising loan rates cause 
concern. Some new large office buildings have been announced. 
Contracts for highway work have surged. The high value of the dollar 
has sharply curtailed exports of some producer goods. Farm crops are 
coming along after a slow start, but are still behind normal 
development. Farm prices are weaker than had been expected, partly 
because of reduced export demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Foreign Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The high value of the dollar is the principal cause of a "drying up" 
of some export markets. Exports of construction equipment and heavy 
trucks are 80 percent below the levels of two years ago. There is 
concern that foreign producers will capture these markets 
permanently. The high dollar also encourages imports of capital 
goods such as machine tools, medium trucks, and aircraft components. 
Reduced airline traffic to the U.S. and smaller foreign tourist 
business also reflect current exchange rates as well as restrictions 
on conversion of Latin American currencies to dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys show that companies planning to increase hirings now 
outnumber those planning reductions, reversing the pattern of a year 
ago. Most of the change reflects fewer planned reductions. No new 
major layoffs are foreseen. However, most of the companies that cut 
staff drastically in the past two years do not plan to reverse these 
policies. Middle management has been most affected by cutbacks. Job 
opportunities remain very limited except for well-trained 
specialists such as data processors. The weak job market continues 
to hold down increases in compensation. Many companies are 
continuing freezes for exempt workers. Unions face tough bargaining 
in upcoming negotiations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices are strengthening somewhat, overall, but no significant 
upsurge is expected this year. Cost structures have benefitted from 
excellent productivity gains, but this trend will slow as activity 
rises further. Most firms strongly desire to widen profit margins, 
which are far below the level of the late 1970s.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The uptrend in residential construction continues. Fixed rate home 
mortgages, on average, have increased from about 12.5 percent to 13 
percent. This rise may have stimulated demand from borrowers who  
fear further increases. (Lenders continue to experiment, with 
varying success, with innovative adjustable rate mortgages, which 
still lack general acceptance.) A further increase in rates to 14 to 
15 percent could seriously dampen the market. Meanwhile, demand for 
building materials is excellent, with most gypsum board plants 
operating at full capacity. Gypsum board is on allocation in some 
areas, but this is not restricting construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Work on new factory buildings is at a very low level, and no 
improvement is foreseen. The office building sector is still 
declining, but some large new downtown projects in Chicago are being 
unveiled for an early start. The market is overbuilt, but developers 
believe that space will be needed in three or four years when these 
projects are completed. Moreover, some developers wish to take 
advantage of the temporary willingness of "hungry" contractors to 
enter bids that may seem cheap later on. There is a large volume of 
rehab work, often handled at wages below union scale. Bridge and 
road work will be up sharply in the second half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for equipment produced in the District is picking up, but not 
as rapidly as the national aggregates on orders and output indicate. 
Producers of steel plates and castings report some rise in demand 
from equipment producers. Mainly this is for replacement needs, 
either parts or whole machines. Few industries have large new 
facilities underway or in the planning stages. Sales of truck 
trailers are booming because of new regulations. Orders for heavy 
trucks have improved enough to raise output schedules from very 
depressed levels. Freight car orders also are up slightly from near 
zero. Business communications equipment, which held up during the 
recession, remains strong. Machine tool orders remain very weak, but 
press orders have increased slightly. Heavy construction equipment 
remains very depressed with large stocks in the field, including 
those of leasing companies. Farm equipment inventories represent a 
whole year's sales, and new layoffs have been announced. Foreign 
demand for U.S. equipment is very low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Liquidation of inventories continued into the second quarter for 
many companies, but in large part this was involuntary as sales 
exceeded expectations. Rebuilding is apparently underway now, and 
will contribute to second half strength. Inventories of most cars, 
trucks (including heavy trucks), recreational vehicles, steel, 
nonferrous metals, capital goods components, and building materials 
are quite low. Oil products are in good balance. Retail stocks of 
finished farm tractors and heavy construction equipment are far in 
excess of current needs. General merchandise inventories at retail 
are lean, but additional supplies are readily available.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of autos (especially large models) and light trucks 
(especially compacts) are running well above last year. Orders for 
heavy trucks, many of which are custom built, have increased. 
(Because of downsizing of the heavy truck industry, there is concern 
that a surge in demand would strain capacity.) In contrast to last 
year when car output schedules were reduced several times, they have 
been increased successively this year. Third quarter output is now 
expected to be the highest for the period since 1978. The 
improvement in autos has reverberations throughout the region for 
companies making seals, locks, electric components, frames etc.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise chains have been reporting improvement in sales 
for several months, both hard and soft goods, with the Midwest 
lagging the nation. The uptrend had continued in the face of an 
abnormally cold spring. A heat wave after mid-June brought a spurt 
in sales of air conditioners, dehumidifiers, light apparel, and 
recreational goods, which had been slow. Other lines benefited from 
this increased "traffic."
