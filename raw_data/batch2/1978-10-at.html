      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 11, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        An acceleration of activity has created further pressures on prices 
  and supplies. The possibility of wage and price controls has 
  undoubtedly begun to influence pricing decisions in some industries. 
  Although businessmen expect inflation to accelerate next year, their 
  cautious control of inventories has kept stockpiling to a minimum. 
  The "inflation psychology" is thought to have contributed 
  significantly to the latest strength in consumer spending, capital 
  investment, and housing markets. Financial institutions are uneasy 
  with the rising cost of money and automatic transfers on the 
  horizon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business leaders in several major District cities have noted a 
  variety of problems with short input supplies and slow deliveries. 
  The latest list of shortages includes parts for aerospace and 
  communications equipment, light-weight trucks, castings, aluminum 
  alloys, and paper for telephone directories. Deliveries are reported 
  to be "very bad" for auto parts and many building materials. Lead 
  times are longer for office equipment, tools, and some steel goods 
  and finished textile goods. On the other hand, there seems to have 
  been some improvement in deliveries of wood, aluminum, aluminum 
  containers, and insulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        A poll of business leaders revealed that businessmen take the 
  possibility of wage and price controls much more seriously than they 
  did four months earlier. Quite a few suspected their suppliers, 
  particularly manufacturers of building materials and steel makers, 
  of raising prices in anticipation of controls. The fear of controls 
  has been openly acknowledged in one industry whose product prices 
  have been escalating rapidly—food processing. Food processors have 
  been raising list prices and discounting; food retailers, who 
  reportedly consider the threat of controls less ominous, have raised 
  prices in line with the increase in list, blocking the pass through 
  of lower wholesale food costs. One contact remarked that next year's 
  large union wage settlements would certainly bring on controls if 
  something else doesn't before then; another thought that the mere 
  mention of controls in the papers touches off a wave of price 
  increases. Still, there remains a number of businessmen who feel 
  that rising costs, not the fear of price controls, are the primary 
  reasons for recent price increases.
       </p>
       <p>
        The consensus 1979 inflation forecast of these business leaders was "we'll be lucky if it's not double-digit." Many offered predictions 
  of increases in prices in their own industries—steel to rise 9 to 10 
  percent, shipping industry costs to gain 11 percent, costs in the 
  soft drink industry to advance 8-1/2-11 percent, and the teamsters 
  to get a 33- to 37-percent compensation hike.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the face of such inflationary prospects, there is little evidence 
  of businesses stockpiling to beat price increases. Inventory 
  policies remain conservative. The inflation's psychology's impact 
  can be seen in investment decisions and consumer behavior, however. 
  Equipment suppliers find buyers moving up purchases; builders see 
  projects coming off the drawing boards after long delays. Whether 
  for this reason or others, the past month brought a rash of 
  announcements of large building projects, both commercial and 
  industrial, that will add substantially to an already sizable volume 
  of nonresidential construction under way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumer spending growth picked up in August and in September after 
  the early summer slowdown. A remarkable number of contacts in a wide 
  variety of consumer-oriented businesses noted that the higher-priced, higher-quality goods and services have been selling best. 
  Automobile sales have been reasonably good, although late arrivals 
  of 1979 models and thin carry-overs of 1978's restrained sales of 
  new domestics in many areas. Red Book contacts characterize the 
  younger consumer as motivated almost entirely by expectations of 
  higher prices, ready to buy everything now that he can afford or 
  meet the payments on, and having little use for savings.
       </p>
       <p>
        High prices and expensive money have yet had little effect on 
  housing markets in the rapid growth areas, but the end of the boom 
  is in sight. Forecasts of a slowdown in 1979 are nearly universal, 
  and some call for a sharper downturn than was anticipated earlier in 
  the year. Sales and starts have already tapered off in many slower-growing areas, where unsold inventories are rising and builders and 
  lenders have virtually ceased speculative ventures. There is some 
  evidence that mortgage lenders have become more selective.
       </p>
       <p>
        As business loan growth has slowed, banks have experienced 
  exceptionally strong credit demands from consumers for both 
  mortgages and consumer installment loans. Auto loans of 42 and 48 
  months are common; one director reported that banks in his area are 
  now offering 60-month loans. The financial community appears to be 
  troubled by three recent developments. The new CDs have been of 
  considerable help in maintaining deposits, but with T-bill rates 
  approaching state usury ceilings on mortgage rates, many thrifts 
  fear being priced out of the mortgage markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Tennessee, where the usury ceiling is most difficult to skirt and 
  applies to corporate loans as well, bankers are debating how much 
  longer they can afford to pay the maximum rate on six-month 
  certificates. Some say they won't hesitate to stop offering them if 
  rates rise further; others feel they must hold onto these accounts 
  and hope for a decline in rates because of stiff competition for 
  deposits. Apparently, some banks have already suffered losses of 
  funds because they were unwilling to pay the going rates. With the 
  advent of automatic transfers at hand, bankers are struggling to 
  develop satisfactory pricing schemes. Many view the service as 
  tantamount to interest-bearing checking accounts and expect earnings 
  declines like those that New England banks experienced with NOW 
  accounts. There is some feeling that offering the service is "practically mandatory." A further concern is the uncertainty 
  surrounding the regulations that will implement the Community 
  Reinvestment Act.
