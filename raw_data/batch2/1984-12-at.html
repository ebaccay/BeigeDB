      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Strengths continue to outweigh weaknesses in the southeastern 
economy. With the exception of certain import-sensitive industries, 
the manufacturing sector continue to expand, and optimism remains 
strong. Retailers expect healthy holiday sale without excessive 
pressures on profits. The large volume of commercial construction is 
helping to offset the slower pace of residential building, and 
contacts believe that underlying conditions portend a revival in 
housing next year. Bank loan demand remains on the upswing, and 
thrift mortgage commitments are above the seasonal norm. Business 
and convention travel is sustaining growth in lodgings and air 
transportation, although vacation travel has slowed somewhat. The 
agriculture sector, particularly cotton and soybean growers, also 
experienced some late-season setbacks as the result of heavy 
rainfall and flooding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment rates changed marginally in September. However, more 
recent labor market data for three of the six District states 
suggest that the region's overall rate rose slightly in October. 
Industrial activity also is mixed. Fewer housing starts and rising 
Imports of Canadian lumber are swelling forest product supplies and 
depressing prices. One-third of the lumber now sold in Alabama 
reportedly is Canadian. Clothing and textile producers continue to 
face stiff foreign competition that has resulted in layoffs and 
plant closings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although previously idled workers in Louisiana's petrochemical 
industry are being recalled, the industry remains weak. However, 
respondents anticipate chemical production to grow from current 
depressed levels if interest rates stabilize or fall further over 
the next quarter since demand for the state's chemical products 
stems largely from the credit-sensitive auto and construction 
industries. Drilling activity in south Louisiana continues its 
gradual upward trend. Over 39 percent of rigs are now working 
compared to 68 percent a year ago. The region's many paper mills are 
operating near capacity. Industry spokesmen fear that packaging-
related orders may slow as the economy cools, but they foresee 
ongoing strong demand for computer paper and other forms. Defense 
and space programs are providing additional stimulus. A satellite 
assembly facility and a cruise missile plant recently began 
operating In Florida. A major Mississippi defense contractor expects 
to add 1,500 workers to its payrolls by spring as naval shipbuilding 
and refurbishing contracts reach the assembly stage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Southeastern retailers report varied sales gains ranging from 2 to 
10 percent for October and November. Mild fall temperatures slowed 
consumer spending and contributed to the accumulation of unwanted 
inventories in a few areas. However, generally steady retail sales 
and increased advertising and sales promotions helped keep 
inventories at desired levels elsewhere. Electronic items and toys 
were best sellers in the October-November period. Sales of winter 
apparel items, especially outerwear, also spurted in November with 
the onset of cooler weather. Retailers report that prices for 
Thanksgiving weekend were at "regular discount levels." Although 
some retailers have lowered their expectations for consumer 
spending, most expect good Christmas season sales without the need 
for extreme price discounts to move inventory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shortages of certain popular models and strike-related sales 
declines slowed car sales activity in October and the first two 
weeks of November, but regional auto sales remain sharply ahead of 
1983 on a year-to-date basis. Southeastern dealers expect new car 
sales to continue strong through the first half of 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many builders and real estate agents polled believe that declining 
interest rates, stable home prices, and increasing personal income 
augur a rebound in housing in 1985 from the current moderated level 
of residential construction. Commercial real estate construction 
continues at a record pace in most major southeastern cities, but 
vacancy rates are generally high. Miami's vacancy rate edged down to 
13 percent, though. Shopping center construction has increased in 
Birmingham and Miami with the entry of major retailing chains into 
those markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan activity remained strong in October. Consumer and business 
lending accelerated from the growth rate of previous mouths. The 
pace of real estate lending at banks slackened in October, but 
mortgage commitments at savings and loan institutions currently are 
above the level expected for this time of year, according to thrift 
officers surveyed. They report that the higher qualifying standards 
for customer income recently enacted by mortgage insurance companies 
has not noticeably dampened consumer demand for mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism
Vacation tourism slowed somewhat in October, but business and 
convention travel remains strong. Attendance at many southeastern 
attractions decreased relative to year-earlier levels. For the first 
time since the beginning of the year, Florida welcome centers 
registered fewer visitors. However, hotels and motels increased 
revenues in October due to increased occupancy and steady room rates 
in most markets. Miami's convention bookings were 20 percent ahead 
of year-ago levels. Most regional airports, which, like hotels, 
serve primarily business and convention travelers, had higher 
passenger volume than in October 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Late season weather has changed crop prospects. As a result of 
extensive rainfall and flooding, Mississippi's estimated cotton 
yield declined 115 pounds per acre, occasioning a 17 percent revenue 
loss from earlier projections. Rains and floods also proved damaging 
to the soybean crop in Louisiana and Mississippi. Production 
declines in those states, added to earlier drought-induced losses in 
Georgia, may reduce revenue to southeastern soybean farmers by 9 
percent, or $139 million, from 1983's relatively low level.
