      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 21, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Fifth District business activity generally picked up in January 
  judging from our latest survey. Such measures of activity as new 
  orders, backlogs of orders, and employment improved among 
  manufacturers surveyed. Only shipments, apparently held down by 
  adverse weather conditions, showed no gain. Retailers also noted 
  improved conditions as reflected by rising total sales and relative 
  sales of big ticket items. Nonetheless, manufacturing respondents 
  are less optimistic than they were a month ago. At least part of 
  this change in attitudes is possibly due to apparently imminent 
  curtailments of power consumption dictated by dwindling coal stocks. 
  Despite the recent implementation of emergency measures in some 
  areas, however, actual effects of the coal situation so far have 
  been minimal. In the financial sector, mortgage demand continues to 
  be strong on a seasonally adjusted basis. To date, supplies of 
  mortgage funds have been adequate. In some areas terms of lending 
  are tightening in response to slower deposit growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conditions among Fifth District manufacturers firmed over the past 
  month with one-third of our respondents reporting an increased 
  volume of new orders and rising order backlogs. Despite the fact 
  that inventories, of both finished goods and materials, expanded 
  over the month, there was no increase in the number of respondents 
  reporting excessive inventories. Employment among manufacturing 
  respondents also rose slightly but hours worked per week remained 
  stable. Prices, meanwhile, continued to increase generally, although 
  several manufacturers report declines in prices received.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among retailers responding to our survey, both total sales and the 
  relative sales of big ticket items improved over the past month. 
  Retail inventories apparently declined slightly and are now 
  essentially in line with desired levels. One respondent, however, 
  views current stocks as lower than desired. Prices and wages were 
  generally higher than a month ago according to the retailers 
  surveyed. Most Fifth District directors now anticipate that 1978 
  automobile sales in their areas will be somewhat weaker than in 
  1977.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the expectations of our respondents regarding future 
  business activity remain basically optimistic, manufacturers' 
  expectations seem to have weakened somewhat over the past month. 
  Fewer than one-third expect the general level of business activity, 
  nationally, locally, and in their respective firms to improve over 
  the next six months. On the other hand, more than one in six now 
  foresees some deterioration of conditions over that time period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other than the direct employment impact upon workers in a few 
  industries, e.g., miners and railroad workers, and some secondary 
  impact in such areas as local retail sales and state government 
  revenues in coal mining areas, the coal strike has had little effect 
  on the District economy to date. Dwindling coal stocks, however, 
  have led to some minor power curtailments by electric utilities 
  serving West Virginia and parts of Maryland and Virginia. If these 
  utilities are forced to rely on their current coal stocks and are 
  unable to tap outside sources of electrical power, major 
  curtailments are possible within the next ten days to two weeks. The 
  utility regulatory body in West Virginia has already initiated an 
  emergency plan which will institute gradual service curtailments as 
  needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Comments of our directors and industry sources suggest some 
  tightening in mortgage markets, at least in some areas of the 
  District. A slowing of deposit inflows at lending institutions 
  coupled with a seasonally vigorous demand for mortgage loans has 
  created a general impression that a continued tightening of market 
  conditions will be increasingly reflected in lending terms over the 
  next several months. To date, however, adjustments have been 
  scattered and apparently concentrated principally in the larger 
  cities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The volume of credit extended by large Fifth District banks has been 
  unchanged since the beginning of the year. Consumer loans, other 
  than mortgages, have increased only modestly while business loans 
  have been essentially flat. At the same time inflows of deposits 
  appear to have been slow. There has been no gain in savings 
  deposits, and the growth of large negotiable CD's has leveled off.
       </p>
       <p>
        Replies to our fourth quarter farm credit survey revealed that last 
  year's drought-reduced crop output and the tightening cost-price 
  squeeze combined to create cash-flow problems for many Fifth 
  District farmers. Bankers as a result have experienced much slower 
  loan repayment rates and a sharp increase in requests for renewals 
  and extensions. Farmers' demand for credit from traditional lenders 
  continues fairly strong even though many farmers have been able to 
  qualify for Federal drought disaster loans. Bank supplies of 
  loanable funds seem to be adequate for the demand, but they are 
  apparently at the lowest level since this survey began more than two 
  years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        District farmers may cut 1978 cotton acreage 26 percent from last 
  year but are likely to offset this reduction partially by increasing 
  soybean plantings 9 percent. Planned feed grain acreage is down 5 
  percent as was the acreage seeded to food grains (wheat and rye) 
  last fall. These intended plantings are as of January 1 and may 
  change considerably by planting time.
