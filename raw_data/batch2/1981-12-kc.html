      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 16, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District continues to be 
relatively weak. Although retail sales have been soft, retailers 
generally report satisfactory inventory levels. Residential 
construction and sales are weak in most areas. Improvement in 
mortgage demand and mortgage commitments at savings and loans 
institutions depends on hoped-for greater inflows of savings and 
lower mortgage rates after the first of the year. The new winter 
wheat crop is off to a good start, but cattle prices remain 
unfavorable to producers. Loan demand at Tenth District banks 
remains mixed, as does deposit growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers in the Tenth District report sales for 
the first 11 months of 1981 about 10 percent higher than last year. 
But sales in October and November of 1981 were less strong, due to 
weakness in sales of winter clothing, furniture, and appliances. 
Sales of Christmas merchandise throughout the District also have 
been less than most retailers anticipated. In spite of relatively 
weak sales, most retailers express cautious satisfaction with their 
inventories, in part due to optimism about sales during the rest of 
December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industry Costs and Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most purchasing agents contacted in 
the Tenth District report input prices have increased from 6-12 
percent over the past year. No further price increases are expected 
this year, but many expect increases of up to 10 percent in early 
1982. Although fuel costs have been relatively stable, total 
aviation industry costs rose 12-20 percent over the past year, with 
further increases expected. Input availability is generally not a 
problem for Tenth District manufacturers. Half the companies 
contacted report inventory levels well above desired levels due to 
declining sales and are planning to trim their inventories as much 
as possible in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Construction and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Tenth District homebuilders 
associations indicate that housing starts have decreased 25-50 
percent over the past year, with single-family units leading the 
decline. Albuquerque seems to be hardest hit, with a decline in 
housing starts of approximately 80 percent. Denver, on the other 
hand, continues to have a strong market, with declines of less than 
5 percent and single-family starts 6 percent above a year ago. Apart 
from Denver, house sales are sluggish but inventory levels are near 
normal. Building materials availability is expected to become a 
problem in the coming months, particularly for lumber, due to lumber 
mill shutdowns in some parts of the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      At savings and loan institutions in the Tenth District, savings 
inflows in 1981 were down considerably from last year. Most savings 
and loans hope for some slight improvement in inflows in the near 
future, primarily due to hoped-for inflows from the new IRAs that 
the institutions plan to offer after January 1, 1982. The demand for 
mortgage funds at Tenth District savings and loans is reported as 
low-to-nonexistent, resulting in abnormally low levels of mortgage 
commitments. Most of the weakness in mortgage demand is attributed 
to high mortgage rates, which are currently averaging 17 percent at 
Tenth District savings and loans. Those rates are expected to fall 
slightly by the end of the first quarter of 1982, resulting in some 
slight improvement in mortgage demand and mortgage commitments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The winter wheat crop in the Tenth District is 
currently in good condition, with approximately the same acreage 
planted as last year. Despite the unfavorable cattle price 
situation, lower feed costs and lower prices for calves entering 
feedlots point toward somewhat more profitable fed cattle production 
by the spring of 1982. Some livestock producers are holding calves 
because of currently unfavorable prices, and grazing them on 
abundant wheat pasture. Other cow-calf producers have sold off 
breeding stock to generate cash to repay loans, but are also holding 
calves over the winter. At the same time, District bankers report 
that many feedlots in their area are currently at full capacity. The 
recent declines in interest rates may not significantly improve 
customers' creditworthiness for new loans, since bankers feel that 
continued low commodity prices have offset the relief brought by 
lower interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at Tenth District banks is 
following the mixed pattern of recent months. Commercial and 
industrial lending is very strong in those areas serving the energy 
industry. Consumer lending remains sluggish across the District, and 
real estate loans are nonexistent. Prime rates range from 15 3/4 to 
16 1/4 percent, down from 16 3/4 to 18 percent last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit growth continues to be strong in areas with sizable loan 
demand but is relatively flat elsewhere. Most of the growth has 
occurred in the large CD category. While some banks continue to rely 
on CD's to finance new lending, other institutions are using CD's to 
reduce their exposure in the overnight market. Across the District, 
bankers report more than adequate liquidity.
     </p>
     <p>
      After an initial spurt, consumer interest in All-Savers Certificates 
has tapered off and most institutions contacted anticipate little 
activity in the future. Attention has now turned to IRA/Keogh 
programs. Most bankers surveyed are extremely optimistic about these 
accounts becoming a stable source of long-term funds. However, there 
are considerable differences of opinion about the volume and sources 
of funds that might be attracted to these accounts.
