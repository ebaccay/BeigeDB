      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The pace of economic activity will apparently quicken this quarter. 
Most inventory corrections in steel, chemicals, and major appliances 
are apparently completed, although some adjustment may continue into 
this quarter. Recovery in capital goods remains mixed. Natural gas 
supplies have tightened but have not caused plant shutdowns. Prices 
remain under upward pressures. Many deposit-type institutions in 
Cleveland have cut their rates on passbook savings accounts. Thrift 
institutions in several major metropolitan centers of the District 
have tightened terms on savings certificates.
        <p>
         Rising activity characterizes several key industries in the 
  District, including steel, machine tools, rubber, communications 
  equipment, printing equipment, and heavy-duty trucks. Last month's 
  increase in orders for steel reversed a downtrend that began in the 
  second half of 1976. Machine tool orders, according to an economist 
  associated with a producer, were the highest for any fourth quarter 
  on record although, in real terms, orders were still only 75 percent 
  of their peak in 1973. A producer of communications equipment and 
  printing equipment reports its order rate in the last two months was 
  nearly double its sales in 1975.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bulk of the inventory correction in the same key industries was 
  completed last quarter, but manufacturers and retailers are likely 
  to reduce their stocks again this quarter. The sharp rise in steel 
  orders last month is attributed partly to near completion of 
  inventory liquidation of steel products. Order and shipments are 
  forecast to trend upward throughout 1977, according to steel 
  economists. Manufacturers' stocks of major appliances are still high 
  despite recent cutbacks in production, according to an economist 
  with a major appliance producer. His estimates indicate that the 
  worst of the inventory adjustment is over and that production will 
  begin to rise in line with sales. Shipments in 1977 are expected to 
  rise 7 percent from last year. Production of plastic resins rose 
  again last month as a result of a virtual end of inventory 
  correction, but a financial officer with a large chemical producer 
  expects some of its lines to remain sluggish until later this 
  quarter.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some retailers still have excess stocks. Retailers described sales 
  during the Christmas season as ranging from good to better than 
  expected but not boomy. Several commented that markdowns spurted 
  sales in the two weeks before Christmas and helped bring stocks more 
  in line with planned levels. A large discount chain reported that 
  sales were excellent, but stocks were still somewhat higher than 
  normal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Curtailed production of small cars and spottiness in capital goods 
  continue to hamper production and employment gains in the District. 
  GMC's Lordstown plant announced another three-week shutdown of small 
  car facilities this month because of poor sales and excess stocks. 
  Manufacturers of construction machinery, heavy equipment used in the 
  utility industry, and mining machinery report business is still 
  soft.
        </p>
        <p>
         Well-below normal temperatures throughout the District since last 
  fall have tightened supplies of distillate fuel and natural gas. 
  Consistent curtailment of supplies of natural gas by one major 
  distributor has so far affected schools and small businesses, and a 
  recent 50 percent curtailment affecting major users will apparently 
  hurt the tomato greenhouse operation in the Cleveland area. A large 
  distillate fuel producer reports that supplies from December 1976 
  through March 1977 will be adequate unless temperatures average more 
  than 15 percentage points below normal for that period. An officer 
  with another major natural gas distributor stated that industrial 
  firms it serves have not been affected by short supplies. He 
  indicates that reserves will be insufficient if well below normal 
  temperatures persist. He noted that natural gas consumption in 1977 
  is not expected to exceed 1976 because higher prices have cut 
  consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upward price pressures remain strong. Preliminary results of this 
  Bank's latest monthly survey of manufacturers show that the 
  proportion of respondents who expect price increases is as high in 
  January as it had been for the past two months. The recent price 
  increases for flat-rolled steel products are apparently sticking, 
  and several producers of welded tubing steel products announced a 6 
  percent price hike for those products effective January 15. A steel 
  economist expects a price rise on tinplate and tin mill products in 
  February. Iron ore prices are also scheduled to be increased next 
  month, according to a major ore producer in the District. Natural 
  gas prices will probably increase 20 cents a cubic foot this year 
  and another 20 cents in 1978, according to an officer associated 
  with a major gas distributor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lower savings deposit rates by some banks and savings and loan 
  associations reported in last month's Redbook have spread through 
  several major metropolitan centers of the District. The most 
  competitive area has been Cleveland, where a major bank triggered 
  the changes by reducing rates paid on deposits by businesses. That 
  Bank has since reduced rates on home improvement loans, used car 
  loans, and boat loans. Presently, passbook rates paid by major 
  Cleveland banks have been cut to 4 1/2 percent. Some large savings 
  and loan associations in Cleveland reduced the rate on passbook 
  savings to 5 percent, but a few are paying 5 1/4 percent. Maturities 
  and yields on savings certificates vary considerably, and some 
  associations stopped offering certificates of less than one or two 
  years in maturity and reduced rates on all certificates. Reductions 
  in rates on passbook savings of about 1/4 percent are also reported 
  in Columbus, Akron, and Canton. In Pittsburgh, neither banks nor 
  savings and loan associations have decreased rates on passbook 
  accounts, but the associations have lowered rates on certificates, 
  and a few are no longer offering higher yield certificates. A major 
  bank in Pittsburgh plans to retain maximum rates on certificates but 
  will lengthen maturities.
