      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from this District indicate moderation of economic growth. 
Employment is growing slowly and pressures to avoid price increases 
are intense. Retail sales gains are moderating. Manufacturers report 
either smaller order increases or declines in orders. Inventories 
are near desired levels. Housing activity continues to fall, but 
banks report business and consumer lending remains strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the District improved in September. 
Employment increased and unemployment declined in Ohio, reducing the 
unemployment rate to 9.22 (s.a.), 2.3 percentage points below its 
year-earlier level. Manufacturing employment continues to rise 
slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Firms report substantial competitive pressure on prices. A survey of 
manufacturing firms in the region reveals fewer firms are raising 
prices and more are cutting prices than three months ago, while most 
are holding prices steady. Those firms also report a substantial 
slowing of increases in prices paid for commodities and services. 
Capital goods producers anticipate using productivity gains 
primarily to moderate increases of prices charged rather than to 
widen profit margins, despite their view that profit margins are 
very narrow for this stage of an economic expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandisers in this District report double-digit sales 
gains from year-earlier levels for September. The increases, 
however, were concentrated in the first part of the month. Gains 
dropped back to a single-digit pace by month-end and remained there 
through early October. Retailers expect this more moderate pace to 
continue through yearend, with one analyst anticipating a 7% - 8 
1/2% gain for the year as a whole. Cutbacks in orders have kept 
inventories at acceptable levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area auto dealers report an easing in early-October sales. Low 
inventory rather than a lack of demand continues to be cited as the 
major cause of slower sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Firms in this District generally report new orders continue to rise 
but at a reduced pace, although several capital goods producers 
report order declines. Weakness in capital goods orders is generally 
attributed to inventory adjustment, growth of imports, and slowing 
of business fixed investment to a more normal pace for this stage of 
the business cycle. One capital goods producer, noting the strength 
of new appropriations for capital spending, expects orders to 
rebound soon, and capital spending to decline in late 1985 at the 
earliest. Firms experiencing declines in orders expect to use order 
backlogs to avoid reducing output, but only for a few months. A
producer of truck parts notes that there was a decline in orders for 
large trucks in the third quarter because orders had been bunched 
into the first half to avoid tax increases effective July 1. He 
expects truck orders to rebound in the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel producers report soaring imports and customer inventory 
liquidation have caused a reduction of orders and production. 
Together with excess capacity, this weakness in demand has kept 
transaction prices well below published prices. A major producer 
estimates it will be late in the first quarter of 1985 before 
customer inventory targets are reached.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tire producer reports orders from original equipment manufacturers 
continue very strong but orders for replacement tires have softened 
in the last two months. Despite their having operated at capacity 
for any months, domestic tire producers generally plan no increases 
in production capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inventories generally appear to be near desired levels. Most 
manufacturers report inventories of materials and finished goods are 
being kept level, while roughly equal numbers of firms report 
inventory increases and decreases. Excessive inventories are 
reported in the steel industry, especially at steel service centers, 
and in the farm machinery industry. Inventories of truck and 
automobile tires are very low for this stage of the business cycle 
but manufacturers, distributors, and retailers seem satisfied with 
current inventory levels. General merchandisers report inventory 
levels are satisfactory, and automobile dealers complain that 
inventories are too low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After an unusual one-time surge in August funded by proceeds of 
State of Ohio mortgage revenue bonds, housing activity in September 
resumed its downward trend of recent months. Despite signs of 
further weakening during the fourth quarter, market participants are 
expecting better-than-normal sales and profits for this stage of an 
economic expansion. Nevertheless, builders and realtors are 
undertaking significant steps, including reducing building on 
speculation and lowering employment through attrition, to weather 
the slowdown that they forecast will continue through mid-1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lenders report considerably fewer applications in the third 
quarter than in the second, with applications in September ranging 
from 20 to 40 percent below expected levels. Lenders indicate that 
high mortgage rates have softened demand considerably, and a recent 
slight drop in mortgage rates had no effect on borrowing. Unlike in 
any other parts of the country, mortgage borrowers in this area seem 
to be particularly cautious about adjustable rate mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan outstandings in all major categories increased at Fourth 
District banks during September. Business lending increased 
significantly, after being relatively flat in July and August. 
Consumer loan demand continues to be strong although the pace of 
lending has tapered off somewhat. Bankers expect business and 
consumer loan demand to remain quite good in the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence suggests that district banks used borrowed funds to 
accommodate much of the recent loan growth. Although savings 
deposits increased, banks experienced a greater decline in 
transaction deposits.
