      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 5, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Responses to our latest Survey of Fifth District Business Conditions 
  suggest only minor changes in the level of activity over the past 
  month. Manufacturers, as a group, apparently experienced very slight 
  declines in the volume of new orders and order backlogs. In 
  addition, inventories were up despite an increase in shipments. 
  Responses concerning employment and weekly hours worked suggest some 
  gains in production are continuing to occur. Increases in prices 
  paid have become even more widespread in recent weeks although 
  employee compensation and prices received do not seem to have 
  followed suit, at least according to this month's survey. The 
  outlook of our respondents has also deteriorated since the last 
  survey. Indications are that aggregate credit demand in the region 
  has softened somewhat since May, but also that there have been no 
  dramatic shifts in the pattern of loan demand for major types of 
  loans. The current truck strike is having an unfavorable impact on 
  the farm income situation. State agriculture officials, especially 
  in the Carolinas, indicate that the strike is resulting in 
  tremendous financial losses for producers of vegetable crops and 
  peaches.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers reporting a reduced volume of new orders slightly 
  outnumbered those reporting gains in orders over the past month. 
  Much the same was true of responses concerning changes in backlogs 
  of orders. Nearly two-thirds of all respondents nevertheless 
  continued to experience either unchanged or higher levels of both 
  orders and backlogs. Inventories of materials and finished goods 
  also appear to have risen on balance, but only about one respondent 
  in four views current stocks as excessive. Shipments were apparently 
  up somewhat among those manufacturers surveyed although gains were 
  less widespread than in our previous survey period. There has also 
  been some increase in the incidence of reports that current plant 
  and equipment may be excessive, but such responses continue to 
  represent a relatively small proportion of total responses. There 
  remains virtually no sentiment among respondents for altering 
  current expansion plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Approximately one-third of the manufacturing respondents report 
  increased levels of employment over the month and there was also 
  some small increase in the average workweek among responding firms. 
  Although nearly three-fourths of our respondents report paying 
  higher prices last month, the number experiencing gains in employee 
  compensation and prices received actually declined. Expectations of 
  manufacturers have become decidedly more negative in recent weeks. 
  Three-fourths of those surveyed expect the level of business 
  activity nationally to worsen over the remainder of the year and 
  over half expect some worsening in their respective market areas. 
  Only about one-fourth, however, expect conditions for their own 
  firms to decline over the next six months.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the retail sector there does not seem to be any clearly 
  discernible pattern. In some areas sales have weakened while in 
  others they are holding up surprisingly well. One of our directors 
  reports firm sales activity up until just the last few days, and 
  further feels that this very recent weakening is more consistent 
  with his expectations than the earlier performance. One respondent 
  in the building materials line also reports sales continuing to hold 
  steady. Survey responses also suggest some running down of 
  inventories by retailers, which seems to be consistent with their 
  doubts about whether sales can continue at recent levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        The demand for commercial and industrial loans appears to have 
  tapered after showing unusual strength earlier this year. In 
  particular, term loans for capital expansion have shown weakness. At 
  the same time, short-term loan demand has increased about with the 
  rate of inflation. Inventory financing has hardly increased at all 
  if measured in terms of physical volume of goods, and reports 
  suggest that the buildup of stocks for the Christmas season will be 
  delayed as retailers hold back to gauge the strength of their 
  markets. Loan demand from construction related businesses has led 
  other sectors due largely to the surge in materials prices. Consumer 
  installment loan outstandings continue to increase while the number 
  of loans made is holding fairly steady. Consumer revolving credit 
  activity, however, continues strong. Several banks have stated that 
  they feel the peak in consumer loan demand has been reached. 
  Mortgage loan demand is strong in most areas, but activity is being 
  limited by a scarcity of funds at savings and loan associations. The 
  volume of new funds received in money market certificate accounts at 
  the thrift institutions has dropped considerably, while losses 
  continue in other categories of time deposits. Liquidity positions 
  are comfortable at most large commercial banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        District cash farm income was one-third above a year ago during the 
  period January to April, but the current truck strike is having an 
  unfavorable impact at the present time. Because of the lack of 
  trucks, thousands of bushels of perishable vegetables have been left 
  to rot at shipping points. Other crops. ready to be harvested, have 
  been plowed up. Virginia reports indicate that operations of meat 
  packaging plants, dependent on out-of-state shipments, have been 
  significantly affected. And both meat packing plants and some 
  poultry processing plants have been severely affected in moving 
  their products from plant to market. In addition, official reports 
  suggest tighter diesel fuel and gasoline supplies for farm work in 
  some District states. Farm work in some areas is being delayed by 
  late deliveries of fuel or the inability to obtain fuel when needed.
