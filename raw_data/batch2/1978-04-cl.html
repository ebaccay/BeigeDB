      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Businessmen and economists anticipate that the expansion will 
  continue through 1978, despite the slow start in the first quarter. 
  Retailers, however, are skeptical that first-quarter sales losses 
  will be recouped. Industrial production should further rise this 
  month as a result of a sharp comeback in coal production and a 
  continuing pickup in steel and machine tools. Housing starts should 
  recover sharply this quarter, but savings and loan associations are 
  limiting mortgage commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Financial officers and economists have not altered expectations for 
  the economy in 1978, although their forecasts on inflation have been 
  revised upward. There is some doubt, however, that a pickup in 
  output and spending this quarter will fully recoup earlier losses. 
  Moreover, several express concern that the overall rate of inflation 
  will increase to about a 7 percent annual rate by the fourth quarter 
  as higher coal prices, utility rates and recent steel price 
  increases are passed on to final users. A few Directors emphasized 
  that the accelerated rate of inflation is a dominant topic to their 
  customers and should be considered a deterrent to business 
  confidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some retailers of general merchandise report substantial improvement 
  in sales in March from February, but others indicate little 
  improvement, because their pickup in sales occurred in February. 
  Generally, none anticipate more than a seasonal gain this quarter. 
  Spring merchandise has not been selling as well as expected, and 
  apparel sales have slumped since last December. Inventories, 
  especially of apparel, are judged as higher than desired and are 
  being watched carefully. An economist with a major department store 
  chain was disappointed that the increase in March sales was no 
  larger than it was in view of Easter and sales promotions. The 8.8 
  million annual rate of new car sales last quarter was consistent 
  with the expectations of several Fourth District economists 
  associated with the auto industry. But sales fell about 5 percent 
  short of the projections of an economist with a major auto producer 
  who pointed out producers cannot easily make major downward 
  adjustments in production schedules this late into a model year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coal production is increasing rapidly since the strike settlement. 
  Output in the second full workweek following the settlement rose to 
  nearly the record pace of last October. The industry expects to 
  operate at capacity—16 million tons weekly—on a sustained basis. A 
  Director cautions shipments from mines are a problem because of the 
  poor condition of some highways in Appalachia and inadequacy of rail 
  facilities that can also be a deterrent to new mine capacity. 
  According to an economist with a major coal producer, the first year 
  of the coal contract will result in a 10.2 percent increase in the 
  price of utility and industrial coal, a 7.3 percent increase in the 
  price of steam coal, and a 4.6 percent increase in metallurgical 
  coal prices. Increases of about half as large are expected in the 
  second year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel operations continue to strengthen despite earlier expectations 
  of a drop in orders following the coal settlement and price 
  increases in February and March. March shipments were unusually 
  strong, partially in response to weather-induced delays earlier this 
  year. One steel economist expects production this quarter will rise 
  to about 90 percent of effective capacity, compared with nearly 80 
  percent last quarter. Substitution of domestic for foreign steel 
  because of the trigger price system is apparently providing this 
  unexpected strength. Steel service centers which have purchased at 
  least a third of their requirements abroad have sharply increased 
  orders from domestic producers in recent weeks. Economists have been 
  skeptical that this price system would curtail steel imports, but 
  some now feel that imports after April will begin to drop sharply 
  from recent peak volumes.
        <p>
         <p>
          Officials and economists have not changed their forecasts that the 
  increase in real capital spending this year will at best equal last 
  year's increase. One official described his company's position for 
  1978 as still cautious. He attributed this to ample capacity, 
  memories of high debt and low liquidity during the last recession, 
  Government safety regulations and his company's phasing out a 25 
  million dollar investment for a new automotive product.
         </p>
         <p>
          Recovery in medium trucks used especially by small businesses is 
  still well below peaks reached in 1973, and inventories are judged 
  to be ample because sales have fallen short of expectations. Machine 
  tool builders, however, have become more optimistic following a peak 
  in new orders last quarter and further gains are expected this 
  quarter. One builder said backlogs for some highly technical lines 
  have expanded to 85 weeks compared with 50-60 weeks a few months 
  ago. They are operating near 90 percent of capacity.
         </p>
         <p>
          Housing starts are expected to recover sharply from weather-
  depressed activity earlier this year. Last quarter's losses should 
  be recouped this quarter. Some S&amp;Ls claim demand for loans is even 
  stronger than last summer because some banks appear to be less 
  interested in mortgage lending than they have been. Mortgage rates 
  have risen 1/4 to 1/2 point since March. To attract funds, a few 
  S&amp;Ls; have instituted continuous compounding of interest on all 
  deposits. Several report that they do not plan to limit mortgage 
  lending in coming months, despite slowed growth in deposit flows, 
  which, for some institutions, strengthened in late March and early 
  April. Liquidity at some associations has fallen to reserve 
  requirement limits. In view of tightening cash flows, a few are no 
  longer writing loans for new customers or for multiple dwellings and 
  are not lending to marginal builders. Some S&amp;Ls; also have eliminated 
  95 percent loans.
