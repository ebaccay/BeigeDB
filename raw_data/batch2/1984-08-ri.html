      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 6, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On balance, activity in the Fifth District is continuing to expand, 
rapidly in some areas and sectors. Nonetheless, there are also 
emerging signs of moderation in some industries as pipelines fill up 
and import competition remains strong. Drawing strength from 
construction, trade, and seasonal services, total employment is 
reaching record levels in parts of the District. Residential and 
commercial construction continue robust, although there is evidence 
of slower speculative building of residential units, and the major 
gains in total residential activity appear to be past. Coal 
production is running very strong in the District. Ports activity is 
setting records as a result of import volumes. Tourist activity is a 
mixed bag as some areas are having disappointing peak seasons. The 
quarterly survey of agricultural credit conditions revealed that the 
financial health of District farmers has improved somewhat of late.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, the manufacturing sector is continuing to make healthy 
gains in employment and output, but there is significant disparity 
within the sector. The strength is almost entirely in durable goods 
and building materials, and largely in the capital and industrial 
goods portions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even within the nondurables, however, there is significant variety. 
The paper industry has been operating at near capacity for some 
time, so gains have been restricted. The textile and apparel 
industry, on the other hand, may be giving ground as inventory 
building appears to have run its course and import competition 
continues to intensify. There are also scattered reports of some 
slack developing in the furniture industry. If accurate, these 
reports probably reflect slower inventory accumulation rather than 
weakening final sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity continues generally buoyant around the 
District. Commercial and industrial construction is showing strength 
at nearly every stage along the pipeline, and the projects now in 
progress should sustain the industry for a good while. Residential 
construction is also holding on to recent gains in most areas. There 
are reports, however, that house sales have slowed in recent weeks 
and that speculative building has dipped as builders have grown more 
cautious. The overall impression of the residential sector is, 
nonetheless, one of vigor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all available information points to further gains in consumer 
spending activity in recent weeks. Sales are rising nearly across 
the board, from apparel and general merchandise lines to furniture, 
appliances, and automobiles. Gains in consumer installment credit 
outstanding are still quite substantial.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the appearance of great confidence and enthusiasm on the 
part of consumers, some areas which rely heavily on tourism have 
found summer business disappointing thus far. Such disappointment is 
by no means uniform across the District, however. In fact, analysis 
of the experience of various areas suggests that perhaps tourists 
and vacationers are venturing farther from home, at the expense of 
the areas favored during recent periods of recession and concern 
over gasoline prices and supplies. Tourist-related businesses in the 
more remote areas seem much more pleased with their experience this 
season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Good weather conditions throughout the Fifth District have brought 
optimism to farmers and agribusiness establishments this summer. 
Barring a collapse of farm commodity price levels as harvest time 
approaches this fall, farm cash receipt levels should rebound 
sharply from the drought affected levels of last year. Problems do 
remain in the agricultural sector, however, with uncertainty 
surrounding the future of tobacco farmers, weakness in some 
livestock prices, and higher interest rates dampening the optimism 
arising from the summer's abundant rainfall.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of Fifth District bankers has indicated that financial 
stress, as measured by foreclosures and/or liquidations of farm 
assets are well within "normal" levels, indicating that strength is 
returning to the agricultural economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With consumer and business lending both expanding at recent rates, 
and with deposit inflows having slowed somewhat, liquidity positions 
of District financial institutions have been reduced significantly. 
Still, there is no indication that institutions in general, or even 
a significant number of individual institutions are under any 
liquidity pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Outlook and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For the most part, businessmen and consumers around the District 
remain quite optimistic. They express concern over such things as 
the government deficit, the trade deficit, and the LDC debt problem, 
but have not let it affect their behavior.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some businesses are facing what they perceive to be more pressing 
problems. Foreign competition is among them. Such industries as 
textiles and apparel and furniture are facing very weak markets for 
their exports and very strong foreign competition in domestic 
markets. They are concerned that if costs were to rise, margins 
would deteriorate since price increases would be nearly impossible. 
Costs are already reported to be putting significant pressure on 
margins of producers of a wide range of industrial products and 
goods, but price increases are apparently not tenable in the current 
market environment. Thus, while the outlook is for relatively stable 
prices, producers are very concerned about profits.
