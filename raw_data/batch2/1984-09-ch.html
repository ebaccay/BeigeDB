      <strong>
       September 16, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions in the Seventh District appear less robust than 
earlier in the year. Payroll employment, adjusted for seasonal 
trends, has been about level since the first quarter. Steel output 
declined in August contraseasonally. Farm income remains depressed 
and farm equipment producers have scheduled extended plant 
shutdowns. Demand for mechanical equipment, generally, has failed to 
show expected gains. Retail sales improved in late August, but 
merchants report intense price competition. Housing activity has 
softened, but is holding up better than some realtors had expected 
in view of high financing costs. Auto sales continue to be limited 
by availability of preferred models. Lack of progress in the auto 
industry's labor negotiations casts a heavy shadow over District
centers specializing in production of motor vehicles and parts. 
Inroads of imports in markets for am ever-broadening spectrum of 
consumer and producer goods present a serious threat to the 
viability of many producers of goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Payroll employment in the five District states has increased only 
half as fast as in the nation since late 1982. Compared to June 
1979, employment in the five-state area was down 8 percent in 
contrast to a 5 percent rise for the nation. Moreover, while the 
national total continued to rise through August, District 
employment, seasonally adjusted, has been about even since February. 
Iowa employment showed a slight decline in the recent period and has 
been below the level of late 1982. Despite strength in the auto 
industry, employment in Michigan has been stable since February, 
both in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. Estimated unemployment 
as a percent of labor force in the five-state area, while still 
above the national average, has declined more than the national rate 
since late 1982, implying withdrawals from the labor force. Iowa's 
statisticians estimate its unemployment rate well below the national 
average in the face of its poor economic performance. These 
comparisons cast doubt on the use of unemployment rates as measures 
of economic well-being for states and localities. Recent weeks have 
brought new layoffs of hourly workers in steel, farm equipment, 
autos, and construction components, and white-collar staff cuts in 
manufacturing, financial services, and health care.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Operating rates in the District's steel industry were lower in 
August than in July and trended downward through the month. This 
development had not been anticipated last June. Since steel 
consumption is believed to have held up, the decline in domestic 
steel production is attributed to increased imports coupled with 
reductions in user inventories. A larger proportion of steel going 
to fabricators has been coning from steel service centers, rather 
than direct from the mills, partly because of hand-to-mouth 
inventory policies under which smaller quantities are ordered at one 
time. A large share of foreign steel comes through service centers, 
many of which are owned by foreign steel producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Farm Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Through much of the first half of the year, District producers of 
tractors, combines end other farm equipment clung to the belief that 
the year would see modest increases in sales to farmers, perhaps 10 
percent. However, sales have been disappointing all year and, in 
July, were far below last year's dismal pace. As a result, extended 
shutdowns of major plants have been announced, plants that had been 
operating below 50 percent of capacity in some cases. In addition, 
further substantial cuts in white-collar staff are planned, 
apparently of a permanent nature. Reasons for poor sales of farm 
equipment include depressed farm income, increased imports, and a 
large supply of good used equipment, often disposed of at auctions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Machine Tools
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Biennial International Machine Tool Show opened in Chicago on 
September 5 for a nine-day stay. A thousand exhibitors and 100,000 
visitors are expected, about the same as in recent years. The 
upcoming show may have been responsible for some of the slowing in 
orders for metal-cutting machine tools in June and July. Sales are 
higher this year, but well below the levels of the late 1970s. 
Moreover, a sharp uptrend in imports since then has increased the 
share of market accounted for by imports from 20 percent to near 50 
percent in 1984--over 50 percent for metal- cutting types. Some U.S. 
producers are incorporating foreign components in their machines or 
are offering complete foreign machines under domestic name plates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods—General
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for mechanical capital goods produced in the District, while 
varying greatly by type, remains soft overall. Heavy construction 
equipment is almost as weak as farm equipment. Sales of heavy-duty 
trucks leveled off in late spring after a rapid rise. Bookings of 
trailers, many of them tandems counted as two units, are still in 
excess of capacity. Freight car deliveries in 1984 are now estimated 
at 12,000, double last year's total, but only a fraction of the 
90,000 shipped in both 1979 and 1980. Auto companies, recording 
record profits, have sharply increased appropriations to buy 
presses, machine tools, robots, and other items intended to update 
facilities and reduce labor requirements. New plans by electric 
utilities are at the lowest level in many years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Auto Labor Talks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      At this writing, chances of a settlement of the auto industry labor 
negotiation before the September 14 contract expiration date appear 
dim. On September 6, with only 8 days to go, the UAW named General 
Motors as its "target" for concentrated discussions. Many large 
issues must be resolved: wages, COLA, holidays, pensions, medical 
benefits, mandatory overtime, outsourcing, job training and 
retraining, and, perhaps most difficult, "job security" (guaranteed 
employment). Reported profits of the big auto companies have been 
huge, but analysts warn that funds are vitally needed for investment 
in new facilities. Modern plants abroad have much lower labor costs. 
Cars, small trucks and components from Japan are the main current 
concerns, but major components also are coming from Mexico and other 
nations in which U.S. firms have subsidiaries. Korea, with labor 
costs well below those of Japan, is a potentially serious 
competitor. The choice of GM as the target has significant 
ramifications. With 350,000 union workers, a strike at GM would 
exhaust the UAW's record strike fund three times as fast as a strike 
at Ford with115,000. GM, with very low inventories of finished cars, 
assembled 57 percent of the autos and 42 percent of the trucks 
produced in the U.S. in the first months of 1984. Moreover, GM 
produces a larger share of its components than Ford or Chrysler. A 
long strike at GM would be reflected noticeably in total industrial 
production and GNP. A 67-day strike against the company occurred in 
1970.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of apparel and back-to-school merchandise picked up in late 
August, helped by warm weather. Consumers have continued to purchase 
major appliances at a record pace. Unlike autos, sales of appliances 
have not been limited by availability. Retailers complain of intense 
price discounting, especially from competitors trying to reduce 
excessive stocks. After improving last year and early in 1984, sales 
of recreational vehicles softened in the summer. General merchandise 
prices average no higher than last year currently, a surprising 
development to most analysts who had expected some increase. Credit 
use (especially through bank cards) has been heavy, but delinquency 
experience has been quite favorable.
