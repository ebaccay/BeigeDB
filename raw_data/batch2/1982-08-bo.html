      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither retailers nor manufacturers in the First District see any 
evidence of an upturn. Respondents from the retail sector report 
that July sales were good but not markedly so; they attribute this 
strength to heavy promotional activities rather than the start of a 
consumer-led recovery. Manufacturers were unanimous in reporting no 
signs of a pickup. For some, orders and backlogs continue to fall. 
Most firms are aggressively cutting inventories and payrolls. Costs 
previously regarded as fixed have been cut. Although layoffs are 
widespread, some firms are using four-day work weeks and periodic 
shutdowns to reduce wage costs while still avoiding permanent staff 
reductions. Because of these cost cutting efforts, cash flow 
positions are relatively strong. However, in both retailing and 
manufacturing, the firms participating in the Redbook survey are 
probably among the stronger members of their industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the First District report that they continue to meet or 
exceed sales plans because of extra promotional activities, but they 
see no evidence of the predicted July upturn. Plans for the next six 
months show increasing strength, but buying and ordering are 
proceeding with greater than normal caution. Several firms with 
stores or affiliated merchants in other regions said operations in 
New England compared very favorably to results elsewhere. However, 
while the Redbook respondents are weathering the recession, 
newspapers have reported some store closings in the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Department store sales were weak in June because of unseasonably 
cold and rainy weather; as the weather improved in July, customers 
bought the summer merchandise planned for June, more than making up 
June's lost sales. However, several merchants mentioned that July 
sales were heavily promoted, so that sales were maintained at the 
expense of profits. None attributed July's strength to the tax cut 
or a consumer-led turnaround. Executives at several department 
stores reported that they are buying cautiously for the Christmas 
season; they are planning on good sales but staying in a position to 
cut expenses if back-to-school buying does not track plans. 
Inventories will be kept smaller and more liquid than usual. One 
contact noted that the second half of this year will look better 
even if current activity levels continue, because last year's second 
half was weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      A building goods specialty house reported retail operations 
continuing at a very healthy pace as a result of strong promotional 
activities: "The customers are there, you just have to work harder 
to get them." Contractor sales of the same firm were off 
considerably from last year. While most firms report keeping 
inventories very lean, exceptions can be found. One pet supplies 
operation has gained a larger market share by increasing its 
inventories so as to have what the consumer wants always in stock.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several retailers said that for purchased merchandise, the number of 
items with price increases is declining and for those with 
increases, the rate of increase is lower than in the past. In weak 
markets, special opportunities from manufacturers appear more 
frequently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses from the manufacturing sector were remarkably consistent. 
There are no signs of an upturn. Representatives of firms 
manufacturing such diverse products as packaging, communications and 
electrical equipment, engine castings, processed steel products and 
springs, precision metal products, printing equipment and supplies, 
furniture, heavy capital equipment and specialized industrial 
machinery-all reported that business is very weak and there are no 
encouraging signs. The precision metal products manufacturer and the 
castings producer reported that orders are 30 percent below the 
level of a year ago. Orders and backlogs for heavy capital 
equipment, springs, and electrical equipment and supplies continue 
to fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most firms, even those which see no further deterioration in orders 
and backlogs, are aggressively cutting costs. Inventories and 
employment are being reduced and capital spending plans are being 
scaled back. Many of the cost cutting measures are likely to be 
permanent. Executive after executive said that the economic downturn 
has caused a much greater emphasis on productivity and efficiency. 
Internal procedures have been changed and costs previously 
considered fixed have been cut. Because of these cuts, many of the 
firms contacted have strong cash flow positions despite low sales 
volumes.
     </p>
     <p>
      While many firms reported sizable layoffs, some are attempting to 
share the reductions among all personnel. One machine tool 
manufacturer with a 25 percent layoff in April plans an additional 
10 to 15 percent layoff for October. However, both castings and 
precision metal products manufacturers said they are cutting hours, 
reducing corporate payrolls, and extending plant shutdowns in order 
to keep production forces intact.
     </p>
     <p>
      No one is making business plans based on a recovery in the near 
term. Several executives, from a variety of industries, see no 
recovery in their businesses until the middle of 1983. A couple of 
respondents noted that, if a robust recovery were to develop, spot 
shortages might occur because of the conservative planning and tight 
inventory management.
     </p>
     <p>
      The one bright spot is defense. The defense business is good and 
getting better. However, competition is becoming more intense, as 
more and more firms are looking to replace lost commercial sales 
with military business. Also, one large prime contractor finds it is 
taking longer than expected to get specifications approved. A 
surprising number of firms in a wide range of industries reported 
having defense business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein and Houthakker were available for comment this 
month. Eckstein sees no evidence of recovery in July so far. What 
little evidence there is shows that the economy, at best, has been 
flat and the risks of further deterioration have mounted." The first 
month of the tax cut failed to ignite a consumer spending spree, the 
tax cut instead may have prevented a slump in retail sales. Because 
of the somewhat modest change in withholding schedules, Eckstein 
also notes that "we shall have to wait until next April before we 
see the full benefit of this July's tax cut." Eckstein believes "the 
Fed should turn more toward ease until we see convincing evidence 
that the economy has turned up." He suggests holding the federal 
funds rate below 10 percent for the time being.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker believes that the economy has begun a very slow recovery 
and that the recent decline in interest rates is not just a fluke. 
"The dollar's exchange rates have risen despite the drop in yields 
because, unlike many of our trading partners, we have made progress 
in reducing inflation. Lower inflation is achieved in three stages: 
First, raw materials prices decline; second, the pace of wage 
increases declines; and third, the increase in prices for industrial 
goods and services declines. The first stage is completed, we have 
achieved about half of stage two, and we have come not very far at 
all into stage three. The completion of all three stages may take 
another year or two. In view of this progress, Houthakker believes 
the Fed should not relax monetary policy. So far he gives the Fed 
"high marks. The present rate of money growth at the high end of the 
range (without exceeding the range) is appropriate, and not changing 
the guidelines for 1983 is appropriate as long as money growth moves 
more to the middle of its range."
