      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 31, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The district economy is holding up pretty well under unusually harsh 
  winter conditions, but government economic policy may prove to be 
  tougher to handle than the elements. The weather has had a 
  substantial impact on the agricultural sector, and it isn't all for 
  the worse. Other sectors have been affected less by the weather. 
  Most retailers have seen just a bit more than the normal post-
  holiday sales slowdown. Homebuilders aren't too busy either, but 
  again that's normal for this time of year. In contrast, commercial 
  builders, manufacturers, and bankers remain quite active despite the 
  season. Directors were concerned that wage and price guidelines and 
  Congress's treatment of Carter's budget could be much harder to 
  handle than the bad weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Severe winter weather has had its most pronounced impact on the 
  agricultural sector. Directors report that cattle producers have had 
  particular difficulty dealing with the elements. Range conditions 
  have forced ranchers to deplete their feed supplies at an 
  unexpectedly rapid rate in the Dakotas and Montana. Fortunately, 
  those supplies were at abundant levels last year, and they should be 
  sufficient for the rest of the winter. Nevertheless, some stock loss 
  has been suffered, and ranchers are concerned that continued bad 
  weather might take a large toll during the calving season, which is 
  just now getting underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      Continued bad weather could actually be good for many grain 
  producers, though. Heavy snow has two beneficial effects for 
  farmers. It provides needed cover for the winter wheat crop. And it 
  provides soil moisture, which is essential for good crops throughout 
  the year. The main negative impact of the severe winter for grain 
  farmers is related to the scarcity of rail cars for grain hauling 
  mentioned last month. A couple of bank directors noted that this 
  situation has been exacerbated by recent weather conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The normal post-holiday retail sales slowdown was made only slightly 
  slower by these weather conditions. Directors from Michigan, South 
  Dakota, and Montana mentioned that some shoppers were reluctant to 
  venture into the cold and snow. But other directors from Montana and 
  Minnesota indicated that sales were about at or slightly higher than 
  expected levels for this time of year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like retail sales, district homebuilding activity is typically slow 
  in January relative to the rest of the year. And this January some 
  parts of the district have seen homebuilding come to a near complete 
  halt. But in some other parts of the district, for instance, a few 
  large Minnesota communities, home-builders have been busier than 
  expected. For the district as a whole, then, this month's building 
  lull does not appear exceptionally quiet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial builders, manufacturers, and bankers have seemed nearly 
  immune to the bad weather. Commercial construction activity, 
  especially in Minnesota, is reported to be quite hectic for this 
  time of the year. Manufacturers throughout most of the district are 
  straining to work down large backlogs, and shortages of skilled 
  labor were mentioned by a few directors. Financial institutions 
  continued to face strong loan demand and were actively competing for 
  expensive funds to augment rather slow growth in demand and savings 
  deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several of the bank's directors were more concerned about the impact 
  of government economic policies than they were about the weather. 
  They and other observers around the region remarked on problems with 
  wage/price guidelines. Area businesses are expending a considerable 
  amount of resources trying to understand the implications of the 
  guidelines for their pricing and wage setting behavior. Furthermore, 
  directors commented on the inefficiencies which would arise from 
  strict adherence to guidelines. One director noted that controls on 
  oil and gas prices and less stringent control on exploration and 
  drilling expense was likely to reduce oil and gas output, meaning 
  higher prices for consumers in the end. Another director remarked on 
  the difficulty of holding health care prices within the guidelines
  in the face of the increasingly complex maze of regulations 
  affecting the provision of those services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most directors looked for government austerity as the best way to 
  fight inflation and were concerned that Carter's budget might not be 
  austere enough when Congress finishes with it. Several directors 
  speculated that Congress would substantially increase budgeted 
  nondefense spending. On the other hand, a couple of directors 
  thought the spirit of Proposition 13 might keep Congress's hands off 
  the budget.
