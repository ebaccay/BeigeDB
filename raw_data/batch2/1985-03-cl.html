      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 12, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fourth District is reviving slowly after 
several months of weakness. Employment is rising and unemployment is 
falling. Durable goods are selling well but non-durable goods sales 
are sluggish. Manufacturing activity is weak but no longer 
declining. Housing activity is improving slowly, and business and 
consumer loan demands continue to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ohio employment (s.a.) increased in December and January, while 
unemployment (s.a.) fell in January by more than it had risen in 
December. The unemployment rate (s.a.) fell from 9.1% in December to 
8.4% in January. Surveys of manufacturers indicate little change in 
manufacturing employment (n.s.a.). Unemployment rates (n.s.a.) in 
December in ten metropolitan areas in this District ranged from 6.4% 
in Columbus to 15.1% in Wheeling, a steel-producing center. Local 
indexes of leading indicators of employment for the Pittsburgh and 
Cleveland metropolitan areas have been flat for several months, 
suggesting that employment in those areas is unlikely to grow much 
in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      February retail sales trends in the Fourth District have followed 
the national pattern. Hard goods, especially autos, continue to sell 
well. Car dealers are intentionally carrying higher-than-normal 
inventories in expectation of even stronger sales in the spring. 
Electronics, especially VCR's, are selling well, and competitive new 
imports are keeping prices down. The only weak durable goods are 
nonhigh-tech appliances and furniture. Soft goods, especially 
apparel, fell prey to bad weather and sales improved only marginally 
in the last half of February when Fourth District weather conditions 
improved. Nevertheless, department stores do not plan further price 
cuts to reduce inventories because their margins are already thin. 
Instead, they plan to reduce orders to eliminate excess inventories 
of soft goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys of manufacturers in the Cleveland and Cincinnati areas 
indicate weakness in manufacturing activity. Manufacturers in 
Cleveland and northeast Ohio report their level of production has 
stabilized after falling in January and new orders have stabilized 
after four months of decline. In Cincinnati, production is rising 
slowly, new orders are flat, and order backlogs are declining. 
Inventories of raw materials and components are falling in Cleveland 
and are flat in Cincinnati while inventories of finished goods are 
flat in Cleveland and rising slowly in Cincinnati. Prices paid by 
manufacturers continue to rise very slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of industrial chemicals reports export markets are 
weakening, while growing shares of strong domestic markets are being 
absorbed by imports. Producers of parts for the automobile industry 
report demand is very strong. A large steel producer reports orders 
for flat-rolled sheet products used by the auto industry have surged 
to capacity. Steel prices are below published schedules and imports 
continue to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of manufacturing firms in the midwest indicates they are 
not changing their plans to increase capital spending this year. A 
producer of parts for trucks and autos is planning to invest 
significantly more this year to modernize production facilities and 
to locate production plants closer to customers to meet growing 
demands for just-in-time deliveries. The firm reports that sales of 
smaller trucks are at a record pace but sales growth of heavy-duty 
trucks has slowed and manufacturers are asking suppliers to delay 
delivery of components. A major producer of material used in 
commercial construction reports record demand, and believes that tax 
incentives must be stimulating construction of office buildings 
because vacancy rates continue to rise. The firm has pushed back to 
late-1985 its forecast for a decline in its sales, and expects a 3-
year to 4-year slump in commercial construction, especially office 
buildings, because of excess space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity in Ohio is reviving, hut more slowly than in many 
other areas of the country. Market participants generally expect 
that sales will improve steadily during the first and second 
quarters because of lower mortgage rates, but builders remain 
extremely cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large savings and loan association reports that applications and 
inquiries in February were substantially higher than a year ago. 
Fixed-rate mortgages are regaining popularity among borrowers 
because of the narrowing rate spread between fixed-rate and 
adjustable rate mortgages and tighter underwriting criteria for 
adjustable rate mortgages. A savings and loan association reports 
that its mortgage delinquencies are rising, and higher delinquency 
rates are likely to persist because slow appreciation of home prices 
has eliminated the incentive for some buyers to reschedule payments 
with the mortgagee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most builders in this region had laid plans for strong sales in 1984 
but had a poor year. Builders are assuming that housing starts 
nationally will equal 1.5 million units in 1985. They have reduced 
their geographic market coverage, scaled down production facilities, 
reduced their inventories to maximize profits in a soft market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to have strengthened at District banks in recent 
weeks. Business loans registered the largest gain in outstandings, 
and consumer loan volume continued to grow at a relatively good 
pace. Contacts expect additional pick-up of business loan demand and 
continued strength in consumer loan demand. The market share of auto 
loans held by banks, however, is likely to decline somewhat because 
below-market loan rates are being offered on selected models by 
captive finance companies of some auto manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall deposit growth has been moderate at District banks in the 
past six weeks, Inflows of time and savings deposits have more than 
a offset reductions in demand deposits. District banks also have 
increased their reliance on purchased funds including large 
negotiable certificates of deposit.
