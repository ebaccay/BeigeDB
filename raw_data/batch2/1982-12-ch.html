      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The sorry state of economic conditions in the Seventh 
District reported in earlier Redbooks has not improved. Employment, 
output, and new orders in the manufacturing sector continued to 
decline in November. Normal plant shutdowns over the holidays 
commonly will be extended. The retrenchment in capital goods is 
unprecedented in the postwar era. The industrial base of the 
equipment and automotive industries is contracting as more plants 
are closed. Retail sales continue sluggish, with the Christmas 
season disappointing so far. Residential construction should improve 
significantly in 1983 if interest rates stay down. The heavy 
oversupply of new office space is causing rents to decline. 
Widespread price cutting in wholesale markets frequently means sales 
below cost. No sign of improvement from depressed levels is noted in 
the agricultural sector. Business demand for short-term funds is 
down sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Chronic hard times are taking a toll in reduced 
long-term confidence for both managers and workers. Morale has been 
depressed by abortive improvements in demand, which were assessed, 
erroneously, as heralding solid revival. In the past month, District 
analysts in retailing, paperboard, and cement have noted the 
evaporation of what had appeared to be promising signs. The Chicago 
Purchasing Management Association summarized the views of its 
members on December 7: "The expected recovery has not materialized. 
All key indicators remain strongly negative."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Lower Break-Even Points
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some companies are confident that they can 
maintain profitability at sharply reduced levels of operation. 
Break-even points have been drastically lowered by large, permanent 
cuts in personnel, closing of marginal facilities, sales of 
unprofitable divisions, scaling down operations by purchasing more 
parts and services, elimination of less essential functions, and 
stringent cost control. Such restructuring could bring rapid 
increases in profits if and when revenues rise significantly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise retailers have been unhappy 
with Christmas sales after a promising start in November. Part, but 
not all, of the shortfall is attributed to unseasonably warm weather 
in some weeks, including early December. Virtually all product lines 
are slow. One large chain has increased sales of household durables 
by heavy promotions. The largest airline reports passenger traffic 
up substantially since August, but this reflects bargain fares and 
free bonus flights
     </p>
     .
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment Losses
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Payroll employment in the five Seventh District 
states in the fall was 8 percent below the same period of prosperous 
1976, while employment in the U.S. was one percent higher. 
Manufacturing employment in the District was down 25 percent in this 
comparison. Michigan, of course, has the largest decline. Wisconsin, 
specializing in capital equipment, has the smallest decline in the 
District, but its situation has deteriorated very rapidly in the 
past 12 months. Many manufacturing jobs are gone forever as plants 
have been closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Jobless Funds
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State jobless pay funds have been strained as 
unemployment has remained at high rates for extended periods. The 
Illinois and Michigan funds each have debts of almost $2 billion to 
the federal Treasury. Debts of Iowa and Wisconsin are growing. 
Indiana, despite its severe unemployment problem, has no such debt 
because of legal restrictions. Proposals to raise employer 
contributions to jobless funds are opposed as likely to encourage 
additional migration of industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Negotiations
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Caterpillar strike that began October 1 has 
affected many smaller companies that supply components. Management 
insists that substantial labor contract concessions must be made to 
reduce an estimated 40 percent cost advantage held by foreign 
competitors. The Chrysler dispute apparently is being resolved, with 
the UAW winning its key demand for an immediate wage hike. With the 
year drawing to a close, it appears that, by-and-large, organized 
labor is winning its fight to prevent "take-aways of hard-won 
gains". (The rank-and-file has been more adamant against concessions 
than union leaders.) Unfortunately, the failure to cut unit 
production costs substantially in major hard goods industries 
implies a further erosion of the region's industrial base as 
producers step up efforts to seek foreign sources for components or 
finished goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although most businesses are still attempting to cut 
inventories, holdings remain excessive in lines where sales have 
been even weaker than expected, e.g. apparel, paperboard, and some 
motor vehicles. Nevertheless, inventories will have to rise in some 
sectors, including residential building, if demand increases only 
moderately. A major producer of diesel engines that are mainly used 
in heavy trucks has recalled some workers. Demand for trucks has not 
improved, but engine production had been below usage and inventories 
had been exhausted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prospects for business equipment in the Seventh 
District are even worse than in earlier months. Conditions vary by 
company and line but, overall, no earlier post-war recession was 
nearly so bad. Bookings are off 10 to 65 percent from reduced levels 
of a year ago at various companies. One diversified equipment 
producer is operating at 50 percent of capacity, while another is at 
25 percent. Castings production also is at about 25 percent of 
capacity. Foreign demand, which had been relatively good for some 
products, has ebbed in recent months. Among the worst lines are 
equipment for railroads, trucking, agriculture, construction, 
mining, and metalworking. Capital goods firms have drastically cut 
corporate staff, including those in design and development, to an 
extent that could harm competitive positions in future years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The spurt in auto sales in November, aided by 
favorable credit terms, is not regarded as a clear indication of an 
improvement in demand. Some auto dealers dislike temporary incentive 
programs, because sales almost invariably decline afterwards. 
Instead, they would prefer lower prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel demand remained very depressed in December. Bookings 
are beginning to show up for January, but probably because of the 
desire of customers to have inventories at rock bottom for year-end 
financial statements. Steel companies have learned that customers' 
normal holiday shutdowns will commonly be extended into January, 
perhaps into February.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While residential building is expected to increase 
significantly in the new year, nonresidential construction is almost 
certain to be down. Capital expenditure programs are being canceled 
or stretched out by manufacturers and public utilities. The glut of 
new office space in the Chicago area has caused rents to drop by 11 
percent in the past year. A large office leasing firm has filed for 
bankruptcy because of its liability on blocks of space contracted 
for at rates above the current market level.
