      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 13, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An unsettled pattern dominated the Southeast's midsummer economic 
climate, reflecting current or past aberrations in weather. 
Agricultural production continues to suffer ill effects from the 
drought. Tourist traffic made a late start this year; and retail 
trade presents a mixed picture. Rapid gains in residential 
construction continue, while commercial and industrial building 
activity is accelerating. Certain hard goods producers have 
experienced increased demand. Some manufacturers are attempting to 
insulate themselves from impending energy shortages. Prices for 
Florida citrus fruit and lumber are rising. Savings and loan 
association activity continues to increase.
      <p>
       The drought has taken an increasing toll on District farm revenues, 
  depressing sales in stricken areas, though late June showers gave 
  hope for recovery of some late-planted crops. Projections of this 
  year's crop losses have mounted to several hundred million dollars. 
  The corn crop is nearly a complete failure. In some areas where corn 
  has withered, herbicides applied to aid the corn crop now prevent 
  replanting in soybeans because rainfall has been inadequate to 
  dissipate the chemicals. Extensive damage to hay raises the 
  possibility of a serious shortage this winter. Forced liquidation of 
  cattle continues to depress prices. Peanuts and tobacco are 
  seriously threatened, as are soybeans in some areas. The cotton crop 
  is holding up well; however, rice, sugarcane, and some vegetables 
  appear to be relatively unaffected. One hundred and thirty Georgia 
  counties are receiving Federal disaster assistance; thirty-five of 
  these were already in an emergency state because of worm 
  infestations which plague the cotton and tobacco crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Florida's tourist traffic improved noticeably during June, following 
  a series of below-average months. Sources indicate that the extended 
  school year in northern states caused by severe weather delayed the 
  normal seasonal influx.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to its uniformity during the earlier months of this 
  year, consumption spending now exhibits wide variations in strength. 
  Auto sales remain generally strong, but exceptions have grown more 
  numerous. Some areas report flatness, and some note actual slippage, 
  except for imported models. Used car sales, particularly of large 
  models, are poor in parts of Florida. In a drought-stricken area of 
  Alabama, new car sales are suffering; used car sales are up in 
  number, but profits have fallen. The same spottiness is found in 
  department store and apparel sales. Again, the greatest weakness 
  occurs in hard-hit agricultural areas. Elsewhere, yearly gains range 
  from 6 to 12 percent. Sales of retailers, particularly pleasure boat 
  dealers, in parts of Florida have flattened; this trend may also 
  reflect the late-starting tourist season. Reports on consumer 
  borrowing are mixed in tone. One source reports that collections are 
  slow, while another reports declining repossessions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rapid gains continue in residential construction, according to 
  directors' reports from. many areas of the Southeast. Single-family 
  home building is up 25 to 60 percent from year-ago levels for the 
  first half of this year. The most rapid gains are in the previously 
  depressed Florida market. In Alabama, lots are being sold from plats 
  before roads are built; homes are also being sold before completion. 
  Some sources regard the sales pace as unsustainable; in Tennessee, 
  sales resistance to high home prices is noted. Multifamily 
  residential construction, the core of Florida's oversupply problem, 
  is also reviving. Apartment vacancies have fallen significantly and 
  rents are rising. Absorption of condominiums in South Florida has 
  accelerated. Construction of new condominium units is being started, 
  and some apartment units are being converted successfully to 
  condominiums. But in other areas, there remain condominiums where no 
  units have been sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial and industrial construction activity is also on the rise. 
  In parts of Florida, small building construction is keeping 
  contractors busy and inquiries about future projects are increasing. 
  Commercial and industrial construction activity in rural Tennessee 
  is showing considerable strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some hard goods producers such as manufacturers of castings for the 
  auto and farm implements industries are enjoying strong demand. A 
  large manufacturer of railroad equipment anticipates a sharp 
  increase in business during the second half of the year, barring 
  problems in upcoming labor talks. However, pipe and structural steel 
  fabricators still face slack demand conditions. Pulp and paper 
  industry conditions are stable, despite a continuing surplus of pulp 
  inventories. The severance tax on Florida phosphate producers has 
  been increased from 5 percent to 10 percent of the value of 
  extracted minerals; some firms report losses of sales to foreign 
  competitors. Manufacturers in several parts of Tennessee are bracing 
  for another winter of energy shortages; they anticipate natural gas
  cutoffs as a result of reduced deliveries from producers to local 
  distributors. Stand-by energy systems are being installed; but for 
  some companies, capital costs are a deterrent to such investments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Futures prices of citrus products have risen as buyers, fearing that 
  last winter's freeze damage may reduce next season's crop, attempt 
  to guarantee their supplies. Growers caution that many buyers may 
  hold contracts and take delivery; they feel that the number of 
  contracts outstanding should be watched closely to preserve an 
  orderly market. Citrus juice price increases have not immunized 
  Florida growers from financial losses. Substantially lower juice 
  yields, stemming from the effects of last winter's freeze, have 
  resulted in higher unit costs of harvesting, processing, and 
  transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elsewhere in Florida, reduced demand for ground coffee as a result 
  of high prices has resulted in a layoff of one-quarter of the work 
  force at the nation's second largest coffee plant. Full production 
  is expected to resume in late summer. Lumber prices continue to 
  rise, reflecting the strong pace of construction activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Savings and loan associations' activities continue to expand. During 
  July, a Florida association will open an office contained in a 
  supermarket, the first facility of its kind in that state. Savings 
  inflows and loan demand are generally strong. Two savings and loan 
  associations in Alabama have raised their real estate loan rates to 
  9 percent. Banks in Tennessee have benefited from an increase in the 
  spot price of coal, which has permitted payment of delinquent loans 
  and thereby reduced loan losses.
