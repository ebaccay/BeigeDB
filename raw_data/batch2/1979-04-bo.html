      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors and other respondents in the First District report that 
  the level of economic activity remains very high. The only sign of 
  weakness is a slight softening in retail sales. Manufacturers 
  continue to experience strong orders and capacity utilization is 
  high. Delivery lead times are growing and price increases are 
  becoming larger. In the banking sector, loan demand is strong, but 
  regular time and savings deposits are not growing at all. This 
  situation is causing the smaller banks considerable concern. No one 
  reports any serious problems in the first week of the Teamsters 
  strike; however, several respondents expect to be adversely affected 
  around the middle of the second week.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in the First District may be weakening slightly. The 
  head of a department store chain in the region believes that the 
  momentum has gone out of consumer purchases; it has become harder to 
  sell. A director associated with a large food chain reports that, 
  after several very dynamic months, there has been a marked softening 
  in the past three weeks. On the other hand, directors from northern 
  New England say that sales in their states remain strong. Automobile 
  dealers are doing particularly well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers in New England enjoyed a very strong March. Orders and 
  production were up; capacity utilization is high. The prosperity is 
  widespread: among the areas said to be doing well are automotive 
  products, both commercial and military aircraft engines and parts, 
  machine tools, instruments, graphics and apparel fasteners. Housing 
  products (windows, cabinets and various built in products) are 
  selling very well; however the demand for small appliances is 
  slightly off. All the manufacturers contacted felt that their 
  inventories are at appropriate levels; they are much more concerned 
  about continued increases in delivery lead times and higher prices. 
  Increases in lead times have been particularly marked for electronic 
  components and castings and forgings. Prices have risen especially 
  sharply for brass, plastics, and repairs and services. One large 
  manufacturer expressed the view that price increases by uncontrolled 
  vendors will destroy the voluntary wage-price controls.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the banking sector loan demand is stronger than expected, while 
  regular time and savings deposits are not growing at all. In 
  northern New England this situation is forcing banks to become 
  restrictive in their lending. Smaller banks are worried about the 
  possibility that the denomination of the six-months certificates 
  will be lowered. In contrast to the country banks, a number of the 
  money center banks are reported to be marketing loans very 
  aggressively. This is said to be holding down interest rates; 
  however, the quality of the loans is also somewhat lower than it 
  would otherwise be. These banks are not concerned about the 
  availability of funds; they are willing to buy whatever they need to 
  make loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein and Houthakker were available for comment this 
  month. Eckstein believes that the level of economic activity is very 
  near full capacity. His clients and his reading of current business 
  conditions also suggest that production and sales are still "moving 
  along smartly." The married male unemployment rate has struck "rock 
  bottom," help wanted ads abound, and the DRI indices show that labor 
  market conditions are "tight." The current low first quarter growth 
  estimates reflect the vagaries of quarterly GNP estimates, not a 
  sharp deceleration in business activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite high demand, the economy does not appear to be running out 
  of cash. At present, credit needs are modest compared to the banking 
  system's ability to supply funds. The slow growth of the standard 
  monetary aggregates is misleading in this regard. The public is 
  acting as though it has adequate money resources because it is 
  accumulating liquidity in the form of "near money" assets excluded 
  from the standard aggregates. For example, high interest rates have 
  caused a rapid expansion of money market mutual funds. To the extent 
  these intermediaries purchase large CDs from commercial banks, M4 
  would provide a better gauge of recent "money" growth than M1, M1+, 
  or M2. Eckstein believes that it would be a mistake to reduce the 
  Federal Funds rate at this time. In fact, the Fed should take steps 
  to tighten policy further, raising the funds rate only as a last 
  resort, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker is less optimistic than Eckstein. He believes there is a 
  60 percent chance of a "pause" and 40 percent chance of a recession 
  by year end. Like Eckstein, Houthakker believes that the standard 
  monetary aggregates are misleading. Considering the growth of money 
  market mutual funds and other money substitutes, monetary policy has 
  been neither too tight nor too loose. As long as the public's liquid 
  assets continue to grow at current rates, there is no need to change 
  the Federal Funds rate. Furthermore, the Fed should not change the 
  Funds rate to "defend the dollar." The dollar has been doing well 
  recently. It is more important to "defend the economy." "A 
  prosperous economy is the best support we can give the dollar."
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker is pleased with the President's energy program. In time, 
  decontrol of energy prices should tend to reduce domestic prices as 
  our supply of oil increases and our dependence on foreign oil is 
  reduced. Initially, however, decontrol will increase prices. The Fed 
  should not repeat the mistake it made in 1974 of tightening monetary 
  policy too severely in response to these higher energy prices. 
  Houthakker suggests a "middle course:" The Fed should not adamantly 
  hold the line on price increases, nor should it passively permit 
  higher energy prices to set off ensuing rounds of inflation.
