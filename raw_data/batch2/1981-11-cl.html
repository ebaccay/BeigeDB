      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists and officials in the Fourth District see signs 
that weakness in economic activity is spreading, and most 
respondents have lowered their forecasts of real GNP growth to show 
sizable decline for the fourth quarter. Despite reports of spot 
weaknesses in capital spending, orders are still relatively strong. 
However, steel orders continue to be weak, apparently because 
inventories are being liquidated. Consumer spending in the District 
has deteriorated in recent months, and several respondents are 
concerned that pre-Christmas inventories are too high. Commercial 
bank lending is relatively strong for C&amp;I loans, but is virtually 
flat for consumer loans. S&amp;Ls have attracted a limited amount of new 
funds with the All-Savers certificate, but continue to experience 
weak or negative net savings flows.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists who attended the Fourth District Round Table on 
October 30 at this bank scaled down their forecasts of economic 
activity for the fourth quarter of 1981 and the first quarter of 
1982 from their June forecasts. The median of 31 forecasts shows 
only a 0.5% annual rate of decline in real GNP this quarter. 
However, nearly a third of the group indicated that the decline is 
more likely to be between 3 percent to 5 percent (a.r.), because 
signs of weakness are spreading and deepening. They expect some 
downward adjustment in inventory investment, and continued (though 
less severe) declines in residential construction and net exports 
this quarter from last. All of the forecasters expect revival of
growth in real GNP by next spring; the median forecast shows annual 
rates of increase of 4.5 percent to 5 percent in the second half of 
1982, in response to further moderation in inflation and the second 
stage of personal income-tax cuts. From the fourth quarter of 1981 
to the fourth quarter of 1982, the median forecast shows an increase 
in real GNP of 4.0 percent and an increase in the GNP implicit-price 
deflator of 7.6 percent. About two-thirds of the forecasters now 
expect money stock (M-1B) growth in 1981 will remain below the 
target range, and most have scaled upward their estimates of the 
Federal deficit for FY 1982 by $10 to $20 billion from their June 
range of $45 billion to $55 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital-goods producers report mixed conditions, with 
no recent significant decline for some goods but depressed business 
for others. Capital spending plans are still near their planned 
levels of a year-ago, according to several respondents, despite high 
interest rates and a weakening economy. A capital-goods producer 
states that heavy-duty trucks and farm equipment remain depressed. 
However, energy and electronics industries are expected to continue 
to be strong, while nonresidential construction is holding up 
reasonably well. Capital-goods orders, according to an economist for 
a major capital-goods manufacturer, are still strong, except in 
railroad-related equipment, auto-related metal cutting, and 
construction equipment. However, a small producer of industrial lift 
trucks reports that incoming orders are the lowest in the company's 
history.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Current operating rates in steel average less than 70 percent 
of capacity, according to an industry economist, with order intake 
rates equivalent to slightly above half of operating capacity. Steel 
consumers are attempting to liquidate inventories at a time when 
imports remain relatively high. The high level of orders last spring 
and summer was supported by a 3 million ton inventory buildup and 
strong demands from the oil industry. However, steel consumers are 
expected to liquidate 1.5-2.0 million tons of inventory this 
quarter. Some forecasts of domestic steel consumption and production 
in 1982 show increases of a few percent from 1981, but not until 
after the liquidation phase is completed by next spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Round Table participants expect that consumer 
spending will weaken again in the fourth quarter of 1981, following 
the spurt last quarter. Some see signs that the weakness in consumer 
spending has spread into major household goods and even into some 
consumer nondurable goods. Weakness in auto sales has been 
complicated by the lack of new models this season, according to an 
auto industry economist. He also pointed out that deterioration in 
consumer balance sheets and a weak economy for another six months 
will hinder a rebound in new car sales. He asserted that high 
interest rates have only cost the industry about half a million 
sales during 1981, but that the main cause of weakness has been 
inflation. A local auto dealer reports sales down 20 percent over 
year-ago levels and down 65 percent from 1978 levels. District 
retail sales have deteriorated somewhat in September and October, 
according to a bank economist. Merchants are anticipating a pick-up 
in sales as the Christmas shopping season approaches, but sizable 
inventories may require considerable discounting before the end of 
the year. A producer of consumer-durable goods reports that order 
cancellations are occurring, resulting in substantial layoffs in 
some appliances. Another economist pointed out that the decline in 
real nondurable goods, excluding gasoline sales, coupled with a 
substantial drop in corrugated box shipments in the last two months, 
suggests weakness in the economy is spreading and that an upper 
turning point in the business cycle may have occurred in August or 
September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business lending activity in the District continues to be 
supported in part by inventory financing, rather than merger-related 
activity. Bank loans are increasingly important to both large and 
small companies, according to a bank economist, because trade credit 
is scarce. Large and small companies have slowed payments, forcing 
some to borrow because of delinquent payments. A banker is concerned 
that firms may be borrowing to pay interest on previous loans. 
Lending activity, however, is expected to fall in the fourth quarter 
of 1981, as the economy weakens and businesses reduce year-end 
inventories. Consumer lending has been flat for the last three 
months, according to an area banker, and remains well below the peak 
of March 1980. A rise in delinquent rates on loans is causing some 
concern.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Savings Flows
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The All-Savers certificate, intended to ease both 
liquidity and earnings pressures, has not worked as well as 
expected. A large S&amp;L in the District reports another substantial 
quarterly loss in the third quarter, associated with a further rise 
in costs and a sharp decline in mortgage loans (55 percent below a 
year earlier). Nevertheless, the S&amp;L reports that revenues exceeded 
year-ago levels and the All-Savers certificate experienced strong 
growth in early October. A bank economist reports some shift to All-Savers from money-market certificates, but cautions that much of the 
All-Savers growth is derived from passbook savings accounts. An 
economist for a FHLB in the District notes that growth of All-Savers 
dropped 80 percent from the first ten-day period to the second ten-day period in October. Retail repos, which have been tied to the 
All-Savers, were negligible in October. All-Savers is not having 
much adverse effect on money-market funds, according to a bank 
economist, and S&amp;Ls are unlikely to achieve sizable net savings 
inflows until an instrument is created to compete with money-market 
funds.
