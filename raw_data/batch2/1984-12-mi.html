      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for some large layoffs in northeastern Minnesota, economic 
conditions in the Ninth District have not changed much lately. 
Generally favorable employment conditions have changed little from 
earlier this fall. Consumer spending appears to be stronger in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area than in other less diversified parts of 
the district. The pulp and paper and the oil and gas sectors are 
performing well, while the lumber and plywood and the iron mining 
sectors are not. Crop farmers' profitability has not improved much, 
but dairy and fat cattle prices have.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District employment conditions are generally stable. While 
Minnesota's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose a bit in 
September, the increase is widely thought to be due to statistical 
quirks. In fact, in that state, seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll 
employment posted a September increase only slightly less than the 
1984 average monthly increase, and average weekly earnings in 
manufacturing industries increased slightly from August. Similar 
reports come from other parts of the district. In the Dakotas, for 
example, the September unemployment rate was only 4 percent. In the 
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, area, it was as low as 3 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment in one of the district's industries has not been stable 
recently: massive layoffs in the northeastern Minnesota iron mining 
sector were announced in November. Due to a slump in steel demand, 
about 4,500 more workers were laid off in an industry which had at 
one time directly employed 14,500 workers, but which more recently 
had employed only about 8,000. The latest layoffs are a severe blow 
to the northeastern Minnesota economy which had been recovering from 
lingering effects of the national recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A mixed pattern of consumer spending is reported. While growth is 
generally noted in the Twin Cities, it is not in some other parts of 
the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of general merchandise have not been uniformly strong lately. 
At two large Twin City retailers, sales appear to have picked up 
late in November. Both of these retailers report November sales 
about 12 percent ahead of year-earlier levels, although inventories 
are still high. This Bank's directors also report good sales in 
parts of western Wisconsin and around Bozeman, Montana. Retail sales 
have not been so good in other parts of the District, however. In 
Rochester, Minnesota, early November sales were generally slow, with 
smaller retailers doing worse than larger retailers. One Bank 
director reports small increases at best for retailers in South 
Dakota, while other directors report a general merchandise slump in 
many parts of Montana and North Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Motor vehicle sales, in contrast, seem to be continuing at a good 
pace in many areas of the district (despite the effects of the 
General Motors strike). Regional offices of domestic auto 
manufacturers report that sales rose between September and October. 
Indicative of this strength, one manufacturer experienced 9 percent 
higher car sales and 43 percent higher truck sales this October than 
last. Its inventories are low but still adequate. Bank directors 
report that car sales in October and November were a little light in 
South Dakota and about the same as a year earlier in Bismarck, North 
Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      While housing purchases have picked up lately in the Twin Cities and 
in some scattered areas, they have been slow in other areas. After 
falling in August, Twin City home sales rose in September, 
maintaining a level over 17 percent higher than a year earlier. 
October sales in Minneapolis maintained the September pace. Sales in 
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, were good, in part due to the 
availability of subsidized mortgages financed with mortgage revenue 
bonds. But Bank directors report that housing starts slowed in 
western Wisconsin and Montana, and many units remain unsold in 
Bismarck, North Dakota, and in Rochester, Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The picture in resource-related industries is mixed, too. Two 
sectors are continuing to do well. While expansion plans in the 
paper industry been delayed, pulp and paper prices and production 
are still strong, particularly for coated printing paper. Oil 
production is also strong, with 50 rigs operating in the Williston 
Basin of North Dakota and a new $51 million project to enhance oil 
recovery from these wells. Due to the warm, dry weather, oil and gas 
drilling has gone well in Montana, increasing employment there. Two 
other sectors are not doing too well, though. As noted above, 
continuing low steel demand helped cause massive layoffs recently in 
northeastern Minnesota's iron mining industry. And domestic lumber 
and plywood prices continue to be hurt by Canadian imports and 
substitute building products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite a generally favorable harvest, many district farmers are 
still suffering from low product prices, excessive debt burdens, and 
low land prices. Dairy farming and livestock operations have seen 
some price improvement, though. The Minnesota farm price index fell 
in October for the fourth consecutive month. It has fallen nearly 12 
percent since June. Of the respondents to this Bank's late September 
survey of district ag bankers, 44 percent said that farmers in their 
areas earned less in the third quarter than a year earlier, and a 
full 50 percent said that debt repayment was slower than normal for 
that time of year. However, fat cattle prices have been quite strong 
recently, and milk prices went up in October, as fluid milk supplies 
tightened.
