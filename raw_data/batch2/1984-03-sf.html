      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economic recovery is continuing with increased 
momentum. Consumer spending in the post-Christmas holiday period has 
been stronger than it has been nationally, with both retail stores 
and automobile dealerships experiencing large year-to-year sales 
gains. Western homebuilding activity in January rebounded even more 
strongly than nationally, and permits for new units point to a 
continuing high-level of activity. Nonresidential construction 
spending is really beginning to pick up. In the manufacturing 
sector, nearly all industries have been increasing production and 
employment recently, with demand especially strong for defense and 
business capital equipment. Agricultural crop prices are up sharply 
from a year ago and the planting season is progressing well. In the 
deregulated environment, financial institutions have chosen not to 
compete aggressively against each other for small time deposits but 
to offer rates fairly close to those of money market funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending has been strong in the post-Christmas holiday 
period and would have been even greater at some retail outlets had 
not late December "clearance" sales so depleted inventory as to 
reduce merchandise selection. Major department stores in Southern 
California, for example, experienced an average 11 percent gain in 
sales in both January and February over levels of a year earlier. 
This far surpassed the gain at department stores nationally in 
January. In other Western states—even those where unemployment 
rates are still above the national average—year-to-year sales 
gains were nearly as large as in California. Sales of nondurable 
goods, especially clothing, have been especially strong. But durable 
goods such as furniture and appliances also are selling well. 
Moreover, auto dealerships have been experiencing much larger sales 
gains than department stores, even in rural areas. To finance their 
heavy expenditures, consumers have been sharply increasing their 
installment debt but are reported to be very current on their 
payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all manufacturing industries have bean expanding output and 
employment recently, with the exception of some primary metals, 
notably copper. The Pacific Northwest lumber industry has not yet 
been adding workers but has been experiencing a resurgence in orders 
and prices since November as national homebuilding has shown renewed 
strength. Employment growth has been especially strong in the 
electronic equipment and missiles and space vehicles industries 
located in California, Oregon, Arizona and Utah. Electronics firms 
have been benefiting not only from rising defense and consumer 
demand but business capital spending to enhance efficiency. Orders 
also have been increasing sharply for other capital goods, including 
non-electrical machinery, trucks and aircraft. In Washington, the 
nation's leading manufacturer of commercial transport planes has 
been adding workers since October, reversing a two-year cutback. A 
large manufacturer of long-haul trucks experienced a doubling of 
profits during the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Even 
manufacturers of such big ticket discretionary consumer goods as 
recreational vehicles and pleasure boats are experiencing an upsurge 
in sales. Despite increased production, the manufacturing sector 
generally still has ample unused capacity, except for paper where 
demand for certain products has reached the "boom" stage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity has shown even more dramatic strength in the 
West recently than it has nationally. In January, Western housing 
starts soared upward by 46 percent, reaching the highest level since 
late 1979 and a pace 73 percent above the level of a year earlier. 
Permits issued for new dwelling units in the region also rose more 
than nationally, suggesting that Western homebuilding activity in 
coming months will remain relatively strong. Sales also are reported 
to be holding up well, although home prices in the West generally 
are up on average about 6 percent from a year ago. Respondents 
attribute the greater-than-expected strength in housing to increased 
availability of adjustable rate mortgage packages, which offer 
initial rates as much as 3 percentage points below conventional 
fixed rate mortgages, and to gains in real personal income. They 
also mention that buyers feel that both mortgage and inflation rates 
are going to move higher and that now is an opportune time to 
purchase a home. Equally impressive is the strong pickup already 
occurring and planned in nonresidential construction activity. 
Throughout the District, respondents report the launching of a large 
number of new projects such as shopping and convention centers, 
hotels, office buildings, and highway improvements. Firms continue 
to be cautious about investing in new industrial structures, 
however, except for electronic equipment manufacturers and other 
defense suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions throughout the District generally are considerably 
more favorable than a year ago. District farmers are benefiting from 
sharply higher prices for vegetables and citrus crops, partly as a 
result of the winter freeze in Florida and Texas. California is 
experiencing one of the warmest and driest winters on record—in 
contrast to last year's flooding—so that the planting season is 
progressing normally. The mild temperatures—and consequent early 
budding—will mean that yields of tree fruits and grapes will be 
moderate. This will push up prices since tree fruit inventories are 
low. Production coats are stable, including interest rates, while 
the growing domestic economy generally is helping to boost prices. 
However, the slow export market is still a problem. Despite improved 
market conditions, many small growers in California are still in 
serious financial difficulty because of previous poor years. 
Numerous small farms and parcels have been put up for sale to 
lighten debt burden. Yet even at land prices far below those of a 
year ago, owners are having difficulty finding buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The financial institutions in the Twelfth District have found the 
deregulated market for small time deposits to be rather calm after 
the initial scramble for funds. Some observers suggest that for 
short-term accounts interest rate differentials of greater than 20-30 basis points are required before significant movement of funds 
between institutions occurs. Rates have been generally stable in 
recent months, as the industry seems to have avoided "rate wars" by 
keeping their rates in line with those offered by money market 
funds. The rates on Super-NOWs have been particularly stable, 
staying around 7 percent, as its role as a transaction deposit 
apparently dominates any interest rate concerns. Financial 
institutions have not extensively used their increased ability to 
tailor the maturity of their deposits. Some have tried to lengthen 
maturity. But in general there seems to be a willingness to accept 
the consumers' desire to keep deposits under a year in maturity 
because of their uncertainty over future interest rates.
