      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity in the fourth district has risen to effective 
capacity in a number of industries with no signs of impending letup. 
Primary metal producers report order books are full through the 
first half of 1979 and capital goods producers are generally more 
bullish now than late last fall. Economists who attended the March 9 
meeting on the economic outlook held at this bank, expect a 
recession to begin in the second half of 1979 and have also scaled 
up their expectations for inflation this year. S&amp;Ls expect sharply 
reduced deposit flows as a result of March 15 changes in money 
market certificates. Financial problems in the City of Cleveland 
remain unresolved despite the voter passage of an income tax 
increase.
      <p>
       Manufacturing in the district is virtually at effective capacity in 
a number of key industries, especially primary metals, capital 
goods, fabricated metals, and rubber and plastic products. 
References to parallels with 1973-1974 are becoming more frequent, 
and some concerns have begun to surface that a typical inventory 
cycle may be developing. Capital goods producers have been stepping 
up inventory building in response to strengthened orders and 
backlogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth district economists who attended a meeting on the outlook at 
this bank on March 9, lowered their expectations for output in 1979 
from estimates last November. The median forecast of a group of 29 
economists shows a gain in real GNP at a 1.8 percent annual rate in 
the first half of 1979, followed by a 1.3 percent rate of decline in 
the second half, and a 1 percent rate of increase in the first 
quarter of 1980. Only four of the group expect a recession to begin 
in the second quarter of 1979, but 15 of 29 indicate a decline in 
real GNP in the third quarter and 20 of 29 expect a decline again in 
the fourth quarter. The projected recession is expected to be mild 
and brief because of a lack of major excesses or imbalances, a less-
than-typical decline in housing, gradual improvement in net exports, 
and continued strength in fixed investment. They expect the rate of 
inflation to be 8.5 percent, 7.9 percent, 7.0 percent, and 6.8 
percent from the first quarter of 1979 through the fourth quarter, 
respectively, and the unemployment rate to edge up to 6.8 percent in 
the fourth quarter of 1979. Several expressed a view that public 
policy makers should take additional risks now to bring the rate of 
inflation under control, which includes holding down growth of 
monetary aggregates, should a sharp rebound occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economists scaled down their expectations for consumer spending from 
last fall. They now expect nominal consumer spending to slow to 
nearly an 8 percent annual rate of increase in the second half of 
1979 following an expected 10 percent increase in the first half. A 
group of seven automotive producers and suppliers now expect 
domestic new car sales will amount to nearly 8.8 million units in 
1979 plus 1.8 million imports. An automotive economist discounts the 
runup in consumer installment debt unless a sustained decline in 
real income occurs. He indicated that recent increases in gas prices 
have already contributed to a further shift from middle-sized to 
compact cars and believes that unlike the experience following the 
oil embargo in 1974, higher gas prices may have a positive effect on 
car sales because cars on the road are less fuel efficient. Some 
other economists, however, note that the high rate of inflation has 
substantially changed consumer spending patterns, especially for 
nondurable goods, and are skeptical that spending for these types of 
goods will be insulated from a recession.
      </p>
      <p>
       One notes that consumers have resisted higher relative prices for 
nondurable goods while buying goods that represent a hedge against 
inflation. An economist with a major department store chain expects 
a drop in real GAF sales this quarter, which is likely to continue 
into the summer because of double-digit inflation and slower 
employment and income gains. He believes a peak in GAF sales 
occurred last October, and since then, sales have been relatively 
flat, contrary to the surge reported last quarter in nondurable 
goods sales in national product accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economists are considerably more optimistic than they were last fall 
that business fixed investment will show stronger gains in 1979 than 
indicated in recent surveys. They now expect a nominal 13.8 percent 
increase in 1979 on the strength of accelerated rates of increases 
in orders and backlogs in the last six months. Machine tool orders 
in the first two months of 1979 rose significantly from the 
comparable period of 1978, which leads one economist to assert that 
the present phase is similar to early 1956 and 1973, and may tend to 
prolong the expansion although at a slow rate of growth. Another 
economist concluded that the economy has moved into a typical 
advanced stage of an expansion in which fixed investment replaces 
consumer spending as a prime source of thrust to economic activity. 
Nevertheless, there are still some weaknesses or expected weaknesses 
among segments of capital goods industries. Demand from utilities 
for electrical generators remains weak, and heavy-duty truck 
production is expected to fall sharply by next fall in response to 
slowing sales and record inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some petroleum refineries in the district have announced allocation 
of gas supplies this month that are generally based on 100 percent 
of year-ago volume in order to stretch out gasoline supplies. In 
some cases, district-based refineries were picking up additional 
business from refineries that earlier announced cutbacks in supplies 
to local retailers.
      </p>
      <p>
       S&amp;Ls in the district expect that March 15 restrictions on money 
market certificates will sharply curtail growth of deposit flows and 
mortgage credit and probably lead to further near-term tightening in 
mortgage terms. Some feel the certificates were threatening the 
liquidity and profitability of some associations. An official with a 
major Ohio association, for example, stated that if growth of 
certificates continued at the rate of the past six months, by the 
end of 1979, 25 percent of their deposits would be in certificates 
and profitability would have been cut by more than one-half. Some 
others feel profitability has not been that much of a problem, but 
may worsen because deposit outflows will accelerate as certificates 
mature. Loan commitments have not been as strong as last year 
because some lenders have been unwilling to make 90 percent mortgage 
loans and some have been unwilling to make 80 percent loans except 
to their customers. The feeling at some S&amp;Ls seems to be that 
competition for funds, once the cap is effective, will be fierce, as 
associations set up promotional activity to retain funds and attract 
new deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voters in Cleveland approved a 50 percent income tax hike and 
rejected the sale of the Municipal Light Plant, but financial 
problems appear to be far from over. While generating an estimated 
$25 million this year in new tax revenues to deal with an 
accumulated $100 million debt, the city still must confront two 
obstacles in order to return to the bond market. First, without cash 
from the sale of Muny Light, the city is unlikely to be able to 
repurchase either the defaulted notes worth $15 million or the $26 
million in notes that mature by September. Second, the new tax is 
not sufficient to reestablish investor confidence in the financial 
integrity of the city. The State Legislature is currently debating 
the form that state aid might take. Legislative action is expected 
to be slow despite the fear of unmet payrolls in Cleveland and of 
the spillover of financial problems into the school system and the 
suburbs.
