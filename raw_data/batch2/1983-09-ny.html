      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An uneven economic recovery in the Second District continued in 
August. Consumer spending appeared to be slowing from the 
extraordinary pace of early summer, though gains over 1982 were 
still substantial at some stores. Residential construction was 
strong; homebuilders are booked up for the next few months. 
Nonresidential construction improved further, with some industrial 
and commercial projects getting underway. Most manufacturers saw a 
pickup in activity, but heavy goods producers saw little 
improvement. In the agricultural sector, a summer drought damaged 
corn and  hay crops, but harvests of fruit are expected to be high. 
On the financial side, business lending was flat and automobile 
loans picked up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity continued to slacken in recent weeks. Although some 
department stores still achieved healthy double-digit gains over a 
year ago, the volume of sales in August was generally lower than in 
May and June. The pace appeared to be slowing further in early 
September. One middle-income chain experienced four straight weeks 
of declining sales and reported that by early September, volume was 
less than last year. Some merchants felt that hot weather was a key 
factor in depressing sales, especially those of autumn apparel. 
Retailers are hopeful that business will pick up when the weather 
cools.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction continued at a rapid pace. Builders of 
custom homes are fully booked through the next few months, and 
speculative projects, mostly condominiums, are increasing, This 
activity has caused shortages of supplies and labor to become more 
severe. Despite the current activity, builders are anxious about 
next spring. Traffic has fallen recently. While such a slowdown is 
normal around Labor Day, there is concern that higher interest rates 
may be discouraging buyers. If the normal pickup in October fails to 
materialize, construction will fall off during the first half of 
next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The nonresidential real estate market continued. to improve 
throughout most of the District. Leasing activity increased further 
in downtown New York, New Jersey, and on Long Island. Although new 
starts of office construction remained rare, our contacts reported 
that some buildings are being planned, Furthermore, several 
industrial and commercial development projects are planned or 
underway in New York City's outer boroughs, with a good deal of 
public sector participation. And plans for major retail mall 
projects have been reported in Manhattan, Long Island, and the 
Albany area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to pick up throughout the District, 
but the extent of the upturn was uneven. High technology companies, 
including producers of computers, semiconductors, defense 
electronics, and medical equipment, experienced the sharpest gains, 
and several of these firms announced expansion plans. In other 
industries, such as plastics and instruments, sales gains were 
modest. In heavy goods industries, however, no significant pickup 
has been reported. While steel production rose marginally in Western 
New York, almost half of the industry's capacity remained idle. And 
although capital goods producers were finding more projects on which 
to bid, they had still not observed any significant rise in solid 
orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for employment, a state labor official felt the job market was 
just beginning to turn up, with the strongest relative improvement 
in the services and construction sectors. By contrast, some major 
insurance companies reported efforts to cut costs by reducing 
employment levels or by moving jobs outside Manhattan. Unemployment 
District-wide remained below the national level, but in some areas, 
re-entrants to the labor force were expected to keep rates high even 
as employment levels rise. In New York City in particular, the rapid 
increase in the labor force pushed unemployment to 10.6 percent in 
July and August.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the agricultural sector, bad weather has damaged some crops but 
has had little effect on others. The drought during July and August 
depressed yields per acre for corn and hay. In contrast, wheat was 
harvested early during the dry spell, and yields were high. The 
fruit-growing regions had adequate rain, and good crops are 
expected. The apple harvest may be one of the largest on record. 
High yields and low demand for New York wines have combined to 
depress the price of grapes, however. In the dairy industry, high 
production has limited price increases, and profits are expected to 
be squeezed as feed costs climb.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks surveyed in early September reported that business lending 
showed little improvement. Any increase at individual institutions, 
moreover, was, attributed to their marketing efforts rather than any 
improvement in overall loan demand. Most institutions in the region 
have taken an unaggressive approach to mortgage lending as rates 
have backed up and demand for loans has dropped off . In contrast, 
the volume of both direct auto loans and dealer paper has picked up 
during the summer as auto sales have surged. Further, the 
competitive position of banks is expected to improve as many 
interest rate promotions of auto finance companies end. With the 
deregulation of most types of consumer time deposits beginning 
October 1, some institutions have begun extensive promotional 
campaigns, in some cases offering retail, repurchase agreements at 
high rates until October 1 when the funds will be converted into 
longer term time deposits.
