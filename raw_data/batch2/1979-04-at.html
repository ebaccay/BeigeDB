      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Activity has been rather quiet in the past month, bringing steady 
  but modest growth despite the emergence of potential problems. 
  Except for subcompact car sales, consumer spending gains have been 
  small. Housing markets remain fairly strong but softening. At banks, 
  deposit growth looks a bit better, but loan demand has eased. 
  Steady, solid advances in nonresidential construction have 
  continued. Layoffs and strikes have clouded labor market reports, 
  but the Teamsters' strike has had only limited impact as yet. 
  Inventories appear to be adequate and manageable, although short 
  gasoline supplies have become more visible. Farmers are getting 
  higher prices and are optimistic about the year's prospects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Growth in retail sales within the District has been moderate and 
  steady. Many retailers indicated that consumer spending is generally 
  satisfactory and may be slightly ahead of spending for the 
  comparable period in 1978. A continued shift in preference for 
  smaller, fuel-efficient automobiles was evident, with very good 
  sales straining supplies of economy cars. One contact reported a 
  tendency for middle-class consumers to trade down to smaller models, 
  while the well-to-do continue to purchase luxury cars.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's been little change in housing trends of late. Some areas 
  reported a pick-up in mortgage loan demand in March, probably 
  largely seasonal or due to special influences like April 1 changes 
  in local building codes. Apartment construction continues to 
  increase modestly, although some areas have noted apartment 
  vacancies creeping up. In early April, New Orleans made available 
  some $72 million, raised through municipal bonds, to mortgage 
  borrowers at 8 1/4 percent. Estimates of the total amount of tax-
  free mortgage offerings planned by Louisiana cities range from $500 
  million to $750 million. Several Florida cities, including 
  Jacksonville, have similar bond issues in the works.
       </p>
       <p>
        Loan demand, excluding mortgages, has moderated in the most recent 
  weeks. Deposit inflows have strengthened, although demand for six-
  month money certificates seems to have slowed after the regulatory 
  changes. In Tennessee, with an easing of usury restrictions on the 
  horizon, borrowers are reportedly negotiating eagerly for longer 
  loan maturities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonresidential construction appears to be progressing at a steady 
  pace. Office occupancy rates have continued upward, nudging up 
  rents; construction seems to be well-balanced against reasonable 
  expectations for demand, with most space rented in advance. Land 
  transactions have been very active, with prices strong and even 
  distressed properties now moving. A major Atlanta realtor has 
  experienced no abatement of commercial closings to date, but he sees 
  some hesitation of prospects, definite caution with regard to retail 
  properties, and a potential overhang of warehouse construction. He 
  characterizes credit availability as good and underwriting as "sensible." Some noteworthy industrial announcements have been made 
  in the past few weeks, among them a $150- to $200-million expansion 
  of St. Regis' Pensacola plant and an enormous electric-generating 
  facility in Tennessee. Florida's phosphate producers are moving 
  ahead with ambitious expansion plans, notably the development of 
  uranium extraction capabilities, since the EPA gave them the green 
  light in March.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent labor market news has been downbeat, with strikes and layoffs 
  dominating the picture, but the potential for good job growth 
  remains. The latest hard figures, several weeks old, showed only 
  slight overall employment gains. A construction strike, involving 
  2,500-5,000 workers, has brought a halt to major commercial building 
  projects in south Florida. Georgia-Pacific's Louisville, 
  Mississippi, plant continues to operate despite a lock-out of local 
  workers. Both disputes arose from management's attempts to keep wage 
  increases within the Administration's guidelines. The impact of the 
  Teamsters' strike has been muted by the District's relatively high 
  proportion of nonunion labor in trucking. The two Atlanta-area GM 
  plants are well-supplied with parts, the majority of which are
  received by rail, and are likely to be stepping up production in 
  coming weeks. Ford's Lakewood, Georgia, LTD plant will remain on a 
  one-week-on, one-week-off schedule until July to reduce inventories 
  and alleviate a parts shortage that pre-dates the Teamsters' strike. 
  While it appears that Georgia will be spared from any major military 
  cutbacks, Florida is likely to be the hardest hit state in the 
  nation, losing more than 5,000 armed forces personnel, if the recent 
  proposals are carried out.
       </p>
       <p>
        A query of directors regarding inventories revealed no significant 
  problems, either build-ups or shortages, although many expect some 
  if the Teamsters' strike persists much longer. A few bankers 
  reported that they received limited requests for financing of extra 
  inventories just prior to the strike. Retail stocks are generally 
  considered tractable, although Atlanta retailers complain of 
  excesses. Supplies of some steel products remain tight, with lead 
  times extending further.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tightness of gasoline supplies has become more noticeable but has 
  yet to pose major problems. Temporary outages have been more common, 
  mainly at retail stations (especially Exxon) but also at some 
  distributorships. Many stations have cut back hours and/or begun 
  closing on Sundays. Other rationing schemes being considered by 
  retailers include converting self-serve pumps to full-serve and 
  limiting service to regular customers; some south Florida stations 
  are reportedly issuing IDs for that purpose. Some hoarding of fuels, 
  notably by agricultural and construction firms, has been observed by 
  central Florida directors. On the other hand, the trucking slowdown 
  has reduced sales of gasoline, food, etc., at truck stops.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Three-Mile Island incident has provoked a great deal of comment 
  on the future of nuclear power in the Southeast; scattered groups of 
  protesters have called for the closing of existing facilities and a 
  halt to construction of new nuclear plants. No concrete steps in 
  that direction have yet come to our attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business is poor in the District's coal industry. Many smaller 
  operators are selling at loss or closing shop. The industry has seen 
  a rather brisk capital expansion and a dramatic rise in regulatory 
  costs in the past few years, while the projected surge in coal 
  demand has not materialized.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the agricultural sector, prices generally have continued to rise. 
  Beef prices posted a new record last month, and corn and soybean 
  prices remained quite strong. Expanded production dropped poultry 
  and pork prices, however; a "promotional" 10-percent cut in citrus 
  prices looks likely to stick, and industry sources are talking of 
  another reduction within the next few weeks. Crop producers are 
  optimistic, increasing plantings and borrowings. Heavy rains have 
  put plowing slightly behind schedule.
