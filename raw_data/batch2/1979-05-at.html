      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 16, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The latest reports from Red Book contacts have been more downbeat 
  than any in the last two years. The deep South has been troubled by 
  extensive flood damage in addition to the nationwide problems of 
  rapid inflation and dubious energy supplies. Retail sales, which has 
  shown little strength since Christmas, now appears to be declining 
  in real terms. Housing markets continue to weaken, except in 
  Florida, where thin inventories, high prices, and increasing 
  speculation pose potential problems. While banks have enjoyed strong 
  deposit growth and some pick-up in lending, thrifts have realized 
  little or no net inflows since the regulatory changes vis-a-vis 
  money market certificates. The short-term outlook for industrial 
  production, capital spending, and jobs is largely positive despite 
  some weak spots. Inventories seem well in hand with the exception of 
  autos, where stocks are far out of line with demands. The Southeast 
  is weathering the gas cutbacks with a minimum of problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        Heavy rains and flooding have caused severe damage in several large 
  sections of the District. Estimates are not yet available for many 
  affected areas, but early estimates indicate damages of well over $1 
  billion in Mississippi, roughly $30 million in Louisiana, at least 
  $60 million in the Nashville area, and several million more in 
  southwest Alabama and south Florida. Federal disaster relief has 
  been made available to most locales, some $600 million thus far in 
  Mississippi alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        The floods' agricultural impact included damage to farm structures, 
  severe soil erosion in limited areas, some loss of cattle and 
  vegetable crops, deterioration of pastures, and delays in planting. 
  Agricultural experts estimate that pastures will be restored by mid-
  June and that soybeans will be planted in time to produce normal 
  yields. The delay, however, mandates a shift from cotton to soybeans 
  that may involve as much as 50,000 acres.
       </p>
       <p>
        Districtwide, consumer spending has been noticeably weaker since 
  March, with year-over-year retail sales gains lagging or barely 
  keeping pace with inflation in most areas. Directors and their 
  contacts in retail trade characterize consumers as increasingly 
  cautious, angry about inflation and beginning to resist price hikes, 
  and worried by the energy outlook. Undoubtedly, however, the bad 
  weather and early Easter have restrained spending in the latest few 
  weeks. Softness has been particularly noted in sales of nondurable 
  goods and automobiles, although demand for small cars (both domestic 
  and imported) continues to boom. While general merchandise stocks 
  remain under control, inventories of large cars are uncomfortably 
  high but short supplies of fuel-efficient models threaten to dampen 
  sales. In the Atlanta area, Ford has added another idle week to its 
  alternate-week schedule at its full-sized model production facility, 
  while area Volkswagen dealers have stopped taking orders for the 
  rest of the model year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In most parts of the District, residential construction has 
  continued its shallow decline with nearly all work pre-sold. 
  Inventories are universally reported as thin; existing-home sales 
  have held up well. The growing popularity of converting apartments 
  to condos is aggravating a shortage of rental housing. Observers 
  attribute the slowdown to a variety of causes--poor supplies, high 
  home prices, "availability of money," buyers' difficulty in 
  qualifying for loans, a negative economic outlookâ€”but none believe 
  that high interest rates per se are deterring prospective buyers. In 
  flood-stricken areas, contractors are looking to restoration work to 
  help keep up their business volume.
       </p>
       <p>
        Florida remains the exception in the housing picture; in south 
  Florida especially, market activity continues at record levels. 
  Supply strains are acute there; large companies are complaining that 
  inadequate inventories and dramatic price increases are thwarting 
  relocation efforts and personnel transfers; realtors are knocking on 
  doors and encouraging owners to consider selling. Several Florida 
  directors expressed concern about speculation; besides builders, 
  local "non-realtors" (doctors, lawyers) have gotten into the act. 
  Mortgage credit supplies appear adequate but not plentiful, 
  evidenced by a trend toward larger downpayment requirements and 
  rising mortgage interest rates (now, atypically, above those of 
  other District states).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deposit inflows to thrifts were quite weak in April, while banks 
  enjoyed strong gains, particularly in demand deposits and money 
  market certificates. Despite an easing of business loan demand at 
  the "large" banks, bank lending has picked up, with brisk increases 
  in real estate and consumer loans. The May 1 raising of Tennessee's 
  usury ceiling from 10 percent to an effective 14.5 percent brought 
  the first of a series of planned gradual interest rate adjustments 
  at most banks; however, the state's largest bank holding company has 
"frozen" its rates to "small borrowers" at 10.5 percent. So far, 
  Tennessee banks have noticed little change in lending volume or 
  borrower reaction to the higher rates. The state's S&amp;Ls are back in 
  the mortgage lending business after several dormant months, but many 
  refuse to set rates until closing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial activity remains healthy, for the most part, and quite 
  profitable, by the latest reckoning. Directors report minor 
  deterioration in sales and order backlogs for home-building 
  materials and some types of equipment, but steel-related industries, 
  suppliers to the paper industry, and railcar producers have taken a 
  rash of new orders. Persistent weakness in the coal market has added 
  to Alabama's unemployment rate and created surplus inventories for 
  some of the industry's suppliers. The textile situation remains a 
  mixed bag, with some mills prospering and expanding and others 
  closing. Generally, capital spending and nonresidential construction 
  show steady growth, although many contacts sense some hesitation 
  with regard to projects still in the planning stages. Inventories 
  continue to be held tightly in rein despite isolated incidents of 
  advance buying. Employment prospects are positive in most 
  industries; the shortage of technicians and engineers appears to 
  have worsened.
       </p>
       <p>
        The gasoline shortage seems to have created more fear than real 
  problems as yet, although most people expect it to get worse. May 
  allocations to distributors and industrial users range from 70 to 95 
  percent of May 1978 sales (usage), with the mode at 80 percent. Gas 
  stations throughout the District have cut back their hours; weekend 
  closings are troublesome only in central Florida; purchase limits 
  are relatively rare. Atlanta's Hartsfield airport has and expects to 
  maintain ample supplies of aviation fuel. The State of Tennessee has 
  implemented a contingency plan to help make up for shortfalls of 
  supply to farms, businesses, and school systems.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the usual seasonal slowdown, tourism appears to have suffered 
  no ill effects from limited gasoline availability in spite of the 
  industry's grave concern. Huge increases in air passenger traffic 
  and faltering recreational vehicle sales may reflect a substitution 
  effect, but hotel occupancy rates, advance bookings at hotels, 
  travel agencies, and cruiselines, attendance at major attractions, 
  and pleasure boat sales continue strong.
