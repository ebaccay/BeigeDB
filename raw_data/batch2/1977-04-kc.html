      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District directors report that area businessmen are optimistic 
about the economy. Recent rains have provided a psychological boost, 
retail sales are good, and the energy situation should, on the 
whole, benefit the region. Although farm prices rose in March for 
the fourth consecutive month, the continued rise in farm costs has 
kept producers from significantly improving their profit margins. 
The drought has been somewhat alleviated by recent rains. 
Nevertheless, additional moisture is needed for normal crop yields. 
Loan demand in the District increased in March, due to abnormally 
high levels of agricultural loan renewals and increased commercial 
loans. Savings deposit growth was also reported as strong, though 
fears were expressed about the effect on this inflow should short-term interest rates rise.
      <p>
       Directors report that the mood of businessmen in the Tenth District 
  is largely one of optimism. Given the strong agricultural 
  orientation of the District, the recent rains have provided a needed 
  psychological boost, and other areas of the economy are generally 
  showing strength. One troublesome situation that was mentioned is 
  the depressed prices for wheat and cattle. Country banks are highly 
  loaned up to farmers, and there are indications that their 
  correspondents are beginning to apply pressure on these banks to 
  encourage farmers to begin selling their wheat—some of which has 
  been stored for 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       In agricultural areas of Kansas, it was reported that "retailers 
  have been doing amazingly well." Farmers are continuing to spend 
  strongly on consumer goods, although farm implement sales are quite 
  depressed. Elsewhere in the District, retail sales are generally 
  good but not outstanding, while construction spending remains 
  relatively weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the labor market, unemployment still remains abnormally high, but 
  excluding Kansas City (which is experiencing strikes of public 
  school teachers and workers in heavy construction), the situation is 
  untroubled. Furthermore, in Oklahoma City, General Motors announced 
  plans to build an assembly plant which will ultimately employ 5,000 
  workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several directors also commented on energy and capital investment. 
  Wyoming and Colorado should benefit from the national commitment to 
  shift from natural gas to low-sulfur coal. Outside investment in the 
  energy field has been strong and a solar energy research center has 
  been established in Golden, Colorado. While levels of capital 
  spending appear to be rising, uncertainty remains a strong 
  consideration influencing expansion. One director noted, however, 
  that "a few good moves (by the administration) could restore 
  confidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       Farm prices rose 1 per cent in the month ended March 15, marking 
  their fourth consecutive monthly gain. Although the index of prices 
  received is now slightly above year-earlier levels, the index of 
  prices paid by farmers for all items was 5 per cent higher in March 
  than it was a year ago. Consequently, many producers are confronted 
  with a rather tight price-cost squeeze in their operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The severe drought in many parts of the District has been 
  temporarily broken by recent thunderstorms and showers. Most of 
  Nebraska, Kansas, and the eastern half of Oklahoma have received 
  good moisture during the past months. The wheat crop is now greening 
  up, as are the pastures for cattle grazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from District states indicate that the condition of the new 
  wheat crop ranges from just fair to good. There is evidence of wind 
  damage and winterkill in southwest Kansas, and insect problems are 
  increasing in Oklahoma, where the wheat is now jointing. Despite the 
  recent improvements in weather conditions, additional moisture will 
  be necessary to achieve average yields. However, a large carryover 
  of wheat will help maintain total supplies and prevent a sharp runup 
  in price.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Tenth District banks contacted for the April Red Book indicated 
  that loan demand had increased in March. In addition to renewals of 
  agricultural loans, which would normally be repaid during this part 
  of the year, a number of banks reported an increase in commercial 
  loans to finance higher levels of inventories and receivables. One 
  Colorado banker expressed apprehension about the effect of President 
  Carter's upcoming energy proposals on the tourist industry and the 
  demand for loans to finance purchases of recreational vehicles. 
  Oklahoma bankers, on the other hand, expect the passage of a 
  comprehensive energy bill to provide further impetus to the already 
  strong demand for energy-related business loans. Some Oklahoma banks 
  have already raised their local prime lending rate from 6 3/4 per 
  cent to 7 per cent as a result of the strong loan demand in their 
  area, and others expect to do so in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strong savings deposit growth was reported in all areas of the Tenth 
  District. Most banks indicated that the rate of growth of time and 
  savings deposits was either stable or increasing. Some bankers 
  stated that they expect this trend to be reversed if short-term 
  interest rates rise by as much as 50 or 100 basis points. None of 
  the bankers contacted expect the rebate package to have an 
  appreciable impact on deposit growth, although some admitted that 
  they were still puzzled by the 1975 experience when deposit growth 
  exceeded expectations during the rebate period.
