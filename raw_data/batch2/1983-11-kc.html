      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from the Tenth District indicate further moderate 
improvement in economic conditions. Retail sales continue to 
improve, with generally stable prices. Prices of industrial inputs 
have shown recent increases, however. Inventories of industrial 
inputs and of retail goods are regarded as satisfactory, except 
among automobile dealers. Both housing starts and house sales have 
weakened, as have savings-inflows to savings and loan institutions. 
Fall crops suffered from drought and other factors, and livestock 
prices are falling as marketings increase. Both bank loan demand and 
bank deposits have increased recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total dollar sales in the first nine months of 1983 increased up to 
7 percent over the same period last year, with widespread 
improvement reported for the past three months. Prices have been 
generally stable in 1983 and are expected to remain so through the 
end of the year. Inventory levels are reported to vary from 
satisfactory to a little high. A normal seasonal upturn in sales is 
expected for the rest of 1983, with the national recovery expected 
to contribute to further improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District report improved 
sales in 1983 from weak year-earlier levels, with the strongest 
gains occurring in Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado. Sales of domestic 
and import models are still being suppressed by low inventories. 
Easing of automobile credit conditions is evident in more aggressive 
marketing of automobile financing by banks. Banks are also 
soliciting loans to finance dealers' floorplanning. The outlook for 
the 1984 model year is very good, especially for mid-size to large-
size cars, which is expected to increase the domestic share of the 
market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Almost half of the purchasing agents contacted report substantial 
increases in input prices since October of last year. In the past 
three months, almost all have experienced increases in the prices or 
their major inputs. But on average, little or no further change in 
input prices is expected through the and of the year. Few 
difficulties are being experienced in getting materials and none are 
expected through the remainder of 1983. In general, materials 
inventories are at satisfactory levels. None of the respondents are 
experiencing bottlenecks due to internal shortages of labor or plant 
capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing starts have been slowed by recent increases in mortgage 
rates, and further slowing beyond the usual seasonal decline is 
expected in the months ahead. The rate of new home sales remains 
relatively strong. New home prices have increased by 5 to 10 percent 
this year. Materials prices are slightly higher than a year ago; 
although lumber prices have declined somewhat since summer. 
Materials price increases are expected to be modest the remainder of 
the year. Savings inflows into savings and loans have declined from 
their rapid first half pace and are expected to be about the same
this year as last. Rates on variable rate mortgages currently range 
from 11.5 to 12.5 percent, while fixed rate mortgages carry rates 
ranging from 13.75 to 15 percent. Interest rates are expected to 
vary around current levels with no clear trend through yearend l983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions vary widely across the Tenth District, but 
most bankers report that the summer drought has aggravated 
conditions in an already depressed farm economy. Although irrigated 
crops throughout the district produced record yields, Kansas, 
Missouri, and Oklahoma were severely affected by the summer drought 
and experienced large yield losses in fall harvested crops. All fall 
harvested crops were adversely affected by insect damage. 
Furthermore, New Mexico's milo, peanut, and cotton crops were 
reported to have been damaged by premature frost and hail. The 
planting of winter wheat is nearly complete in most district states 
and the crop is generally reported to be in good condition. But in 
isolated parts of Oklahoma, winter wheat may need to be reseeded due 
to recent flooding. Livestock prices continue to fall as marketings 
have increased due to rising feed costs and poor pasture conditions. 
No widespread liquidation of herds, however, is reported. Sales of 
farm equipment and farm inputs continue to be abnormally slow. The 
expected yearend increase in demand for farm equipment has not yet 
materialized, and probably will not. While some bankers in the Tenth 
District are optimistic about agriculture in the coming year because 
of high grain prices and fairly good yields, many others report an 
increasing number of problem loans and farm foreclosures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at Tenth District banks has increased slightly over the 
last month. Half of the respondents report an increase in commercial 
and industrial loans and a third report some increase in residential 
loans. The volume of consumer loans and agricultural loans has 
remained essentially unchanged. Almost all respondent banks have 
experienced an increase in total deposits during the last month. In 
most cases, this has been due to an increase in demand deposits. 
Conventional NOW accounts, Super-NOW accounts, MMDA's, and large 
CD's show little or no change. There has been relatively little 
response to the October 1. deregulation of small time deposits. All 
but two respondent banks indicate that they are not actively 
promoting the new, deregulated deposits. Most banks are paying about 
the same interest rates on the new deposits as they had been paying 
on the regulated deposits, and only a few banks have reduced their 
minimum deposit requirements. Consumer interest in the deregulated 
deposits has been weak, and most of the funds invested in them has 
come from the rollover of previously regulated time deposits.
