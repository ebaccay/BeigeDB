      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Southeast's economy continues to progress in spite of nagging 
difficulties in several areas. The strong dollar and high mortgage 
interest rates have retarded manufacturing employment growth and 
dampened somewhat the region's usually dynamic housing industry. 
Inadequate dealer stocks of popular automobile models and drought-
reduced crop yields have countered the general expansion. On the 
positive side, steady consumer spending continues to be the 
principal impetus behind the region's growth, followed by swelling 
defense-related payrolls, strong commercial construction and a 
rebound in housing, and improving tourism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In August, the District unemployment rate of 8 percent continued 
near the level that has prevailed since last April. Florida and 
Georgia posted unemployment rates slightly over 6 percent, 
contrasting sharply with Alabama and Mississippi at 11.2 and 11.3 
percent, respectively. Weakness in some industries has been offset 
by strength in others. Expectations for forest products have been 
revised downward as a result of slackening demand for housing and 
Canadian competition. In spite of productivity-enhancing investments 
by domestic textile and apparel firms, foreign producers continue to 
increase market share due to the strong dollar. Chemical companies 
are reacting to foreign competitive pressures by reducing production 
costs and shunning large projects that could result in excess 
capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, defense and related industries are boosting payrolls 
throughout the region. Shipyards doing Navy work, high-tech 
electronic firms and aerospace companies are all experiencing rapid 
growth. Appliance producers expect their record-breaking sales to 
continue through year-end. Oil and gas drilling activity should 
remain strong in the months ahead and show signs of increasing 
stability. Carpet manufacturers report strong sales, especially for 
commercial use.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail spending through September exceeded its year-ago level by a 
substantial margin. Retailers in the Southeast reported varying 
sales gains for August, but generally robust September sales. The 
Atlanta, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Miami metropolitan areas 
continue to outpace the nation in department store sales. Clothing, 
electronic items, and housewares are early fall best sellers.
     </p>
     <p>
      A low inventory of popular models weakened auto sales during August 
and September, according to car dealers throughout the region. 
Although August car and truck registrations in the Southeast fell 
sharply from previous months, year-to-date figures were 19 percent 
ahead of the same period last year. A major auto producer's sale in 
the region and the nation advanced 10 and 18 percent, respectively, 
in the first nine months of 1984 compared to 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction in the Southeast remained surprisingly 
buoyant through early October, particularly in central Florida and 
the Nashville area. However, single- and multifamily building 
permits are down from their year-ago levels. Builders believe that 
uncertainty about the overall state of the economy and the impact of 
government deficits, in particular, is keeping interest rates high 
and limiting housing activity. The downward creep in mortgage rates 
over the past three months has increased the popularity of fixed-
rate contracts. Mississippi's housing market got an infusion of new 
money from the state's $175-million housing bond issue designated 
for below-market-rate home mortgages. Commercial construction 
continues to surge, with office construction leading the way.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans by large commercial banks were up in September over 
August. Both commercial and residential real estate loans showed 
continued strength in August and September, while some leveling off 
occurred in business loans. Contacts attribute slower business 
lending to corporations reaching desired inventory levels and 
moderating economic growth. They also report that a large share of 
commercial real estate loans in September was for the building of 
office parks, strip shopping centers, and hotels. August mortgage 
commitments at S&amp;Ls; dropped 9 percent from July and were 11 percent 
below commitments for the same month last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Early fall activity in the tourism industry exceeded its year-
earlier performance. Visitor center registrations were up in every 
state except Tennessee. Many attractions posted double-digit 
increases in attendance. Boosted by strong business and improved 
convention travel, hotels seemed to have filled more rooms without 
lowering rates. Despite poor average daily attendance of 38,000 at 
the World's Fair, New Orleans hotels have enjoyed a 12 percent 
increase in occupancy and a $10 average increase in room rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Air traffic remains strong at most District airports. Contacts cite 
renewed travel interest following the Olympics and ideal weather as 
two main factors contributing to the overall high level of tourism 
activity in the District. The start of the school year has not 
dampened travel to the extent expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Significant changes have occurred in the prospects for soybeans and 
cotton in the region over the last month. A late summer drought in 
Georgia has caused projected soybean production to fall by 12 
million bushels for an approximately $75-million decline in revenue. 
On the other hand, weather has favored cotton production, causing 
estimated yields to approach or surpass record yields of previous 
years. The net effect of these changes is likely to be a modest 
decline in net revenue to the region's producers of major crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects a larger domestic supply 
of orange juice this year than in the 1983-84 season. The Florida 
crop is expected to be about 30 percent smaller than in 1980-81, the 
last year without freeze damage. Citrus canker has not yet been 
found in bearing groves but was discovered in a seventh Florida 
nursery.
