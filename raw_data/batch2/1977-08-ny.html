      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>

      <strong>
       August 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent comments of Directors and other business leaders in the 
Second District indicate a continuation of moderate expansion of 
business activity. At the same time, responses reveal anxieties over 
the outlook for trends in employee compensation and in profitability 
of business enterprise. Among notable current developments, activity 
in the real estate sector has quickened considerably, and at least a 
modest revival of construction activity appears to be under way. 
Consumer spending has been fairly strong despite a stifling heat 
wave and the loss of one business day due to a blackout in the New 
York City area. Nevertheless, mounting inventories have become a 
problem for some businesses. Several respondents also voiced concern 
over an apparent stiffening of wage demands and increasing pressures 
on profit margins. On the financial scene, the continuing lag in 
business loan demand in New York City has prompted several major 
banks to consider measures to seek out medium-sized regional 
customers.
      <p>
       In spite of the forced closing of stores in the New York City area 
  by the loss of electrical service in mid-July, department store 
  sales generally strengthened last month. In the view of the leading 
  retailers contacted, merchants generally recouped lost sales upon 
  reopening. Indeed, one retailer reported the sales at its city 
  branches continued to outperform its national stores. Among product 
  lines, apparel sales were strong. Merchants differed in interpreting 
  this strength, however. Some expected the stepped-up activity to 
  continue while others expected it to wane with the end of summer 
  markdowns and promotions. Sales of other consumer products also rose 
  strongly in July. Pacing the gain in consumer durables were sales of 
  air conditioners and fans, which swelled in the wake of the heat 
  wave that gripped the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       Respondents generally reported that inventory levels were building 
  up. While some retailers professed little concern over this 
  development in view of the favorable outlook for merchandising, 
  others were less sanguine. One executive of a national retail chain 
  indicated that all divisions had exceeded their budgets, tying up 
  more funds in inventories than was desired. Industrial respondents 
  also reported increases in inventories. For the most part, inventory 
  levels were not felt to be seriously out of line with shipments, 
  although some metal fabricators did regard their stocks of raw 
  materials as excessive. A director noted other scattered instances 
  of unwanted inventory build-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports on capital spending were mixed. On the one hand, several 
  upstate machine and tool makers found new orders increasing smartly. 
  One firm attributed the upward trend in orders to the strengthening 
  of the automotive sector in western New York State. In response to a 
  pickup in demand, one steel maker recently reactivated a blast 
  furnace that had been closed since late last year. Oil well drilling 
  activity has picked up, and overall capital spending in the 
  petroleum industry was expected to rise by 18 percent this year 
  compared with an earlier planned increase of 12 percent. 
  Notwithstanding these signs of strengthening demand, several 
  respondents cited a general sluggishness in shipments and orders. An 
  agricultural director reported that spending on farm implements and 
  equipment was down due to weak farm prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tentative signs of a recovery in real estate and construction appear 
  to be emerging. Recently, plans were announced to develop a new 
  office building in Manhattan without a specific corporate tenant. 
  This represented the first major speculative project in several 
  years and comes on the heels of recent reports of rising rents and 
  of a scarcity of large blocks of desirable office space. Elsewhere 
  in the District, building activity appeared to be gaining momentum 
  as well. The Buffalo Branch reported that construction contracts in 
  the Niagara Region have strengthened recently. One branch director 
  reported plans for a new shopping center on a plot that had been on 
  the market for a number of years in his rural community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Respondents displayed varying degrees of pessimism over the outlook 
  for profits. One director noted that recent weeks have seen a 
  softening in sales and prices of aluminumâ€”previously the one bright 
  spot in the otherwise depressed nonferrous metals sector. Another 
  director observed that some steel fabricators and users are likely 
  to encounter trouble passing along recent steel price hikes to their 
  customers. Part of the lackluster outlook for profits, moreover, 
  reflected concern over the growth of labor costs. Several 
  respondents perceived a stiffening in wage demands as well as 
  increased union emphasis on fringe benefits and work rule 
  concessions. A director expected brass processors to take a tough 
  stance in forthcoming labor negotiations because of poor business. 
  The chairman of a major bank foresaw wages at his bank rising by one 
  percentage point faster than prices over the balance of the year. A 
  Buffalo director felt that the increase in unemployment compensation 
  benefits recently approved by the New York State legislature would 
  add to the upward pressure on wage rates. Respondents also cited the 
  high costs of energy and of pollution control as retarding the 
  growth of profit margins.
      </p>
      <p>
       The continued sluggishness of New York City business loan demand has 
  apparently led several major banks to consider reorienting their 
  marketing strategies toward medium-sized regional customers. A few 
  New York banks already have
       <br/>
       out-of-state loan production offices and 
  several others are actively contemplating the establishment of such 
  offices. The Chairman of a major bank indicated that his bank had 
  posted a "good" gain in its share of national lending during the 
  seven weeks when its prime rate was one quarter percentage point 
  below the generally prevailing level, despite reports of price 
  cutting below posted rates by some other banks in seeking business 
  loans.
