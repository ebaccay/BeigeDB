      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 9, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        A slow and gradual increase in economic activity, along with a 
    slightly more rapid rate of inflation, is expected by marketing and 
    financial officers and corporate economists in the Tenth District. 
    Few significant long-term effects of the severely cold January 
    weather are expected for business activity. Little enthusiasm is 
    evident for the purchase of new plant and equipment. Expected 
    weakness in the farm sector is a source of concern for economic 
    activity this year in some states. Fuel cost increases may be joined 
    by food cost rises due to drought if the amount and timing of 
    precipitation received this year are not satisfactory. Although 
    business loan demand remains little changed, bankers believe that 
    loan activity has been postponed rather than eliminated.
       </p>
       <p>
        This month's Red Book survey included conversations with marketing 
    managers and financial officers of various nonfinancial 
    corporations, as well as with economists for both financial and 
    nonfinancial businesses, and at several universities. The consensus 
    view saw only a slow and gradual increase in economic activity 
    overall, with inflation perhaps becoming more worrisome than 
    appeared likely a few months ago. There was general agreement that 
    there would be few significant long-term effects on business 
    activity from the severe cold in January. Production disruptions 
    have been temporary, and are expected to be offset by a catch-up 
    later in the year. Expectations for GNP growth for the year remain 
    about the same, even if first quarter growth is low. (A large 
    interstate trucking firm noted, however, that they have experienced 
    a tremendous increase in shipping in February and early March, 
    indicating to them that "the first quarter will be stronger than 
    most people think.") Caution is still the watchword with regard to 
    capital spending. Respondents report that they see "little 
    enthusiasm" for purchases of new plant and equipment, reflecting a 
    conservative mood on business fixed investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several respondents believe that some of the problems of the severe 
    winter—especially the fuel situation—will combine with the effects 
    of the drought to affect adversely the rate of inflation this year. 
"Inevitably" higher energy prices are expected to "ripple" through 
    the economy, adversely affecting prices, income, and economic 
    activity. An Oklahoma City bank economist notes that a number of 20-year natural gas contracts are now expiring, and that sharply higher 
    fuel costs are thus almost certain this year for businesses and 
    households in Oklahoma.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business in Oklahoma generally is reported as favorable—retail 
    sales good, "housing moving well, consumer borrowing improving." 
    More uncertainty and concern were expressed for Kansas and Nebraska 
    in the year ahead, primarily because of the expected weakness in the 
    farm sector. Adverse weather effects in Colorado were reported as 
    limited to agriculture and tourism. One respondent noted that "the 
    winter sports season was ruined"; another commented that, although 
    the ski areas were hurt substantially, they represented only a small 
    part of Colorado's income total.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expected food cost increases for 1977 have recently been revised 
    upward to 3 to 5 per cent for the year, as a result of the harsh 
    winter and drought conditions over much of the country west of the 
    Mississippi. Worsening of drought conditions during this spring and 
    summer could result in even larger food cost increases. Soil 
    moisture levels in the Great Plains and western corn belt presently 
    range from 2 to 5 inches below normal. Thus, crop production in 
    these areas will depend solely upon the upcoming season's 
    precipitation, and the timing of the rainfall takes on added 
    significance. Well timed rains during periods of peak demand by 
    crops will result in minimal crop production, while the same amount 
    of moisture less well timed, will result in less than normal 
    production. Past history suggests that the precipitation required to 
    produce a normal yield for crops in these areas will occur during 3 
    to 4 years out of 10 early in the growing season and 1.5 to 3 years 
    out of 10 during critical later stages of the growing season. On 
    balance, the chances of producing normal crop yields in these areas 
    during 1977 are small, due to the low soil moisture levels that 
    presently exist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenth District banks contacted for the March Red Book indicated 
    little change in business loan demand during the month of February. 
    One bank which reported a small increase in demand attributed it to 
    participations in loans generated at correspondent banks. Another 
    banker stated that strong cash flows at businesses were holding down 
    or delaying new loans. It was also suggested that the weather had 
    temporarily depressed loan demand. None of the banks reported any 
    changes in their prime lending rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several bankers indicated that they felt that the impact of this 
    winter's severe weather had been overestimated and that loan demand 
    was probably being postponed rather than eliminated. All did express 
    greater concern about the effects of the drought. Besides direct 
    loans to farmers and
        <br/>
        agri-businesses, other areas expected to be 
    adversely affected include agricultural loan participations with 
    smaller banks, and skiing area loans. The possibility of water 
    rationing in Denver is quite strong and could result in weakening of 
    demand for single-family construction projects and for many business 
    loans.
