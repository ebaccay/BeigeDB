      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Southeast's economic climate remains generally sunny, although 
some clouds have appeared in the form of the energy program and 
persistent price increases. A broad survey finds businessmen unsure 
of the effects of the energy proposals but cautious in making major 
commitments until the uncertainty abates to some degree. 
Construction expenditures are rising rapidly, reflecting local 
government improvements, booming single-family housing markets, and 
moderate advances in nonresidential building. A special survey of 
bank lending finds strength in construction-related lending and 
growth in agricultural loans. Purchasing managers' responses to a 
survey suggest favorable developments, on the whole. However, their 
expectations of intensifying price pressures are consistent with 
other current reports. Georgia mobile home manufacturers, who looked 
to recent regulatory changes for a new lease on life, are 
encountering disappointment.
      <p>
       One word summarizes the reaction to the recently announced energy 
  policy—uncertainty. A broad cross section of businessmen just 
  surveyed expressed an almost unanimous view that capital spending 
  plans are being postponed. Utility industry sources expect the costs 
  of coal conversion and pollution control equipment to hike the cost 
  of electricity. In addition, utilities question the practicality of 
  converting small plants which might be shut down instead. This same 
  pattern may also apply to small industrial plants. Coal producers 
  also question the new policy; they perceive a conflict between the 
  energy policy, which encourages use of coal, and environmental 
  protection regulations, which increase the degree of uncertainty 
  surrounding large mining investments. Slight changes in these 
  standards can curtail the market for a mine's output, thereby making 
  a substantial investment unprofitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several District cities have recently completed or are in the midst 
  of "face-lift" operations. Seven Mississippi towns and Montgomery, 
  Alabama, have undertaken extensive renovation of their downtown 
  areas. Birmingham plans less comprehensive but large-scale city 
  improvements. Atlanta will spend several hundred million dollars on 
  airport expansion and sewage system improvements. Well over a 
  billion dollars will be spent when subway construction is included. 
  Tampa is taking steps to complete city expressways; airport 
  expansion is scheduled for Miami.
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing has been exceptionally strong in many areas of the District. 
  By all accounts, March and April brought record sales for realtors. 
  In southeast Florida, new single-family home sales have been running 
  60 percent over a year ago; in the state, new home building is up 81 
  percent. East Coast builders are selling out projects from floor 
  plans. Atlanta realtors report sales about 45 percent better than 
  last year. In the New Orleans area, single-family home buying has 
  become speculative. Unsold condominium stocks are being chipped away 
  in Florida, and Atlanta's housing supply is tightening. Some areas 
  report rapidly rising housing prices; others find almost no change 
  from last year's price levels. A negative aspect of the housing boom 
  in South Florida is a record rate of foreclosures of home mortgage 
  loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonresidential construction activity has made solid but 
  unspectacular advances. Louisiana and Mississippi have picked up 
  several new industrial expansion contracts. Though a large part of 
  new capital spending is going for expansion rather than new plants, 
  several large new facilities have been announced.
      </p>
      <p>
       A survey of commercial bank lending activity in the Southeast 
  detected moderate to substantial increases in loan demand. Increased 
  demand is almost universally reported on the part of construction 
  contractors, builders, and their suppliers. Coffee producers, 
  importers, and dealers also have increased their borrowing. Gains 
  have been noted in lending to hard goods manufacturers; there is 
  little sign of an increase for soft goods producers. These borrowing 
  trends correspond to recent retail sales developments. Lending has 
  also increased rapidly for oil producers and service firms in 
  coastal areas. Agricultural lending has increased, reflecting rising 
  land values, favorable prospects for 1977 crops, especially 
  soybeans, and new equipment demands caused by changes in crop mix. 
  Some "carry-over" loans for rice and sugar producers are also being 
  made.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, the resurgence in loan activity reflects the effects of 
  inflation in addition to a normal expansion in the need for working 
  capital, accounts receivable, and inventory financing. Some loans 
  are being used for equipment purchases, but there is little evidence 
  of lending for plant expansion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In coming months, most banks foresee a continuing moderate to strong 
  increase in loan demand; particular strength in construction-related 
  lending is expected to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life insurance companies reportedly are holding an abundance of 
  funds for investment. Because they expect rising interest rates, 
  they are concentrating their lending almost entirely in the short- 
  and intermediate-maturity ranges. Some companies are, for the first 
  time, entering into warehouse financing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Favorable economic prospects appear in an April survey of 
  southeastern purchasing managers. Order backlogs for their products 
  are growing; they also note a stretch-out of lead times on goods 
  they order. Although no noticeable change in the pace of deliveries 
  has occurred in the past four months, some slowing is foreseen 
  during the next quarter. During the past three months, there has 
  been a steady increase in the proportion reporting higher prices. 
  More pervasive price increases are anticipated in coming months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rapid growth in inventories is not expected. Changes in raw 
  materials stocks were limited in the three months preceding April, 
  when a strong buildup was reported. However, during the next 
  quarter, a return to stability in raw materials is foreseen. The 
  growth rate of finished goods stocks flattened last month after 
  three months of steady increases; slower growth is expected to 
  continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proportion of respondents reporting sales increases has risen 
  steadily for four months; almost three quarters foresee continued 
  gains. Profits had been stable prior to an increase in April. This 
  recent improvement is expected to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       In price developments, there presently exists an inventory overhang 
  of about one year's supply of copper and a six-month supply of 
  nickel. Steel producers report a demand increase related to a pickup 
  in heavy construction. Retailers note price increases for 
  appliances, leather goods, and "home fashion" merchandise. Furniture 
  prices were recently boosted 25 percent by two manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers of mobile homes in Georgia report that a recent easing 
  of restrictions on highway transportation has brought no noticeable 
  improvement in their business. Shipments remain quite weak, despite 
  the enactment of legislation permitting 14-foot wide mobile homes to 
  be transported over Georgia highways. Additional plant closings 
  appear likely to occur.
