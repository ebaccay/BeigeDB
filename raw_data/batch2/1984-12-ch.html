       December 5, 1984
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total business activity in the Seventh District has been about 
stable since early this year, having flattened earlier than in the 
nation. Most District reports suggest relative stability in the 
months ahead, but concern has been growing that a general 
deterioration is underway. Auto production has returned to a high 
level, but only slightly above last year. Steel output has improved 
since late September, but remains well below the first half rate, 
and below break-even levels. Machine tool orders are up, mainly from 
the auto industry. Heavy construction and farm equipment makers, 
faced with weak markets, are selling off units and closing marginal 
plants. Cutbacks are occurring in the important health care 
industry, reversing a long-term expansion. Container loadings on 
flat cars, which had slowed earlier in the year, slipped 
significantly in November. Demand for most mechanical capital 
equipment remains weak. Sales of heavy trucks and trailers have 
softened recently from high levels. However, surveys show sizable 
additions to capital outlays next year by the auto and steel 
industries. Many lines of seasonal retail merchandise are reported 
moving well, but the 2-year boom in consumer hardgoods apparently 
has run its course. Retail inventories are viewed as excessive, 
encouraging price markdowns. Recent declines in paperboard demand 
partly reflect reduced orders for general merchandise. Residential 
construction continues to weaken, while nonresidential construction 
is expanding. District farmers, many in distress because of heavy 
debts and weak prices, continue to restrict purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Recession Fears
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The plateau in District activity since last spring, coupled with 
recent declines in factory orders and freight movements, raises the 
question of an imminent recession. Pressures to reduce or hold down 
inventories are intense. Our contacts with industries important in 
the District generally expect relative stability during the rest of 
1984 and early 1985—but no precipitous decline. However, some 
company analysts are warning their managements that the situation is 
fragile and that a general decline, rather than renewed expansion, 
is the more likely development.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto makers are planning production at a high level through next 
year's first quarter, but with only small gains from year-earlier 
levels. Weaker auto sales in recent months reflect shortages of 
popular models. Strikes, unrelated parts shortages, and import 
quotas have limited supplies. Large "availability" premiums are 
reported on some models, recalling the situation after World War II.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel production in the Chicago and Detroit areas has improved 
somewhat from September lows associated with heavy imports, the auto 
strike, and inventory cutting. However, output remains well below 
the first half pace. Increasingly. imports have penetrated Midwest 
markets. usually through steel service centers, often owned by 
foreign steel producers. Fourth quarter shipments are expected to be 
about even with the third quarter, in contrast with a normal 
seasonal rise. Local analysts have lowered estimates for total U.S. 
mill shipments to around 74 million tons. Next year's shipments are 
expected to be helped by the Administration's import restraint plan, 
retroactive to October 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many capital goods manufacturers with production facilities in the 
region are restructuring and downsizing operations. A major heavy 
construction equipment producer plans to close five plants. Other 
firms are consolidating divisions and laying off workers. Producers 
of most mechanical capital goods face intense competition from 
abroad in U.S. and foreign markets. Some farm equipment suppliers, 
long-time leaders in their fields, are selling or writing off money-
losing divisions. Farm equipment sales, weak last year, have 
softened further. Some other types of capital goods, for oil and gas 
development, materials handling, food processing, and railroad 
transportation, have improved but from low levels. Easing of orders 
for heavy trucks and trailers, in strong demand earlier in the year, 
is expected to reverse when regulations on size limits and routes 
are clarified. Surveys show further growth in capital spending next 
year, with sizable increases in outlays by the auto industry and 
steel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise sales in the District have been mixed in recent 
months, with good gains for some discounters and declines, 
seasonally adjusted, at other chains. Large appliance sales are at 
record levels, but the vigorous two-year expansion has lost 
momentum. Furniture demand also has slowed. However, small "traffic" 
appliances, toys, and other gift items are moving well, raising 
hopes for a good Christmas selling season. Consumer attitudes, 
measured in the region, remain optimistic. Inventories are widely 
viewed as excessive. Markdowns are frequent. Some general 
merchandise chains have cut back orders. This helps account for an 
easing in paperboard demand, after an 18-month expansion. Prices on 
average are about stable and little changed from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New housing construction in the region has weakened since about 
midyear. Despite sizable declines in mortgage interest rates since 
then, area lenders report softer loan volume. However, with lower 
rates, the outlook is somewhat improved. Fixed-rate loans are 
accounting for larger share of the total, due to higher standards on 
adjustable rate mortgages and a narrower "spread" between rates on 
fixed- and adjustable-rate loans. Permits for residential 
construction in District states are 68 percent above the low 2 years 
ago for nine months, but 58 percent below the peak in 1977. 
Nationwide, permits are up 80 percent from 2 years ago and only 8 
percent below the 1978 high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Office and retail construction continues strong in the Chicago area. 
Total nonresidential building contracts this year in the five 
District states (F.W. Dodge data, in square feet) are up nearly 60 
percent from 2 years ago, but still more than 40 percent below good 
levels of the 1970s. The backlog of public works projects is 
growing—mainly highways, bridges, water and sewer. The amount of 
road and bridge work next year will depend on resolution of a 
political impasse in Congress which is delaying release of 
accumulated funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Following rain-caused delays, the District farm harvest is finally 
drawing to a close. Corn and soybean prices remain well below year-earlier levels, keeping farm income low. Despite average domestic 
harvests, record crop production world-wide is forecast for 1984-85. 
This may dampen the expected recovery in U.S. grain exports. Meat 
output is down from last year, but above earlier forecasts, largely 
reflecting increased broiler output. Milk production is running 
about 4 percent under last year, partly because of federal payments 
to farmers to cut output. The milk surplus also has been trimmed by 
higher consumption. Dairy farmers apparently are poised to expand 
output when the paid diversion program ends in March.
