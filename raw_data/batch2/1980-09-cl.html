      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 9, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents in the Fourth District expect that further 
weakening in capital spending and sluggishness in consumer spending 
will contribute to another slight decline in overall economic 
activity this quarter and next. Recent improvements in consumer 
spending and housing, however, have raised the possibility that real 
economic activity will increase in the fourth quarter, according to 
some officials. Recent strength in real retail sales may have been 
supported in part by a slim return to credit card usage, but most 
retailers and bankers doubt that the consumer sector will provide 
much impetus to a recovery until mid-1981. Respondents tend to be 
skeptical over reduced consumer inflation rates in August, and are 
concerned about a return to double-digit rates in 1981. Savings 
flows have improved slightly, but lenders anticipate that recent 
marginal gains in mortgage lending activity are likely to be 
dampened as mortgage rates in the District have firmed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although most respondents still expect a trough in the 
fourth quarter, several expect real GNP growth in the fourth quarter 
to be zero or slightly positive. Most still expect a peak-to-trough 
decline in real GNP of about 3%. A bank economist cites a revival in 
growth of consumer debt, the stabilizing of car sales, and the 
bottoming out of housing as the first signs of recovery. Negative 
factors most often mentioned that lessen prospects for a prompt 
recovery include a continued weakening of capital goods with no 
bottom yet in sight, rising interest rates and prices that may hold 
down the demand for consumer durables and housing, and a combination 
of low savings rates and high debt levels going into the recovery 
that will limit the ability of consumers to increase spending 
substantially. Weakening in capital goods is likely to continue into 
next year and, according to a durable-goods producer, declines in 
the capital-goods sector will partly offset strengthening in 
consumer goods and housing. A producer of household goods expects 
that it will be the end of 1981 before the economy gets back to pre- 
recession levels of real economic activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The steel industry has experienced a reversal from the steep 
decline in orders that began in March, and operating rates in the 
industry should rise gradually from the 50-55 percent rates 
experienced in June and July. However, the 20-25 percent increase in 
new orders in late July and August was still 20 percent below 
February and March levels, according to an industry economist. 
Although the source of the order strength is widespread, much of the 
improvement is due to an ending of inventory liquidation. Demand 
related to oil field equipment remains strong, but demand from 
machine tools and construction customers is easing and cancellations 
are reported from railroads. However, a better-than-expected upturn 
in auto sales this fall may produce a rush to re-stock steel 
inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto sales in July were higher than the underlying rate of 
demand (9 million units), according to an industry economist, but 
sales for August and September should be below that rate (8.4 and 
8.6 million units, respectively). While some purchases may have been 
advanced by dealer and producer promotions, many buyers are thought 
to be awaiting the 1981 models. The price of many of the new models 
will be above imports, but an auto supplier notes that fuel-
efficiency should be comparable and domestic models will be larger, 
safer, and more stylish than imports. A steel economist reports that 
orders from the auto industry indicate a conservative production 
schedule, averaging 9.9 million units for 1981. A manager of several 
area dealerships expects no strong increase in auto sales until next 
March and has reduced his inventories and staff to the lowest levels 
of any time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in August rose again in real terms 
particularly for soft-goods, but remain weak for furniture and 
appliances. An economist in the appliance industry reports that 
orders continue to be weak, but declines have moderated, with orders 
10 percent below last year in real terms. Several bankers report 
some increase in credit card usage in August by existing 
cardholders. However, retailers report cash sales up, but credit 
card usage has not shown any improvement since the decline in April. 
An economist for a major retail chain believes that a prerequisite 
for a sustained consumer recovery is increased credit card usage, 
because incomes will remain depressed by further price increases.
Most producers and retailers expect a slower-than-usual recovery in 
consumer spending. They assume a tax cut and increased small car 
availability that should improve retail sales by early 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite moderation in consumer prices in August because 
of lower mortgage rates, most respondents expect upward price 
pressures through the first half of 1981. They view the underlying 
rate of inflation to remain about 9-10 percent. An auto economist 
expects consumer prices to rise from 8.1 percent in the third 
quarter to 12.7 percent in the first quarter of 1981, before 
dropping back to 8.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1981. Food 
prices are a major factor in the expected acceleration in the 
inflation rate, but several economists express hope that tight 
monetary control would reduce the rate further in 1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Loan Demand
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan activity in the District remains weak. Consumer 
loans continue to decline in most areas and business loans are still 
on a low plateau. An area banker expects some seasonal pickup in 
consumer loans in the fall, but notes that consumers seem more 
concerned about paying back loans. However, an auto dealer is 
encouraged by the increasing interest of banks in financing auto 
sales. Business lending remains soft, but banks are now more active 
in the commercial paper market. A durable-goods producer states that 
many firms are more liquid now since inventories have been reduced. 
Loan demand will continue to be weak in early 1981 because of better 
cash flow during the early stage of recovery, according to a bank
economist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings flows improved slightly among banks and S&amp;Ls, especially in 
passbook accounts. Several respondents note a tendency among 
customers to prefer liquidity over higher paying time deposits with 
withdrawal penalties, which typically occurs when times are 
uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mortgage Lending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mortgage activity, especially loan commitments, 
picked up in July and early August, but loans are still 30 to 40 
percent below year-earlier levels. Although builders were never too 
optimistic about a recovery in housing, according to an economist 
with a regional FHLB in this District, rising mortgage rates could 
postpone a recovery until 1981. Housing starts may be erratic over 
the balance of this year, and average about a 1.3 million rate 
monthly. Mortgage rates rose about 1 percentage point last month 
according to an S&amp;L official, because lenders are more sensitive to 
rate changes in secondary markets and to cost of funds. Although 
most respondents expect a downward trend in mortgage rates because 
of improved deposit flows, current rates offered by banks are 
generally at 13 percent plus points, while S&amp;Ls offer rates that 
range from 12-1/4 to 12-3/4 percent plus points.
