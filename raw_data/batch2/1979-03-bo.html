      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business conditions are very strong, according to directors and 
other respondents in the First District. There are no signs of a 
slowdown. A few businessmen are concerned that the present situation 
looks ominously "boomy"; however, most have been pleasantly 
surprised by the economy's strength. Manufacturers report that new 
orders remain strong; there has been no slackening in the order 
rate. Capacity utilization is high. Lead times for materials have 
lengthened markedly in the past couple of months. Retailers seem 
generally content; inventories have been reduced to more 
satisfactory levels. In the banking sector, loan demand is quite 
strong for this time of year. Borrowers do not appear to be deterred 
by current high interest rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        New orders are still coming in strongly for New England 
manufacturers. Capacity utilization is high. The prosperity appears 
to be widespread: among the products said to be doing well are 
electrical appliances, electronic components, automotive products, 
machine tools, aircraft parts, and ski apparel. A large producer of 
non-electrical machinery reports that all divisions of the company 
are doing well and there are enough orders for heavy capital 
equipment to last through 1979. A tire manufacturer says that they 
are operating flat out, although this is at least partly in 
expectation of a strike by the United Rubber Workers in late April. 
The major change from previous months' reports is a substantial 
increase in the number of firms mentioning longer delivery times for 
materials and components. Most companies have observed some 
lengthening in lead times and several claim that the change over the 
last couple of months has been very marked. Electronic components, 
aluminum and steel were identified as particular problem areas. 
Several companies mentioned unusually sharp increases in the prices 
of petrochemical and glass products and one firm was very concerned 
about recent increases in trucking rates. Labor shortages seem to be 
becoming both more widespread and more critical. Difficulties in 
obtaining engineers, especially electrical engineers, were mentioned 
by most large firms. There is also a severe shortage of computer 
software people and, in some areas, skilled assembly workers. The 
head of one large firm stated that the wage guidelines, with which 
they must comply because of large defense contracts, are seriously 
hindering their ability to recruit needed workers. The 
representative of the tire manufacturer pointed out that, while his 
company has accepted the guidelines in principle, the URW with whom 
the firm is negotiating, has said that they are not even considering 
them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers seem generally content. In northern New England those 
associated with the resort industry are doing particularly well. The 
head of a large department store chain thinks that there has been a 
slight easing; however, he also believes that the retail inventory 
situation has improved substantially from what it was in the fall.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the banking sector, loan demand is healthy, although there has 
been a seasonal slackening in demand in northern New England. This 
easing has occurred primarily in the consumer area; commercial 
demand has held up well. Despite the season, northern New England 
banks are almost completely loaned up. One respondent is planning on 
borrowing in the secondary market; because of the cost of these 
funds he will be charging 11 percent or more for mortgages. In 
Vermont the usury ceiling, which has been at 9-3/4 percent, is going 
to be lifted. In southern New England, the head of one large bank 
reports that loan demand in all categories is good and the outlook 
for the rest of 1979 is promising. Banking directors do not think 
that today's high interest rates are a serious deterrent to 
borrowing. Bankers in northern New England expect mortgage demand to 
pick up as soon as the weather turns warm. A survey by one bank of 
small businesses in New England reveals that in February most such 
firms did not think that high interest rates had seriously affected 
either their profit position or cash flow. None had been deterred 
from seeking funds by high interest rates and very few had 
encountered difficulty in acquiring financing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein and Houthakker were available for comment this 
month. Both are reluctant to attach great significance to the recent 
marked decline in the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates, 
independently citing the tremendous growth of money market mutual 
funds as an offsetting influence. Both agree that the real economy 
is currently quite strong, although Houthakker is reluctant to 
follow Eckstein in labeling this a "boom" period. For these reasons, 
neither is prepared to advocate an easing of Federal Reserve policy 
at the present time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Eckstein is concerned about the effect of the strong 
economy on the short-term expectations of businessmen. His 
impression is that the January data revealing a sharp deterioration 
in vendor performance and large increases in durable goods orders 
and manufacturing inventories have been interpreted by the business 
community as signs that the economy is now in a full-fledged boom. 
Fearing that business will react to this by attempting to build 
inventories, Eckstein feels that the situation is becoming 
uncomfortably similar to that which prevailed at the end of 1973. In 
his view, if a big inventory correction next year is to be avoided, 
the Fed must act now to convince businessmen that it does not intend 
to permit the boom to continue. While he would prefer to see this 
done without a general increase in interest rates, for example by 
rhetoric or a discount rate hike, Eckstein is not averse to raising 
market rates if milder steps fail.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Houthakker is concerned about the implications of the 
strong economy for the inflation outlook. Although he feels that the 
current low savings rate provides evidence that some of the recent 
acceleration in inflation is due to excess demand, he expects this 
to become a less important source of difficulty in the future as 
high real interest rates induce a return to normal saving behavior. 
Potentially more important in Houthakker's view is the dramatic 
increase in commodity prices. Since this price series has in the 
past been a good "leading indicator" of the wholesale price index, 
Houthakker expects continued high inflation from this source for the 
next few months at least. On the positive side, Houthakker thinks 
that spot oil prices will drift down as Iranian production 
increases, and that the stable dollar should lead to a slowdown in 
the upward trend of import prices.
