      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of the economic recovery in the Southwest continues to pick 
up. Although the unemployment rate for the District states edged up 
to 5.8 percent, total employment continues to climb. Drilling 
activity in Texas is at a 15-year high, and production of oil field 
equipment is on the upswing. New orders for apparel have picked up, 
and output is beginning to rise. Total loans at the District banks 
have decreased since January because of a moderate decline in 
business loans. Real estate and consumer loans, however, have 
continued to advance sharply. Steadily increasing costs of 
production are pushing up agricultural loans.
      <p>
       Drilling activity in Texas continues to rise, but production and 
  proved reserves of oil and gas continue to decline. Most of the 
  drilling is in low-yield, shallow fields. The supply of idle 
  drilling rigs has dropped to a comparatively low level, but there 
  are apparently no serious equipment shortages. The number of rotary 
  rigs in operation is at the highest level in over 15 years and is 
  nearly a fourth above the level a year ago. Few onshore rigs are 
  idle, and they are mostly deep-well rigs located largely in West 
  Texas. There is strong demand for offshore rigs used in shallow 
  water, while many deep-water rigs remain idle. Demand for drilling 
  crews is increasing, but there are no indications of a shortage of 
  labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reflecting the higher level of equipment utilization, demand for oil 
  field equipment is climbing steadily. Oil field equipment 
  manufacturers expect a strong improvement in sales in 1977 over last 
  year. Better terms of financing, as well as increased business, have 
  spurred many drilling contractors to order new equipment and retire 
  older machinery. With the upswing in production of machinery and 
  drill pipe, prices for equipment have also begun to rise sharply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparel production, which suffered a sharp downturn last year, is 
  starting to show signs of improvement, as indicated by a pickup in 
  new orders. Manufacturers of men's clothing indicate sales this year 
  will be greater than in 1976, but they continue to be very cautious 
  in making sales forecasts. According to observers at a recent 
  showing of women's and children's early fall merchandise at the 
  Dallas Apparel Mart, demand was strong for sweaters and coats. 
  Inventories of these items were drawn down sharply last winter, and 
  retailers appeared to be building ample stocks in anticipation of 
  another cold winter. That buying pattern leads many observers to 
  believe new orders for other winter garments will be up 
  substantially during the next big market in May. Manufacturers 
  estimated that retail prices for fall merchandise would be 10 to 12 
  percent higher than last year, and those estimates did not take into 
  account higher labor costs that would stem from an increase in the 
  minimum wage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total loan demand at District member banks has declined since 
  January. Virtually all of the decrease has been in business loans, 
  and bankers expect only a small to moderate pickup in business loan 
  demand this year. Real estate loans continue to strengthen with 
  further recovery in the construction industry. Consumer loan demand 
  is expanding sharply, reflecting rising consumer confidence. Auto 
  loans are particularly strong, and credit card usage is also up. One 
  bank in Dallas reports the level of credit card debt outstanding has 
  remained near the Christmas peak, and normally it would have run 
  down by $8-9 million by this time of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inflow of time and savings deposit funds to District banks 
  remains strong, and bankers have not attempted to slow the inflow by 
  reducing interest rates paid or changing other terms on time 
  deposits. Because the supply of loanable funds continues to grow, 
  more banks are becoming more aggressive in seeking new loans or loan 
  participations. Moreover, banks are increasing their holdings of 
  various types of government securities—especially municipal bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agribankers indicate that reduced cash flows from low grain and 
  cattle prices, coupled with the rising costs of production, continue 
  to adversely affect agricultural credit conditions in the Southwest. 
  At current grain prices and with "normal" weather, only the most 
  cost-efficient farmers will make a profit this year. Drought 
  conditions and rising costs of energy are increasing irrigation 
  costs in the grain-producing northern High Plains of Texas and are 
  leading to greater demand for operating credit. Conversely, cotton 
  and soybean producers in the southern High Plains are faring much 
  better. They experienced a good year in 1976 and are reported 
  currently to be increasing purchases of machinery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reduced cash flows and larger lines of operating credit have caused 
  loan-to-deposit ratios at rural banks to rise. Renewals and 
  extensions of loans are also increasing, particularly in the 
  intensified wheat-producing areas of the High and Rolling Plains of 
  Texas. The supply of loanable funds to meet credit needs has 
  declined somewhat in the area mainly reflecting low wheat prices. 
  Bankers continue to maintain firm collateral requirements and are 
  taking a closer look at the credit worthiness of their customers. 
  The number of referrals to nonbank credit agencies is rising 
  sharply. Although the supply of loanable funds has declined, few 
  member banks have used the seasonal borrowing privilege at the 
  discount window this year, as the discount rate still remains well 
  above short-term interest rates.
