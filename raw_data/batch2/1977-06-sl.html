      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 15, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity continues to improve in the Eighth District 
according to area businessmen. Consumer spending has been mixed in 
the past two months with sales of consumer durables, particularly 
automobiles, quite strong and department store sales relatively 
weak. Manufacturing activity continues to register gains in sales 
and orders over a wide range of industries. The home building 
industry is especially strong in the District with gains in both 
single- and multi-family units. Loan demand at financial 
institutions has been sparked by demand for homes, land, and 
consumer durables, while commercial and industrial loans remain 
sluggish at larger banks. Sharply rising farm land prices have 
outpaced the growth of farm income in the past two years. Several 
real estate observers are questioning whether land sold at current 
prices can be farmed profitably. Continuing dry weather conditions 
are making crop prospects for the current year more uncertain than 
usual.
      <p>
       Sales of consumer durables, such as appliances and cars, generally 
  continue upward in the District. In some areas, small cars are 
  reported to be outselling larger models. On the other hand, 
  department store sales have been rather sluggish. Major department 
  stores in the St. Louis area experienced only small gains in May 
  over a year ago, not enough to offset price increases, hence real 
  sales have declined. Reports from Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, 
  and Kentucky tend to reinforce this general pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturing industries are moving closer to capacity as orders 
  continue to rise. Representatives of the chemical industry report 
  continuing strong sales over a large number of product lines. 
  Heating and air conditioning equipment sales for the home building 
  industry continue to flourish. Firms in this industry expect 
  internal capacity problems in sheet metal fabricating to develop 
  within the next two years. Welding and cutting equipment firms also 
  report strong demand for their products and one such firm recently 
  started scheduling overtime. Demand for commercial aircraft from 
  domestic sources is increasing, but weakness in foreign sales is 
  expected to offset these gains this year. Current orders, however, 
  indicate that commercial aircraft manufacturing will increase 
  substantially next year, perhaps as much as 35 percent. A major 
  appliance plant in the District reports strong orders so far this 
  year and plans to add 1,200 workers to their work force within two 
  months. Strong sales gains were also reported by tools and 
  automobile parts manufacturers. On the negative side, a local steel 
  processing firm, has announced that several small plants will be 
  closed throughout the country. This move is said to be linked to the 
  sluggish pickup in overall plant and equipment spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Home building remains one of the strongest sectors of the District 
  economy. Current sales for single-family dwellings now exceeds the 
  ability of builders to deliver in the near term, thus backlogs are 
  lengthening. One of the chief bottlenecks in expanding housing 
  production is said to be the availability of skilled carpenters. As 
  a result, overtime is a fairly common practice in the industry. 
  Overtime was made more attractive in the St. Louis region as a 
  result of the reduction from double-time to time-and-a-half overtime 
  pay in the recently negotiated wage contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multi-family housing construction is also making significant gains 
  in some parts of the District. Surveys conducted in the St. Louis 
  area indicate apartment occupancy is now in the very high 95 to 99 
  percent range. New projects in the St. Louis area so far this year 
  already exceed the entire production of last year. About one-half of 
  these units involve government programs. In contrast, multi-family 
  construction in the Memphis area is still quite low, although 
  reports indicate that the occupancy rate is increasing steadily. 
  Some signs of a revival of construction in the commercial area is 
  also being detected. One St. Louis area observer noted that while 
  few major projects are underway, numerous small projects are having 
  a significant impact. A contractor in the southern portion of the 
  District reports a number of new industrial projects as well as a 
  number of new shopping centers are in the planning stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Growth of savings deposits at thrift institutions has slowed from 
  the high rates of a year ago but is still reported to be fairly 
  strong. Savings deposits at commercial banks have slowed noticeably 
  in the past several weeks. Liquidity, however, remains relatively 
  high and loans are still readily available. Loan demand is strongest 
  for homes, land, and consumer durables. On the other hand, business 
  loan demand at large commercial banks has continued sluggish in 
  recent weeks. Mortgage interest rates have remained generally 
  unchanged in the past month in the St. Louis area, while bank 
  lending rates have gone up with national rate increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dry soil conditions are again plaguing some areas of the District. 
  After substantial rainfall in the early spring, there has been 
  little precipitation for several weeks in some areas. Most of the 
  spring planting has been completed, but plantings in some parts of 
  the District have been postponed due to lack of sufficient moisture 
  to germinate seed. The recent dry weather, combined with last year's 
  subnormal rainfall in the eastern portion of the District, makes 
  this year's crop prospects very much subject to timely rainfall 
  during the growing season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Land prices have risen rapidly in the past two years in the 
  District, despite little or no net income gains in farming. Reports 
  from the Delta portions of Arkansas and Mississippi indicate land 
  prices have increased about 30 percent in the past year alone. 
  Bankers say these large increases are difficult to justify on the 
  basis of current returns in agriculture. Reports indicate that the 
  purchasers are largely existing farmers plus some foreign buyers.
