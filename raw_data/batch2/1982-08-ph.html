      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District in August fail to give any clear 
indication of the direction the local economy is taking. 
Manufacturing remains weak, retail sales have dropped, and business 
loan demand has tapered off in recent weeks. Area farmers are facing 
mixed crop yields, and tourist business, although good in some 
areas, is also spotty.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook varies by industry. Despite persistent sluggishness in 
the industrial sector, manufacturers continue to look for an 
imminent recovery. Retailers also anticipate a pickup, but one that 
is mostly seasonal in nature. Bankers foresee further cuts in 
interest rates, but softening loan demand, as borrowers turn to 
long-term capital markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District crop yields will be mixed this year, according to 
area agriculture officials. While the New Jersey tomato crop is 
strong, and corn and soybeans are also doing well, several of the 
area's major farm products will not turn in a good 1982 showing. 
Most vegetable farmers, for example, will have a small harvest this 
year, owing to record rainfall in early spring which delayed 
plantings. That wet weather also forced hay growers to put off their 
first cutting. Hence, they will get only two or three cuttings this 
year, rather than the usual four. A severe coldsnap in early spring 
damaged the New Jersey peach crop. Peach volume is currently running 
17 percent below that of a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area farm prices are generally strong, especially for those 
commodities in short supply, but farmers may not get to keep much of 
the money they take in. Rising distribution and production costs, 
especially interest expense, will keep the lid on farm income again 
this year. An official of the Pennsylvania Farmers Association 
predicts that total interest expense for farmers in 1982 will exceed 
the 1981 mark of 13.6 percent of gross income.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers responding to the August Business Outlook Survey 
report that local industrial activity has stabilized this month 
following a seasonal drop in July. This month's results point to 
continued weakness in the industrial sector, which seems to have 
bottomed out in February but has yet to show any real sign of 
recovery. Both new orders and shipments dropped sharply under 
seasonal pressure in July. In August, new orders have declined 
slightly, while shipments have held steady, causing further 
shrinkage of backlogs at area manufacturing plants. Reports of 
inventory liquidation are still widespread and reductions in 
payrolls and average workweek length persist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the continuing slump in industrial activity, more Outlook 
Survey respondents are optimistic about future business conditions 
than in June or July. Over three-quarters of participating 
manufacturers now expect business conditions to improve within six 
months, and there are widespread predictions of growing strength in 
both new orders and shipments. In response, local manufacturers plan 
to expand payrolls and working hours, but projections of weakness in 
both inventory growth and capital spending raise doubts about the 
real strength of the recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prevailing sluggishness in local manufacturing continues to have 
a stabilizing effect on industrial prices. At over 80 percent of 
participating firms, neither input nor finished goods prices have 
changed since July. Looking ahead, however, forecasts of continued 
stability in prices, apparent in the June and July surveys, have 
diminished somewhat this month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As predicted by many retailers, neither the July tax cut nor the 
Social Security increase has had a significant effect on consumer 
purchases to date. In fact, sales have slipped considerably over the 
last few weeks, and can now be described only as mixed. Reports of 
current sales volume range from 5 percent below to slightly ahead of 
a year ago, but sales are generally below retailer's expectations. 
Merchants simply blame the lingering general economic slump for 
current lackluster consumer performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, retail contacts see sales improving by year-end, and 
hope for a reasonably good holiday season. They concede, however, 
that even with a strong finish, they'll be lucky to break even on 
the year. They remain very cautious about inventory building, and 
have no plans to add to current stocks until a turnaround in sales 
is obvious. Presently, department store inventories are down from 
August '81 by as much as 10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers say lending activity is mixed in August. The 
recent decline in interest rates has apparently attracted some 
borrowers to long-term debt instruments and put a damper on the 
demand for business loans. Reports of C &amp; I loan activity range from 
slightly off to 7 percent ahead of a year ago, not disastrous but 
definitely less robust than earlier this year. At the same time, 
however, bankers have opened the door to consumer loans, and retail 
borrowing, down by as much as 15 percent just six weeks ago, is now 
running only about 1 percent under August 1981 levels. The outlook 
for lending reflects a continuation of current developments. Bankers 
expect that, as the economic picture shapes up, business borrowing 
will drop further as stress borrowing fades. Further growth of 
consumer loans is projected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate has been lowered to 15 percent at Third District 
banks contacted this month, and local bankers are forecasting 
further cuts. Estimates of a trough in interest rates center around 
early- to mid-fall. At that time, bankers expect rates to firm up 
and begin to climb as business investment picks up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Time deposits at Third District banks have maintained the surprising 
firmness that has been evident throughout 1982, and are now running 
as high as 13 percent above a year ago. Demand deposits are still 
running about 3 to 4 percent behind on a year-over-year basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourist Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Businessmen at Third District vacation spots give mixed reviews of 
the season so far. Seashore businessowners say early summer was 
disastrous, with record rainfalls noted in many areas. Midsummer 
business has been a bit better, but tight budgets have led many 
families to shorten their vacations, resort to daytripping, and 
generally pare expenditures. The strength of the U.S. dollar, vis-a-
vis the Canadian dollar, has been a particular problem in South 
Jersey, a favorite vacation spot of Canadians. Overall, seashore 
business is currently holding at about last year's level, but a boom 
in late summer will be necessary to offset early season losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mountain vacation spots in Pennsylvania, on the other hand, are 
having a good year. After a strong winter season, summer tourist 
trade in the Poconos is now well above most expectations. To be 
sure, the average stay at mountain resorts is shorter this year than 
last, but late summer and fall business is projected to be strong. 
Advance reservations are running 10 to 14 percent over a year ago, 
which should give Pocono businesses a good boost and help them 
finish well ahead of 1981.
