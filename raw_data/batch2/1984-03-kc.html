      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Tenth District continues to improve in 
early 1984. Price increases, bath at retail and for materials 
inputs, remain moderate. Inventories of both retail goods and 
industrial inputs are generally regarded as satisfactory. Input 
availability problems are only spotty and are not regarded as 
serious. Housing starts are expected to remain strong throughout the 
year, as are both the demand for mortgage funds and the inflow of 
savings to savings and loan associations. Loan demand at commercial 
banks has recently increased somewhat, with lending rates generally 
unchanged. Adequate credit for spring planting appears to be 
available to creditworthy farm borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Virtually all retailers surveyed report that sales for 1984 continue 
to be up over the same period last year. Appliances and electronic 
merchandise have been selling particularly well, while most 
categories of apparel have been somewhat weak. In general, most 
respondents are holding to normal seasonal patterns for clearance 
sales and most are satisfied with present inventory levels. Although 
the majority of respondents are optimistic about sales for the 
remainder of the year, many indicate a cautious approach to 
inventory accumulation for the second half of 1984. Wholesale and 
retail prices have remained flat over the past three months, and few 
retailers expect any significant price increases in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All automobile dealers associations contacted report that sales are 
higher in 1984 than in the same period last year. Financing is 
readily available for all dealers. Potential buyers are able to get 
loans, most of which are made directly with banks. Inventories of 
domestic cars are either being maintained or replenished as the 
recent surge in demand continues. Stocks of imported autos are low, 
and many dealers are making a high percentage of orders after sales. 
All respondents expect sales growth to be maintained or to 
accelerate this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents in the Tenth District report stable to moderately 
increasing input prices during the past year, generally in the zero 
to 10 percent range. In the past three months input prices have been 
stable to 6 percent higher. Half of the agents foresee stable prices 
for the remainder of 1984 while the rest are predicting increases of 
5 to 10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some minor difficulties are being experienced in getting materials, 
as some firms seek to expand inventories. However, troubles are 
spotty with most agents anticipating only slight problems for the 
remainder of the year. Materials inventory levels are generally 
satisfactory with little change expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home builders report that housing starts in January and February 
exceeded year ago levels, especially in the multifamily category. 
Starts are expected to remain strong throughout 1984. Sales of new 
homes have changed little from last year, while inventories have 
increased. Prices of new homes range from unchanged to 8 percent 
higher than a year ago. Home builders report that construction 
materials are general readily available at steady or moderately 
increasing prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings inflows at savings and loan associations are up from last 
year and respondents expect inflows will continue to increase 
through the balance of 1984. Virtually all institutions surveyed 
report a strong demand for mortgage funds, which is expected to 
continue. Mortgage interest rates are steady and are expected to 
remain unchanged to down slightly through 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Tenth District banks surveyed experienced some increase in loan 
demand in February. Commercial and industrial loans and consumer 
loans showed the strongest growth. Deposits rose moderately or 
remained unchanged at slightly more than half of the surveyed banks, 
and fell somewhat at the remaining banks. The strongest deposit 
categories were Super-NOW's, MMDA's, and IRA's. In those banks in 
which total deposits fell, demand deposits and conventional NOW's 
accounted for the decline. The prime rate ranged from 11 to 14.3 
percent, with most banks charging between 11 and 11.5 percent. Both 
prime rates and consumer lending rates were unchanged from last 
month and the surveyed banks expect no changes in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Adequate credit for spring planting appears to be available to 
qualified farm borrowers throughout the Tenth District. However, 
fewer farmers than normal are considered creditworthy, because of 
increased cash flow problems and stricter credit standards. 
Financial pressures are causing some farmers to liquidate assets and 
the number of farm auction sales is much higher than usual. Although 
the quantity of land being offered for sale is up sharply, many 
attempts to sell land have been unsuccessful due to a soft market. 
Winter feed supplies are short in Colorado, Wyoming, western Kansas, 
and central Nebraska. As a result, some calves and cattle are being 
sold earlier than planned. Other parts of the district have good 
supplies of winter feed. Profits from wintering stocker cattle, 
especially those grazed on wheat pasture, are expected to be quite 
favorable. Many farmers in Kansas and New Mexico are participating 
in the 1984 wheat program, but there is little interest in 
participation throughout the rest of the district. Interest in the 
1984 feed grain program is high in Nebraska and the 1984 cotton 
program is popular in Oklahoma. Most grain received by district 
farmers under the 1983 Payment-In-Kind (PIK) program has now been 
sold.
