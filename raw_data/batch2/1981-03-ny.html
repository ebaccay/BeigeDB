      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 25, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District continued mixed in February 
and early March. Retail sales increased at most stores, though a few 
merchants reported disappointing results. Domestic car sales picked 
up a bit at some dealers, due in large part to the rebate programs; 
foreign car sales also improved. Outside the consumer sector, 
economic activity appeared to be generally flat. Yet a number of 
respondents did indicate that their companies had experienced a 
modest improvement in business in recent weeks. Despite the stronger 
than expected performance of the national economy in the first 
quarter, the consensus forecast still calls for sluggish growth over 
1981 as a whole. Many respondents expressed enthusiasm for the 
direction and substance of the new Administration's tax and 
expenditure proposals. None, however, indicated that the proposals 
had led them to change their own production and capital-spending 
plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The February gains in Second District retail 
sales were weaker than during the Christmas season, but somewhat 
stronger than in November. Mild weather and widespread promotional 
price-cutting accounted for the February pickup. Generally, 
inventories were reported at satisfactory levels and under continued 
close surveillance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales in the Second District strengthened in recent 
weeks. To a large extent, however, the sales gains have been the 
result of the substantial rebates offered by domestic car makers. 
Yet sales of some imported cars also improved, and dealers in these 
cars anticipate further gains during the spring. Inventory positions 
vary greatly. Some were reported low because of the high cost of 
carrying inventories while others were described as adequate or 
high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Manufacturing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Second District 
outside the consumer sector was somewhat mixed though many 
respondents experienced an improved situation in recent weeks. A 
spokesman for the petroleum industry noted a softening of demand 
compared to a year ago due to greater conservation efforts and 
warmer weather, and some upstate capital goods firms report a 
continued low level of new orders. However, moderate pickups in new 
orders occurred at several firms including a chemical equipment 
manufacturer that supplies oil refiners, a home furniture and 
furnishings manufacturer, and an automotive company. In addition, a 
major food company foresees that 1981 will surpass last year's 
record performance, a large cosmetics and jewelry manufacturer 
reports continued gains following an acceleration in sales which 
began late last year, and an industrial equipment manufacturer has 
experienced strong demand from commercial and industrial 
construction firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While several economists saw business activity in 
the first quarter of 1981 coming in stronger than they had 
anticipated, they have not changed their forecast of a 1 to 1-1/2 
percent rise in real GNP for the year as a whole. Retailers 
anticipate a positive impact on sales during the second half of 1981 
resulting from the enactment of President Reagan's proposed personal 
income tax cut, and some manufacturers expect the rise in defense 
expenditures to stimulate the economy in general and provide orders 
for their defense-oriented customers. Others, however, expect the 
near-term effects of the tax and expenditure cuts to be offsetting. 
The proposed accelerated depreciation program is not expected to 
have much immediate impact, in light of the current low level of 
capacity utilization and the less than buoyant level of final 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business loan officers at large commercial 
banks report that business loan demand has been sluggish. 
Respondents generally agree that a slowing of economic activity and 
competition from the commercial paper market have contributed to the 
weakness in bank loan activity. However, in the wake of the recent 
decline in market interest rates relative to the prime, respondents 
reported that below-prime lending has been brisk, but very 
competitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Henry Kaufman 
(Salomon Brothers), Francis Schott (Equitable Life Assurance 
Society), and Albert Wojnilower (First Boston Corporation). Their 
views are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Kaufman: A double-dip in economic activity will not occur. Besides a 
much larger than expected increase in real GNP this quarter, the 
economic path for the balance of this year will include about 2 
percent real growth in the second quarter and 3 to 4 percent for the 
second half of this year. The distinctive features of the continued 
expansion will include no cyclical support from housing, a big 
increase in defense expenditures, prudent business monetary 
practices (constrained by high interest rates) and renewed strength 
on corporate liquidity later this year when interest rates will 
reach new highs in the long term bond markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: Prospects for disinflation, largely created by well-judged 
monetary policy, are being converted into reality. Progress will be 
slow because of the institutionalization of inflation. Yet, 
psychological factors have turned distinctly favorable for three 
reasons: (1) the Administration's expenditure control proposals have 
credibility, including prospects for Congressional acceptance; (2) 
Federal Reserve restraint has resulted in renewed liquidity 
pressures at intermediaries, which is reflected in cautious loan 
policies; and (3) the soft spots in the economy, such as housing, 
automobiles and farm machinery have created apprehensions about 
significant business failures. These apprehensions have dampened 
speculation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: Current statistics and reports from business contacts 
suggest that the economy remains strong and that the Reagan program 
is prompting more expansionary planning by business firms. The 
decline in interest rates likely is setting up a repeat performance 
of last summer's acceleration of business and upsurge in interest 
rates-but this time it will be from a stronger base of business 
activity and without the caution induced by preceding credit 
stresses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications are that longer term bond issues, initially by banks but 
probably followed by others, are accelerating sharply. Buying of 
such securities, however, remains limited largely to pension funds 
and to fiduciaries and speculators who expect to remain interested 
in the bond market only very briefly.
