      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District contacts report that the regional economy has posted 
mixed gains in November. Local manufacturing continues to expand 
despite some downward seasonal pressure, and retailers report yet 
another strong month in November. The financial picture has been 
mixed; commercial loan demand remains disappointingly weak, while 
retail lending continues to make significant advances. in housing, 
contacts report that continued high mortgage rates are resulting in 
a dip in November sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the Third District economy is for continued 
expansion into the Spring. Manufacturers expect to make significant 
capital investments and retailers anticipate very strong sales over 
the next six months. Bankers are forecasting a long awaited pickup 
in C&amp;I loan activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District housing activity, except for that in downtown 
Philadelphia, has decreased slightly in November from October 
levels. Although business remains ahead off the depressed levels of 
a year ago, most contacts report spotty or declining sales over the 
last six weeks. The most often cited explanation for recent poor 
sales performance is that higher mortgage interest rates, and 
uncertainty over future rates, are keeping all but the most 
pressured buyers out of the market. New starts are also very slow 
this month, owing to both declining sales and seasonal conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although seasonal factors had a damping effect on area industry this 
month, responses to the most recent Business Outlook Survey still 
indicate that local factories continued to post gains. About 40 
percent of the executives surveyed report improved conditions in 
November while only 6 percent indicate a decline. New orders and 
shipments have shown widespread growth, and unfilled orders and 
delivery times have advanced slightly as well. Inventories, led by a 
significant buildup in durables, appear to have leveled off from a 
two-year decline. Employment also has also improved in November, and 
both payrolls and the length of the average workweek have been 
increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the continued strength of the expansion, respondents have 
tempered their outlooks somewhat this month. While 62 percent of the 
executives polled predict that the recovery will continue into next 
Spring, November's survey records the smallest group of optimists so 
far this year. Nevertheless, solid increases are still anticipated 
in both new orders and shipments, and manufacturers expect to hire 
more workers and to expand working hours between now and April. 
Additionally, the percentage of respondents planning to increase 
plant and equipment expenditures over the next six months is the 
highest it has been in two years. In short, the outlook is for 
continued growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices have climbed again this month. Input price 
increases have been significant in November, but slightly less so 
than in October, reflecting the mild seasonal easing of producer 
activity. Prices received for finished goods, on the other hand, 
have posted more widespread gains this month than last. Looking 
ahead, 70 percent of the manufacturers surveyed predict higher 
materials costs in the next six months, while 60 percent expect to 
receive higher prices for finished goods over the same period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the Third District have shown steady improvement 
over the last six weeks. As contacts had anticipated, year-over-year 
gains are running about 10 percent in November, and they are 
expected to maintain that pace throughout the holiday shopping 
season. "Black Friday" was an exceptionally good day, despite an 
early snow, with some stores showing increases of 20 percent from a 
year ago. Higher consumer confidence levels and higher real incomes 
prompted an early opening of the Christmas shopping season this 
year, according to contacts, which could well turn out to be the 
best season since 1978. Retailers report their heaviest sales to be 
in personal computers and related equipment, entertainment
electronics, and home furnishings. Due to a significantly reduced 
need for promotional activity, profit margins in area stores have 
risen from October levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants remain confident about sales over the next six months and 
currently are forecasting increases of 8 percent to 9 percent over 
strong Spring 1983 figures. Accordingly, retailers plan to allow 
their inventory levels to remain well above those of a year ago. 
Stores have built up stock over the last six weeks in preparation 
for the holiday surge, and contacts say inventories will remain 2 
percent to 10 percent higher than a year earlier into the Spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area banks continue to report mixed loan activity in November. 
Commercial loan volume has risen only slightly in the last six 
weeks, far below the anticipated level. Once again, many bankers 
feel that the improved internal cash flow of area companies is 
weakening loan demand. Reports on year-over-year loan volume vary 
from 12 percent below to 20 percent above November '82 levels. 
Although banks are struggling with C&amp;I loans, they are enjoying 
consistently steady growth in retail lending. Led by the aggressive 
marketing of credit cards, consumer loan volume currently stands 
between 5 percent and 13 percent above levels of a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District bankers are optimistic about loan demand for the next 
six months. They believe that companies will soon exhaust their 
internal funds and turn to borrowing to support investment in 
inventories, plant, and equipment. Consumer lending is also expected 
to be very active through Spring, and bankers plan to continue heavy 
promotion of retail, loans and credit card accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime lending rate remains at 11 percent at major banks in the 
Third District, reflecting what bankers feel is an "air of economic 
stability." Consequently, contacts foresee little change in interest 
rates between now and the second quarter of 1984. Some bankers 
expect short-term rates to ease slightly over the next two or three 
months, and then to rise again after the first quarter as overall 
borrowing continues to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows in the Third District are reported to be rather 
sluggish in November. Demand deposits, although fairly volatile in 
recent weeks, show little net change from October. November's levels 
range from 2 percent below to 10 percent above those of a year ago. 
Time deposit growth is flat this month, according to area bankers, 
but levels remain about 30 percent ahead of November '82.
