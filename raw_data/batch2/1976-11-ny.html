      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the Second District continue to improve moderately, 
  according to District directors and other business leaders. 
  Department store sales in New York City have been strong for the 
  past two months, and consumer spending elsewhere in the District 
  also appears to have gained momentum. At the same time, there are 
  also signs that capital goods production in the District may now be 
  picking up. On the outlook for the national economy, the business 
  leaders contacted have not altered in the face of the recent 
  economic slowdown their view of a moderate but steady expansion over 
  the next year. With only a few exceptions, inventories were judged 
  in good balance with sales. Less encouragingly, many business 
  leaders voiced concern that the Ford Motor Company settlement would 
  tend to strengthen somewhat labor demands in future negotiations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending in New York, both in the City and upstate, appears 
  to have strengthened and merchants expect a strong Christmas season. 
  According to leading City retailers, since sales turned up around 
  Labor Day they subsequently continued to post sizable gains. While 
  the turnaround coincided with the movement toward Sunday openings, 
  most retailers feel it is still too early to estimate the impact of 
  such openings. Several department store executives attributed part 
  of the October strength to unseasonably cold weather, which sparked 
  purchases of outer wear. The vice president of an association of 
  retailers agreed that soft goods were now selling better. Reports 
  from upstate New York also indicate that consumer spending has 
  gained considerably. The head of a leading department store in 
  Buffalo said results for October were the best so far this year. A 
  banker director noted a considerable pickup in consumer borrowing 
  which he attributed to automobile purchases. In this strengthening 
  environment, most retailers are expecting a healthy Christmas buying 
  season that would carry over into the first half of 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      Concerning the general outlook for the national economy, the 
  consensus view was that the recent slowdown in growth would not 
  adversely affect the pace of economic activity over the next several 
  quarters. Indeed, one director pointed out that the rate of growth 
  in final sales had not slowed down at all. He predicted moderately 
  faster growth over the winter and spring, followed by some slowing 
  in the second half of 1977. Directors, business leaders, and 
  economists alike felt that despite the recent slowdown the near-term outlook remained one of moderate but steady expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent slowdown had not created any substantial inventory 
  imbalances and, overall, inventories were in good shape in the 
  unanimous view of respondents. One isolated sector where inventory 
  imbalances were thought to exist was in the metals industries, 
  especially steel and copper, which were frequently mentioned as 
  being top-heavy. One director, however, did feel that the situation 
  in steel had largely been corrected. The chief economist for a 
  diversified company thought that chemical inventories were high 
  while an executive of a chemical concern considered them to be 
  comfortable.
     </p>
     <p>
      One effect of the economic slowdown has been to allay fears of near-term shortages and capacity constraints. In July a senior official 
  in the paper industry predicted that the industry would face 
  capacity problems by mid-1977; but in view of current developments, 
  this forecast has been revised so that capacity constraints are not 
  expected to develop before 1978. A chemicals executive labeled the 
  capacity situation in his industry as good, stating that through 
  careful planning bottlenecks had been eliminated. A senior economist 
  of a textile company spoke of considerable excess capacity while a 
  metals executive predicted that shortages would not occur for a year 
  or two. Few business leaders reported changes in planned capital 
  spending, but many complained that the effects of environmental and 
  governmental regulation had severely constrained the growth of 
  capacity. Uncertainties over proposed environmental legislation and 
  concern over the possible imposition of price controls were cited by 
  several respondents as retarding investment spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods production in the District continues to lag, but there 
  is some evidence of a turnaround. New orders for capital goods have 
  apparently picked up for a number of companies. One officer reported 
  a tremendous upswing in new orders, primarily in new bookings from 
  the plastics industry. The production manager at another plant 
  commented that new orders for sophisticated machinery had been good 
  for some time and now orders for less sophisticated machinery are 
  picking up. According to the vice president of an electrical 
  machinery company, new orders have been somewhat stronger in recent 
  months and moderate growth is expected in the near future. The vice 
  president of a forge company reported that, while current capital 
  spending is slow, activity is expected to strengthen in early 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of directors and business leaders seemed to feel that the 
  Ford settlement would lead workers to strengthen their demands, but 
  few expected the impact to be substantial. Most directors thought 
  the settlement would lead to demands for higher wages, reduced 
  hours, or a guaranteed annual wage. A number of business leaders 
  agreed that the settlement was likely to encourage other workers to 
  make more expensive demands, with one businessman stating that his 
  company's upcoming negotiations would probably be affected. On the 
  other hand, few thought that the impact economy-wide would be 
  substantial because few other workers have the same bargaining 
  strength as the automobile workers. In one director s view, the 
  Ford settlement was tailored to the interests of a particular union 
  and would not, therefore, cause other workers to alter their 
  demands. An analyst in a brokerage house agreed that other workers 
  were unlikely to accelerate their demands as a result of the 
  settlement because in large measure the Ford contract was in line 
  with others negotiated this year. Despite this general consensus, 
  the directors of the Buffalo branch cautioned that the current 
  United Parcel Service strike could signal a general strengthening of 
  union demands over the next year.
