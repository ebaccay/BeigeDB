      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economic expansion has cooled dramatically. In 
September and early October, retail sales at department stores and 
automobile dealerships are reported to have shown no significant 
improvement from August's reduced pace. Nonresidential construction 
activity is reaching boom proportions in key metropolitan areas. But 
the recent slight reduction in mortgage interest rates has been 
insufficient to prevent both the construction and sale of new homes 
from falling further. The strong U.S. dollar, and consequent 
increase in lower-priced foreign imports, is hurting such key 
Western industries as lumber and primary metals, reducing the 
overall growth of manufacturing employment to a crawl. Prices for 
important Western agricultural products continue to fall, increasing 
the debt position of many farmers. Business loan demand at many 
District banks sagged during the third quarter, and only large banks 
expect a pickup in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales results were mixed throughout the Twelfth District 
states in September and early October. But overall, sales at major 
department stores appear to have shown little or no increase from 
August's reduced pace. The four major department stores in Southern 
California described back-to-school and early fall business as 
"disappointing". In September, their year-to-year gain in sales 
narrowed to 8 percent compared with 13 percent in August and 17 
percent in July. Retailers attributed this weaker performance in 
part to unusually warm weather which hindered sales of autumn 
apparel. But the fact that sales of furniture, housewares and 
appliances fell indicates that the housing slowdown is taking a toll 
on consumer purchases of durable household items. Retail sales also 
were disappointing in Utah and Idaho. In contrast, retailers in the 
Pacific Northwest apparently experienced a pickup in sales after the 
mid-summer slowing. Throughout the District, automobile and 
recreational vehicle sales were reported to have declined in 
September, but mainly due to supply problems. Retailers generally 
have lowered their expectations for Christmas business. But 
department stores still expect an average year-to-year sale, gain of 
8-10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The growth of manufacturing employment in most Twelfth District 
states has slowed dramatically recently, both because the growth of 
consumption of many key products manufactured in the area has slowed 
but also because lower-priced foreign imports are supplying on 
increased share of U.S. markets. The influx of imports has forced 
further cutbacks in employment in the metals and lumber industries 
and recently has begun to undermine domestic paper orders and prices 
as well. Moreover, the fact that inventories of such 
internationally-traded commodities as copper, aluminum and paper 
have continued to rise suggests that domestic producers may be 
forced to cut output further. If the Administration approves 
legislation recently passed by Congress, Pacific Northwest forest 
products firms could receive substantial relief from the burden of 
high-cost federal timber under contract. Still, lumber market 
conditions are so weak that many companies are expected to operate 
at a loss in 1984. Rising federal expenditures for defense and space 
programs and increased business investment continue to boost 
employment in such industries as electronic equipment, aircraft and 
missiles and nonelectrical machinery. But even in those industries, 
employment growth is slowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing starts in the West have shown further weakness recently, 
despite a slight reduction in mortgage interest rates. Western 
starts have held up somewhat better than those nationally but still 
are currently running about 27 percent below this year's peak 
reached in January. Because builders have reduced the construction 
of new homes about in line with the decline in sales, their 
inventory of unsold new homes has not risen to excessive levels. 
Nevertheless, builders expect Western housing starts to fall further 
in 1984 and 1985, even if mortgage rates remain at current levels. 
Falling permits reinforce the likelihood of a further slowdown in 
regional homebuilding. High interest rates have not impeded the 
virtual boom underway in nonresidential construction activity in the 
West. Portland is doing particularly well in attracting investment 
in high-technology manufacturing plants. Office vacancy rates are 
reaching disturbing levels in major metropolitan area, however, 
reducing rents below year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, the Twelfth District agricultural sector continues to be 
in a difficult period financially, especially those farms which are 
highly leveraged. The strength of the dollar is reducing exports, 
while putting downward pressure on prices through a large influx of 
imports. Summer and fall crops in the region have been especially 
abundant, further reducing prices. Even in California where total 
net farm income may be up in 1984, the return on equity generally 
will be unsatisfactory. In California, above-normal production this 
year has combined with a carryover of surplus inventory to depress 
prices for such commodities as grapes, nuts, and tree fruits to or 
below the break-even point for many growers. California's cotton 
crop is progressing well, but the strong U.S. dollar and prospect of 
record world production continue to push prices lower. The situation 
of rice growers is especially troublesome, since such countries as 
Taiwan and Thailand have stepped up their exports. In California, 
Utah and other Intermountain states, the livestock sector has not 
experienced significant year-to-year improvement in prices. Farm 
Land values are still falling, while highly-leveraged farmers are 
further increasing their debt position. In Utah, foreclosures on 
farm loans are reported to be rising sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial and industrial loans at many Twelfth District banks 
sagged during the third quarter, and bankers report mixed prospects 
for the coming months. At large banks, business loans (not 
seasonally adjusted) declined at a 3 percent annual rate over the 
third quarter, in contrast to increases of 7 and 23 percent 
respectively during the first and second quarters. Still, most of 
the larger banks reported continued strong demand from certain 
borrowers, especially high technology firms, retailers, builders, 
and the service industries. Moreover, these banks expect improved 
retail sales, strong capital spending, and a slowdown in the growth 
of corporate profits to boost overall business loan demand in the
near future, although lover inventory financing requirements will, 
offset some of this expansion. Smaller banksâ€”especially those 
located in regions dominated by the mining, lumber, and energy 
industriesâ€”also have experienced weaker demand for credit in 
recent months. But these banks generally do not expect business loan 
demand to pick up, due to the effects of continued high interest 
rates and import penetration in depressing their local economies. 
Moreover, an increasing number of firms in their market areas are 
trying to limit their investment to an amount that can be financed 
with internally generated funds.
