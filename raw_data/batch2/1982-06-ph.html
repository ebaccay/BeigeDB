      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District are mixed in June. Reports from 
the industrial sector continue to point to a bottoming out, but 
signs of growth are few and far between. Industrial prices continue 
to reflect that sluggishness. Retail business is sporadic, with 
large gains in May being offset by a weak June. In the financial 
sector, bankers say business borrowing is strong and deposit flows 
are reasonably good.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the future, Third District businessmen are optimistic but 
cautious. Manufacturers anticipate a pickup over the next six 
months, but not one strong enough to warrant increased capital 
spending or significant inventory building. Retailers seem to agree. 
They project some gains, but none large enough to really signal a 
recovery. They, too, plan to keep the lid on inventories. Area 
bankers have mixed views about business over the next six months, 
mostly as a result of widely variant interest rate forecasts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers responding to the June Business Outlook Survey say 
their industry is still in a lull. Industrial activity has remained 
virtually unchanged for four consecutive months now. A note of 
encouragement comes from the durables sector, however, which appears 
finally to have stabilized. Specific indicators show that new orders 
and factory shipments both posted small gains in June. As a result, 
the pace of inventory liquidation, although still significant, has 
tapered off somewhat after reaching a two-year peak in May. Labor's 
situation has not improved, however, with cutbacks in payrolls and 
working hours still being reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      The dampness of the current business climate seems to have only 
slightly affected survey participants' outlooks; about 70 percent 
still see clear sailing ahead. There is widespread anticipation of 
gains in shipments and new orders between now and year-end, and 
manufacturers are planning to expand both their work forces and the 
length of the average workweek to some degree. Respondents also 
predict an end to the inventory run off, but are not projecting a 
recovery strong enough to warrant a serious increase in plant and 
equipment spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices, which were stable in May, are holding steady in 
June too. And, while some area manufacturers foresee some renewal of 
inflation over the next two quarters, at least some of the present 
price sluggishness is expected to persist. In June, a larger portion 
of respondents than at any other time since the last months of the 
1973-75 recession say that both raw material costs and finished good 
prices will remain steady through the balance of 1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area department stores turned in a strong showing in May, but 
primarily as a result of heavy promotion. Sales through the first 
half of June have been fairly slack, and May gains, some as high as 
12 percent, are being partially offset. Even so, year-over-year 
gains for the May-June period are expected to be in the neighborhood 
of five percent. Reasons for the current dampness in department 
store sales include unseasonably wet weather and a "DON'T buy now" 
consumer psychology, a sharp contrast to a few years ago when the 
public believed in "buy now" to avoid price hikes. With the 
inflation rate down, consumers now tend to put off purchases and 
wait for price markdowns. As a result, retail margins are under the 
gun.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead to the balance of 1982, retailers are very cautious. 
Although some small sales gains are anticipated, merchants generally 
don't predict a strong surge until at least the fourth quarter. The 
tax cut and Social Security increase are expected to go into further 
rebuilding of balance sheets. As a result, retailers are keeping 
very tight stocks, to the point of causing some spot shortages of 
certain goods. No plans for inventory building are evident.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers say retail borrowing is still off 
substantially from a year ago, but business loan volume is strong. 
Reports this month put current C&amp;I loan volume from 8.5 to 12.5 
percent ahead of June 1981 levels. Much of that strength, according 
to contacts, comes from businesses barred from the bond market by 
the high cost of long-term capital.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers' views on interest rates have turned mixed since the last 
Redbook, and some now believe we've already seen the trough of the 
current interest rate cycle. Forecasts of the prime, which now 
stands at 16.5 percent, range from a 250 basis point drop between 
now and year-end to a 200 basis point increase by that time. 
Uncertainty over whether the Fed will bring monetary aggregates into 
line with targets seems to be the source of the variance in the 
forecasts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand forecasts for the next six months depend heavily on the 
direction of interest rate movements. With slack demand for retail 
inventory financing expected and a possible end to stress borrowing, 
some bankers believe that a further decline in rates, drawing 
customers to the bond market, would cause the bottom to drop out of 
the commercial loan market. Without that decline in interest rates, 
though, loan volume will probably hold up, they say.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows in the Third District are mixed but improving. Demand 
deposits have been picking up at major banks recently, but are still 
about 3 percent off on a year-to-year basis. Time and savings 
deposits are ahead of year-ago levels by about 11 percent. Sales of 
both 91-day money market certificates and 42-month ceiling-free 
deposits have been less than dramatic.
