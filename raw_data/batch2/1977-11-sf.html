      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Western economy is still growing, but with a few weak spots. 
Retail sales are mixed—strong in some places, sluggish in others. 
Inventories are generally at desired levels. The industrial picture 
is also mixed—many industries growing nicely but problems in pulp 
and paper, aerospace and steel. The current kingpin of the Western 
economy is construction, where single family building continues 
strong, but multiple unit and commercial appear even stronger. 
Demand continues strong for both construction and mortgage lending. 
While there is concern about disintermediation, little has been 
observed.
      <p>
       Retail sales appear uneven in the West. Some areas report strong 
  sales, particularly in small cars, while others report sluggish 
  sales. Third quarter retail sales were up 14.5 percent in Utah and 
  14.0 percent in Idaho over a year ago. Food sales in Seattle are a 
  bit weak, due partly to the fact that the Boeing strike involves 
  some 2 1/2 percent of the total Seattle work force. Also, a national 
  clothing manufacturer located in the district reports mediocre 
  sales. Inventories appear to be generally at desired levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Western industrial picture is mixed. The forest products 
  industry is generally in good health, except for the pulp and paper 
  portion which was declared by one director to be a "disaster area." Aluminum orders have leveled off temporarily, but there is said to 
  be fundamental growth in the demand for aluminum from the food and 
  transportation sectors, so that output next year is expected to 
  increase beyond a rather good 1977. Aerospace is hampered by strikes 
  at both Boeing and Lockheed. Steel production in Oregon is said to 
  be depressed by foreign imports, but overall, Oregon manufacturing 
  continues strong as indicated in the rising employment figures. Two 
  new food export ventures were noted in the Pacific Northwest. One is 
  an operation which has begun to ship a planeload of live beef to 
  Japan each week and the other is a project by a large Seattle food 
  distributor to fly fresh meat and produce to a new supermarket in 
  the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors from Utah and Idaho claim not to be experiencing a pause 
  in their economies. Most firms are said to be far out-stripping 
  their level of output of the previous year. Significant employment 
  gains in construction, mining and manufacturing are cited for Utah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction appears to be the sector of strength in the Western 
  economy. While average unemployment rates remain high, there is 
  virtually no unemployment in construction. Some areas are actually 
  reporting shortages of such skilled workers as electricians, 
  carpenters and plumbers. However, there have been two shifts taking 
  place, one is the diffusion of the construction boom from California 
  to other Western states and the other is a shift from single family 
  units to multiple units and non-residential construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Southern California reports an end to the lotteries and overnight 
  sellouts of subdivisions, and developers are becoming a bit more 
  cautious by putting up smaller blocks of houses at a time. Homes are 
  remaining on the market longer and there is more price bargaining. 
  While the level of single family construction continues high, the 
  real growth in Southern California has been in commercial and 
  industrial construction, which for the first 9 months of this year 
  was up 110 percent over the same period last year. Even this rapid 
  growth has apparently not kept pace with demand, for a shortage of 
  prime, new office space is said to be developing. Construction of 
  multiple family units is experiencing growth through California—100,400 multiple unit permits were taken out in September, the 
  largest number since February.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Utah, 1977 home building is estimated to be up 47 percent over 
  last year. There, as in several other areas, shortages of such 
  building materials as insulation, cement and sheetrock have been 
  reported. In Oregon, residential construction continues strong and 
  the previously sluggish non-residential sector took off in August at 
  a level 300 percent higher than a year ago. Portland, in particular, 
  is said to have experienced more rapid expansion of commercial 
  construction in the past three months than ever before in history. 
  One observer listed over $300 million worth of hotel, office and 
  hospital projects currently underway in the Portland area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistent with the strong pace of construction and real estate 
  sales, the demand for both mortgage and construction is described as "high," "brisk" and "strong" all over the district, though some 
  areas report a leveling off in demand. Reports from Southern 
  California, in particular, note that while mortgage demand is still 
  strong, it is less than in the first half of the year when real 
  estate speculation was at its peak. It is explained that most of the 
  pent-up demand for homes has run its course and consumers have 
  become slightly more cautious about incurring additional debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of directors addressed the question of disintermediation, 
  but only one felt he had observed any signs of the phenomenon having 
  actually begun. While banks in smaller towns felt there would be no 
  problem until 90-day Treasury bill rates hit 7 1/2 to 8 percent, 
  large California banks felt 6 1/2 percent would be enough to trigger 
  a mild degree of disintermediation. Still, even one of these larger 
  bankers observed that a prolonged or extensive shortage of mortgage 
  credit similar to 1969 and 1974 is not expected because financial 
  institutions are more liquid now and interest rates are not expected 
  to reach double-digit levels.
