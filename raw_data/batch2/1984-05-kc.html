      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The current moderate improvement in Tenth District economic 
conditions is expected to continue. Retail sales in early 1984 have 
been well above a year earlier, except in rural communities. A 
gradual slowdown in sales growth is expected, however. Prices are 
expected to be stable to slightly rising, both at retail and for 
materials inputs. Lead times on materials inputs are increasing, 
leading to some inventory expansion. New car sales are good in most 
district states. Housing starts are strong, but builders expect a 
slight decline as the year progresses. Demand for mortgage funds is 
down somewhat at savings and loan associations, which report making 
over 80 percent of new loans on an adjustable rate basis. District 
commercial banks report modest deposit growth and weak loan demand, 
with demand strongest for consumer loans. Winter wheat conditions 
vary widely across the District, depending on local disease and 
moisture conditions. Spring crop planting has been delayed in much 
of the district by excessive rain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Tenth District purchasing agents contacted report input price 
increases of 5 to 10 percent since April of last year, but few 
report significant increases during the last three months. A 
majority expect further increases of 5 to 10 percent during the 
remainder of the year. Nearly all respondents report increasing lead 
times and some problem with availability of inputs, with little 
improvement expected over the course of the year. In general, 
materials inventories are at satisfactory levels after recent 
expansion in response to increasing sales and worsening lead times.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers report sales for the first three months of 1984 well 
above a year earlier, except in rural communities where there has 
been little or no improvement. Because of extremely competitive 
conditions, retailers have not raised prices. Furthermore, aside 
from increases to maintain markups if costs rise, prices are 
expected to remain stable through 1984. Many retailers report high 
inventories which they intend to trim. A gradual slowdown in sales 
growth is expected for the rest of 1984, but sales are expected to 
stay above year earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers in the Tenth District report generally improved 
sales in 1984 relative to a year ago although some areas of weak 
sales still exist, particularly in rural areas. Gains were strongest 
in Missouri and New Mexico, and weakest in Colorado. Domestic 
inventories are being expanded where possible in expectation of 
continued strong sales, while very low inventories continue to 
suppress the sales of imports. Most dealers report that funds are 
available both for floorplanning and for customer loans. All dealers 
contacted are optimistic about the outlook for sales through 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing activity and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home builders report housing starts are up from a year ago despite 
recent bad weather, but are expected to fall slightly as the year 
progresses. Sales of new homes are lagging slightly behind year-ago 
levels. New home prices are up 5-10 percent over a year ago. Home 
builders report no problems in obtaining materials. Savings inflows 
at savings and loan associations are generally unchanged from last 
year but are expected to increase slightly through the rest of 1984. 
Increased mortgage rates have slightly reduced the demand for 
mortgage funds. Further rate increases are expected to weaken demand 
the remainder of the year. Savings and loan associations are 
aggressively marketing adjustable rate mortgages with 80 to 100 
percent of all new loans made in this form. Because the rates on 
most ARMs are tied to an index which lags market rate changes, 
recent increases in market rates have not yet resulted in 
significant collection problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers' reports on both loan growth and deposit growth differ 
widely, ranging from slightly stronger to weak. Only in Colorado and 
Northern New Mexico do conditions seem uniformly good. Surveyed 
bankers report a slight increase in loan demand during the past 
month. Demand is strongest for consumer loans, especially auto 
loans, and for commercial real estate loans. A few bankers report a 
slight increase in residential real estate loans. Demand for 
commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans is flat Districtwide, 
however. The prime rate has increased to a range of 12 to 13 1/2 
percent from a range of 11 to 12 1/2 percent last month. Most Tenth 
District banks report a slight increase in deposits from last month, 
nearly all due to MMDAs, IRAs, and Keogh accounts. Conventional NOW 
accounts and demand deposits increased slightly in the last month 
while Super-NOWs and passbook savings accounts remained constant. 
Large CDs also remained constant Districtwide, reflecting weak loan 
demand and modest deposit growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Winter wheat conditions throughout the Tenth District range from 
poor, due to disease or lack of moisture, to good. District hankers 
report that farmers' sign-up for the government's revised 1984 wheat 
program thus far has been high. The planting of spring crops in all 
but the southwest area of the District has been delayed by at least 
two weeks due to excessive rain. The calf crop in most of the 
District is above average with saving rates as high as 95 percent in 
some areas. Some yearling cattle are being sold this spring; others 
will be pastured until fall. Ample funds are available for farm 
operating loans this spring. Farm credit problems, however, are at 
least equal to those of last year, with some farmers wholly or 
partially liquidating assets to reduce farm debt. Unless farmers can
substantially reduce their debt this year, farm liquidations will 
likely rise. Farm real estate values continue to decline as the 
supply of land on the market increases, but relatively few sales are 
being reported.
