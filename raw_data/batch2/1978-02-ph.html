      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 21, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Reports from the Third District indicate that economic activity is 
  generally slow. Manufacturers say that business is unchanged from 
  January, and inclement weather has put a damper on retail sales. 
  Executives in both of these sectors look for renewed expansion over 
  the next six months. Area bankers say that business loan demand is 
  seasonally slow, and that it too should gain strength in the future. 
  They express a belief, though, that higher short-term interest rates 
  could have repercussions in the mortgage market. The nationwide coal 
  strike also threatens to cut into the District economy if striking 
  miners do not ratify a contract soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers responding to this month's Business Outlook Survey say 
  that the general business climate is unchanged from January, 
  continuing a now four-month old slowing trend. Supporting the claims 
  of a slowdown in growth, respondents indicate no change in new 
  orders this month, and only a weak increase in shipments. 
  Consequently, there is no improvement reported on the employment 
  front, and inventories are up fractionally.
       </p>
       <p>
        As for the future, although manufacturers are still generally 
  bullish, the overall optimism continues to diminish as the 
  industrial sector fails to gain real strength. New orders and 
  shipments are projected to pick up over the next six months, but 
  these expectations are also less widespread than they have been 
  recently. Despite the dampened outlook though, manufacturers in the 
  District continue to foresee gains in employment and increases in 
  capital spending. In the current Survey, 40 percent of the 
  respondents say they anticipate adding to their work forces by 
  August, and a like proportion plans to increase plant and equipment 
  expenditures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prices increases in the industrial sector are no more widespread in 
  February than last month. About half of those polled this month 
  report paying higher prices for raw materials, while about one 
  fourth say they are charging more for their finished products. 
  Looking ahead six months, over 80 percent expect to be paying more 
  for inputs, while only about 60 percent think they'll be able to get 
  higher prices for the goods they sell.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nationwide bituminous coal strike could seriously affect the 
  Third District economy if an agreement between striking miners and 
  management is not reached quickly. Although the strike does not have 
  a direct effect on employment, since less than 1 percent of the 
  District labor force is involved in coal mining, the local economy 
  could be impacted if coal shortages develop. Over half of the 
  original stockpiles that the major coal users, mainly utilities, had 
  accumulated before the strike are now gone, and users have begun to 
  substitute more expensive fuels for coal. As stock piles dwindle, 
  power cutbacks could have serious repercussions in the industrial 
  sector and therefore on employment. A Director of this bank 
  representing the energy industry believes that the crucial point has 
  already been passed, and that this area will start to feel real
  employment effects in a matter of days.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales in the area are reported to be mixed. Reports of 
  current dollar sales range from 1 percent below to 5 percent above 
  year-ago levels, and sales are generally below planned volume. The 
  major reason for this, according to contacts, has been extremely 
  adverse weather which has helped to keep the lid on sales since the 
  middle of January. In addition, two of the worst winter storms to 
  hit the area in twenty years caused merchants, along with other 
  business people, to shut down and lose a total of three selling 
  days. Inventories are somewhat thicker than they were last year at 
  this time, partly as a result of slow winter sales, and partly as a 
  result of a management decision to add to stocks.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the longer term, retailers are looking for a "healthy" spring 
  buying season, hence the decision to increase inventories. Moreover, 
  they believe the recent slowdown to be a temporary setback, and 
  expect to recover lost sales over the next two months. Overall, mid-
  summer sales are projected to be between 6 and 9 percent above year-
  earlier levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports from commercial bankers in the region indicate that business 
  loan demand is slow, but no worse than seasonal patterns would lead 
  one to expect. In terms of levels, commercial loans are between 2 
  and 5 percent ahead of the corresponding period in 1977. Consumer 
  loan demand remains strong. Over the next six months bankers expect 
  a slight pickup in C&amp;I loans with August levels about 4 percent 
  ahead of year-earlier figures.
       </p>
       <p>
        The prime rate is currently 8 percent at all of the banks contacted, 
  and is generally expected to be pushed into the 8 1/2 to 8 3/4 
  percent range by late summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankers contacted say that higher short-term interest rates will 
  definitely have an effect on the market for mortgage funds. Some 
  have already noticed some disintermediation on the part of 
  depositors as higher earning assets became available. One official 
  at a local MSB notes that there is still a net inflow of deposits at 
  his institution only because the rate on large CDs was recently 
  hiked. He believes that if the short-term rate rises another 25 
  basis points, this region will see a significant shrinkage in the 
  supply of available mortgage funds. In addition to this, most of the 
  commercial bankers contacted say that as short-term rates go up, 
  lenders will shift away from mortgages into short-term assets. It is 
  generally felt that this would also happen at institutions committed 
  to financing the housing market, such as MSBs and S&amp;Ls, but that 
  they would take a longer time, perhaps 4 to 5 months, to make such 
  alterations in their loan portfolios.
