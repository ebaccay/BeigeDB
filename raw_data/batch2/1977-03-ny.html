      Beige Book Report: New York

      <strong>
       March 9, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business activity in the Second District has returned to normal 
    following the end of the severe weather and natural gas shortage, 
    according to businessmen and directors contacted recently. At the 
    retail level, spending apparently strengthened progressively over 
    February, with sales for the month either meeting or exceeding 
    merchants' expectations. With the restoration of natural gas service 
    in early February, manufacturing output and employment rebounded as 
    many firms stepped up production through overtime to meet order 
    backlogs or rebuild inventories. At the same time, new orders 
    appeared to have strengthened somewhat and many respondents expected 
    a pick up in fixed and inventory investment. Respondents were less 
    sanguine on the inflation outlook, however, expecting increased 
    pressure on prices as a result of the weather problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        Production and employment appear to have rebounded early in February 
    with the resumption of natural gas service and moderation in the 
    severe weather. Directors of the Buffalo Branch stated that in the 
    Rochester and Buffalo areas many firms were stepping up production 
    through overtime to meet order backlogs or rebuild inventories. This 
    strong upward trend in output was most notable in the automotive 
    sector, where substantial overtime expenses were incurred to make up 
    production.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scattered evidence of a pick up in capital spending was reported by 
    capital goods producers in the District. New orders generally were 
    up slightly in February and continued improvement was expected in 
    coming months. For the most part, production losses due to the gas 
    shortage were expected to be made up. Many respondents had either 
    increased overtime or have plans to lengthen the work week. An 
    exception to this view was the vice president of a heavy machine 
    tools producer, who reported that new orders were off in February. 
    While expecting overall orders to pick up, the construction and 
    mining equipment sectors were weak, and he felt that prospects for 
    these lines were less certain.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the outlook for capital spending, several respondents expected 
    plant and equipment outlays to increase later in the year. Some of 
    the increase in outlays may result from the natural gas shortage. 
    Several respondents indicated that they were considering the 
    addition of alternative energy sources for their plants. In this 
    vein, the president of a major chemical and metals firm reported 
    that the relative price of oil and coal could prompt major 
    conversions to coal. He indicated that the costs of changeover at 
    one of his plants were made up in one year. Directors of the Buffalo 
    Branch felt that plant and equipment additions would be spurred by 
    tightening capacity utilization resulting from stronger sales and 
    inventory rebuilding. The president of a textile firm noted that, 
    due to the low level of utilization, capital expenditures in his 
    industry would largely be for replacement and modernization. An 
    equipment manufacturing executive felt that President Carter's 
    stimulus package was a psychological plus for business even without 
    a substantial increase in the investment tax credit. His company is 
    planning to step up plant and equipment spending in the second half 
    of this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        District merchants reported that consumer spending in February 
    strengthened despite some limited disruptions in sales activity 
    early in the month. The consensus among retailers was that it is 
    impossible to estimate to what extent the increase made up for sales 
    lost in January. First of all, respondents were unsure of the extent 
    to which the January sales disruption was a consequence of the 
    weather-related natural gas shortage. During the natural gas 
    squeeze, a number of retailers curtailed store hours and thermostats 
    were lowered. This made shopping less convenient and tended to lower 
    consumer spending. On the other hand, the unusually cold weather was 
    credited by several retailers with stimulating sales of certain 
    items, most notably outerware. Whatever the cause, retailing was 
    apparently back to normal levels for February as a whole and, 
    indeed, several retailers reported that sales were ahead of 
    expectations. A vice president of a major department store reported 
    that recent sales were "rather good," which suggested to him that 
    they were entering a "healthy period" of expansion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The disruptive effects of the severe weather were expected to put 
    upward pressure on prices. In addition to the obvious effects on 
    food prices due to the drought in parts of the nation, the severe 
    weather was expected to influence prices in a number of ways. One 
    metals producer reported that the price of lead had firmed recently, 
    apparently in response to increased demand for batteries created by 
    the cold. An economist of an oil company noted the higher fuel 
    demand resulting from the cold would be met largely through the 
    importation of high-priced foreign oil which would result in higher 
    average petroleum prices. In the judgment of several respondents, 
    these price pressures are likely to be exacerbated by the 
    inflationary impact of fiscal stimulus measures. More positively, 
    one respondent felt that the recent increase in prices created by 
    the severe weather would largely prove to be temporary—merely 
    reflecting the inefficiencies associated with low production rates 
    and dislocations. He expected an abatement in the rate of inflation 
    as production levels return to normal levels.
