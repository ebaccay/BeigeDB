      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 16, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District in November point to mixed local 
economic conditions. Manufacturing is showing signs of a hiatus 
after a short recovery in October, but retail sales have perked up 
somewhat. Mixed loan activity is reported by area bankers. Mortgage 
rates have dropped, giving the housing sector a boost.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District businessmen are very cautious about the prospects for 
improvement over the next six months. A weak recovery is expected in 
the manufacturing sector while a moderate pickup is expected in 
retailing. Bankers foresee lower interest rates and slipping 
business loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Spurred by a rapid decline in mortgage rates, the Third District 
housing market has revived substantially in the last six weeks 
according to industry contacts. Conventional mortgage rates have 
dropped into the 13 to 14.50 percent range, pushing housing activity 
above the disastrous levels of a year ago. Market conditions, 
however, are still described as soft by area real estate brokers. 
Sales are reportedly running somewhat behind those of a "normal" 
fall and contacts say that mortgage rates in the neighborhood of 12 
percent are necessary to induce buyers to enter the market in force. 
Most of the sales activity is in pre-owned homes. With new home 
prices depressed, builders report little improvement in the market 
for new construction; housing starts remain at a virtual standstill.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers participating in the November Business Outlook Survey 
report that local industrial activity, which showed marked 
improvement in October, has slipped marginally this month. The gains 
indicated in the October survey were the most widespread in over a 
year and the only significant improvement noted thus far in 1982. It 
is evident from the latest survey, however, that area industry 
continues to struggle. New orders have held steady in November, but 
shipments, after two months of steady growth, have fallen off 
slightly. Manufacturers continue to reduce industrial payrolls and 
have also cut back again on working hours. In addition, inventory 
liquidation is still pervasive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, respondents are still very optimistic that expansion 
in the industrial sector will resume over the next six months. 
Almost four out of five participants project a strengthening in 
general activity between now and May, characterized by widespread 
gains in new orders and shipments, along with growing backlogs. But 
there is little feeling that inventory rebuilding is in the picture 
yet. Plans for capital spending remain weak, emphasizing 
respondents' caution regarding the recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prices firms charge for their own products dropped marginally in 
both October and November, the first price cuts in area 
manufacturing since the end of the 1973-75 recession. Input costs, 
on the other hand, remain largely unchanged from their September 
levels. Manufacturers predict that between now and May, as the 
industrial sector rebuilds, prices of both raw materials and 
finished goods will begin to rise again.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales at department stores in the Third District are beginning to 
show more life. Volume has improved since September and now ranges 
from zero to four percent above the levels of a year ago. Retailers 
say, however, that in light of the poor showing by area stores in 
1981, sales activity is still very weak. Local merchants, who 
expected the upswing, indicate that much of the spending is for 
promotional items, lower-priced luxury goods, and less-expensive 
hardgoods such as kitchen appliances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail contacts continue to be cautious about sales over the coming 
months. The present uptempo buying is expected to continue through 
mid-December, when a brisk holiday season should kick in. Gains for 
1982 on the whole, however, are projected to be on the order of only 
three to four percent. Merchants foresee a slow pickup continuing 
into the second quarter of 1983, resulting in sales two to six 
percent above year-earlier volume by May.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories have been kept trim in response to the slow 
activity prevalent through most of this year, and are now slightly 
below last year's levels. Retailers have no plans to alter stock 
levels in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District loan activity has turned mixed recently after 
increasing through early October. A swing to long-term corporate 
debt, facilitated by lower interest rates and declining inventory 
financing requirements, has slackened the demand for business 
borrowing. As a result, C&amp;I loan volume has slipped since the last 
Redbook. Current estimates put commercial lending only four to five 
percentage points ahead of last November and a little below bankers' 
expectations. Consumer loans, as expected, are seeing more action 
again this month, due mainly to the drop in interest rates on 
consumer loans and an increased effort by local bankers. The volume 
of retail loans, however, remains well below year-ago figures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers are forecasting a continuation of present trends in area 
lending over the next six months, depending on the strength and 
timing of the expected recovery. Less distress borrowing and 
increased reliance on the corporate bond market should soften 
business loan demand even further. Consumer borrowing will probably 
grow strongly, according to contacts, as both lenders and borrowers 
find retail loans more attractive.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate at Third District banks has dropped to 12 percent 
from 13.50 percent in September. A downward trend is expected to 
pull the prime down as far as 10 percent sometime late in the second 
quarter of 1983 before it firms up. Other lending rates at area 
banks, including mortgage rates, are expected to follow suit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows in the Third District appear healthy in November. 
Demand deposits are up sharply since September; bankers attribute 
this jump to slow reinvestment of maturing All Savers' dollars. Time 
deposits have improved as well, especially the new 7-31 day time 
deposits, and are now as high as 14 percent above last year at this 
time.
