      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The Western economy continues generally strong with a few signs of 
  weakening. With a few exceptions, retail sales remain brisk 
  throughout the West. The energy situation is said to be sparking 
  sales of small cars. Residential construction and sales have slowed 
  throughout the District, though non-residential construction 
  continues strong in several areas. In District industries, lumber 
  prices remain firm, strikes and freezes push up food prices and the 
  skilled labor market remains tight. Only a handful of firms have 
  reacted to the potential oil shortage by increasing their 
  stockpiling capability. The consumer debt situation appears mixed, 
  with continued strength reported by some banks and moderate 
  weakening reported by others. Generally strong loan demand is said 
  to account for the West Coast's adherence to an 11 3/4 percent prime 
  and several banks expect their Eastern brethren to come back up to 
  11 3/4 very shortly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although patches of weakness are beginning to emerge, retail sales 
  remain generally strong in the West. Consumer spending in California 
  remains brisk and our directors explain this by large employment 
  gains, the growing importance of the two-income family, Proposition 
  13 tax savings, large increases in home equity values and the 
  associated availability of consumer credit. According to one 
  director in Southern California, the opening of a new Neiman Marcus 
  store has stimulated "the biggest buying spree in history all over 
  Beverly Hills." Oregon's largest department store also indicates 
  that sales remain strong, and reports from Washington point to 
  continued briskness in all types of sales. In Idaho, a major grocery 
  chain reported some weakening in retail sales and small business 
  failures in shopping centers are reported on the increase. While 
  sales are also weak in Utah, one observer expects an improvement 
  once the severe winter weather breaks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto sales, though reported slow in two areas (Salt Lake City and 
  central California), appear to be strong in the rest of the 
  District. Small cars are the star sellers and this is being 
  attributed to the expectation of fuel shortages and price rises. In 
  one area, the Ford Pinto is said to be sold out. A five-state 
  distributor of foreign cars reports January sales up 89 percent and 
  February sales up 20 percent over year-earlier levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Real estate activity has weakened throughout the District. In San 
  Diego, both construction and sales of homes are down and the 
  inventory of unsold homes is up from year-ago levels. In Salt Lake 
  City, the January dollar value of residential construction is 
  reported down 32% and non-residential construction down 18 percent 
  from year-earlier levels. There is, however, still some strength in 
  non-residential construction in California, Oregon and Washington. 
  Both San Francisco and Seattle are in the midst of a downtown 
  building boom, and Seattle's hotel capacity is expected to double in 
  the next 3 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Developments in District industries generally suggest inflationary 
  pressures. A combination of strong export demand and supply 
  shortages (induced by government timber policy and a rail car 
  shortage) have kept lumber prices up, despite the slowdown in 
  housing. A farm worker strike in southern California has disrupted 
  the harvest of lettuce and several other crops, and the strike is 
  expected to soon move into the Salinas Valley, another major 
  vegetable producing area. A freeze in Southern California caused 
  considerable damage to the grapefruit crops. Reports of skilled 
  labor shortages come in from Seattle and Salt Lake City. In the 
  latter city, a new electronics firm was said to be using large 
  bonuses to lure workers away from a competing firm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of our directors appear not to have altered any investment or 
  energy plans in light of recent changes in the world energy 
  situation. The exceptions are: (1) a food distributor who, in order 
  to insure an uninterrupted supply of diesel fuel, has leased 
  additional storage capacity and begun stockpiling, (2) a dairy 
  products distributor who is studying the potential for stockpiling, 
  (3) Boeing which has adopted a vigorous conservation program and is 
  shifting its plant's heating from oil to natural gas, and (4) a 
  group of building contractors who report a three-fold increase in 
  the number of calls concerning alternative sources of heating.
       </p>
       <p>
        The consumer debt situation appears mixed with reports of continued 
  growth, softening, and a shift in composition. A large California 
  bank reported that consumer loans (both direct and indirect) and 
  credit card debt rose during January and February, contrary to the 
  normal seasonal downturn in these months. A smaller California bank 
  reported consumer debt up 3 percent in January and 2 percent in 
  February, in contrast to declines last year at this time. Reports 
  from Seattle, Portland and San Diego also suggest continued growth 
  in consumer debt. On the other hand, smaller banks in Washington, 
  Oregon and Utah report some weakening in consumer lending. One 
  Oregon bank noted a substantial change in the composition of its 
  consumer loans. During the first 3 quarters of 1978, home equity 
  loans accounted for 35 percent of this Bank's new consumer 
  installment loans, but this share jumped to 95 percent in the fourth 
  quarter and appears to have continued at a high level into 1979.
       </p>
       <p>
        Loan demand is reported generally strong and is given as the major 
  reason why West Coast banks have kept their prime rate at 11 3/4 
  percent. Most feel that the move to 11 112 percent by some large 
  Eastern banks was premature and not supported by fundamentals. One 
  large California bank expects these Eastern banks to be back up to 
  11 3/4 by late March, and that this will be followed later by a move 
  to 12 percent across the country. A few banks also mentioned the 
  high cost of funds as a major reason for not lowering either their 
  prime rate or mortgage rate.
