      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending, especially for durables, offers the strongest 
evidence of recovery in the Southeast, and retailers surveyed expect 
sustained growth through the summer. The uptrend in construction 
persists despite a recent increase in mortgage rates and an earlier 
drop in building permits. Business loans at large commercial banks 
have risen for the first time since February. Manufacturers report 
increased sales, some firming of prices, and more recalls than 
layoffs. The pickup in tourism is gaining momentum, but this 
acceleration has yet to reach south Florida and Tennessee. Florida's 
citrus industry is one of the few bright spots in the troubled 
agricultural sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The southeastern labor market shows signs of strengthening despite 
the increase in Florida's unemployment rate from 8.6 percent in 
April to 9.1 percent in May. The recent volatility in the state's 
jobless rate is attributable to changes in seasonality patterns. 
Alabama's unemployment rate fell from 14.3 percent in April to 13.1 
percent in May. Even in depressed industries, recalls have exceeded 
layoffs. Steel fabricators in Alabama have begun rehiring furloughed 
workers. Building supply firms, particularly in Florida, report 
increasing sales and firming prices because of expanded housing 
demand. Executives at cement plants and lumber mills expect to 
operate near capacity in the next few months in response to 
burgeoning construction activity. Higher prices in Louisiana's farm 
chemical industry, mainly the result of cutbacks in plant capacity 
and reduced supplies, are probably more temporary. However, industry 
leaders remain concerned that low-priced, imported ammonia will 
exacerbate their problems. Louisiana produces 30-40 percent of the 
nation's ammonia, a chief source of nitrogen fertilizer for crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The May performance of consumer sales exceeded retailers' 
expectations; southeastern taxable sales in May rose 6.8 percent 
from 1982 levels in spite of declines of 5.9 percent in Louisiana 
and 0.3 percent in Mississippi. Most retailers polled now anticipate 
sales throughout the summer to run 10 to 35 percent ahead of last 
year, even though nearly all predict the impact of the July 1 tax 
cut will be negligible. Merchants attribute these increases to 
renewed consumer confidence in the economy and, in Florida, to a 
growing momentum in tourism. Appliances and other durables, such as 
stereos, televisions, and lawn mowers, are moving especially well. 
New motor vehicle sales in the Southeast continued to strengthen in 
May. Dealers indicate that a number of popular full-size car lines 
were in short supply regionally as well as nationally at the end of 
May. Consumers are using credit to pay for a large portion of these 
durable purchases, according to retailers and credit reporting 
agencies polled.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The June 8 increase in the FHA/VA rate from 11.5 percent to 12.0 
percent may spur home sales, according to realtors in the District. 
A fall in discount points accompanied the rate hike and lowered 
"cash-in-hand" requirements for many home buyers. The rise in rates 
also spurred prospective buyers to sign contracts in order to lock 
in current interest rates. Lenders expect no major changes in 
mortgage rates in the near future, but they believe increases are 
quite possible within a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Building permit activity remains strong despite the drop in April. 
Single-family building permits issued fell 1.1 percent from March to 
April. Many industry analysts attribute the decrease to aberrations 
from normal seasonal patterns earlier this year when lower interest 
rates catalyzed an unusual winter surge in building. Permit offices 
report that June housing activity remains stable. Atlanta housing 
sales are especially strong. The market now consists of individual 
transfers from other regions and a larger share of local buyers 
seeking to upgrade the value of their housing; last year corporate 
relocations accounted for most sales. Although fairly stable to 
date, housing prices may begin to rise by the fourth quarter because 
of inventory absorption and increasing land costs, according to 
industry representatives.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate brokers surveyed have become more buoyant in 
their outlook despite rising rental rates and ongoing problems of 
excess supply in many regional cities such as Orlando, Atlanta, and 
New Orleans. Commercial realtors are not worried that vacancy rates 
are not diminishing because they expect a 6-8 month lag between the 
onset of recovery and office relocation decisions. However, suburban 
markets in the Southeast are faring better than their downtown 
counterparts. The vacancy rate in Atlanta's central business 
district approaches 20 percent compared to a metro-wide rate of 15 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans at large District banks rose considerably from April to 
May. The first growth of business loans since February sparked this 
overall increase. Total bank deposits were off slightly in May. Some 
respondents believe the slowdown in income tax refunds has reduced 
the influx of most deposits except time deposits and large-
denomination certificates of deposit. Money Market Deposit Accounts 
showed more strength at S&amp;Ls than at large banks in May. However, 
their earlier impetus has slowed to a monthly growth rate of less 
than 3 percent at both institutions. Substantial funds flowed out of 
Negotiable-Order-of-Withdrawal (NOW) accounts at large banks 
although super-NOWs at thrifts rose slightly from April to May. 
After shelving a proposal to allow interstate banking, the Tennessee 
legislature recently passed several bills to make the state's 
financial institutions more competitive. Most notably, banks may now 
acquire other banks across county lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Attendance at most attractions is more than 5 percent over last 
year's levels, and state visitor center registrations, except in 
Alabama and Tennessee, were up in May relative to last year. Central 
Florida remains the leader of this upsurge. Respondents in Tennessee 
and south Florida are pessimistic about travel this summer. May 
lodging tax receipts in most states exceeded year-ago figures, but 
many properties still suffered lower occupancy rates because of the 
lingering effects of recession and because of the expansion in hotel 
rooms. Hotels in cities such as New Orleans and Atlanta, which rely 
on convention trade, have begun to discount rates to offset reduced
occupancy. This practice is likely to generate considerable 
uncertainty and adverse results, particularly among smaller hotels, 
in the opinion of those polled.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in agriculture remain troubled, although certain markets 
show encouraging signs. Valencia orange production has rebounded 
from last year's crippling freeze with an estimated harvest of 72 
million boxes (20 million more than in 1982). Overall revenue 
projections for oranges portend a 20 percent rise to $804 million. 
In contrast, large stocks of grapefruit juice carried over from 1982 
and poor marketing practices have resulted in excess supplies, lower 
prices, and a $40 million decline in projected revenues. Estimated 
revenue in 1983 from Sixth District peach production will be 
approximately half of 1982 revenue because late frosts and freezes 
severely reduced crops in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, as well as 
South Carolina. Despite these regional crop losses, California's 
above-average peach crop has held nationwide prices below 1982 
levels. Adverse weather throughout the South and widespread flooding 
in Louisiana and Mississippi lowered the District yield for winter 
wheat from 36 bushels per acre in 1982 to 32 bushels in 1983. 
Nevertheless, wheat farmers' net income should be substantially 
higher this year because approximately one-fifth of the projected 
revenue of $530 million will come from sales of Payment-in-Kind 
(PIK) wheat, for which there are no offsetting costs. PIK, however, 
continues to have an adverse impact on agricultural suppliers and 
livestock farmers, who face higher feed costs.
