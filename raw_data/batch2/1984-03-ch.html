      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The expansion in the Seventh District has strong momentum, with 
prospects favorable for gains through the year. Consumer spending, 
still the prime mover, has been above expectations. Confidence 
levels are the highest in several years. However, employment 
increases are still mainly in manufacturing. Output of autos and 
heavy trucks is at capacity levels, restricted by component 
availability. Some producers of construction equipment, mining 
equipment, machine tools, and freight cars report increased orders, 
but capital goods output, overall, remains far below peak levels. 
Not all sectors in the District are expanding vigorously, but there 
is no evidence of new deterioration. House sales have been strong 
relative to past years. Price inflation is increasingly evident. 
Inventory investment is expected to accelerate, with stocks 
currently low in virtually all lines. The signup of dairy farmers 
for the new government output restriction program was far less than 
expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Price Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price increases clearly are accelerating, but District analysts 
believe that the general inflation rate will not accelerate over 2 
percent this year. Price increases have been substantial for paper 
and paperboard, gypsum board, aluminum, and electronic components—all being produced at near-capacity rates. University tuitions are 
being boosted 8-10 percent. Electric and telephone utilities are 
requesting very large rate increases, but natural gas rates may 
level or decline because gas companies have "walked away" from high-priced contracts with suppliers. Rail and truck rates are expected 
to move up, but airline fares are under downward pressure.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Increases in employment in the District are still mainly confined to 
manufacturing. Unemployment is reported to be reduced substantially 
in virtually all localities, but declines in estimated unemployment 
have not been matched in most cases by increases in employment. 
Motor vehicles account for the major share of the rise in 
manufacturing employment, but even in that sector employment is far 
below past peaks. Motor industry employment has not recovered as 
much as unit assemblies of vehicles because of heavy overtime, more 
automation (including robots), and increased use of imported 
components. A large portion of the reported reduction in the number 
of indefinite layoffs reflects deletions of workers who are no 
longer eligible for recall. Scattered callback. of workers in 
capital goods industries amount to only a small fraction of those 
released during the recession. Most companies that have slashed 
drastically their middle management staffs have no intention of 
restoring these jobs. A very large bank, that already has reduced 
employment by about 10 percent, plans a further reduction of similar 
magnitude, in part by attrition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Benefits
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Companies that are increasing wages and salaries this year indicate 
that such increases will average in the 5-6 percent range, down as 
much as 50 percent from increases in some recent years. But some 
firms are freezing compensation, and others are reducing wages and 
trimming benefits. Wage cuts have been most general in meat packing, 
with plant closings threatened if labor does not agree. The largest 
food chain in the Chicago area recently announced a cut of about 20 
percent in hourly rates to get labor costs more in line with fast-expanding "warehouse store" competition. This move abrogates a 21/2-year union contract signed only a few months ago. The union involved 
is suing, but no strike action appears imminent. A widespread move 
is underway by employers to slow the rapid rise in the cost of 
medical benefits, which now often amount to $1,500 per year per 
active worker—$6,000 in one company. Steps taken include increased 
employee contributions, higher deductibles, switches to less 
expensive plans, curtailed coverage, and requirements of "a second 
opinion" before elective surgery.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of virtually all types of consumer goods and services have 
been strong this year, often above expected rates. Major retailers 
are boosting orders to suppliers to keep stocks at adequate levels. 
Regional surveys indicate consumers are more confident of their 
future incomes than at any time in at least five years. Improved 
confidence, together with rising incomes and generally low 
installment debt burdens, is unleashing pent-up demand that had been 
building since 1979. Plans to buy cars are especially strong. Other 
big selling lines include major appliances, furniture, and personal 
and home computers. Demand for recreational vehicles and motorcycles 
also has picked up, but is far below past peaks. Finally, consumers 
are spending more on airline tickets and vacations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Output of mechanical capital goods, a major District activity, is 
increasing on a broader front. Heavy trucks, truck trailers, and 
associated diesel engines are scheduled at full capacity for several 
months ahead. A large producer of earth-moving equipment is 
recalling some laid-off workers as demand has increased and parts 
inventories have been depleted. Most companies report export 
business very slow, but a producer of huge mining shovels recently 
won a Turkish contract, the largest single order in the company's 
history. Orders for freight cars have been rising but only to about 
25 percent of capacity. Demand for replacement parts is also up. 
Three District producers of mobile construction cranes have been 
phasing out their production activities, because of low demand and 
severe foreign competition. Farm equipment sales have not picked up 
as expected. Machine tool orders are increasing, mainly from the 
auto industry. Overall, the District's capital goods producing 
sector remains depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Assemblies of both cars and trucks in the first quarter will be far 
above last year, and the highest for the period since 1979. With 
demand strong and inventories of desired models low, this pace is 
expected to be about maintained in the second quarter. Output is 
restricted by availability of components, partly because of 
rejection of parts that fail inspection. Domestic producers are 
acutely aware that the quality "image" of their products is compared 
unfavorably with that of vehicles from Japan, Germany, and Sweden. 
Inventories of most Japanese cars are near rock bottom because of 
import quotas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The market for new and used homes improved sharply last year and has 
been surprisingly strong in early 1984. Realtors report prices up 6-8 percent in the past year in good areas, with further gains 
expected. The market is supported by first-time home buyers who had 
deferred purchases in recent years because affordable financing was 
not available. A wide variety of ARMs are now offered, but careful 
reading of the "fine print" is advised. Some lenders are pushing 15-year amortized loans rather than ARMs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Congressional delay in allocating funds for badly needed highway, 
bridge, and mass transit projects could require postponement of some 
projects until next year. Nonresidential private construction 
activity in the District is dominated by a new wave of large office 
buildings scheduled to start in the next several months.
