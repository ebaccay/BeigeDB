      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The sluggishness in the Second District became more widespread 
during October. The retail sector worsened, as department store 
gains tapered off and automobile dealers reported bleak conditions. 
Manufacturing industries remained depressed. Our directors reported 
a sharp deterioration in business conditions nationwide, with the 
weakening spreading beyond housing and autos to basic industries in 
general and retail sales across-the-board. On the financial side, 
demand for business loans was high due to cash shortages and a poor 
bond market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In October, growth in retail activity in the Second District slowed 
from the modest rise in August and September. While many stores in 
the New York region outperformed those in many other areas of the 
country, few local retailers achieved their goals. A slackening 
national economy, with rising unemployment and high interest rates, 
was blamed for the downturn. Slow sales have led to somewhat 
inflated inventories. Expectations regarding holiday business ranged 
from cautious hopes to outright pessimism.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales slumped in October as rebate and interest rate 
subsidy programs expired. Even the previously strong market for used 
cars showed some signs of weakening. Floor traffic has dwindled as 
potential buyers worry about uncertainty in the economic outlook and 
high interest costs. Dealers attempting to minimize carrying charges 
are paring inventories and reducing factor orders. No improvement is 
anticipated before January, as the holiday months of November and 
December traditionally are slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained depressed during October. Capital 
goods producers reported that sales, shipments, and new orders have 
generally stabilized at the low levels of prior months; only one 
firm mentioned any additional drop. Backlogs have enabled some 
establishments to maintain production; but at the current rate at 
which these past orders are being filled, cutbacks will occur soon. 
Electronics and defense companies also experienced flat or slightly 
dampened sales, but one firm noted high demand for its aerospace 
products. A number of producers reported declining profits or actual 
losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stringent control of inventories was widespread. Two companies have 
trimmed raw materials supplies, while others are tightening 
inventories of work-in-progress. Desire for cuts in stocks of 
finished goods was expressed, but in some cases slow sales have 
prevented a rapid adjustment to lower levels. Despite slow activity, 
some businesses seem reluctant to curb capital spending, but others 
emphasized only sluggishness ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Plans for sizable layoffs by a major upstate manufacturer of office 
equipment suggest that unemployment in some localities may jump. 
Many concerns are relying on attrition and careful hiring practices 
to hold employment down. Poor economic conditions have moderated 
wage increases for firms not locked into pre-existing contracts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook of our business directors changed from "wait-and-see" to 
outright gloom: the weakness has now spread to all basic industries, 
and while high technology industries and services may be holding up, 
they fear a serious recession is in the making; the weakening in 
retail sales of department stores and mass merchandisers have left 
inventories at undesirably high levels and the outlook for holiday 
sales has turned quite uneasy. Other respondents were less 
pessimistic, with the fourth quarter flat to slightly down and 
moderate growthâ€”2-3 percentâ€”foreseen for 1982. These 
respondents' current projections indicate the prime rate could fall 
to the 14 percent to 16 percent range by the end of the year, a 
larger drop than was anticipated in September. The inflation outlook 
is unchanged, with an 8 percent to 9 percent CPI expected for 1982 
as a whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Senior lending officials at the major New York City banks generally 
reported strong demand for business loans in the month of October. 
The major reasons cited for the firm loan demand were the 
deterioration of the long-term bond market and the dwindling cash 
flow of corporations. It was noted that inventory financing has not 
been excessive and is unlikely to create any problems in the near 
future. During the coming months, credit demand is expected to 
soften slightly as business activity declines. However, in 
anticipation of a short recession, bank officers also expect lending 
activity to pick up by the beginning of next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from James O'Leary (U.S. Trust Company) 
and Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty Trust Company):
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Leary: Virtually all of the economic indicators are now confirming 
that general business activity is worsening. High interest rates are 
biting. Federal Reserve policy is on the right course. There is room 
for the authorities to encourage a stronger rate of increase in M1B 
and a continuing decline of short-term rates. But such a move should 
be carried out with great care so that it will be perceived as being 
within the framework of maintaining a "steady" policy position and 
not one that aggressively expands money supply to head off a serious 
recession. I anticipate a further significant decline of short-term 
rates in the next few months, which would be healthy if it does not 
go too far as it did during the second quarter of 1980. It would 
surprise me, however, if long-term rates declined very much in any 
lasting way during the next several months due to the fact that the 
supply of funds for the purchase of long-term, fixed-rate bonds and 
mortgages is not apt to be large enough to satisfy the huge backed-
up demands for such financing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: A marked shift in sentiment has occurred and we now expect 
negative real growth for at least this quarter. Recovery may be slow 
because long-term interest rates will probably remain quite high in 
relation to underlying conditions. The Fed should continue its 
current policy along gradual easing of short-term ratesâ€”any 
abrupt changes could be counter-productive by arousing fears of a 
rapid reversal such as was witnessed in the fall of 1980 and the 
spring of this year.
