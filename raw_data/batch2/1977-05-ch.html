      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A broad uptrend in activity continues in the Seventh District. Most 
observers expect the expansion to continue through the remainder of 
the year. The Administration's energy plan has received mixed 
reviews. Retail sales trends are favorable. Output and employment 
are rising in most areas. Order backlogs are increasing in most 
industries. The pace of price inflation has quickened somewhat, and 
further boosts are expected. Order lead times are lengthening 
gradually. Some producers of capital goods report substantial 
increases in orders, but prospects for new plant construction in 
this region remain poor. The market for single family homes is 
extremely strong. District farmland values continue to rise at a 
rapid pace.
      <p>
       District observers look favorably upon the Administration's attempt 
  to impress the public with the seriousness of the energy problem. 
  The need for a concrete "energy policy," even one with defects that 
  could be remedied later, has been strongly urged for years by 
  informed people. However, the proposed program is viewed as one 
  sided, with its heavy emphasis on slowing demand and with little to 
  offer in the way of incentives to increase supplies. The 
  Administration's program is viewed as excessively complicated. Few 
  of the specifics are expected to pass Congress without alteration, 
  and, then, only after substantial delays. Although a rise in oil and 
  gas prices to world or "replacement cost" levels is desirable, and 
  the sooner the better, the expected degree of conservation is 
  believed to be optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       A major oil company emphasizes that its investments on exploration 
  and development are determined by internal cash flow, and available 
  cash would be less under the Administration's program than 
  currently. District electric utilities are largely oriented toward 
  coal and nuclear plants and are not much affected by the proposed 
  restrictions on gas and oil. Major utilities here deplore the 
  deemphasis of the breeder reactor, which currently appears to be the 
  only feasible means of supplying adequate energy in the years ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of the energy plan on business investment prospects is 
  not clear. We have learned of no specific investment decisions that 
  have been either accelerated or delayed as a result of the messages. 
  With the future of the legislation in doubt, moreover, specific 
  calculations as to the impact of higher prices, taxes, and tax 
  credits are not possible. Most business executives do not believe 
  that investment tax credits provide a major incentive, although the 
  tax savings clearly provide additional investment funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well-managed and well-financed industrial and utility companies have 
  been planning and investing with an eye to fuel conservation, in 
  general, and gas and oil, in particular, for at least four years. 
  They needed no warnings concerning current and probable future 
  supply stringencies. Most companies have an ''energy czar'' who 
  coordinates all energy-related policies for all facilities wherever 
  located.
      </p>
      <p>
       Owners of both commercial and industrial buildings send 
  representatives to periodic meetings with other companies and 
  government officials to consider energy problems. Existing 
  structures are being renovated by adding insulation, new windows, 
  and siding. Arrangements are being made to provide additional 
  storage for fuel oil and propane and to reduce use of natural gas. 
  Various manufacturers have acquired their own gas and coal 
  properties, either for direct use or to barter. Manufacturers of 
  instruments, controls, valves, and whole systems that regulate 
  energy use are doing an excellent business. Any appropriation urged 
  as an energy measure is said to receive rapid approval by boards of 
  directors. All of these factors were at work prior to the 
  Administration's recent proposals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction of large new industrial and utility plants is at a low 
  level in the district, and no significant pickup is expected in the 
  near future. Stringent federal and state environmental controls are 
  said to restrict new developments to an important degree. Currently, 
  the major concern is air pollution. EPA regulations issued in 
  December, in effect, state that no new major "source" of emissions 
  can be constructed unless an "offset" is provided by reducing 
  emissions from other sources. Some analysts insist that the 
  standards established for various emissions are unreasonably severe, 
  even unworkable. These air quality restrictions do not seem to apply 
  to new equipment installed in existing structures, and help explain 
  the rising share of capital spending accounted for by equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major retailers report a continued high level of retail sales with 
  furniture and appliances—both large and small—showing new 
  strength. Inventories of these items are said to be "thin." General 
  merchandise sales are expected to be up 10 or 11 percent for the 
  year as a whole with prices averaging about 5 percent higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales of single family homes are "phenomenal" and may reflect "panic 
  buying." Mortgage funds are in good supply, but interest rates and 
  fees have been increased moderately by S&amp;Ls. Processing of loans is 
  at "capacity." Buyers are not favoring sites closer to centers of 
  population, and most are not much concerned about fuel bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Producers of equipment for constructions, mining, materials 
  handling, and metalworking report a significant rise in orders in 
  the past month of two. Order backlogs are building up again.
