      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 6, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions continue to improve in the Seventh District, but 
the extent of the recovery has been less satisfactory than in the 
nation generally. Confidence of executives and consumers, overall, 
is at the highest level in several years. The strongest improvement 
has been in motor vehicles, where the outlook is clouded by 
complicated labor- management negotiations now in progress. Most 
producers of mechanical capital goods report gains over last year's 
severely depressed conditions, but the revival is far from 
satisfactory, especially in farm equipment. Export markets remain 
weak. Attempts to cut labor costs against union opposition have led 
to new confrontations, and threatened closings of additional 
factories and stores. Some electric utilities are under severe 
financial stress, mainly because of problems with nuclear plants. 
Retail sales continue at good levels, especially durables. Price 
inflation remains moderate. Except for some types of motor vehicles, 
there are no significant supply restraints. Paper and paperboard 
producers are operating near capacity. Housing activity, 
increasingly, is restricted by high interest rates and availability 
of credit. Nonresidential building prospects, in contrast, have 
strengthened. Both residential and nonresidential construction 
activity are far below levels of the late 1970s. Crop conditions 
generally are favorable, but many farmers are burdened by debts 
incurred in earlier years and are holding back on continents. 
Farmland values have declined further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Versus Nation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Attitudes expressed at gatherings of financial and business 
executives in the Seventh District seldom reflect the felicitous 
aura of most evaluations from New York and Washington. Prosperity 
has not returned to the Midwest. The best evidence is found in 
employment data. The rise in payroll employment since late 1982 has 
been only half as great in the five-state area as in the nation. 
Manufacturing employment has increased somewhat faster here than in 
the U.S. in this period (largely because of motor vehicles), but 
remains 20 percent below the levels of five years ago. Non-
manufacturing employment has increased only slightly here and 
remains below the levels of 1979, in contrast to substantial gains 
in the U.S. Comparisons of changes in income and retail sales with 
the nation reflect these trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Reasons for District Problems
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reasons for the weaker situation in this region relative to the 
nation are varied and complex. No relief is in sight. Most important 
has been the limited recovery in capital goods—including machine 
tools and equipment for construction, agriculture, mining, and 
railroads. Second, aside from weak domestic markets, durable goods 
producers have been especially hard hit by declines in exports and 
by increases in imports. Third, continued financial stress seriously 
depresses agriculture and businesses that serve farmers. Fourth, 
construction activity remains far below earlier peaks. Fifth, many 
District financial institutions, public utilities, state and local 
governments, and hospitals have been forced to curtail employment. 
Finally, most areas in the region have seen slow growth or declines 
in population, which both reflect and contribute to the problems 
described above.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Negotiations
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor-management negotiations over adjustments in labor costs have 
led to confrontations, sometimes bitter, in a variety of industries, 
including food retailing, machine tools, meatpacking, and 
state/local government. Some unions have voted heavily against 
proposals to cut wages and tighten work rules, even with the 
understanding that their facilities will close. In many cases, the 
main issue is a lower starting wage with freedom to use more part-time workers. A strike is expected in coal mining in October and 
utilities are increasing coal stocks. By far the most important 
negotiations, directly involving 500,000 workers, began in the auto 
industry on July 23. Unions want higher wages now and in subsequent 
years, larger pensions, job guarantees, and a reversal of 
concessions agreed to in early 1982. Managements wish to hold down 
such claims and also limit health benefits. Companies are making 
record profits; the UAW has a record strike fund. Managements 
threaten to increase foreign sourcing of components if a 
satisfactory agreement is not reached. Detroit sources describe both 
sides as outwardly optimistic on a settlement, but "negotiations 
will be the most complicated and difficult in their 47-year 
history." The outcome will be anxiously awaited throughout industry 
because the auto agreement usually has set the tone for subsequent 
negotiations in farm and construction equipment, rubber, and steel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction has held up surprisingly well so far, but a 
decline appears to be imminent. In the first half of 1984, housing 
permits in the five-state region were up 25 percent from 1983, and 
double the 1982 level. However, permits were less than half as great 
as in 1977 or 1978. Nationally, permits this year have about equaled 
the strong performance of 1977-78. Current effective mortgage rates 
approaching 15 percent are barring many potential buyers, especially 
second-time buyers. Recent levels of housing activity have been 
aided by extensive use of ARMs. But high default rates on ARMs, 
double that on fixed rate loans according to a major insurer, have 
caused lenders and borrowers to re-examine this device. Private 
mortgage insurers headquartered in this region (which depends 
heavily on private insurance) wish to raise their rates on ARMs by 
40-50%.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      High financing charges do not appear to be slowing the recovery in 
nonresidential building. One analyst lists 27 large, new commercial 
buildings planned for the Chicago area, mainly downtown. Substantial 
office vacancies still exist, but leasing volume has increased and 
large blocks of prime space (50-100,000 square feet) are relatively 
scarce. Only one large, new building will open in downtown Chicago 
in 1985. Manufacturing building contracts also have increased from a 
very low base. Store construction has strengthened, but is 
concentrated in individual buildings or small shopping centers. 
Dodge nonresidential construction contracts (in square feet) in the 
first half of 1984 were double the level of 1982 in the five-state 
area. However, they were only half as great as in 1978. For the 
nation, first half volume was within 10 percent of 1978.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District farmland values continue to edge downward, reflecting low 
farm sector earnings of recent years and lackluster earnings 
prospects for the near future. Our latest survey of agricultural 
bankers indicates that District farmland values declined 1 percent 
in the second quarter and 7.5 percent in the year ending July 1. 
District farmland values are down about 20 percent from the 1981 
peak and are near the levels of late l978. Declines in the Midwest 
have been greater than in most other regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Electric Power
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The decision, announced July 16, to halt construction of a long-delayed nuclear power plant in Michigan has far-reaching 
consequences. Over 6,000 construction workers and technicians 
apparently will be dismissed. If the utility cannot raise rates 
sufficiently to offset an apparent $4 billion write-off, it may be 
forced into bankruptcy. This could threaten both its ability to 
supply adequate electric power and to purchase natural gas reserves 
needed for the winter. Ironically, its sales of power are up 
strongly this year to residential, commercial, and, especially, 
industrial customers for the first time in five years.
