      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 18, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence of recovery continues to grow, but certain sectors, 
particularly agriculture and the textile and chemical industries, 
remain weak. Retail sales, especially of consumer durables, are 
still on the upswing. Construction continues the previously reported 
resurgence. The financial sector shows modest improvement, but 
uncertainty prevails in some local markets. The upsurge in tourism 
remains concentrated geographically, but the increase in the volume 
of air travel appears to be spreading.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Signs of recovery in manufacturing output 
and employment are uneven. Orders in the lumber industry are 
strengthening. After an extended period of economic slack, shipments 
of phosphates have revived in Florida. In contrast, output and 
employment in the textile industry have not yet responded to the 
upturn in economic activity. Nonetheless, industry representatives 
are optimistic. They expect increasing auto sales and new housing 
construction to boost orders for tire cord, upholstery, carpeting, 
and draperies. Still, they express concern about the cost of 
financing new equipment required to become competitive with foreign 
producers. Spokesmen for the petrochemical industry in Louisiana and 
Mississippi foresee little improvement in demand for petrochemicals. 
Engineering firms report that companies are not expanding product 
lines but are exploring alternatives with higher profit potential. 
Many establishments are shifting to more lucrative specialty 
chemicals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers report continued sales gains 
in March and April. Retail sales performance in the Southeast, 
especially in Orlando and Atlanta, is reportedly better than in 
other parts of the country. Department store officials say that 
current promotional activity rather than recovery in the housing 
industry is spurring sales and higher-than-usual inventories. 
Merchants expect retail sales to weaken in May but look for a strong 
back-to-school season. Both attendance and orders at the fall 
apparel buyers' market in Atlanta were up 15 percent over last year. 
Retailers reportedly stepped up their buying because sales have been 
strengthening in recent months. District motor vehicle sales in 
April continued the upward trend of the past few months. Automobile 
dealers say that sales of full-size, luxury models and light trucks 
are responsible for most of the improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Officers of financial institutions expect mortgage 
rates to continue declining through May. Reports from building 
permit offices indicate April and May applications are at least as 
strong as March, during which they were up sharply in spite of bad 
weather. Our respondents believe the strong permit data during the 
first four months of the year reflect the true strength of 
residential housing demand. Those we polled see a general firming of 
house prices and in some areas outright price hikes by means of the 
elimination of builder buy-downs and other discounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Georgia anticipate new 
construction and office space absorption to be at lower levels in 
1983 than in 1982. Sources in Florida, Louisiana, and Alabama are 
more optimistic yet cautious. Contacts report a hiatus in new 
construction of large shopping centers in Georgia, Alabama, 
Mississippi, and Tennessee. Shopping center construction in Florida 
and Louisiana is characterized as steady with good prospects for 
picking up in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Legislators in Florida and Tennessee have effectively 
defeated bills to allow interstate banking in their respective 
states. Proponents of the Florida legislation maintained that 
interstate banking would provide more capital for loans, expand the 
state's tax base, and create some healthy competition. Although 
tabled, the Florida bill could come up later this year. Advocates of 
the Tennessee legislation argued that out-of-state acquisition of 
some local banks would relieve the lack of confidence in the state's 
financial industry caused by the failure of United American Bank 
(UAB). Bankers claim the FDIC's failure to honor loan participations 
purchased by Tennessee and Kentucky banks from the now defunct UAB 
could further weaken some already shaken institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts report an expanded increase in the volume of air 
traffic at regional airports. Smaller carriers are introducing 
service to many local airports that major airlines abandoned 
following deregulation. However, financial conditions for 
southeastern carriers remain troubled despite a slight abatement in 
the intensity of airfare competition. Our contacts do not expect 
financial conditions for District-based carriers to improve until at 
least the third quarter. In other sectors of the travel market 
strength remains concentrated geographically: Central Florida is 
booming, while lodgings and attractions in south Florida, Tennessee, 
and Louisiana languish. Atlanta's convention trade continues to be 
troubled by shortened stays and drop-offs in bookings although 
volume is up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Declining demand for short-term credit by District 
farmers reflects continuing weakness in agriculture. Except in 
Georgia, loans outstanding from the Production Credit Association 
fell in every District state in the first quarter relative to the 
previous quarter. The poultry industry is reeling from the side 
effects of the Payment-In-Kind program. Feed grain price increases 
of $10-30 per ton have resulted in a 2-5 cents per dozen climb in 
the cost of egg production. Large supplies, a declining export 
market, and weak domestic demand have led to a sharp drop in egg 
prices here. A substantial improvement in the weather has allowed 
farmers to make up much of their planting, but corn and cotton crops
remain behind schedule, and yield reductions on late-planted corn 
are possible. Corn supplies are likely to be below normal in 
southern states in July and August.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Panel of Economists
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our panel of economists is almost evenly 
divided in its recommendations for monetary policy. Half believe 
that current Fed policy is appropriate, and half think that money 
supply growth should be reduced to a steady rate, ranging from 5 to 
10 percent. Similarly, about half of those surveyed expect inflation 
to average 4 percent in 1983; the remaining members anticipate a 
more rapid acceleration in prices. Almost all expect inflation to 
reach at least 5-6 percent in 1984. By a narrow majority, they look 
for the foreign exchange rate of the dollar to fall this year. The 
most frequently cited signs of local recovery continue to center on 
the construction industry-housing and commercial building, real 
estate, and lumber manufacturing. However, a few respondents mention 
improving labor markets, increases in consumer spending, and some 
upturn in manufacturing. No pattern is evident in regard to the next 
phase of recovery. Nearly everyone on our panel regards housing 
demand as strong enough to sustain the current pace of construction 
activity.
