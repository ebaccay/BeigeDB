      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 16, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy remains entrenched in recession. 
Consumer spending is not leading the recovery, despite the tax cut, 
while unemployment is rising. Residential construction is still 
depressed, and non-residential construction is now slowing down in 
many areas of the District. The lumber industry continues to suffer 
from mill closures, layoffs, low prices, and foreign competition. 
Metal prices are still too low to reopen any closed mines. In 
agriculture, low crop prices are contributing to low farm incomes, 
and unseasonable rains recently caused large losses for some 
California crops. Depository institutions appear to be gaining funds 
with new types of deposit accounts, but the large amount of funds 
coming due in balloon-payment mortgages is a major concern among 
financial institutions. A survey of Twelfth District Directors 
indicates that unemployment is almost universally expected to 
increase further on both a national and regional basis, but the 
recent rise in bond and stock prices are seen by some as an 
optimistic sign.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continuing high levels of unemployment appear to be holding back any 
recovery in consumer spending. Despite the recent tax cut, retail 
sales continued to be weak in August and September, as retail stores 
failed to benefit from back-to-school buying. Weak sales in early 
October are threatening even the holiday season's upturn. In many 
parts of the District, auto sales continue to be slow, despite a 
wide variety of sales pitches. With high consumer loan rates, 
consumer credit is not increasing in southern California or Utah. 
One bright spot, tourism in Oregon, is estimated to be up 10 percent 
this year over last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing and mining continue to be depressed in the Twelfth 
District. In the lumber industry, at least four more major plants 
and mills have closed recently in Oregon and Washington, and more 
are expected to close before the end of the year. In Idaho, the wood 
products industry is still operating at a very low level of 
activity. Prices of some major lumber items are now half what they 
were in 1979. As a consequence, prices on federal timber contracts 
made several years ago are well above market. To avoid defaults and 
further curtailment of activity, the canceling of some contracts has 
been proposed. It is believed that wood pulp and paper producers are 
losing 20-25 percent of their business to foreign imports. While 
silver prices are up from a recent low, they are not high enough or 
firm enough to reopen any of the closed mining operations in Idaho. 
Unemployment in the mining areas is very high, and many workers face 
the expiration of their benefits in early 1983. The copper and steel 
industries existence in Utah are threatened by continued low prices 
for these products. In the Seattle area, Boeing continues to 
eliminate several hundred jobs each month; employment at Boeing is 
expected to fall from 85,000 last year to 70,000 by the end of this 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Late summer brought no signs of recovery for the housing industry, 
though recent declines in mortgage rates have been cause for some 
optimism. By the end of 1982, the number of new residential permits 
issued in Utah will have fallen by 70 percent from the 1977 all-time 
high, making this housing recession the longest and most severe on 
record. New permits in Oregon so far this year are at less than a 
tenth of 1979 levels. The nonresidential construction picture is 
mixed. In Oregon, this activity dropped 30 percent in August from 
July. In Los Angeles, nonresidential construction has slowed down; 
some projects have been canceled, including a few that were 
underway, because long-term financing could not be found. In 
Washington, however, commercial construction remains strong, 
although office vacancies are rising; and, in Utah, nonresidential 
construction was up 153 percent in August from a year ago. Signs 
that inflationary expectations are coming down are to be found in 
the low bids for various large highway construction projects in 
Washington State; these bids were half the previously estimated 
cost.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cold and wet weather in late August and September has caused some 
dramatic crop losses in California, which have been estimated to 
amount to between $150 million and $300 million. Raisins, wine 
grapes, and almonds all suffered losses. Low prices and rain have 
combined to cut farmers' income from this year's harvest of alfalfa, 
tomatoes, and lima beans. Low prices and weak demand continue to 
keep farm income low, and are threatening farmers in some areas with 
the loss of their farms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The drop in interest rates appears to have generated demand for 
restructuring debt, rather than much new investment. Increased 
inquiries about home loans may signal a real estate market 
improvement, but may also result from borrowers' desire to refinance 
balloon payment loans amounting to an estimated several billion 
dollars. The new variable rate account is attracting funds to 
depository institutions, and there has been some recovery in core 
deposits recently. Delinquencies and bankruptcies are not causing 
noticeable problems, though some financial institutions are having 
to take over real estate. A survey of Twelfth District Directors 
indicates that recent declines in interest rates have not reduced 
the number of problem loans and a substantial reduction will not 
occur until the economy improves.
