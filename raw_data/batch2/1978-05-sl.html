      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business activity in the Eighth District has continued to register 
  gains in recent weeks. While consumer spending on many summer-related items has been retarded by unfavorable weather, automobile 
  sales have shown considerable strength. Inventories of some items 
  are reported to be higher than desired, but this situation is not 
  viewed with alarm, and retailers generally remain optimistic about 
  future sales gains. Manufacturing activity continues to advance in 
  several key industries, including suppliers of homebuilding 
  products, transportation equipment, and chemicals. Demand for 
  single-family homes continues to be strong, but concerns were 
  expressed by homebuilders about their prospects next year. Some 
  savings and loan associations, as well as commercial banks,
  registered either declines or no change in time and savings deposits 
  in April. With strong demand for mortgage credit, mortgage interest 
  rates have continued to increase. In the farming sector, crop 
  planting is behind schedule, although the situation is not critical 
  at this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The movements in retail sales were mixed in April as department 
  store sales were reported to be somewhat sluggish, but automobile 
  sales registered further gains. The sluggish performance of 
  department store sales was largely blamed by retailers on the 
  colder-than-normal spring weather which hampered sales of such items 
  as summer clothing and air-conditioning equipment. Inventories were 
  reported to be somewhat excessive for these items, but the sales 
  slump is not expected to be permanent and the inventory buildup is 
  not considered to be a serious problem at this time. Retail 
  passenger car and truck sales in April registered gains relative to 
  a year ago and dealer inventories are at desired levels for most 
  models.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturing activity continues to expand. Firms supplying the 
  homebuilding industry are among those experiencing continued strong 
  demand. A representative of a major appliance manufacturing firm 
  reported sizable increases in orders, particularly from the contract 
  business, but felt that the current growth rate was not sustainable 
  over the longer term. Firms manufacturing such building products as 
  connector plates, electrical fixtures, tools, other hardware, 
  paints, and coatings reported strong demand. In general, however, 
  the gains in 1978 are expected to be less than in 1977. The 
  transportation equipment industry is another sector showing strong 
  performance in the District. A representative of the automobile 
  industry reported automobile orders are running above a year ago and 
  assembly lines are operating at a high level. Aircraft, railroad 
  car, and barge manufacturing firms are also experiencing high levels 
  of demand for their products. The chemical industry, a major 
  industry in the District, has also made some gains recently. A 
  representative of a major chemical firm reported strong demand for 
  agricultural and industrial chemicals and some pickup in demand for 
  fibers after a poor first quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The District housing industry continues to "boom" with the gains 
  concentrated in the single-family market. The large order backlog of 
  new homes in the St. Louis area has not yet dissipated, reflecting 
  continued strong home sales. As construction activity has gained 
  some momentum this spring, shortages of skilled workers and 
  bricklayers are beginning to show up. However, such shortages are 
  not viewed by homebuilders as an insurmountable problem and 
  apprentice programs are bulging. Homebuilders are beginning to 
  express some fear about a sharp decline in home demand in the 
  future. Their special concerns are the possibility of 
  disintermediation, rising mortgage rates, and the continuation of 
  sharply rising costs of building supplies. Builders report that the 
  cost of building materials rose about 15 percent last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Representatives of some savings and loan associations reported a net 
  outflow of deposits in April. This was said to reflect improved 
  yields on short- and medium-term securities as well as renewed 
  interest in the stock market. Representatives of the savings and 
  loan industry report increased advertising budgets and more 
  offerings of premiums in an attempt to maintain or advance their 
  market share of savings. With strong demand for mortgages, 
  considerable upward pressure has been placed on mortgage interest 
  rates. Rates have advanced about 1/4 of one percentage point in the 
  St. Louis and Memphis areas since last month. Considerable concern 
  was also expressed by savings and loan representatives about the 
  recent action of the Federal Reserve which allows automatic 
  transfers between savings and demand accounts at commercial banks. 
  These officials fear that interest-sensitive funds would be 
  withdrawn from their institutions and thus reduce the supply of 
  credit to the housing industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similar to the savings and loan associations, small consumer time 
  and savings deposits at large commercial banks registered little or 
  no increase in April from a month earlier, although sizable 
  increases in the volume of large CDs occurred. Loan demand at 
  commercial banks showed considerable strength in April in both 
  commercial and industrial loans and consumer installment loans.
