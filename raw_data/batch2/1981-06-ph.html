      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity is 
sluggish to mixed, but hold some hope for improvement by year-end. 
Manufacturers report no real change in overall industrial activity, 
with payrolls holding steady for the fifth consecutive month. They 
expect a sharp upturn in the industrial sector to come some time in 
the next two quarters. Local retail merchants say they are well 
ahead of last year levels, owing, at least in part, to big 
promotional campaigns. The balance of '81 looks good also, as 
retailers expect sales to continue growing. Third District bankers 
report sluggish to mixed loan activity. C&amp;I loan volume is up 
marginally in June, but consumer loans are down sharply. Looking 
ahead to December, District bankers forecast slight improvement in 
business borrowing and expect the current decline in retail 
borrowing to level off. On the residential construction scene, sales 
have dropped off sharply as high mortgage rates have discouraged 
many buyers, according to area real estate contacts. Contractors and 
developers are holding off on new groundbreakings until they are 
more certain about future mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Area manufacturers responding to the June Business Outlook Survey 
report no change in the level of overall industrial activity from 
last month. Specific indicators are mixed. Factory shipments are up 
marginally in June, while new orders are off slightly for the first 
time this year. Inventories, following last month's spurt, have 
slipped back fractionally. As for employment, the first half of 1981 
has been a period of stagnation for area factory workers and this 
month appears to be no exception. June survey participants report, 
for the fifth consecutive month, no real change in factory 
employment. However, a marginal increase in the average workweek is 
reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the sluggishness that has beset area industry since January, 
local manufacturers have retained their optimism. Respondents to the 
June survey are confident, predicting a strong boost for business 
within the next six months. Over one-half of the respondents 
anticipate growth in new orders between now and December, while a 
slightly smaller portion project increased shipments by year-end. 
Producers' backlogs are expected to swell marginally. The upbeat 
outlook may be good news for area labor, as manufacturers plan to 
increase payrolls and lengthen working hours in the second half of 
1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the inflation front, industrial prices are up again in June. Over 
60 percent of the survey participants report paying more for raw 
materials than they did a month ago and nearly 40 percent say they 
are charging more for the products they sell. Area manufacturers 
expect inflation to continue throughout the balance of 1981, as over 
three-quarters of the respondents expect input costs to increase by 
year-end and about two-thirds plan to raise their own prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to area retailers, June sales are well ahead of last 
year's levels, surpassing all expectations by a good bit. Reports of 
sales volume in June range from 10 to 15 percent above mid-1980 
figures, as big-promotional campaigns helped to boost business. 
Credit card sales appear to be about even with early 1980 levels, 
matching the volume that existed before the 1980 credit restraint 
program was instituted. Credit collections are fair to good. Sales 
of soft goods, particularly men's and women's quality sportswear, 
are doing well, and big ticket items are starting to pick up.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, area merchants are optimistic, expecting sales 
in coming months to run 6-8 percent above year-earlier figures. 
According to some contacts, consumer confidence appears to be 
growing with the anticipation of tax cuts and further easing of 
inflation. Local merchants look for a strong finish in 1981, 
anticipating a big fourth quarter as seasonal factors give sales an 
added boost.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers report sluggish-to-mixed loan activity in 
June. C&amp;I volume is up modestly, 4 to 6 percent, over year-ago 
figures, which is in line with area bankers' expectations for the 
most part. Consumer loans, on the other hand, are off as much as 15 
percent from June '80 levels. In order to boost business loan 
demand, some below-prime lending is taking place, but bankers are 
shying away from making fixed-rate loans. Looking ahead to the 
balance of 1981, bankers expect business loans to show slight 
improvement by year-end, and retail loans are expected to bottom 
out, putting a halt, at least temporarily, to the steady decline in 
consumer borrowing observed since April 1980.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows in the Third District are also mixed. Demand deposit 
levels are about 4 percent below year-ago figures as area bankers 
are still adjusting to the institution of NOW accounts. Savings and 
time deposits are up slightly this month, and CDs are in line with 
budgets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 20 percent. 
Projections of the prime indicate an anticipated turnabout from the 
recent trend of rising rates. Cuts in the prime are expected to 
leave the rate 300 to 500 basis points below its current level by 
December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing sales in the Third District have dropped sharply again this 
month compared with year-ago levels. Residential sales are down as 
much as 50 percent from June '80 figures. With conventional mortgage 
rates at 16 1/2 percent, more and more buyers are pulling out of the 
market, causing a softening in residential prices. Contractors and 
developers are holding off on new groundbreakings until interest 
rates come down. Even then, however, many builders are, as one 
contact put it, "sitting on the sidelines" waiting for pre-sale 
commitments before going back to work.
