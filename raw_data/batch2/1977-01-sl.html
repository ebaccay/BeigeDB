      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Eighth District businessmen are generally confident that the 
recovery will continue in 1977. The lull in business activity last 
summer and early fall has continued into recent weeks for some 
industries, but a number of other firms report that activity has 
gained momentum. Retail sales have been strong over the holiday and 
post-holiday season. Prospects for capital spending, on the other 
hand, are mixed. In general, such spending is expected to increase 
in 1977, but in some industries little change from a year ago is 
foreseen. Homebuilding made good gains in several areas of the 
District in 1976 and further gains are anticipated in 1977. Thrift 
institutions continue to experience large increases in deposits on a 
seasonally adjusted basis and mortgage rates have edged downward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Major retailers report that sales were generally excellent over the 
Christmas season. One major department store in the St. Louis area 
reported 3 to 4 percent gains in real terms, although aggressive 
merchandising was necessary to move goods. Reports from smaller 
retailers in the nonmetropolitan areas over the District were mixed. 
An appliance and stereo equipment retailer in the St. Louis area 
noted that sales were more sluggish than anticipated over the early 
part of the Christmas season, but a surge of buying in the last few 
days before Christmas made up for the earlier slowness. Also recent 
reports indicate that post-Christmas sales have been excellent.
       </p>
       <p>
        A sizable number of manufacturing firms indicate improving economic 
conditions in recent months. A paper industry representative 
reported that year-end business was very strong with sales 10 
percent larger in December than a year earlier. A small manufacturer 
of welding and cutting equipment has had a marked improvement in 
sales beginning in mid-November, and additional workers have been 
added to the work force. Part of the demand for this firm resulted 
from increased export sales. Other firms noting improvement in 
recent weeks include a manufacturer of apparel, a food processing 
firm, and a manufacturer of refrigeration equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some notable exceptions to this improving picture can be cited, 
however. For instance, a representative of a large chemical firm 
states that sales have been flat recently, although 1976 sales 
averaged above those of 1975. Among industrial chemicals, sales of 
detergents are flat and polystyrene sales are described as quite 
weak, but some other plastic products are doing fairly well. The 
outlook is bright for sales of agricultural chemicals this year. The 
steel industry continues in a lull according to a local 
representative. Considerable excess capacity continues to plague 
this industry, although shipments are expected to increase 6 to 7 
percent this year. A large boost in investment spending is needed 
before the steel industry will gain much momentum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prospects are mixed for capital spending. A representative of a 
major capital producing firm reported that no major increase in 
spending is foreseen for 1977. Investment spending in the paper, 
steel and chemical industries is at a relatively low level. 
Particularly flat is nonresidential construction spending. A number 
of firms in the food processing industry, however, have announced 
sizable investment plans for 1977. In the St. Louis downtown area, 
several capital investment projects have also been announced for 
1977. Spending on such projects may total as much as in the past two 
years combined. Many of the projects are related to a new convention 
center which is scheduled for opening later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Homebuilding made considerable progress in most areas of the 
District in 1976, and prospects are for further increases this year. 
In the St. Louis metropolitan area 6,000 single-family homes were 
built in 1976, up from about 4,000 in 1975. Apartment building, 
however, remained at generally low levels throughout the District. 
Some projections for 1977 homebuilding in the St. Louis area point 
to a 15 percent increase this year from the 1976 level. Apartments, 
however, are expected to total less than 10 percent of the new units 
built this year. Memphis has continued to unwind from the 
overbuilding of earlier years, but construction of single-family 
homes is running above year earlier levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bright prospects for homebuilding are partially related to 
favorable developments at thrift institutions. These institutions 
continue to report large deposit gains. Some institutions report net 
gains during the Christmas season, a period usually characterized by 
net withdrawals. Smaller passbook accounts apparently behaved in the 
normal seasonal pattern, but increases in time certificates more 
than offset these declines. Deposit gains have also been strong in 
early January and are generally expected to continue upward through 
the spring months, reflecting the favorable rates offered by savings 
and loans relative to other market rates. Effective rates on time 
certificates offered by these institutions, however, have been 
edging downward over the past six weeks, as both rates and terms 
have been adjusted. Mortgage interest rates have also been inching
downward over recent weeks, another favorable sign for the 
homebuilding industry.
