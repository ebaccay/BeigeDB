      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fourth District continues to increase, but 
labor market conditions remain weaker than in the nation. Retail 
sales improved in April from March, but gains for the March-April 
period are smaller than for the previous two months. Output and 
prices in manufacturing continue to rise, and some primary metals 
and automotive production lines are operating at capacity. Housing 
construction and sales remain strong. Strike-hedge demand for coal 
is rising. Business loan demand remains strong at commercial banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite steady recovery, labor market conditions in this District 
remain weaker than in the nation. A banker estimates the 
unemployment rate for eastern Kentucky to be 16%. Ohio's 
unemployment rate in March was 3.1 percentage points below its year-
earlier level but was still 2.4 percentage points above the national 
rate. Nevertheless, the average workweek in Ohio manufacturing 
increased 0.2 hours to 42.6 hours (n.s.a.) in March, after two 
months of declines, and the average workweek in automobile 
manufacturing increased to 46.2 hours, the highest since December 
1978.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates in eleven major metropolitan areas in this 
District in February ranged from 7.6% in Columbus to 13.3% in 
Pittsburgh. An index of leading indicator, for the Pittsburgh area 
has risen strongly in the last few months following a slowdown last 
autumn, suggesting substantial employment gains in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales recovered briskly in April from the previous month's 
slump. General merchandisers contacted, however, report less than 
10% year-over-year gain for the March-April period as compared with 
increases of about 11% to 12% in the previous two months. Much of 
the April strength was concentrated in soft goods, especially 
apparel. New cars sales remained quite strong in April. Both 
domestic and import dealers report solid, across-the-board sales 
strength, which is expected to persist through the reminder of the 
quarter. Shortages were reported for some larger size models, and 
the waiting period for some import models has lengthened to about 
eight weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Output and prices continue to rise. This Bank's survey of Fourth 
District manufacturers indicates that firms expected shipments to 
rise in April but at a slower pace than in March. A survey of 
northeastern Ohio purchasing managers indicates production and new 
orders rose again in April. Two-thirds of the respondents report 
prices paid are higher than a month ago, and none report lower 
prices. A survey of Cincinnati area purchasing managers indicates 
vendor performance is continuing to deteriorate while prices paid 
are rising. A major auto producer reports difficulty adding to 
production schedules that are at capacity for mid- and standard-size 
cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Primary Metals
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for sheet steel and aluminum remains strong. A major steel 
producer reports that production is at capacity for sheet steel, 
which is used primarily in automobiles. The firm suggests demand for 
sheet steel may not increase further because automobile production 
has peaked and steel imports are readily available. Area steel 
producers report growing demand from the capital goods sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major aluminum producer's fabricating facilities have been 
operating at capacity for a year. The firm is allocating supplies of 
aluminum sheet among customers for June and July deliveries because 
demand exceeds production capacity. The firm's smelters have been 
operating at capacity since autumn; however, some high cost smelters 
are closed and won't reopen unless aluminum prices increase by about 
two-thirds. World market prices of ingot aluminum have declined in 
the last three months despite apparent tight supplies, a phenomenon 
the firm cannot explain. World supplies of bauxite and aluminum are 
reported to be ample.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      House construction and sales remain strong but are sensitive to 
interest rates. Builders of single-family homes report that 
construction activity during the first quarter of 1984 was up from a 
year ago, and barring a further rise in interest rates, construction 
in 1984 would match or possibly exceed last year's total. The "move-
up" market remains strong and demand by first-time buyers is being 
bolstered by expectations that interest rates will edge up steadily 
as the year matures. Realtors, who reported record earnings in 1983, 
are currently experiencing a strong sales pace; even if interest 
rates rise slightly, they expect a fairly good housing market for 
the balance of 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lenders recently experienced a decline in mortgage applications. 
Applications for fixed-rate mortgages fell, but are being partially 
replaced by applications for adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). 
Lenders say ARMs will keep the market buoyant until initial ARM 
rates reach the 13% - 13 1/2% range, which lenders now consider the 
"tolerance" rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Coal
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Coal prices are rising and demand and shipments are increasing in 
eastern Kentucky. Utilities are reported to be increasing stockpiles 
as a hedge against a strike when the United Mine Workers' contract 
expires on September 30.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand remained strong at Fourth District banks in recent 
weeks. Business lending led the way and is expected to remain strong 
throughout the year. Consumer loans also increased, particularly 
auto loans. Bankers expect the pace of consumer lending to taper off 
somewhat, but expect overall loan demand to remain quite strong in 
the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Net deposit inflows have been relatively flat with the lack of 
growth partly attributed to the April 15th tax deadline. Loans have 
been financed to a large extent with borrowed and purchased funds, 
and from the sale of government securities. Bankers expect deposit 
growth to pick up moderately in the next two months.
