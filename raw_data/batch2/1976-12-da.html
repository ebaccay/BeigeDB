      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most regional economic indicators point to further strength in the 
  Southwest economy. Business loan demand at large District banks, 
  however, is expected to continue weak, with further downward 
  pressure on interest rates. Oil and gas production continues to 
  decline, but drilling activity and employment and income in the 
  industry continue to rise. Demand for labor continues to grow. 
  Unemployment is declining, and the unemployment rate for the five 
  states of the Eleventh District is down to 6.0 percent. A recovery 
  in construction activity appears to be taking hold in multifamily 
  housing and nonresidential building. A survey of department stores 
  found Christmas sales to be strong, and auto dealers reported 
  further growth in new car sales. Moreover, manufacturing output 
  should continue to grow at a moderate rate next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Department store sales are showing strong improvement. Almost all 
  retailers interviewed are optimistic about the prospects for robust 
  Christmas sales, and early indications seem to support their 
  optimism. Only at stores in border cities that cater to Mexican 
  nationals is business off substantially. Sales of both hard goods 
  and soft goods are reported to be strong. High-priced merchandise is 
  moving extremely well. Retail inventories are at desired levels and 
  in line with the anticipated volume of Christmas sales. A major 
  Dallas retailer stated that his inventories are at their best level 
  in three years. A director with a large nationwide group of 
  department stores reported a very conservative outlook for first 
  quarter 1977 with improvement in the second quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales in the District are up moderately, but sales in 
  Houston are at the highest level in three years. Demand for small 
  cars remains weak, while sales of intermediate- and full-size cars 
  continue to strengthen. Also, fleet demand remains strong, and sales 
  of vans, trucks, and jeeps are brisk. GM and AMC dealers indicate 
  that the rebate programs on subcompact models increased sales only 
  marginally. Dealer inventories of full- and intermediate-size models 
  are low, while stocks of small cars remain high. But nearly all 
  dealers report that inventories are gradually being brought into 
  balance. Some Houston dealers, however, cite overall inventory 
  levels are 30 to 50 percent lower than they would like.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing output in Texas continues to increase in most major 
  industries. However, output of petroleum refining; paper products; 
  and stone, clay, and glass products has weakened. A Houston 
  economist notes that durable goods production has been gaining 
  momentum in that area. And coupled with the high level of output of 
  nondurables, further gains in production should stimulate increased 
  capital spending in a few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The future increase in production by the Southwest's largest 
  industrial complex, petroleum refining and chemicals, could be 
  influenced by the anticipated price increase by OPEC. Most observers 
  expect an increase of 10 percent, which would lead to a one cent a 
  gallon increase in gasoline prices. However, there are differences 
  on the anticipated timing of the price hike. Some respondents expect 
  no immediate increase in oil prices but felt the increase would 
  certainly be imposed in the next six months. In any case, output by 
  the complex is expected to rise next year and may push existing 
  production capacity in some product lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovering from a slump earlier this year, the number of active oil 
  drilling rigs in Texas has risen to the highest level in 17 years. 
  Despite the high level of drilling activity, production of oil field 
  equipment has weakened. New orders have fallen as drilling 
  contractors, faced with higher equipment prices and increased 
  financing problems, are content to work their current inventory of 
  rigs more intensively. As a result, production of oil field 
  equipment next year probably will be geared largely to the 
  replacement of older equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production of primary metals is rising on relatively strong demand 
  for aluminum. Demand for steel and copper remains weak. Output of 
  steel, however, is expected to increase by next spring, but copper 
  production will remain little changed for most of next year. 
  Moreover, a high level of copper inventories will have to be run 
  down before production can be stepped up. Aluminum producers see a 
  gradual increase in product prices, while a Fort Worth steelmaker 
  expects prices of ferrous metals to remain soft. Another steel 
  producer thought the recently announced 6-percent increase in prices 
  for sheet steel would not hold.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recovery in construction activity is beginning to spur the 
  demand for lumber in Texas. Current inventory levels of lumber range 
  from "adequate to low." And lumber prices have climbed to the high 
  levels that prevailed four years ago, according to a lumber 
  brokerage firm. A Houston company anticipates that the demand and 
  prices for lumber will continue to move up in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      In mining, production of oil and gas continues to decline, but 
  drilling activity has rebounded sharply from a low last June. 
  Drilling in Texas has surpassed the peak level of output attained a 
  year ago. In uranium mining, one District state—an important 
  producer—is considering a large increase of its tax on "yellow 
  cake."
     </p>
     <p>
      Grain sorghum prices have fallen substantially in recent months. And 
  in response to lower feed costs, the number of cattle placed on feed 
  is up in the District's major feeding areas. Pressured between high 
  production costs and low prices, grain farmers are reported to be "in trouble" and may press vigorously for higher price supports.
