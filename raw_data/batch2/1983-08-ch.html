      <strong>
       August 10, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for total business activity in the Seventh District is 
still favorable, but there are disturbing signs. Most important, the 
modest recovery in housing is seriously threatened by recent 
increases in mortgage interest rates. Secondly, the District's 
important producer goods industries have shown only scattered gains 
from abysmal levels. Inventories remain lean, overall, and are not 
expected to increase significantly because of ready availability of 
new supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increases in total income and employment in the District since last 
December have lagged the nation. District employment had declined 
much more sharply from the prosperous levels of the late 1970's than 
the national total and: this gap has widened further. The strongest 
sectors have been home construction, full-sized autos, light trucks, 
furniture, appliances, recreational vehicles, and defense equipment. 
But most of these are far below past peaks. Paperboard shipments 
have increased in line with the general economy. Steel shipments 
will be up in 1983, but probably less than had been anticipated 
earlier. Retail sales are well above last year, with both hard and 
soft goods aided by hot weather. Among construction materials, 
demand for gypsum board is strong for both residential and
nonresidential uses. Prices are rising again, on average, but no 
resurgence of general inflation is foreseen in the months 
immediately ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Corn and soybean crops in the Corn Belt have been damaged 
significantly by several weeks of hot, dry weather. Yields will be 
down at least 8-10 percent, possibly much more if conditions do not 
improve soon. While the effect of lower crop yields on farm income 
is probably positive, farmers have sharply reduced purchases of 
operating supplies in line with reduced needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Heat Wave
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the District has been afflicted by unusually warm weather 
since mid-June. Effects on economic activity have been multiplying. 
Retail sales of summer merchandise have been stimulated. Electric 
power consumption, mainly because of air conditioning, has set new 
records, with electric bills further inflated by high summer rates. 
Traffic through housing developments was reduced, in the opinion of 
builders. Finally, crop damage from hot, dry weather is the largest 
in years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mortgage Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The rise in the FHA/VA rate from 12.5 to 13.5 percent, effective 
August 1, merely recognized the increase that had already occurred 
in market rates. The going rate on 30-year conventionals is now 14-14.5 percent, up almost a full percentage point in the past month, 
and up two points since early May. The rise in mortgage rates has 
taken many potential buyers out of the market. Unless rates decline, 
the peak in housing probably is at hand if not already passed. Some 
S&amp;Ls; report a drop of 40 to 50 percent or more in loan applications 
since May. Total transactions are not off this much because mortgage 
bankers (and some S&amp;Ls) are achieving increasing success with 
programs to sell home buyers on various types of adjustable rate 
mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction-Residential
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Building permits for housing, which remained at improved levels 
through June, may have slipped in July. In the first half, single-family permits in the Chicago area were more than triple last year's 
level, but apartment permits were up less than 20 percent. Despite 
the large increases from last year, single-family permits were only 
half as large as in the comparable period of 1977 (the record 
level), while apartment permits were only one-fifth as large.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Producer Equipment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Experience of producers located in the Seventh District generally 
does not reflect the improvement indicated by national aggregate 
data on orders, production, and purchases of equipment. The 
difference is traceable to the relatively small involvement here in 
electronic equipment—data processing, communications, and robotics—which is doing well. There has been a small rise in demand for heavy 
trucks and trailers, but demand for most types of equipment for 
construction, agriculture, electricity generation, railroads, 
mining, oil and gas well drilling, materials handling, and 
metalworking has remained very slow. In some cases operations are at 
the lowest level since the 1930s. Some plants are closed for good 
and others have been idle for 6 months or more at a time. Domestic 
producers of equipment often have large margins of excess capacity, 
and much good used equipment is available. In addition,, there have 
been sharp declines in exports to OPEC nations. Imports have 
increased, particularly from Japan. In many cases, imports 
(including a widening range of equipment and components) are of 
excellent quality. Imports are readily available at low prices and 
on favorable credit terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the first half of 1983 the rate of increase in payroll employment 
in Michigan exceeded the national increase as auto firms recalled 
workers. Data for Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin showed smaller 
percentage increases than the nation, while Iowa showed no rise at 
all. For the five states combined, payroll employment in the second 
quarter was 10 percent below the level of 1979, while manufacturers' 
employment was off 25 percent. Hiring intentions are somewhat 
stronger than last year, but there is no near-term prospect of 
significantly reducing the shortfall relative to 1979. Many 
companies that reduced employment by one third to over one half have 
no intention of rehiring significant numbers. Recruitment of new 
graduates at colleges is down 10 percent from last year, and down 40 
percent from two years ago. Help-wanted advertising in Chicago-area 
papers was 10 percent above last year in the past two months, but it 
was less than half of 1981 volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer buying has increased in the District in the first half of 
1983, but not as much as in the nation--according to national 
chains. Hot weather permitted large sales of summer merchandise with 
less price discounting than last year. All types of appliances have 
been selling well. Room air conditioners have been the star, with 
shortages of some models. RVs are up 50 percent, and furniture up 30 
percent from 1982. Sales of full-sized domestic cars and many 
popular imports would have been even stronger if larger numbers had 
been available. Despite favorable sales trends in most consumer 
durables, physical volume is still well below the peak years of the 
1970s. Retail inventories, overall,, are somewhat low relative to 
sales based on historical comparisons. However, additional supplies 
of most general merchandise are available within one or two days. 
Blanket orders for general merchandise already negotiated indicate 
that significant price increases will not occur this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Extremely hot, dry weather during the second half of July apparently 
resulted in extensive damage to spring plantings in the Corn Belt. 
Local analysts believe that damage through the end of July lowered 
probable corn yields by a tenth from last year and soybean yields by 
8 percent. Prospective yield declines, coupled with sharp cuts in 
acreage under federal programs, may reduce corn and soybean harvests 
by 36 and 20 percent, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Weather damage varies throughout the District, but it is most 
extensive in central and southern Illinois and Indiana and southern 
Iowa. Further damage is possible if the hot, dry conditions extend 
into mid-August as some weather forecasters predict.
