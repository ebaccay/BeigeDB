      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 21, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business activity in the Eighth Federal Reserve District made modest 
  gains in January although production and sales were hampered by 
  adverse weather conditions. Retail sales registered small increases. 
  Inventories were generally at or near desired levels. Manufacturing 
  activity in most industries continues to increase. Home construction 
  remains at high levels, spurred by a backlog of new home sales. Net 
  savings inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits into 
  commercial banks and savings and loan associations continued to 
  increase, but the rate of growth has slowed substantially. Mortgage 
  interest rates have risen on both commercial and residential loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales registered modest gains in January compared with a year 
  ago. Sales were reportedly hurt by adverse weather conditions, 
  although last year's January sales were also adversely affected by 
  severe weather. Department store representatives reported somewhat 
  larger sales gains for durable goods than soft goods. Automobile 
  sales in the St. Louis area this year were about equal to the 
  January and early February sales of last year but inventories of new 
  cars are generally above desired levels. No significant inventory 
  problems were reported by other retailers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rate of growth in manufacturing appears to have slowed somewhat 
  in January from the December level, reflecting in part some weather-
  related problems and a slowdown in automobile production. Severe 
  weather slowed the delivery of raw materials and parts to a number 
  of plants in the District. Some automobile assembly plants were 
  temporarily shut down in order to make inventory adjustments in 
  models where sales had not met expectations. Representatives of some 
  capital goods manufacturers reported small gains in production, 
  although demand has not been as strong as had been expected. 
  Production of housing-related goods, including building materials, 
  construction equipment, and wall coverings, remains generally 
  strong. Aircraft manufacturing continued strong as substantial order 
  backlogs were reported.
       </p>
       <p>
        A large backlog of orders continued in the home building industry, 
  although a slowdown in new home orders has occurred in recent weeks. 
  Homebuilders were generally optimistic despite the slowdown, given 
  the existing backlog of orders and the generally good prospects for 
  new home sales this year. Contributing to the large number of 
  unfilled orders was the severe weather in part of December and 
  January which hampered construction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial banks in the District experienced little change in 
  consumer-type savings deposits, but relatively large increases in 
  other time deposits, primarily large certificates of deposits, in 
  January. Savings and loan associations generally reported that net 
  inflows of savings were positive, but the rate of gain had slowed 
  noticeably. The slowdown was attributed to rising rates on 
  alternative investments, but disintermediation is not believed to be 
  a serious problem at this time. It was pointed out, however, that 
  further increases in short-term rates could have significant effects 
  on savings inflows in the coming months. Borrowings by savings and 
  loan associations at Federal Home Loan Banks were reported to be 
  increasing, but the level of such borrowings was still relatively 
  low.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rate of interest on mortgage credit has risen in recent weeks. 
  Mortgage rates on new homes in the St. Louis area are now generally 
  at 9 percent on an 80 percent loan, up from 8-3/4 percent a few 
  weeks ago. However, a few savings and loan associations in St. Louis 
  are still making such loans at 8-3/4 percent. Mortgage rates on 
  commercial building have also moved up one-eighth to three-eighths 
  of a percent. In general, mortgage money is reported to be available 
  at the higher rates. However, some directors of the Little Rock 
  Branch reported that in parts of Arkansas savings and loan 
  associations were fully loaned up, that funds for commercial 
  building were not now available, and that new home buyers were 
  having difficulty in arranging permanent financing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coal strike may soon have a sizable impact on overall economic 
  activity in the District. Union Electric, the leading electric 
  utility in the St. Louis area, reported that mandatory cutbacks may 
  have to be considered within the next two weeks unless the voluntary 
  cutbacks proposed last week work or the strike ends. However, 
  representatives of this firm report that it has greater coal 
  supplies than most utilities as much of its coal comes from the 
  western states. The Governor of Kentucky has made a plea to 
  residential, industrial, and business customers to voluntarily 
  reduce their use of electricity. The TVA (Tennessee Valley 
  Authority), which supplies electric power to west Tennessee and most 
  of Kentucky, expects to require reduction of current usage by all 
  customers about March 1st unless the strike is settled. 
  Representatives of utilities in the area report that the TVA plan 
  will likely involve some layoffs at manufacturing plants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Farm commodity prices and the farm income outlook have improved 
  somewhat in recent weeks. Farm commodity prices average about 6 
  percent higher than last September. Nevertheless, a small percent of 
  the farm operators still talk about a farm strike during the current 
  year.
