      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <palign="center">
      <strong>
       June 15, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Respondents in the First District report that the favorable trends 
of the past several months are continuing. A steady decline in 
unemployment is an important source of optimism. Capital spending 
appears to be picking up and the housing industry is at last showing 
vitality. The retail sales situation is somewhat mixed with a fall-off in early May followed by a strengthening in recent weeks. Fears 
of inflation seem to have lessened but some businessmen appear to 
have become slightly apprehensive about the general outlook. This 
reflects concerns about national and international developments, 
particularly as regards energy, rather than their own experience.
        <p>
         The most important development in the manufacturing sector is the 
  apparent pick-up in capital spending. Manufacturers of producers 
  durables, particularly machine tools, report increasing orders. In 
  addition, New England firms themselves seem to be expanding their 
  investment plans.
        </p>
        <p>
         Retail sales in New England had a rather disappointing early May. 
  However, there was considerable strengthening in the second half of 
  the month. Assessments of the retail sales performance range from 
  pretty strong to mediocre. Housing products are selling particularly 
  well. One major retailer in the region commented that inventories 
  are slightly higher than desired. He believes the industry as a 
  whole is apprehensive about the future and is trying to keep 
  inventories low.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the disappointing aspects of the New England economy has been 
  the housing industry. However, there are now significant signs of 
  improvement. Although new construction remains relatively weak in 
  most of the region, there are now fairly widespread reports of a 
  pick-up, particularly in single family homes. In addition a special 
  survey of realtors revealed a very active market in existing units. 
  Several realtors said that sales are 50 percent above last year. 
  Single family units account for most of the activity, although two 
  realtors ventured that the slower market in multi-family units 
  reflects lack of supply. Responses regarding price ranges were quite 
  varied, but in southern New England the market seems to be strongest 
  among higher priced units. Prices are escalating quite rapidly as 
  the overhang of unsold housing from the recession period has moved 
  off the market.
        </p>
        <p>
         Commercial and savings bankers in New England also report moderate 
  to high levels of activity in real estate markets, but no unusual 
  speculative activity. Demand for both completed single family homes 
  and improved building lots remains strong in southern New Hampshire 
  and house prices there are currently appreciating at a rate of 1 
  percent per month. However, banks in the area report that most local 
  builders operate on a very small scale and that while some of these 
  builders are constructing units on speculation, the overall level of 
  speculative activity does not appear to have increased over that 
  occurring one year ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bankers in the agricultural district of northern Maine report an 
  acceleration in the rate of increase of land prices there. Loan 
  officers also noted that an increased number of sales were to buyers 
  from outside Maine. However, these bankers feel that the effect of 
  the recent acceleration in land prices was to restore the historical 
  relationship of Maine land prices to agricultural land prices 
  elsewhere, since Maine land prices had lagged national prices in 
  recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sources elsewhere in New England report no unusual speculative 
  activity at present. While some banks reported requests for second 
  mortgages, they did not consider the number of such requests to be 
  abnormal. None of the banks reported requests for wrap-around 
  mortgages. None of the banks reported purchases of single family 
  homes by nonoccupants, and several said that the customary policy in 
  New England is to only lend to owner-occupied units.
        </p>
        <p>
         On balance the performance of the New England economy is quite 
  promising at the moment. Businessmen are optimistic but vaguely 
  concerned about the possibility of external shocks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Professors Houthakker and Samuelson were contacted this month. 
  Houthakker is satisfied with the performance of the economy and of 
  monetary policy. He sees no need for immediate further correction of 
  April's excessive money growth and guesses that the current level of 
  rates will be adequate to bring money growth back within the target 
  range. On the inflation outlook, he sees the rate of inflation as 
  fairly stable with no significant acceleration or deceleration. He 
  notes weakness in various raw materials markets which serve as a 
  good leading indicator of inflation. The world economy is still 
  growing slowly but is no cause for alarm.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the basis of the recent economic data, Professor Samuelson would 
  favor some tightening provided that policymakers are willing to 
  reverse course subsequently if economic targets are not being met. 
  Specifically, Samuelson feels that annual real growth of less than 5 
  percent over the next six quarters would be politically 
  unacceptable. While a prestigious minority of forecasters expect 
  this goal to be met, the consensus forecast is of somewhat slower 
  growth over that period. Samuelson's philosophy is that a "zig-zag" policy, such as tightening now and reversing if the optimistic 
  forecasts gets marked down, is not fine-tuning (which implies 
  perfect command). Zig-zagging around the desirable range as new 
  information accumulates is, to the contrary, the optimal policy 
  posture in a changing world filled with uncertainty.
