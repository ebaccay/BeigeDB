      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Signs off recovery continue to appear in the Ninth District. In 
December and January, consumers increased their spending on homes, 
autos, and general merchandise and were willing to spend on winter 
recreation. This spending sustained the revival in lumbering and in 
some manufacturing industries. In addition, good prospects are now 
reported for some district computer manufacturers, and other 
manufacturers seem to think the worst is behind them. Unfortunately, 
significant parts of the district economy have yet to get any 
relief. In January, manufacturers supplying industrial goods still 
were cutting back operations, and metal mining continued to totter 
from another round of layoffs and shutdowns. The Administration's 
new farm program might bolster farm income in the future, but at 
year-end it was reportedly down from a year earlier in most of the 
district. Furthermore, bank lending remained weak in January, which 
indicates that, overall, the district economy has not yet begun to 
recover.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The most convincing signs of recovery in our last Redbook report 
were pickups in home and auto sales, and these sales have continued 
to expand. According to the Minneapolis Board of Realtors, home 
sales in Minneapolis and its suburbs were up 16 percent from a year 
earlier in the fourth quarter and remained better than a year ago in 
early January. Likewise, regional sales managers for the nation's 
two largest auto manufacturers report that their December sales were 
up around 35 percent from a year earlier and their early January 
sales were greater than a year ago. This Bank's directors confirm 
these sales gains; they say that home and auto sales in their 
communities have been good recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      General merchandise sales also have continued to improve. After 
sales revived in October, a post-Thanksgiving slump threatened the 
recovery, and retailers hoped that a late December sales spurt would 
let them better their 1981 holiday sales. They were not 
disappointed. Two large Minneapolis-St. Paul department stores 
report that their December sales were up about 7 percent from a year 
earlier. In addition, both retailers are pleased with their early 
January sales. According to a Montana director, sales of general 
merchandise have been good recently in his state too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers have been spending on winter recreation as well. In 
Montana, where snow arrived early, the last really good ski season 
was in 1974-75, and according to the Montana Department of Tourism, 
the 1982-83 season should top it. In Minnesota, northwestern 
Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, snow didn't arrive 
in many areas until late December, so the ski season got off to a 
late start. But where there is snow, ski area operators report brisk 
business in January, and they expect it to remain good. In late 
February, for example, the Birkebeiner cross-country ski race in 
northwestern Wisconsin is expected to draw a record 8,000 
participants, and all available lodging within two hours of the race 
site is already reserved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our last Redbook report noted that the pickup in consumer spending 
had just started to carry over into the industrial sector, and this 
transfer has continued. Reflecting recent increases in home sales, 
several lumber mills have either resumed or stepped up their 
operations, a Montana labor market analyst reports. And large 
manufacturers of residential temperature controls and windows report 
that their recent orders have been about 15 percent ahead of a year 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prospects appear to be good for some other district manufacturers 
too. Due primarily to increases in defense orders, a large 
Minneapolis-St. Paul computer manufacturer plans to hire an 
additional 1,200 people this year. Due to increases in commercial 
orders, another computer manufacturer plans to expand its work force 
8 to 10 percent this year. The district's largest computer 
manufacturer, whose sales of computer accessories suffered last 
year, reports that a turnaround looks near: its sales have stopped 
declining but have not yet begun to increase. A large manufacturer 
of housewares and another of adhesives and packaging materials voice 
similar views.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers supplying industrial goods, however, report 
declining business. A Minneapolis-St. Paul manufacturer of 
industrial filters says business has been soft lately, and this firm 
has continued to lay off workers. A southern Minnesota manufacturer 
of electric generators laid off 71 workers in January. In Michigan's 
Upper Peninsula, a manufacturer of heavy construction equipment, 
which once employed 2,000 workers, laid off its remaining 200 
workers when it permanently shut down in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent developments in metal mining have not been hopeful either. 
Our last Redbook report noted that two iron mining companies were 
planning to recall workers in early 1983, but these recalls have 
been largely offset by recent layoffs. The closing of Bethlehem 
Steel's Lackawanna, New York, facilities resulted in 900 Minnesota 
iron miners being laid off for eleven weeks. In the Upper Peninsula 
of Michigan, another 700 iron miners were laid off in January. Also, 
the Upper Peninsula's one large copper mine remained shut down, and 
the Anaconda Company announced that it would permanently cease all 
copper mining in Montana by June 30, which will idle 700 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recovery has continued to evade the farm sector too. Of the 
bankers responding to our late December Agricultural Credit 
Conditions Survey, 81 percent said that farm income in their 
communities was less than a year earlier in the fourth quarter of 
1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new payment-in-kind (PIK) program., however, should bring some 
relief to district farmers. Much of the farm income decline stems 
from large stocks of farm commodities depressing prices. In 
Minnesota, for example, corn stocks currently are at a record level 
and are up 27 percent from a year ago. The PIK program is designed 
to reduce stocks by decreasing plantings and paying farmers in 
commodities. The program may not raise prices much until 1984, but 
the grain that farmers will receive and the production expenses they 
will save should boost their 1983 income. PIK, however, could reduce 
farmers' purchases of seed, fertilizer, and other production inputs 
this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The more farmers participate in it, the more the PIK program will 
reduce stocks and eventually raise prices, and participation in the 
district may be quite high. In Minnesota's second largest corn-
producing county, for example, officials estimate that farmers 
controlling 80 to 90 percent of the corn acreage will be enrolled in 
the PIK program. This is about twice the participation in last 
year's program, which was only 43 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although signs of recovery continue to appear, bank lending has yet 
to reflect any overall recovery in the district economy. In January, 
bank loans at both city and country banks were essentially unchanged 
from their weak December levels. At city banks, this weakness 
stemmed from the slack in overall business activity, and at country 
banks it resulted from poor agricultural conditions. Forty-four 
percent of the bankers responding to our latest Agricultural Credit 
Conditions Survey considered their year-end loan-to-deposit ratio 
low. Furthermore, much of the recent loan demand at rural banks has 
not been for new credit, but rather to refinance debt that farmers 
can't repay. Seventy-eight percent of the survey's respondents 
indicated that demand for farm debt refinancing was greater than 
normal in the fourth quarter.
