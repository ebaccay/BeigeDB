      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 16, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Since July, open market interest rates have declined substantially 
and equity values have made record gains. So far, the effects of 
these national developments on the Ninth District have been 
restricted primarily to financial variables. District commercial, 
consumer, and mortgage loan rates have fallen, and some local 
corporations have begun taking advantage of improved market 
conditions to clean up their balance sheets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some sketchy evidence has emerged, however, that interest rate and 
wealth effects have started to carry over into the real sector. In 
particular, auto sales have shown some responsiveness to improved 
financing terms, and more would-be home buyers have been actively 
shopping (if not buying, as yet). Nevertheless, October home, auto, 
and general merchandise sales remained weak by historical standards. 
District manufacturing, metal mining, and lumbering continued in the 
same depressed condition reported in the last several Redbooks. On 
district farms, falling commodity prices and poor weather still were 
causing distress.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Borrowing costs for district businesses and consumers have declined 
this fall, and the well-publicized reductions in the prime rate have 
been matched by most district banks. Local mortgage bankers and 
officials of the district's two largest banks and its largest S&amp;L 
indicate that their rates on mortgage and consumer installment loans 
dropped 200 to 300 basis points in the last three months. In 
addition, one of the district's largest bank holding companies 
reduced its interest rate on outstanding credit card balances from 
22 to 19.8 percent in October. Not all local firms have cut their 
loan rates, though. For example, at a consumer finance company, 
headquartered in the district and with operations in 31 states, 
rates are still at usury ceilings in most of the states in which it 
operates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Interest rate declines have not increased business borrowing from 
district banks, but rather, district corporations have stepped up 
their borrowing in primary securities markets. The lackluster 
business borrowing from banks reported in recent Redbooks seems to 
have continued in October. However, representatives of two major 
investment banking firms say that local firms have recently 
increased their offerings of debt and equity. A large district 
leasing and rental company, for example, floated a $100 million debt 
issue, and equity issues were made by a large retailer and by a food 
processing company. The investment bankers indicate that the 
proceeds of these issues will be used primarily to refinance short-
term debt, not to fund new plant and equipment expenditures. 
Furthermore, they say that many other local firms are planning to 
offer more debt and equity if market conditions remain favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decline in interest rates also seems to have increased consumer 
borrowing somewhat. An official of the nation's third largest 
mortgage banker, headquartered in this district, says that its 
residential mortgage applications rose 6 percent between July and 
August and 16 percent between August and September. The district's 
largest S&amp;L reports that, in the week ending October 25, it received 
54 applications for fixed rate mortgage loans as compared to 16 in 
the week ending a month earlier. This S&amp;L has been heavily 
advertising for consumer loans and reports a doubling in the number 
of such loans extended over the last 30 days. The district's two 
largest banks report that consumer lending has not risen much in the 
last month or so, but that inquiries are up significantly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home and auto sales have remained weak in the district, although 
better financing terms have produced some hints that sales will pick 
up soon. Our contacts indicate that much of the recent increase in 
mortgage lending has been to refinance existing mortgages and 
contracts for deed; home sales, they say, have yet to improve. The 
Minneapolis Board of Realtors, for example, says that October home 
sales in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs matched the weak sales 
reported in recent Redbooks. But future sales seem likely to be 
stronger because more people were reportedly shopping for homes in 
October than in earlier months. Similarly, regional sales managers 
for the nation's two largest auto manufacturers call recent auto 
sales "weak." But one has been more aggressive than the other in 
improving terms of financing and has been doing relatively better 
here.
     </p>
     <p>
      General merchandise sales also have remained weak in the Ninth 
District, according to this Bank's directors and Minneapolis-St. 
Paul retailers. However, two Twin Cities retailers indicate that 
furniture and appliances (reported weak in previous Redbooks) showed 
some signs of improvement in October. This improvement is attributed 
to price cutting and heavy advertising, though, not to reduced 
finance charges.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent layoffs and plant closings suggest that district 
manufacturers have continued to retrench. In computer manufacturing, 
a large Minneapolis company recently announced that its work force 
will be reduced by 1,850, and another plans temporary fourth quarter 
shutdowns affecting 9,000 workers. In heavy equipment manufacturing, 
a construction equipment firm permanently closed a plant in 
Minnesota, and a North Dakota tractor manufacturer laid off 80 
people. In consumer products manufacturing, an apparel firm 
permanently closed a plant in Minnesota, and a major microwave oven 
manufacturer recently shut down its South Dakota plant for three or 
four weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The metal mining and lumbering industries generally have continued 
to operate at low production levels. Minnesota's largest taconite 
plant, shut down in June, was supposed to resume operations later 
this year. It recently announced, however, that it will not reopen 
until "sometime in 1983." Reflecting the continuing weakness in 
lumbering, a large district railroad reports that in September, 
forest product shipments were 31 percent below those a year ago. One 
hopeful sign for the lumber industry is a Minnesota director's 
report that the state's production of wafer board (an inexpensive 
substitute for plywood) increased in September and October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Declining commodity prices and poor weather conditions have 
continued to plague district farmers. Due to declines in both crop 
and livestock prices, the index of prices received by Minnesota 
farmers dropped in October—2 percent from September and 3 percent 
from a year ago. While the threat of early frost reported in our 
last Redbook did not materialize, farmers worry that wet weather may 
interfere with the harvest, which is late already. In Minnesota, for 
example, only 25 percent of the corn had been picked by November 1, 
less than half the 63 percent usually picked by that date.
