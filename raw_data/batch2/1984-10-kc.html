      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 23, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some moderation continues to be apparent in Tenth District economic 
activity. While retail sales continue to improve, housing activity 
and mortgage demand have generally slowed. Inventories of retail 
goods are slightly larger than desired, while inventories of 
materials inputs are at satisfactory levels. Price increases have 
been small, and are expected to continue so. Loan demand is 
increasing slightly at district banks, while deposits remain 
unchanged. Yields of fall-harvested crops varied across the district 
while the newly-planted winter wheat crop is in good condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that year-to-date retail sales are up significantly 
over a year ago, and that sales continued to improve in the past 
three months. Inventories are slightly larger than desired for some 
retailers. However, no major trimming is intended, because most 
retailers are optimistic about sales through the remainder of the 
year. Prices remained generally flat in recent months, and no 
significant increases are anticipated through the remainder of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District continue to report 
improved sales in 1984 relative to last year. Credit market 
conditions are satisfactory, and financing is available both for 
floorplanning and car buyers. Most dealers report smaller 
inventories due mainly to the 1985 model introductions and partially 
to the GM strike. Dealers are optimistic about sales for the balance 
of 1984 and early 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report input price increases of 5 to 10 percent 
over the last 12 months, with virtually no price increases during 
the last three months. Although metals prices are expected to 
continue to fall, prices for other inputs are generally expected to 
remain stable through the end of the year. No problems with 
availability were reported and none are expected. Most purchasing 
agents report inventories at satisfactory levels, and no substantial 
changes in inventory levels are planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity is softening. Single-family starts 
are generally down, particularly since August. Starts in multi-family units range from below year-ago levels to about the same 
levels. Housing starts are expected to slow through yearend if 
interest rates remain at, or rise above, their current level. Sales 
of new houses are generally down from last year (except in Colorado 
where sales have been steady). Building materials are in good supply 
and are expected to remain so. Prices for materials are generally 
steady. Demand for mortgage funds and mortgage commitments at 
savings and loan associations is slowing because of slight increases 
in mortgage rates over the past months, and also because of seasonal 
declines. Most respondents expect mortgage demand to continue 
decreasing, although rates are expected to stabilize. Savings 
inflows range from much higher to much lower than last year. 
Increased competition was cited as a contributor to the declines at 
certain institutions. Respondents, however, generally anticipate 
only very moderate changes in savings flows for the remainder of 
1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand increased slightly last month at Tenth district 
banks. The gains were distributed unevenly throughout the district, 
however, reflecting the diversity of economic conditions. Commercial 
real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans increased 
where strong construction activity is underway. The slight increase 
in consumer loans was also concentrated in the economically more 
active areas of the district. Residential real estate loans declined 
district-wide, however, as did agricultural loans. Following money 
center banks, Tenth District banks reduced their prime lending rates 
by three-quarters of a percent early in October to rates ranging 
from 12 3/4 to 13 3/4 percent. Most bankers expect the prime to 
decline slightly further, although they expect a lower prime to have 
little effect on consumer lending rates. Consumer lending rates were 
generally unchanged from last month. Total deposits remained 
unchanged last month at Tenth District banks, reflecting the general 
lack of strong loan demand and the slow pace of the district 
economy. A slight increase in MMDA's and IRA and Keogh accounts 
offset a slight decrease in demand deposits and passbook savings 
accounts, while other deposits remained constant.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fall harvest is underway in district states. Corn yields in New 
Mexico, Oklahoma, and parts of Colorado and Nebraska are average to 
above average this year. Other parts of the district have not 
harvested corn yet due to wet conditions, and yields in Kansas and 
Missouri may be below average. Below average soybean yields in most 
district states are partly attributed to late planting in the spring 
and to an early frost. Reports on sorghum yields are mixed. Planting 
of the winter wheat crop is underway throughout the district. Though 
just starting in Kansas, planting is finished in Oklahoma, Colorado 
and parts of Nebraska, while other states report 50 to 75 percent of 
the crop planted. The crop is in good condition, and moisture 
conditions are generally favorable. Very little wheat acreage will 
be used as pasture this fall, but range conditions in the district 
are generally good. Bankers are generally pessimistic about debt 
repayment by farmers this year. Production loans will be repaid, but 
little reduction of intermediate and long-term debt is expected. 
Some bankers expect problems in receiving full payment of interest 
on outstanding loans. Reports of foreclosures and partial 
liquidations are mixed. With some exceptions, most bankers believe 
that agriculture's financial stress will worsen during the year 
ahead.
