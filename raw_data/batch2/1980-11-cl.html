      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District anticipate a 1.5 percent increase 
in real GNP in 1981 from 1980, despite rising interest rates. 
Inflation continues to be the major threat to the recovery. A 
boomlet has developed in steel orders, but may reflect price hedging 
that is borrowing from orders in 1981. Consumer goods producers 
expect little near-term improvement in consumer spending, but auto 
dealers are encouraged by new model sales. Bankers report business 
and consumer loan demands are weak, but not worsening since the 
latest interest rate increases. However, S&amp;L officials and home 
builders report a substantial decline in buyer interest and 
applications as mortgage rates average nearly 14 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists who attended the Fourth District Economists Round Table 
Meeting held at this Bank on November 7 expect the recovery to be 
sluggish and a typical for the early stages of an expansion. The 
median of 28 forecasts, made shortly before the election, shows real 
GNP increasing at annual rates of 1.5 percent, 2.7 percent, 4.6 
percent and 3.4 percent from the first quarter of 1981 through the 
fourth quarter, respectively. Most of the step-up after mid-1981 is 
expected to come from higher consumer spending, residential 
construction and a recovery in business fixed investment. Mild 
inventory liquidation is expected to continue into 1981. Real GNP 
this quarter is expected to increase by about the same rate as last 
quarter, because of smaller gains in consumer spending and net 
exports. Five of the economists expect real GNP to decline in the 
first quarter of 1981 before resuming growth, and one expects a 
decline in the fourth quarter of 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inflation is reaccelerating and is the key factor underlying a slow 
recovery, according to several district economists. The latest run-
up in food prices stems partly from increased grain exports and a 
shortfall in farm output, according to a bank economist. Despite oil 
price increases in spot markets, the Iranian-Iraqi war should not 
have a significant effect on prices, according to a petroleum 
industry economist, unless damage to production facilities is 
substantial and OPEC allows the spot market to run prices up. 
However, several energy economists expect oil production losses to 
be made up by other countries. Some economists who expect a small-V 
shape recovery in 1981, anticipate that accelerating inflation will 
contribute to a softening economy late in 1981 and another recession 
in 1982. Several expressed preference to check inflation 
expectations now even at the expense of retarding a recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The steel industry has made a sharp turnaround recently, with order 
levels currently at 75 percent of operating capacity and possibly 
reaching 90 percent in November or December. Steel economists 
believe this bubble in demand will be temporary, and represents, in 
part, a slight improvement in consumption (mostly from autos), a 
decrease in imports, but mostly a vigorous shift in inventory 
replacement by steel service centers. Imports have been dampened by 
the reinstatement of trigger pricing at levels above domestic mill 
prices. Shipment levels could reach as high as 23 million tons in 
the fourth quarter and 85 million tons in 1980, depending on the 
ability of plant facilities to shift from a shut down condition. 
After January, steel operations will likely fall back into the 70 
percent to 80 percent range, according to a steel economist, unless 
the economy is stronger than currently expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The improvements in consumer spending in the early part of the third 
quarter have leveled out in recent weeks, according to several 
consumer-goods producers. An appliance producer reports his firm has 
not yet experienced a recovery in either shipments or orders, and a 
bank economist anticipates no increase in purchasing power until 
after a tax cut in the second quarter of 1981. While nondurable 
goods remained flat in recent months, sales of food-store items have 
held up well relative to past recessions, even during the sharp 
decline in the second quarter, according to a producer of consumer 
soft-goods. However, year-to-year volume on consumer-packaged 
products is currently increasing at only a 2 percent rate, compared 
to a normal 4 percent rate during a recovery. Fourth District 
economists expect about a 2 percent gain in real PCE between the 
fourth quarter of 1980 and fourth quarter of 1981. A typically 
cautious economist with a major retail chain in the district expects 
a somewhat larger gain. According to a bank economist, the financial 
position of households remains weak for a recovery; the debt-
repayment burden is still high, liquidity is low, and delinquency 
rates are rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although auto sales should gradually improve throughout 1981, no 
major comeback is expected before 1981, according to an auto 
industry economist. Auto sales are expected to average a 9.0 million 
unit annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1980 and 9.6 million units 
in 1981. Small cars are selling well, reports an area dealer, but 
sales of larger cars are sluggish despite improved mileage ratings. 
Capacity of domestic small cars is limited currently by engine and 
transmission production. An area dealer reports that 1980 models are 
closing out satisfactorily, but not at the expense of 1981 models. 
Ohio consumers continue to benefit from a $600 average savings on 
select new models as a result of the temporary tax cut, 
manufacturers' rebates and the temporary price freeze.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan commitments are weaker than last month, and larger-than-seasonal declines are expected in December, January and February, 
according to several S&amp;L officials. Mortgage lending rates, which 
rose further in recent weeks, range from 13.5 percent to 14.5 
percent and are expected to reach 15 percent soon, according to an 
Economist for a regional FHLB in the District. However, rates are 
already close to a point of shutting off demand, with loan 
applications in November falling behind last month's pace. Deposit 
flows have weakened, but even large inflows are unlikely to cause 
mortgage rates to differ from other long-term rates, according to an 
S&amp;L official, as more S&amp;Ls operate like mortgage brokers. 
Consequently, affordability of mortgages is an increasing problem. 
An area builder reports housing starts are down drastically and the 
volume of shoppers is now beginning to fall substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business and consumer loans continue to be weak, according to 
several district bankers, but lending rates continue to rise. A bank 
economist, however, cites uncertainty and declining real income in 
the local economy as more important factors in discouraging 
borrowers than higher interest rates. Auto loans may not pick up 
much for another six months because of a usual lag in recovery in 
local economies, according to a banker. Also, usury ceilings tied to 
the discount rate have made auto loans unprofitable in Pennsylvania. 
Business loan demand from large national firms is stronger than from 
smaller local firms, partly because large firms have substituted 
short-term financing for long-term until bond markets turn around,
according to a bank economist. Interest rates are expected to 
continue under upward pressure in the near-term, according to 
several economists, because financial markets anticipate further 
tightening actions by the system.
