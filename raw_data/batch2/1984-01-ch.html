      <strong>
       January 20, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In early 1984 business activity in the Seventh District is on the 
uptrend over a broadening spectrum of sectors. Evidence available in 
the District does not indicate the "slowing" suggested by some 
national data. The general view here is that the improvement will 
continue through 1984, but with a possible dampening effect from 
higher interest rates in the second half of the year. Employment in 
manufacturing is rising, but gains in nonmanufacturing are modest at 
best. Reports on retail sales were strong for December. Inventories 
are generally low. Demand for some types of mechanical capital 
goods, e.g. construction equipment, is strengthening. Wholesale 
prices are firming, but many remain below 1979 levels. Residential 
construction is expected to increase again in 1984, but remain far 
below peak years of the 1970s. Severe cold adversely affected some 
sectors in late December, but stimulated outlays on batteries and 
plumbers' bills. Rising demand is causing shortages of some 
materials such as gypsum board and has boosted backlogs for heavy 
trucks and trailers and large autos.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Shortages and Leadtimes
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports indicating pressure on capacity are becoming more frequent. 
For December, 39 percent of the purchasing managers in Chicago and 
48 percent in Milwaukee reported longer delivery leadtimes, while 
only a few reported shorter leads. In late 1982, delivery times were 
shortening. The stretchout has been particularly marked for truck 
trailers and custom-built heavy trucks. Large cars also are back 
ordered. Gypsum board producers say that shortages in the South are 
attracting high-cost shipments from Canada. The piggy-back rail car 
fleet is fully utilized. There are also some reports or tight 
supplies of steel sheets, computer chips, refrigerators, and car 
batteries. Problems of supply partly reflect cutbacks in domestic 
capacity. Most industries still have ample capacity, and steps are 
being taken to eliminate bottlenecks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some 45 percent of District purchasing managers reported paying 
higher prices in December, while only a few paid lower prices. A 
year earlier companies paying lower prices still outnumbered those 
paying higher prices. Prices have not risen sharply except for a few 
cases such as aluminum and airline fares. More moderate increases 
are also reported for castings. forgings, paper and paperboard, 
gypsum board, and some types of steel. In most industries where 
prices have increased, analysts insist that substantial further 
increases must occur if profit margins are to return to a prosperous 
level. Further increases in utilization rates are necessary, 
however, before the competitive situation will permit such increases 
in these industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise retailers were very pleased with sales in 
the Christmas season. Sales of recreational equipment, appliances, 
computers, telephones, and auto accessories were especially strong. 
Auto sales were held back by availability of large domestic cars and 
Japanese cars. Credit use has been heavy, and delinquencies have 
been lowâ€”probably as a result of careful screening in response to 
more lenient bankruptcy laws. Airline traffic in December only about 
equalled year-ago, partly because of weather, but also because most 
bargain fares have been withdrawn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Improved job markets in the District are still largely a 
result of callbacks in manufacturing. Rehires by motor vehicle and 
parts plants are by far the most important, but there have also been 
gains in appliances, mobile homes, and recreational vehicles. 
Residential construction is also up. In November, all District 
states, with Michigan far in the lead, reported good gains in 
factory employment from late 1982. but the shortfall from late 1978 
still ranged from 15 percent in Wisconsin to 20 percent in Iowa, and 
24 percent in Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Total non-
manufacturing employment data show no improvement through November. 
State and local governments, public utilities, and financial 
institutions are generally hiring only to fill essential vacancies, 
and many are reducing staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Raw steel facilities are expected to operate at 65 percent of 
capacity in the first quarter versus 60 percent in the fourth 
quarter. Rates will be higher at the most modern Chicago-area mills. 
Demand for all types of steel is stronger, but the concentration is 
in cold-rolled steel, mainly for auto and truck bodies, and hot-
rolled sheet for frames for trucks and large cars. Tubular "oil 
country" products are picking up from a low level. (Quality of some 
pipe on hand had deteriorated.) Demand for plates, for producer 
goods, and heavy structurals, also has improved, but very slightly. 
Steel mill operations were handicapped by a variety of problems 
during the severe cold of late December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mechanical-type capital goods (non-electronic) are showing signs of 
life. Orders for large and double trailers, authorized last year, 
are three times current capacity, and quoted delivery times are for 
September. Producers of heavy-duty trucks to haul trailers are 
quoting April deliveries. Capacity to produce heavy trucks has been 
reduced and may be under strain if demand continues to rise. But the 
capital goods picture in the District is still far from 
satisfactory. Relatively few laid-off workers have been called back. 
Orders for freight cars increased in December, but from a very low 
level. In farm equipment, the anticipated spurt in sales before the 
turn of the year to gain tax advantages did not materialize.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Parts Versus Finished Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The capital equipment improvement is still characterized as a 
repair, replacement and modernization market, rather than an 
expansion market. Modest increases in demand for forgings, castings, 
components, steel bars, drill bits, and fasteners are in line with 
this assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Electric Power
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Electricity usage has increased in the past month or two reflecting 
both higher industrial demand and cold weather. This rise was 
welcomed by District utilities, some of which are under 
unprecedented financial strain. The power industry, once a rock of 
stability, faces perilous times because of an adverse regulatory 
atmosphere (both on rates and environmental considerations), and 
questions concerning costly facilities under construction that are 
not needed to accommodate prospective demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of new and used houses, which slipped from the rates reached 
last spring, have held up better than many observers had thought 
possible. Assuming no significant rise in interest rates, builders 
expect a further increase in starts in 1984. However, the District 
total would still be about 50 percent short of the best years in the 
1970s. An important reason for optimism in the Chicago area is the 
sharp rise in use of variable rate mortgages from about 25 percent 
last spring to 50 percent in Octoberâ€”even higher in new homes. 
First year mortgages rates of 10 percent or less are available, 
usually with 3 or 4 percent fees. A wide array of terms are offered, 
so "shopping around" on the part of home buyers is advisable.
