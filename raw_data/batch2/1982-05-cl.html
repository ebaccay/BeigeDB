      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales have flattened but retailers are reluctant to 
indicate the timing of recovery. Demand for capital goods continues 
to decline. Demand for steel may have bottomed at a very low level. 
Manufacturers expect inventories to decline again in May. Retail 
inventories have become more burdensome. Unemployment is rising as 
plant closings continue. Ohio farmers are in great financial 
difficulty. Business loans and NOW accounts were flat in early May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers generally believe that declines in 
sales have flattened but are reluctant to indicate the timing of 
recovery. Several retailers report deferring or canceling plans to 
build and open new outlets over the next few years because of high 
interest rates and uncertain profit margins. One major retailer 
places the trough in consumer spending in April. He points out that 
declines in spending in March and April offset nearly one-half of 
the increase in spending that occurred between last October and 
February. Auto producers are not optimistic that sales will improve 
much until well after the scheduled tax decreases in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital goods producers continue to face declining 
demand for their products. A manufacturer of machine tools, 
continuing to experience lower orders and falling backlogs, is 
"gearing operations down to the lower level of business anticipated 
in 1983." Another machine tool manufacturer recently laid off 
another 250 employees because of weak orders and declining backlogs. 
A bearing manufacturer expects second quarter orders to be 8% below 
first quarter, and backlogs to fall further. He anticipates some 
upturn in demand from auto and farm machinery producers in the 
second half but no recovery before yearend in demand from railroad 
car and machine tool manufacturers. A major supplier of heavy-duty 
truck equipment reports that sales continued to decline in April and 
expects no recovery in heavy-duty trucks before yearend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There are some indications that demand for steel may have 
stopped declining. One major producer says orders have stabilized at 
a very low level but expects industry shipments for the year may be 
as low as 70 to 75 million tons. That firms notes that "low volume 
and very weak prices are putting the steel industry under great 
financial pressure. Marginal producers probably will not survive." 
Another major producer, operating at 48% of capacity, says "the 
order book is flat." The firm expects second quarter shipments to be 
no better than in the first quarter, which had the lowest non-strike 
level of shipments in 40 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A sample of manufacturers report that their inventories 
fell in April and will fall again in May. Most producers of primary 
metals and industrial machinery expect to continue to cut 
inventories. A producer of paint and a paper manufacturer expect to 
add to inventories. A petroleum company expects crude oil 
inventories to continue the decline that began in mid-February. 
Petroleum product inventories dropped sharply in the first quarter 
and should, on balance, decline slightly in second quarter. Bearing 
inventories held by producers and customers fell in first quarter, 
but little change is expected in the second quarter. Inventories of 
heavy-duty trucks were reduced substantially in March but the 
further decline in sales in April has deferred the completion of the 
inventory liquidation. Automobile producers are no longer concerned 
about new car inventories, except on a spot basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories of department-store-type goods have become more 
burdensome because of declines in sales in March and April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Unemployment and Plant Closings
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The effects of recession continue 
to spread and deepen throughout the Fourth District. The April SA 
unemployment rate was 12.4% in Ohio and 10.7% in Pennsylvania, well 
above the nation's 9.4%.
     </p>
     <p>
      Plant closings continue in the District although some have been 
avoided or rescinded because of worker concessions. National Steel 
wants to sell or close its 11,500 employee steel plant In Weirton, 
West Virginia and Colt Industries wants to sell or close its 4,300 
employee Crucible Steel Division plant in Midland, Pennsylvania. AM 
International wants to close or sell its 500 employee duplicating 
machine parts plant in Cleveland. B.F. Goodrich recently agreed to 
continue operating its 2,000 employee Akron industrial products 
plant for 3 years in exchange for union contract concessions. GMC is 
closing a 1,200 employee stamping plant in Cleveland but has 
rescinded the planned closing of a 1,400 employee trim plant in 
Cleveland in exchange for union concessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The widespread nature of the recession is illustrated 
by the increasing plight of farmers, especially those in southwest 
Ohio. Many are finding it hard to obtain credit. The Ohio Department 
of Agriculture expects four times the usual number of Ohio farmer 
bankruptcies this year and expects nearly one-fourth of the state's 
farm machinery dealers to close or be sold. The Department also 
notes that a number of grain elevator operations are in financial 
difficulty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Business loans and NOW accounts were flat in 
early May, and one banker reported more switching of deposits out of 
S&amp;L's. Two major banks report C and I loans declined during the last 
two weeks of April, were flat in the first few days of May, and are 
expected to be flat for the month. Another large bank reports that C 
and I loans have remained strong in recent weeks but a definite 
slowing in commitments will show up in reduced loans in the months 
ahead. Some bankers characterize much C and I activity as "distress 
borrowing" and "not for expansion but just to pay bills".
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       NOW accounts at two large commercial banks declined in the last two 
weeks of April and were flat or down a bit in the first week of May. 
One banker reports that the silent run on S&amp;L's has been augmented 
in the last month by frequent instances of early withdrawal of small 
CD's by depositors who accept the penalty and shift funds to 
sometimes lower yielding certificates in commercial banks.
