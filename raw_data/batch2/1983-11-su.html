      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expansion continued through the early fall in all Federal 
Reserve districts. Generally increasing strength is reported in 
retail sales, as consumer confidence improves along with income and 
employment. Retailers in most districts are anticipating excellent 
Christmas season sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity is growing at a moderate pace, but only 
limited improvement is reported for capital goods industries. House 
sales are generally reported to weaker. Crop production was 
restricted by drought and acreage reductions, but farm income is 
being supported by higher prices and federal farm programs. Nearly 
all districts report increasing bank loan demand, while reports on 
deposit growth are mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continuing and generally increasing strength in retail sales is 
reported in all 12 Federal Reserve districts. Some districts, such 
as Cleveland and Kansas City, mentioned the widespread or broad-
based nature of sales increases. Many other districts noted that 
sales were especially good for apparel, and for home furnishings and 
other household items. New automobile sales were also reported as a 
source of strength in consumer spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to growth in income and employment, most-often-mentioned 
sources of the strength in consumption were a turn to more favorable 
weather conditions and a significant improvement in consumer 
confidence. While Philadelphia and St. Louis reported heavy 
promotional activities by retailers, Atlanta noted a strong rise in 
sales with negligible sales promotions. Retailers in most districts 
appear optimistic about sales in the fourth quarter, and are 
reported to anticipate excellent Christmas season sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories described as generally satisfactory to a little 
high, are apparently not regarded as troublesome in the light of 
sales expectations. Chicago notes, however, that some retail 
inventories are tight enough to lead to sales losses if the 
Christmas season is as strong as expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall manufacturing activity continues to grow at a moderate pace 
according to most district reports. Gains in production and orders 
are generally reflected in reports of increases in employment and 
length of work week, though Boston reports a cautious recalling of 
production workers only and San Francisco notes weak manufacturing 
employment growth in its district. Manufacturers' inventories are 
generally reported as stable to accumulating somewhat, and appear to 
be generally regarded as satisfactory. Prices in the manufacturing 
sector are reported as ranging from stable to increasing moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cleveland and Chicago note that steel orders are continuing to rise, 
but emphasize differences among types of steel products. Cleveland 
notes the most improvement in demand for flat-rolled steal, while 
Chicago reports demand concentrated in lighter products with plates 
and structurals very slow. Cleveland notes some increased demand for 
steel from capital goods producers. Both Chicago and Cleveland 
report only limited improvement in their districts' capital goods 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although there maybe mixed results within a given district, 
residential construction activity is reported by most districts as 
down from earlier this year. Clear expectations are New York, which 
reports "Homebuilders have been quite busy and expect to remain so 
over the next few months," and St. Louis, which notes that 
"construction of homes...continued at a rapid pace." House sales are 
generally reported to be down, except in the Atlanta district where 
a recent revival is attributed to the increasing popularity of 
adjustable rate mortgages. In the Chicago district, however, 
variable rate mortgages are reported to be "shunned by most home 
buyers." Several districts report increases in nonresidential 
construction activity, and New York notes that some state 
governments in its area have authorized increased spending on 
infrastructure restoration.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought and reduced acreage cut crop production in a number of 
districts, but farm income is being supported by higher product 
prices and federal farm programs. Results varied according to 
geographical area and type of farm enterprise. For example, 
Minneapolis reports a good year for soybean farmers in its district, 
while Atlanta notes that producers of peanuts and tobaccoâ€”not 
covered by the PIK programâ€”sustained heavy income losses because of 
the drought. Livestock farmers and ranchers are feeling the impact 
of high feed costs and low livestock prices. Meat prices may fall in 
the short run due to increased marketings, but are expected to rise 
again next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all districts reported increasing bank loan demand, although 
Atlanta noted slower recent loan activity following "healthy" growth 
last summer. The picture for business loans is somewhat mixed, but 
they appear to have been an important part of total loan growth in a 
number of districts. Aggressive seeking of new customers by banks 
was noted by New York, Richmond, and Philadelphia. The latter 
reports that "consumer credit demands have responded very positively 
new-marketing efforts."
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on deposit growth also vary among districts and by type of 
deposit. Several districts commented on the actions of banks and 
customers with regard to the deregulation of time deposits on 
October 1. New York noted that many banks and thrift institutions 
offered "very attractive rates" but Cleveland reported that its 
district banks were not aggressive about the new deposits. Richmond 
and Kansas City agreed that there was little effect on their 
financial institutions and little response from customers. San 
Francisco saw some significant early growth in new deposit accounts, 
but does not expect them to generate substantial inflows of new 
funds.
