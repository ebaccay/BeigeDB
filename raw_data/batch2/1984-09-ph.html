      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Third District economy is still growing in September, led by 
strength in the retail sector. However, there is some easing in 
activity in other sectors. Manufacturers are seeing a slight 
slowdown, although some specific indicators are posting gains. 
Bankers report that consumer lending is thriving while commercial 
lending is slowing its pace. In the agricultural sector, farmers, 
with few exceptions, report a good year. Area resorts, faced with 
rainy weather and tough competition for tourist dollars, have turned 
in a mediocre season. In general, contacts look for continued 
slowing in all areas except retail sales and consumer lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to the September Business Outlook Survey indicate that 
growth in the local manufacturing sector is still positive but is 
easing. Forty-three percent of the manufacturers surveyed this month 
say business activity continues to increase while only 6 percent 
report a decline; just over half say there has been no change over 
last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the apparent cooling of the current business climate, most 
specific indicators show improvement over last month. New orders and 
shipments lead the pack, with 44 percent and 52 percent of 
manufacturers, respectively, citing increases. Only inventories and 
unfilled orders remain unchanged in September, with delivery time, 
employee payrolls, and the average workweek all posting slight 
gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      The near-term outlook for local manufacturing is beginning to dim, 
according to this month's survey. However, while the portion of 
respondents expecting further growth in the next six months is the 
smallest it has been since June 1980, it still remains significant 
at 43 percent. Manufacturers' expectations about specific indicators 
are in keeping with the anticipated easing in future business. 
Survey respondents look for a reduction in inventories, and they 
plan to hold employee payrolls and the length of the average 
workweek at current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The portion of respondents reporting increases in industrial prices 
has fallen for the second month in a row. Seventy percent of the 
executives polled this month say input prices are stable, and a like 
portion reports no change in the prices of finished goods. Looking 
ahead, approximately two-thirds of respondents predict that they 
will be paying higher prices for raw materials within six months and 
about half expect to receive higher prices for their output.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the Third District report strong sales over the past 
six weeks, with back-to-school promotions and cool weather in late 
August giving sales a boost. Contacts in the retail industry 
indicate that big-ticket home furnishings are moving well, along 
with children's apparel. Inventories are slightly heavier than 
usual, relative to current sales, but are in line with expectations 
for the next four months. Sales are currently running 10 to 25 
percent above last year's levels, and retailing executives say they 
are looking forward to tallying up an overall good year with the 
help of the holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers are sending mixed signals on their loan 
activity. Contacts continue to see a slight slowdown in the rate of 
growth of commercial loans but report that the dollar volume of C&amp;I 
loans is still up substantially over year-ago levels. Consumer 
lending has not faltered at all and is registering increases in the 
range of 20 to 28 percent over last year. Local bankers are lowering 
their expectations for commercial loan growth in the near future, 
but their optimism continues to be buoyed by strong prospects for 
growth in the consumer lending area.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate has been holding steady at 13 percent since the end 
of June. Third District bank economists foresee no fluctuations in 
that rate before the end of the year. The general easing in the 
economy has induced contacts to revise their federal funds rate 
forecasts downward slightly with the year-end rate expected to hover 
around 11.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District county agriculture agents report that 1984 has been a 
premium farming year in terms of weather. After a dry, underpar 
season last year, plentiful rainfall has helped to produce a bumper 
crop of both sweet and feed corn, along with a healthy crop of 
blueberries and soybeans in south Jersey, exceptionally large fruits 
in Pennsylvania, and a strong potato crop in Delaware. Field and 
cereal crops are very good, and farmers expect to benefit from the 
easing of restrictions on grain exports. Weather did have some 
damaging effect on two crops this year. Peaches in New Jersey are 
down by about two-thirds due to a frigid winter, and tomato yields 
are running about 60 percent of normal, owing to cracking caused by 
too much rain.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dairy farmers in Pennsylvania are having a good year and note that 
the consumption of milk is up about 6 percent. Chicken farmers, 
their flocks depleted last fall and winter by Avian flu, have 
excellent prospects for production when the quarantine on chickens 
is lifted shortly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm prices, in general, have held steady since last year. While 
record yields in corn and potatoes in particular tended to push 
prices for those two crops lower, corn farmers still can expect to 
be "in the black" for this year. Grain sales to the Soviet Union are 
expected to boost prices and help local farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm income is expected to be slightly better than last year, 
although peach farmers will be hit fairly hard. Peach crop yields in 
New Jersey and the surrounding Pennsylvania and Delaware counties 
were low enough to qualify farmers for Farmers Home Administration 
low-interest loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Resort business in the Third District was disappointing to most 
vacation-spot entrepreneurs this year. Wet, unseasonable weather 
kept many vacationers at home through midsummer, but that was only 
one of the factors keeping the lid on local travel. Both European 
travel, encouraged by the exceptionally strong dollar, and summer 
Olympics in Los Angeles were tough competitors for tourist dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      South Jersey seashore reports saw a drop in visitor volume of about 
10 percent from last year, a result not only of rainy weather and 
cold ocean temperatures but also of the strong American dollar, 
which has cut the number of Canadian visitors virtually in half. 
Only in Atlantic City, where casino gambling flourishes, was 
business better than last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Pocono Mountains, as elsewhere, weather caused a 
disappointing June and July, but August showed surprising strength 
due mostly to last-minute bookings. Gross dollar volume this summer 
could run 3 to 5 percent above last season. Pocono resorts have 
excellent prospects for the fall.
