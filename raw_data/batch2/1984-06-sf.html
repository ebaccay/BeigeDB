      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Twelfth District, the growth of the economy appears to be 
slowing. Consumer spending continues to display exceptional 
strength, with both department stores and automobile dealerships 
experiencing excellent business. Nonresidential construction 
activity also continues to pick up. But in May, the continued rise 
in mortgage interest rates further reduced both the construction and 
sale of new homes. Employment in the manufacturing sector generally 
has been growing at a slower rate due to the ripple effects of the 
housing slowdown on such industries as lumber, near full capacity 
operations in a few industries, and the efforts of firms to hold 
down unit labor costs. In agriculture, the outlook for significant 
improvement in farm income in 1984 has deteriorated due to the 
prospect of excess supplies, aggravated by a decline in exports. In 
April and May, Twelfth District banks experienced a large outflow of 
money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) as they held the line on MMDA 
rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Throughout the District, consumer spending is reported to be 
extremely strong. In fact, the rate of growth apparently accelerated 
in May in contrast to the national pattern. Major department stores 
in Southern California, for example, experienced an average 19 
percent year-to-year gain in sales in May compared with a 14 percent 
gain in April. In Oregon, respondents describe retail sales as a 
bright spot in an otherwise sluggish recovery. Sales of apparel have 
been especially strong, but sales of such durable goods as home 
electronics (video-recorders, televisions) and housewares also are 
reported to be expanding at their earlier rapid rate. The high level 
of new home sales earlier this year is maintaining current sales of 
furniture and appliances at a strong pace, although some slowdown is 
expected soon due to the reduced homebuilding and sales pace. Auto 
sales in May reached their highest level since the late 1970s, 
supported by the increased availability of foreign and domestic 
models and subsidized financing by dealers. Consumer installment 
debt is growing as a percentage of income and retail sales, but loan 
delinquency rates nevertheless are declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most District states, the growth of manufacturing employment has 
slowed in recent months. In California, employment growth in the 
manufacturing sector during the past four months has trailed the 
national gain. There are several reasons for this slowdown. Some 
industries have been boosting output without a corresponding 
increase in employment so as to hold down unit labor costs. Others 
have been cautious about hiring new workers and have relied instead 
on increasing overtime. Still others—notably the Pacific Northwest 
aluminum and paper industries—are operating at near full 
capacity. But there also have been some recent layoffs in certain 
industries. The Pacific Northwest lumber industry has been cutting 
its payrolls due to the effects of the national homebuilding 
slowdown in reducing orders and prices for its products. The copper, 
steel and coal industries in the Intermountain states have been 
laying off workers due to excess worldwide supplies and rising 
imports. The most rapid employment gains continue to occur in the 
electronic equipment and missiles and space industries located In 
California, Oregon, Arizona and Utah. Electronic firms continue to 
benefit not only from rising defense and consumer demand but 
business capital spending to increase efficiency. Other capital 
goods industries adding to their payrolls include nonelectrical 
machinery, trucks and firms manufacturing military and commercial 
transport aircraft.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing starts and sales of new homes in the West are reported to 
have slowed further since April but relatively moderately 
considering the current high level of mortgage rates. Respondents 
attribute the moderate nature of the slowdown to the increased 
public acceptance of adjustable rate mortgages and the increased 
offerings of "buy-down" programs by builders. Sales of existing 
(older) homes actually have continued to increase due to the rise in 
seller financing schemes. Bankers believe mortgage rates have 
reached a threshold, however, where even a further 50 basis point 
rise would have a dramatic negative impact on housing markets. The 
rise in interest rates has not affected the sharp increase in 
nonresidential construction projects planned and underway in the 
West, including new shopping malls, hotels, offices, buildings and 
warehouses. In Southern California, an influx of foreign money from 
Pacific Rim sources is an important source of financing. Firms 
continue to be cautious about investing in new industrial 
structures, except for electronic equipment manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for significant improvement in California net farm 
income in 1984 has become less favorable due to the prospect of 
overly abundant harvests and break-even prices for certain key 
crops. Cotton plantings are progressing well, and prices also look 
favorable relative to a year ago. But the harvest of wheat, barley, 
alfalfa and other small grains is in full swing at prices that at 
best just about match those of a year earlier. The harvest of 
vegetable crops has been outstanding. But demand has lagged behind 
production, reducing prices for such items as lettuce, broccoli and 
celery to or below the break-even point for most growers. Similarly, 
the huge carryover of raisins and potential excess supply of wine 
grapes threaten to hold down grape prices. In the Pacific Northwest 
the outlook for farm income is less favorable than in California due 
to the greater importance of grains in the crop mix. In the Pacific 
Northwest, exports of grain are reported to be running 30 percent 
below the level of a year ago despite increased sales to China. 
Throughout the Twelfth District, rising interest rates are placing 
extreme financial pressure on those farmers who already are highly 
leveraged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District banks experienced a significant runoff in money 
market deposit accounts (MMDAs) during April and May (nearly $1.3 
billion), when market interest rates were moving upward. While not 
all institutions suffered outflow, the large it magnitude of the 
recent weakness was due to a number of factors. First, loan demand 
at many banks remains moderate to weak, although total loan growth 
at large banks has picked up in the second quarter. This slack loan 
demand has left many banks with an abundance of funds. Without the 
demand-side pressure, many banks are holding the line on MMDA rate 
increases to minimize costs and maintain net interest margins. Thus, 
these conditions have opened a significant rate differential between 
banks and a money market funds, which is causing some of the runoff.
A second factor is banks' decision to direct funds from MMDAs and 
into longer-term certificates by offering higher rates on longer 
certificates. In addition, a few smaller institutions also have 
reported that the turmoil in the financial markets has caused 
depositors to move funds into U.S. Treasury securities. Finally, 
these factors coincide with the typical seasonal weakness in 
consumer deposits around the April tax date, as depositors withdraw 
MMDAs to make their tax payments and transfer funds into IRA/Keogh 
accounts.
