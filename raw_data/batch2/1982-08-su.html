      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports suggest that economic activity in most sectors has 
slowed in recent weeks retracing some of the progress made in late 
spring and early summer. Manufacturing activity has declined broadly 
giving rise to new layoffs and plant closings in most Districts. 
Consumers are widely described as extremely cautious, buying very 
selectively, and almost totally avoiding any major commitments. As a 
result of excess capacity and weak orders, many businesses are 
scaling back or deferring capital spending plans. The construction 
industry is confronted by continued weakness in the residential area 
and a recent fading of support from the commercial and industrial 
sector. Crop prospects are generally quite good, but the resultant 
prospect of falling prices implies further financial difficulties 
for farmers. Loan demand is soft with only widely scattered pockets 
of resurgence. The outlook is very subdued and cautious, although a 
few Districts discern traces of optimism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is little in the District reports to suggest any recent 
improvement in industrial activity. Production, shipments, and 
orders are generally below the June-July levels and cost cutting 
measures are being pursued vigorously. Inventories are modest for 
the most part, but there is widespread determination to trim them 
further. Layoffs continue to exceed recalls; vacations and plant 
shutdowns are being extended; and average workweeks are being 
reduced. Capital spending plans are being scaled back since plant 
and equipment capacity is far in excess of current needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dallas, St. Louis, and Philadelphia report that industrial activity 
has stabilized. All other Districts but Kansas City report 
production cut backs that have resulted in layoffs and plant 
closings. New York, Cleveland, and Chicago cite capital goods 
industries, in particular, as an example. Cleveland finds major 
steel producers in great difficulty with inventories high, prices 
low, orders weak, and capacity utilization at 40-50%. In the Chicago 
District over half the freight car plants are closed. Only defense 
related industries, noted by Boston and St. Louis, and some seasonal 
industries such as food processing, seem to be offering much support 
to the broad industrial sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the retail sector, consumers are generally described as cautious 
despite aggressive promotional and discounting programs by 
retailers. The net effect has apparently been to hold real sales at 
or near year ago levels. There is virtually no indication of a 
consumer led recovery being imminent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dealers are keeping inventories very tight and squeezing profit 
margins but have been disappointed recently, particularly by the 
apparent failure of this summer's tax cut and social security 
benefit increase to boost sales. Retailers have adopted extremely 
cautious buying plans, hoping that stronger back to school and 
Christmas spending will materialize, but basically waiting to see 
before committing heavily.
     </p>
     <p>
      Durable goods still seem to be the most affected, but San Francisco 
finds even grocery store sales sliding. Only two areas of relative 
strength appear: tourist trade is doing well in the mountains of 
Pennsylvania and in the western half of the Minneapolis District; 
also, Chicago and Kansas City report recent strength in automobile 
parts and repairs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A very weak but stable residential sector and a stronger but fading 
commercial and industrial sector sum up the current construction 
picture. The housing sector is almost uniformly weak, although 
regional differences do exist. San Francisco reports homebuilding 
picking up slowly while in the New York and Chicago Districts there 
is no revival in sight. Mortgage rates have drifted down in some 
areas, but so far without effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction is generally stronger than residential 
building, but varies considerably from District to District. Most 
Districts remarking on commercial building find it slowing somewhat 
or being sustained only by projects already in progress. Dallas 
reports a high level of activity, however, and Atlanta notes an 
upturn in permits in early August.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With few exceptions District reports on agriculture are bleak. 
Farmers are generally faced with high and rising production costs 
and the prospects of falling crop prices. Weather conditions have 
been good to excellent and forecasts call for bumper crops of grains 
and soybeans, which along with large inventories and weakening 
export demand are widely expected to depress prices significantly 
further as harvests proceed. The livestock sector is somewhat 
stronger as feed prices continue soft and smaller hog and cattle 
supplies lend support to meat prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Continuing deterioration of price to cost ratios is depressing 
farmland prices and eroding the equity position of many farmers. 
Minneapolis reports storage facilities already near capacity and 
Kansas City sees the possibility of a shortage later. Furthermore, 
Minneapolis and Chicago expect relatively small portions of the corn 
crop to be eligible for support programs. The implications of these 
conditions for farmers, lenders, and agribusinesses are, in 
Chicago's view, ominous.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand is widely described as soft. Businesses have slashed 
inventories and otherwise cut costs, greatly reducing credit needs. 
Philadelphia also notes that declining interest rates are attracting 
some borrowers into the long term debt market, further dampening 
business loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      New real estate loans are very weak, but in some areas outstandings 
are on the rise due to lower turnover rates of residential 
properties and a modest increase in second mortgages. Additional 
financing for ongoing commercial projects is also lending support in 
some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer borrowing is showing few signs of life. In the Third 
District there has been a mild recovery, but even there outstandings 
remain slightly below year ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent bank difficulties have reportedly prompted a great deal of 
caution by banks contemplating extensions of credit.
