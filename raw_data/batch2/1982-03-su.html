      Beige Book: National Summary

     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Introduction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While economic conditions remain very depressed 
throughout the nation, there is a widespread view that a bottom was 
reached in the first quarter, possibly in January when severe 
weather hampered activity over a large portion of the nation. 
Allowing for weather effects, retail sales, manufacturing, 
employment, and construction have been about level since late last 
year. Despite deep pessimism, panic has been avoided. Sluggishness 
is expected to continue in the second quarter with some improvement 
about midyear, hopefully aided by lower interest rates. Price 
inflation continues to slow. With a downturn developing in oil and 
gas development, defense procurement becomes the principal expanding 
sector. Finished goods inventories are too high in some sectors, but 
most purchased materials are under close control. Capital spending 
plans generally are being reduced. Auto and appliance sales remain 
weak. Extreme caution holds back decisions on consumption and 
investment, especially on major items. Housing remains severely 
depressed everywhere, but some districts report incipient 
improvement. Office building construction is still vigorous in some 
large centers. Crop prices remain low partly because of large 
harvests projected for this year, but livestock prices have 
increased. Several districts report increased bankruptcies and more 
problem credits for consumers, business, and agriculture. The 
financial condition of S&amp;Ls continues to deteriorate and they 
probably will not be able to finance a resurgence in housing. 
Several districts report business loan demand as "flat," but 
outstandings are buoyed up by expanding energy loans, and loans that 
are not being paid on schedule because of financial problems 
afflicting various borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Regional differences
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All of the district reports follow, in 
general, the outline described above, but there are noticeable 
differences. The Chicago and Cleveland districts with their emphasis 
on hard goods continue to present the blackest pictures. New York, 
on the other hand, finds that the Second District is "weathering the 
recession quite well." Philadelphia may be "on the verge of a 
turnaround." Minneapolis sees "hints of recovery." Dallas reports 
autos and housing "showing initial signs of recovery." At the other 
extreme, San Francisco (in the past one of the most vigorous growth 
regions) has "slipped deeper into recession," with home-building at 
the lowest level since World War II, and distress in housing 
replacing the fabulous boom of the late 1970s.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price increases clearly have slowed, with exceptions in 
some lines. Philadelphia reported, however, that increases in 
industrial prices were more prevalent in March. Cleveland and 
Chicago note substantial pressure by producers on labor and 
suppliers to cut costs. Goods and services are readily available, 
and price discounting is widespread. Chicago noted far-reaching 
ramifications of the declines in crude oil and oil product prices, 
as a result of the world-wide excess supply of oil.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Additional layoffs and reduced hours, affecting full-time and part-time workers in a wide variety of lines of business, 
were reported by most districts. New York characterized overall 
labor market conditions there as relatively strong. Dallas noted 
deterioration since December, due to layoffs and immigration of the 
unemployed from other districts, but reported an unemployment rate 
in February of only 5.8%. Layoffs in the Fourth District included 
workers from the last auto passenger tire plant in Akron. San 
Francisco indicated that most of the boost to employment from rising 
defense spending will occur in 1983-1984, not this year. In response 
to widespread layoffs and reduced job opportunities, unionized 
workers have been increasingly willing to grant concessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales reports are mixed, but generally indicate 
sluggish or weak spending. Lack of confidence and negative 
expectations were noted as restraining outlays. Those who commented 
on the outlook project a rise in consumer expenditures in the second 
half of this year. Minneapolis and Dallas noted signs of recovery in 
auto sales in response to rebates. Evidence of financial strainsâ€”consumer loan delinquencies, rising personal bankruptcies, and 
closing of retail storesâ€”was reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on inventories are difficult to characterize 
because of a highly mixed picture by industry, by stage of 
fabrication and distribution, and by region. In general, raw 
materials and purchased components are low, while finished goods 
have become excessive when sales sagged. San Francisco tells of 
"involuntary" accumulation. Philadelphia reports retail inventories 
"pretty clean", in general. Richmond notes a rise in manufacturing 
inventories. Boston finds stocks generally too high, but packaging 
materials "very low." Cleveland says oil product inventories are 
being cut, but not crude oil. Aluminum is high at the producer 
level, and "extremely low" at the fabricator level. To sum up, 
except for particular imbalances, inventories are low relative to 
normal standards because of heavy finance charges and uncertain 
sales prospects. Chicago and Kansas City warn that a rise in final 
sales could quickly bring longer lead times and higher prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports suggest a significant decline in 
capital spending in 1982. Low business confidence is a major factor. 
San Francisco and Boston are affected by layoffs related to reduced 
demand for commercial aircraft. The drop in oil prices has brought a 
reduction in drilling in all producing regions. Demand for related 
equipment has dropped, and a proposed oil pipe mill has been 
canceled. New York and Cleveland report cancellations of orders for 
machine tools. The TVA has halted construction on three nuclear 
plants. Commercial construction is weak except for large office 
building in centers such as New York, Chicago, Cleveland, and 
Dallas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Defense procurement is vigorous, but these activities 
are most significant in a few districts: San Francisco, Dallas, St. 
Louis, and Boston. Steel and motor vehicle output are down sharply, 
but there are signs of improvement. Appliance output also is down 
currently. Textiles are down in Atlanta and apparel in Dallas. 
Petrochemical output is off in several districts. Richmond reports a 
rise in demand for cigarettes. Overall, manufacturing output remains 
depressed but may be past its low point.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housin
      </strong>
      g
      <br/>
      The housing picture varies from bad to worse throughout the 
nation. Dallas and Minneapolis report a recent rise in home sales, 
but Richmond, San Francisco, St. Louis, Chicago and most other 
districts have observed no improvement in starts from an extremely 
low level. A backlog of demand for housing is building up with few 
unsold units, as reported by Kansas City. Lower interest rates are 
the only hope for home building this year and time is running out, 
at least for the northern states. More builders and subcontractors 
are leaving the field. "Creative financing" has not proved of much 
help.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Large crops are forecast for the South, the Midwest, 
and the Great Plainsâ€”especially wheat, soybeans, and corn. 
Production plans indicate large plantings, and subsoil moisture 
conditions are excellent. Large crops suggest further downward 
pressure on prices. Livestock prices have been rising, but most 
experts project a further decline in net farm income. Farm land 
prices are declining and delinquencies and bankruptcies are rising. 
Heavy debts at high interest rates, combined with lower income, 
could cause further deterioration in the financial condition of 
agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Uncertainty continues to characterize the financial 
markets. Business loan demand is described as weak or flat in most 
districts. Business credit ratings are being downgraded, and more 
loans require special attention. New York experts say business 
liquidity continues to deteriorate, and more ratings will be 
downgraded soon. Mortgage credit is very tight, both for housing and 
commercial projects. Usury rates are impeding credit use in some 
states, especially for credit cards and auto loans.
