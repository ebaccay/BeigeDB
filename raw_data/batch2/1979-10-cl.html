      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 10, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business conditions in the Fourth District have improved during 
  September, but most respondents view a positive third quarter as 
  temporary. Strength in retail sales is credited to a comeback in 
  auto sales which is not expected to carry over into the fourth 
  quarter. Production of capital goods is expected to remain strong 
  this quarter, but reduced operating rates in steel are anticipated. 
  Bankers report strong loan demand, which may reflect the weakened 
  financial position among businesses and consumers. Despite a 
  stronger than expected level of housing starts, several housing 
  market officials believe the marginal buyer is being squeezed out of 
  the housing market by continuously rising prices and interest rates. 
  Continued high rate of price increases will prevail in the fourth 
  quarter with only a few exceptions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Growth of retail sales has slowed in the District, but department 
  store officials are skeptical that the economy is in the midst of a 
  recession. One retail economist noted that real sales of department 
  store-type goods have flattened, but have not yet declined. Other 
  retailers assert that price-adjusted sales are biased downward 
  because consumers have been responding to differences in relative 
  prices. Apparel sales, for example, have been excellent in recent 
  weeks, reflecting a price increase of only half the 13 percent 
  increase in the consumer price index. However, retailers are 
  concerned about diminishing profit margins, rising loan 
  delinquencies, and bad-debt losses. Indeed, most respondents stated 
  that retail sales would have been negative in September except for 
  the pickup in auto sales. The strength in auto sales, which was 
  induced by rebates, may have come at the expense of fourth-quarter 
  sales, according to some officials.
       </p>
       <p>
        Durable goods manufacturing has tended to hold up better than had 
  been expected, partly because housing and related industries have 
  been better than expected. However, a supplier to the appliance 
  industry reports that orders have tended to weaken and backlogs 
  reduced in recent weeks. An economist for an aluminum producer views 
  the decline in orders for packaging materials as an indication of a 
  further slowdown. Finally, a retailer believes some softness in 
  overall business sales stems from tight control over inventories, 
  and hence new orders, by retailers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods producers, except for auto and truck-related 
  industries, report that business has been buoyed by a need for 
  additional facilities, and production is expected to remain strong 
  in the fourth quarter. According to one District economist, high 
  utilization rates and sluggish investment during most of the 
  expansion have made the need for fixed investment apparent. However, 
  a durable goods manufacturer expected businessmen to be cautious 
  because of a lack of funds for investment. A steel economist states 
  that steel orders have dropped to about half the rate in the first 
  two quarters of 1979, when orders exceeded shipments and backlogs 
  rose rapidly. Probable shipments for the second half of 1979 are 7.5 
  million tons, compared with 8.5 million tons in the first half. 
  Operating rates in the steel industry will hover around 80 percent 
  in the second half, compared with 90 percent in the first half of 
  1979. However, demand for steel from energy, freight cars, heavy 
  construction, and machinery remains strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Continued strength in business and consumer loans can be attributed 
  in part to deterioration in the financial position of businesses and 
  households. A banker expresses concern that strong commercial loan 
  demand was the result of a weakening cash flow position among 
  producers. External financing for new model changeovers is cited by 
  one auto economist as a source for increased demand for business 
  loans. On the consumer side, a banker mentions consolidation of debt 
  as a source of consumer loan demand. Indeed, delinquency rates have 
  been climbing. But most of the consumer demand, according to one 
  banker, has been for installment loans and credit card usage. 
  Several bankers note a rise in precautionary borrowing by business 
  and consumers as a hedge against higher interest rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Higher interest rates are having a noticeable effect on both 
  borrowers and lenders in the mortgage market, and are expected to 
  contribute to a decline in mortgage demand and housing starts. 
  Several bankers and housing economists expect 1.5 million and 1.6 
  million in starts during the fourth quarter. However, several 
  savings and loan associations report growing difficulties in 
  financing mortgages because of weak deposit flows and narrowing 
  profit margins brought about by a negative yield curve. One savings 
  and loan official explains that the appearance of adequate liquidity 
  may be misleading because a great reliance on jumbo certificates of 
  deposit (CDs) requires savings and loan associations to maintain a 
  higher liquidity position in case the jumbo CDs cannot be rolled 
  over. Although the cost of funds has been high, a savings and loan 
  official states that mortgages are still being made on the 
  expectation that mortgage interest rates will decline next year and 
  that profits can still be made on points during the first year of a 
  new mortgage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moderation in the inflation rate has not yet occurred, but 
  businessmen look for some relief in response to a slowdown in 
  economic activity. A steel economist believes that steel scrap 
  prices will drop further because of lower operating rates in the 
  steel industry. However, a durable goods producer expected little 
  change from double-digit inflation until 1980. An energy economist 
  believes that gasoline supplies in most parts of the District will 
  probably exceed demand this month, and the price in the near term 
  will rise less rapidly than natural gas and electricity prices. The 
  rise in food prices is expected to be near the overall inflation 
  rate in 1980.
