      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic growth is continuing to slow in the Southeast. 
For the first time in several months, job growth did not outrun 
labor force increases and the unemployment rate stabilized. However, 
a number of industries remain quite strong, including some textiles, 
paper, and the full gamut of auto-related manufacturing. Consumer 
spending, and especially auto sales, is growing briskly, but signs 
of weakness are surfacing in housing and related markets. Mortgage 
commitments and lending activity at financial institutions have 
weakened. Tourism is showing growth from a year ago, but attendance 
has been far below expectations at the New Orleans' World's Fair. 
Excessively dry, hot weather again threatens southeastern farm 
incomes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unemployment rate in the District edged upward to the nation's 
rate in April after declining in each of the five preceding months. 
Florida's unemployment rate increased in both April and May, after 
posting its lowest rate in nearly a decade in March. A slowdown in 
construction and production for national defense weakened Florida's 
labor market. Softening housing demand has adversely affected 
construction employment in much of the region and cut the demand for 
lumber used by building materials and furniture industries. 
Reorganization of the Tennessee Valley Authority and a scaling down 
of construction of power-generating facilities have trimmed that 
government agency's employment in the region. In Georgia. 500 jobs 
have been lost from the closing of denim-producing textile mills due
to shifting consumer demands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the softening of overall labor market indicators, some 
industries are quite strong and prospects for others are improving. 
Some segments of the textile industry, notably carpets, are 
performing well, and the paper industry is operating a 45-48 hour 
workweek, thanks to a high volume of orders and backlogs. Booming 
new-car sales have induced a lengthening of the workweek and spurred 
investment spending at plants supplying the automobile industry. 
Tire plants are currently on a seven-day workweek and one major 
manufacturer is purchasing new tire machines in a large 
modernization program. Moreover, employment at Nissan's plant in 
Tennessee is expected to expand by 1,000 over the next 12 months 
with the addition of a car assembly line to its truck assembly 
operation. By summer's end, 21 of Florida's 22 phosphate mines will 
be back in production and most workers will have been recalled. 
Improving oil demand and sharply lower drilling costs brighten 
prospects for increased activity in the energy sectors of Louisiana, 
Alabama, and Mississippi. Summer hiring of teenagers, spurred by the 
Job Partnership and Training Act and private sector initiatives, has 
been accompanied by a shortage of applicants for available jobs in 
the fast-food and hospitality industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a poll of merchants, May's retail sales were up over 
April and year-earlier levels. The region's sales outpaced 
comparable increases nationally as well. New-car sales in the 
District were booming in May, although the rate of increase trailed 
the nation because of the above-average growth of regional sales in 
1983. Atlanta and wine other metropolitan areas continue to be very 
fast-growing markets. Reports of weakness are confined to rural 
areas where farmers remain under financial stress. Non-auto 
retailers report that seasonal items such as summer apparel, ceiling 
fans, lawn mowers and other outside tools, and garden furniture are 
top-selling items. Merchants are ordering fall and winter 
merchandise with the expectation that sales for the remainder of the 
year will be healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family building permits rose 2 percent in April after 
seasonal adjustment while the nation's permits dropped 3 percent. 
Alabama and Mississippi, both late to recover from recession, posted 
the highest growth rates within the District. However, reports from 
Birmingham indicate a recent sharp reduction in home sales and 
construction activity. At the same time, Jackson home builders 
report that a special state financing program for selected home 
buying is helping them maintain a steady pace of construction. 
Districtwide, reports from building materials suppliers who 
experienced heavy sales activity earlier this year now indicate a 
leveling off or decline in unit sales. Falling prices for lumber 
also foreshadow a housing construction slowdown.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction declined by one-fifth in April after 
rising by more than one-half from February to March. Alabama, 
Florida, and Louisiana construction slipped most, by 25-30 percent. 
Birmingham developers report declines in all nonresidential 
construction, and the completion of large commercial construction 
projects associated with the World's Fair has slowed activity in New 
Orleans. Continued rapid growth of nonresidential construction in 
Atlanta, Nashville, and Orlando mark this region's pockets of 
strength. Although the planning horizon of developers in these areas 
has shortened recently, most are going ahead with projects whose 
planned completion dates are well over a year away.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unadjusted bank data for May show a decline in the growth of lending 
activity in the Southeast for the second consecutive month despite a 
recovery in bank deposit growth from the usual tax-related 
withdrawals of April. Business and real estate loan growth in May 
was noticeably weaker than in April while consumer lending increased 
slightly. Mortgage commitments at the region's savings and loan 
institutions declined in April. Overall, financial institutions in 
the Southeast report high levels of liquidity and reasonably good 
loan demand, but the growth of demand has not kept pace with the 
growth of deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New Orleans' World Fair drew an average of 35,000 visitors per day 
in its first month of operation, or 1.25 million, well below the 
70,000 cited as the break-even attendance average. High prices, 
delayed construction, and adverse publicity concerning its financing 
problems have particularly limited attendance by visitors who live 
within a three-hour drive to the Fair. The low attendance prompted 
Fair officials to lower the price of season passes by one-third to 
lure more local and nearby visitors, but daily attendance is still 
below the break-even level. Neighboring states are benefiting from 
long-distance tourists on their way to the Fair. Most southeastern 
visitor centers are enjoying growth in the number of registrations. 
Air traffic and lodgings industry figures also indicate an increased 
amount of travel in the Southeast. Southeastern air traffic is up in 
almost all airports. Atlanta's airport reversed a three-month 
decline in passenger volume with a 2 percent increase in April.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With favorable weather, District crop farmers are likely to earn 
higher revenue in 1984 as a result of higher prices and increased 
plantings. However, dry, hot weather is now plaguing some of the 
region and, in the absence of a PIK program this year, losses could 
be heavier than in 1983 if drought continues. In the meat sector, an 
expected expansion of poultry production will lift total revenue in 
the poultry industry. For pork and beef producers, high feed costs 
and continuing low livestock prices have resulted in losses; planned 
production cutbacks that are proportionately larger than the 
expected price increases should shrink livestock revenue from a year 
ago.
