     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic recovery in the Eighth District, which began around the 
turn of the year, strengthened in February and early March. 
Favorable weather contributed to greater retail sales and robust 
construction activity. Orders for manufactured goods have been 
rising, and shipments of goods have been inching up. Inventories are 
relatively low, a positive sign for future production. Total 
District employment, however, has changed little from January 
levels, and, although the price level has been increasing only 
moderately, a few respondents are concerned that the oil price 
decline is concealing an ominous rise in other prices. Expectations 
are that sales, production and employment will rise in the spring 
and early summer, but capital spending plans have changed little.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales at department stores in the District averaged nearly 10 
percent more in February and early March than in the corresponding 
period in 1982, a gain of about 7 percent after adjusting for 
merchandise price increases. Most merchandise sold well, 
particularly "large ticket" items. Weather was exceptionally good 
for shopping this year, unlike last year when much of the area was 
blanketed with deep snow. Merchants also noted that some customers 
had received large tax refunds as a result of overwithholding after 
the July tax cut. Automobile sales in the District, after rising 
sharply in January, changed little in February and early March. Five 
dealers reported slight increases in sales, while four experienced 
declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      New and existing homes sold well in February and early March. More 
sales of new homes were made in February in the St. Louis area than 
in any other month in three years, and sales continued at that pace 
in early March, according to the St. Louis Homebuilders' 
Association. Favorable reports also were received from other parts 
of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential and commercial construction in most areas of the 
District has been relatively strong. The average size of new homes 
has declined, however, reflecting high prices of construction, high 
mortgage rates, and a sharp rise in gas heating prices. Reflecting 
the pace of construction activity, lumber sales in the mid-south 
region have risen, causing an increase in the price of standing 
timber. Several contractors voiced concern over costs of materials, 
noting that since last October board lumber has gone up 20 percent; 
brick 9, percent; concrete, 7 percent; and heating and air 
conditioning equipment, 4 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial production in the District remained depressed during 
February and early March, and several large operations were closed, 
including a tire plant, a foundry, a farm equipment plant and a lead 
mining facility. However, most industrial firms, other than those 
producing business equipment and farm machinery, reported increases 
in new orders and shipments. Total District employment changed 
little, since most output gains were accomplished by improved 
productivity, and over two thousand employees were idled by the 
plant closings. Managers claim that a tight rein has been kept on 
inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although shipments from many industrial firms are expanding, reports 
from transportation companies still present a mixed picture. River 
traffic at the Memphis harbor declined in February. District rail 
and trucking activity reportedly was little changed for most 
products, although an increase was noted in grain and lumber 
shipments.
     </p>
     <p>
      It appears that many District farmers will participate in the PIK 
(payment-in-kind) program of the government. Farmers believe it is 
favorable for them, and it is expected to reduce inventories of 
agricultural commodities significantly. Prices of most crops, 
however, are not expected to rise much above support levels. The 
sales outlook for farm equipment and seed is bleak with the PIK 
program.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial condition of savings and loan associations in the 
District is improving, although one large association and several 
others have been liquidated since January. With the new money market 
deposit accounts, the associations are able to attract funds, and, 
with the decline in interest rates since last summer, the 
associations are now operating at a profit or much smaller loss. 
Reflecting a substantial inflow of money market deposits in February 
and early March, the associations have increased their liquidity, 
reduced average rates on money market deposit accounts from 11 
percent to 8.5 percent, made and acquired a greater volume of 
mortgage loans, and extended more loan commitments. A survey of 14 
financial institutions indicates that check withdrawals from the 
money deposit accounts has averaged less than one a month per 
account.
