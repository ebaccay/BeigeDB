      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Growing evidence suggests the District economy is in a moderate 
upturn. Employment is edging higher, although some sectors remain 
weak. Unemployment rates have declined slightly in most areas. 
Consumer spending is up moderately. However, high long-term interest 
rates are depressing the housing and housing-related industries as 
well as the farm sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales are reported to be up moderately in 
the District compared to recent months and this time last year. Soft 
goods sales continue to outperform hard goods sales. Sales of home 
entertainment products are also good, while sales of quality goods 
generally are outperforming lower priced items. Widespread sales 
promotions and markdowns contributed to the sales gain but also 
narrowed margins and strained liquidity of financially weak stores. 
Although many retailers believe that sales erosion has stopped, they 
are reported to be lowering their sales estimates for the remainder 
of the year. For example, many clothing retailers expect fall 1982 
sales to be flat compared to fall 1981 and are thus now buying 
cautiously at trade shows in Atlanta and Miami.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in May in the District were generally off from May of 
last year but up from levels of mid-1981 and early 1982. The 
geographic pattern of sales within the District is consistent with 
geographic differences in the severity of the recession; Atlanta car 
sales are strong compared to agriculturally-depressed South Georgia. 
Full-size cars continue their recent gain of market share at the 
expense of compact cars; however, the recent increase in the price 
of gasoline may soon reverse this trend. Auto dealers are fearful 
that high interest rates will limit future sales levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing industry remains sluggish. 
Real estate sales and issuance of building permits are basically 
unchanged since May. Realtors do not expect much improvement for the 
summer. Realtors and S&amp;Ls report that housing is definitely a 
buyers' market-price concessions are causing a decline in housing 
prices in some areas. The much-feared overbuilding of commercial 
office space may have been exaggerated. In many areas of the 
District, downtown office space is attracting occupants, but often 
as a result of the lowering of rents.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strength in bank lending is reported to be largely distress 
borrowing related to the recession. Firms are avoiding the long-term 
credit market because of high interest rates and are using short-
term bank credit to finance operating costs. In Florida, some firms 
are continuing to borrow to relocate businesses to the region. The 
Mississippi area had little strength in bank loans from any source.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There are recent indications that the 
region is experiencing a moderate upturn in employment. Florida is 
behaving as usual, with a slowdown beginning six to nine months 
after the national recession. Employment there is declining and the 
state's unemployment rate is over 8 percent. Construction remains 
weak throughout the District, but based on employment figures 
through April and impressions from those close to the industry in 
June, construction jobs have improved somewhat. Service-related 
employment continues to climb, but recent increases have been below 
trend as recessions elsewhere have slowed the inflow of northerners 
to Florida. Unlike the private sector, however, government jobs are 
still declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      A slight upturn in employment is also evident in slightly lower 
unemployment rates in the region. Unemployment rates declined in 
April in five of the six states in the District, with Georgia 
experiencing the largest decline. Although Alabama's unemployment 
rate edged up, the increase was marginal when compared to previous 
months. Florida's jobless rate fell in April despite a decline in 
employment as labor force growth slowed in response to the reduced 
inflow of people from outside the state. Florida and Georgia are the 
only two states in the six-state region with single-digit 
unemployment rates. These two states, however, comprise a large 
portion of the area's population and labor force. Thus movement in 
their rates has an important influence on the region's job picture.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are signs of a turnaround in the south Louisiana petroleum 
industry due to higher crude oil prices and the potential for 
greater demand. Well financed oil drillers and related operations 
see opportunities to expand as the surplus is consumed. Streamlined 
regulations regarding offshore drilling have stimulated drilling 
activity, particularly in the Mobile Bay area.
     </p>
     <p>
      The textile industry, a major portion of which is based in the 
Southeast, has been affected by the recession. However, production 
has bottomed out and a very gradual revival is expected to begin in 
August after normal July plant closings. Products tied to autos and 
housing have been doing more poorly than other segments of the 
industry and are expected to recover more slowly. Personal consumer 
products are considered most likely to lead the rest of the textile 
industry out of the recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Attendance at the World's Fair through June 17 was 
3,427,096 compared to the original projection of 2,271,000. After a 
slow start, May attendance was considerably heavier than expected. 
Due to physical site limitations, promoters are still sticking with 
original projections of 11 million total attendance. Still, overall 
attendance should exceed 11 million. People driving to the World's 
Fair are taking in other Tennessee attractions as well. Tourists are 
reportedly arriving in Memphis and Nashville in record numbers. The 
Fair's so-called "spinoff effects" appear limited to the state. 
Tourist activity in north Florida is down from the same time last 
year, and in New Orleans, hotel occupancy rates are lower than 
usual.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The farm financial picture for the Sixth District 
remains unfavorable. From a low rate of 26 percent in Tennessee to a 
high of 60 percent in Georgia as of June 2, delinquencies on farm 
loans represent a continuing problem. The 40 percent delinquency 
rate for the District demonstrates the high proportion of FmHA farm 
borrowers who are in economic difficulty. Completed and pending 
foreclosures, nevertheless, comprise less than 2 percent of 
delinquencies. Recent legal decisions would also appear to forestall 
any foreclosure activity in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      With few exceptions, acreage for the major crops is down 10 to 15 
percent from last year's. Peanut acreage is down even more, 20 to 30 
percent. But these acreage reductions do not necessarily portend a 
drop in production. The highly favorable weather and soil moisture 
conditions which exist throughout the District may result in 
production near that of last year. Clearly, if such is the case, 
there will be less upward pressure on farm prices.
