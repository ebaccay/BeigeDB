      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the Seventh District shows mixed trends, but 
remains depressed overall, especially in contrast to the nation. 
Reaction to the election was very favorable on the part of 
management. But sharply higher interest rates are causing great 
uneasiness. Price inflation has accelerated, partly because of 
rising labor costs. Retail sales have improved somewhat, but sales 
of autos and trucks have been disappointing. Airline traffic is 
sharply lower. Producer equipment output is declining. Steel demand 
has improved further. Housing remains bleak. The financial position 
of farmers has improved, and farmland values are on the uptrend 
again.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Reaction to election
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business and financial executives seem to be 
almost unanimous in their enthusiasm over the extent of the 
conservative shift registered in last week's election, unmatched 
since 1952. They realize that any policy changes will take time to 
implement, but anticipate less onerous administration by regulators 
and less antagonism toward the profit system, which should encourage 
risk taking.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wholesale prices are rising at a faster pace again. Utility 
rates are about 20 percent above last year, but are still deemed 
inadequate. The CTA might raise transit fares in Chicago from 60 to 
85 cents at year end, and to $1 next June. Airline fares are sharply 
higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor organizations, which now include many municipal 
workers, display an unswerving militancy in contract negotiations 
despite widespread layoffs, especially toward attempts of management 
to change work rules to improve productivity. The GM-UAW pact of 
September 1979 was valued at 34 percent over three years, assuming 
an 8 percent annual CPI rise, much less than has occurred. The GM 
formula set the pattern for other major industries. In several 
recent instances managements at various district plants have told 
workers covered by national labor contracts that labor costs are 
about 25 percent less at competing plants in the South. Some or all 
of the jobs at these plants are in jeopardy. Higher energy costs in 
the North are also an adverse factor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales were somewhat improved in October, with seasonal 
merchandise aided by colder-than-normal weather. Retailers are said 
to have ordered cautiously for the Christmas season, which will not 
begin in earnest until the second half of November. Some retailers 
insist that last year's federal bankruptcy law must be revised 
because of growing abuse. "Slow pay" problems on professional bills 
have increased demands for cash payments and improved business for 
bill collectors. Many established fixed-price retailers are said to 
be ready to "deal" with customers to meet competition. Manufacturers 
of riding mowers, RVs, outboard motors, and other luxury goods are 
holding production at a very low level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos and trucks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of autos and trucks have been somewhat 
disappointing thus far in the model year. Various assembly plants 
are being closed periodically for a week or more, including the 
plant where Chrysler assembles its smallest compacts, which were in 
short supply in mid-1979. Heavy truck demand appears to have 
stabilized and is expected to rebound in 1981. Indefinite layoffs in 
the auto industry have dropped from over 250,000 to 191,000, but 
little further improvement is expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Airline travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Airline passenger miles in October were down about 
11 percent from last year. Traffic was down 17 percent for the 
largest airline, partly because of the stimulus of half-fare coupons 
last year. With increases totaling 26 percent since June, standard 
air fares are now 40 percent above last year, an unprecedented 
development. Another 6 percent boost is set for later this month. 
Higher fares are a major factor depressing both business and 
pleasure travel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Order backlogs for most producer equipment continue 
to decline. New orders are weak. Some analysts expect the producer 
goods downturn to persist past mid-1981. Some of the largest 
construction equipment plants are shut down temporarily. A revival 
in demand for construction equipment depends on housing. Orders 
received by a producer of capital goods components have increased 
for two months, reflecting needs for replacement and maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bookings of a leading steel company are running at 80 percent 
of capacity, with sheet products leading. Shipments will continue at 
an improved level through year end, but will remain well below last 
year's peak. Substantial price increases are being posted. A hot 
strip mill, closed last May after demand suddenly dried up, has been 
reopened. Steel companies producing oil country goods are planning 
increases in capacity, because current facilities are running at 
full capacity—a unique situation for the various product groupings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction and transactions are very weak 
throughout the district. In the first nine months single-family 
permits in the Chicago area were 66 percent below last year and 84 
percent below 1978. Multi-family permits were off somewhat less. 
Sales of existing homes were down 33 percent from last year, and 41 
percent from 1978. Mortgage rates have risen further to the 14-15 
percent range, but few loans are being negotiated. (One large 
Chicago S&amp;L stopped making loans on November 5.) Some S&amp;Ls are 
offering only variable rate mortgages. Many home builders, and some 
mortgage bankers, have ceased operations, at least temporarily. A 
leading producer of building materials is raising its forecast of 
housing starts in 1981 to 1.45 million. This is based on (1) growing 
evidence that the housing stock is inadequate, and (2) an expected 
decline in the basic mortgage rate to the 12-13 percent range.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rebounds in commodity prices and farm income prospects 
in recent months are credited with sparking a rise in farmland 
values in the district, up 5 percent in the third quarter, and 
enough to wipe out the decline of the first half. Farm loan demand 
remains soft despite a marked improvement in availability of loans. 
Deposits at rural banks have increased and loan repayments have 
accelerated as farmers increased cash marketings. Transportation 
problems are not nearly as significant as last year, because of 
smaller crops and an increase in the number of hopper cars. 
Purchases of farm implements have increased, but only moderately,
and not for all types.
