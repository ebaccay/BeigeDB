      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 29, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Still no signs of a recovery in the First District. Retailers 
continue to exceed modest sales goals, but only through extensive 
promotional activity. Bargain hunting is very prevalent. The 
manufacturing situation has improved to the extent that more firms 
reported sales which are "bumping along the bottom" than reported 
further declines. Planning for 1983 is based on the assumption that 
current sales and order rates continue for another six months. 
However, most of the manufacturers contacted this month felt that 
payrolls and inventories had been brought down to levels consistent 
with current sales rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers in the First District continue to report sales 
exceeding their expectations, expectations that have been severely 
tempered by the recession. Bargain-hunting is very much in evidence, 
making promotional activity a critical element in maintaining sales. 
No contacted merchants believed the July tax cut or Social Security 
increases were being spent in their stores yet.
     </p>
     <p>
      One discount retailer reported sales in August up 13 percent over a 
weak August last year, and cited extra promotional activity this 
year as an important reason for the improvement. A store selling 
appliances and other consumer durables reported sales over the last 
60 days flat to plus 5 percent compared to last year. Although this 
was the worst 60 days so far in 1982 (the sales increase for the 
year to date is in double digits), their market share has continued 
to rise. Promotional activities and careful comparison-shopping by 
customers have both worked to their advantage. A general 
merchandiser in the Hartford area reported "fair" performance, 
citing sizable but very bargain-oriented responses to promotions. A 
clothing and hardgoods merchant operating nationwide largely through 
catalog sales was contacted for the first time this month. They have 
averaged 30 percent annual sales growth over the last five years, 
and are "mystified" by August and year to date sales more than 40 
percent above last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retail inventory situation is mixed. Several stores reported 
that they are buying cautiously for the Christmas season to keep 
inventories down and retain flexibility. Others are building 
inventories to improve customer service and "make volume happen." 
One of the "cautious" buyers expressed concern that widespread weak 
buying will discourage production, and goods will not be available 
if needed later.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the firms contacted are expecting an improved fourth quarter and 
a strong Christmas season. But all said they would have to work to 
get the customers inside their doors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the manufacturers contacted described the present situation 
as one of "bumping along the bottom." Included in this group were 
manufacturers of machine tools, small appliances, automotive 
products, computers and products for the home. Several firms in 
printing-related fields reported further declines in the late summer 
months. Firms divided on whether domestic or overseas sales are 
weaker. Canadian sales of printing equipment were reported to be 
particularly weak. Sales of productivity improving equipment are 
holding up better than other sales, according to a machine tool 
manufacturer and a producer of packaging equipment. A computer 
manufacturer expects a strong response to a new product advance, 
although overall sales are expected to be flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      With few exceptions firms do not look for a recovery in their own 
industries within the next six months. Budget plans are being 
developed assuming a continuation of the present situation. However, 
most of the firms contacted feel that inventories and employment 
levels are generally consistent with current sales volumes and they 
do not plan any further corrections. This contrasts with the 
responses last month, when even firms with stable orders were making 
additional cutbacks. It also contrasts with the responses to a 
recent survey of local purchasing agents; this survey shows firms 
continuing to reduce inventories and payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Solow, Eckstein, Samuelson, and Houthakker were available 
for comment this month. The first three share similar views 
concerning the state of the economy and how the Fed should respond 
to it. They all believe that the economy is dangerously weak and 
could deteriorate further before finally turning around. None 
envisions a particularly robust recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein is particularly alarmed by the recent surge in unemployment 
insurance claims. Samuelson bases his pessimism on declining 
production, weak auto sales, and sagging consumer confidence. Solow 
fears that the widespread gloom in the business community could 
become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
     </p>
     <p>
      In light of their sobering assessments, Solow, Samuelson, and 
Eckstein all recommend that the Fed should exceed its money growth 
targets in the near future. Samuelson thinks above-target growth 
should continue until a recovery is clearly evident. Eckstein has 
reluctantly concluded that the Fed should explicitly raise its 1983 
Ml growth target to 6 percent. None of the three economists have 
strong feelings about achieving growth targets for the other 
monetary aggregates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although sensitive to the risk and costs of rekindling inflation, 
all three believe that without a further drop in interest rates the 
risk and costs of severe economic decline would be even greater. 
Solow and Samuelson maintain that the Fed has already established 
its credentials as an inflation-fighter which would not be seriously 
jeopardized by above-target money growth under such distressed 
economic conditions. As evidence of this credibility, Samuelson 
pointed out that financial markets have strengthened considerably in 
recent weeks in spite of a widespread perception that the Fed has 
eased. He concluded that any moderation in inflation gained by 
strict adherence to monetary targets would be small and clearly not 
worth unemployment in excess of 10 percent. Yet, he did advise the 
Fed to bring money growth within targets at the first signs of 
"credibility erosion," such as increasing long-term interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to the other three economists, Houthakker believes that 
a modest recovery is already underway and, consequently, no 
emergency measures are needed to bail the economy out. He would keep 
Ml growing at a 5 percent annual rate for the foreseeable future. He 
is unconcerned about recent upward "blips" in Ml growth as long as 
it is brought within range by the end of the year. He also thinks 
that the recent tax increase played a major role in reducing 
interest rates and that additional deficit-reducing measures would 
promote further rate reductions.
