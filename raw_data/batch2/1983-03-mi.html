      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District's recovery continues to gain momentum. The 
directors' reports at our March meeting were unanimously optimistic, 
probably the most optimistic in several years. Our directors do not 
appear to share some national analysts' view that the February 
statistics denote a relapse in the economy. January and February 
advances in retail, home, and manufacturing sales were stronger than 
the increases that occurred late last year. The recovery has also 
begun to reach the district's two weakest industries—metal mining 
and agriculture. Seven out of Minnesota's eight taconite plants have 
scheduled some production this spring, and the new Payment-in-Kind 
Program has engendered some optimism in agriculture. The recovery 
would have even more momentum if auto sales hadn't eased and falling 
oil prices hadn't further curbed petroleum exploration in the 
western part of the district. Furthermore, district state 
governments' struggles to balance their budgets suggest that 
considerable weakness persists even though the district economy has 
started to recuperate. Lending remains lackluster at district banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As noted in previous Redbooks, the district's recovery has been led 
by consumer spending. It continues to strengthen. The largest 
retailer in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area reports a definite pickup 
in department store sales in January and February and indicates that 
they were in fact better than expected. Bank directors also report 
improving retail sales. In South Dakota, for example, some 
retailers' sales have recently been up as much as 40 to 50 percent 
from a year ago. Home sales have also continued to gain momentum. 
According to the Minneapolis Board of Realtors, January and February 
home sales in Minneapolis and its suburbs were up 34 percent from a 
year ago compared with a 16 percent year-to-year gain in the fourth 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to retail and home sales, auto sales appear to have 
weakened in early 1983. Although several bank directors report that 
car sales in their immediate areas have been good, regional sales 
managers for the nation's two largest automobile manufacturers 
indicate that sales in January and February were down from a year 
earlier (after being up in late 1982). They view this easing as 
temporary, however, because consumers have been showing considerable 
interest in purchasing cars. Early attendance at the Greater St. 
Paul and Minneapolis Auto Show in mid-March, for example, was at 
record levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing, like consumer spending, has continued to gain 
momentum. According to a University of Minnesota survey of Minnesota 
manufacturers, 38 percent of the respondents reported increases in 
new orders in February compared with 27 percent reporting increases 
last November. While the percentage of manufacturers reporting 
increases rose, the percentage reporting declines dropped to 24 
percent in February from 46 percent in November.
     </p>
     <p>
      Much of this pickup in manufacturing has come from the forest 
products industries. The revival in home construction continues to 
result in Montana lumber mills stepping up operations and Minnesota 
waferboard plants adding shifts. One new waferboard plant in 
Minnesota, which was completed last year but never opened, now plans 
to start operations this spring. In addition, a director with the 
paper industry indicates that Minnesota paper plants are now 
operating continuously instead of intermittently as they were last 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      At our last writing, the recovery in industrial activity had been 
confined to manufacturing. It is now spreading to metal mining. 
Seven out of Minnesota's eight taconite plants are scheduled to be 
operating in April. All but one plant had been shut down for 
extended periods since last spring. Many of the plants' operations 
will remain far below historical norms, however, and their 
employment levels in April are projected to be down 50 percent from 
last April.
     </p>
     <p>
      While metal mining has started to show signs of reviving, petroleum 
exploration has declined. In February, 64 oil rigs were operating in 
Montana and North Dakota, down from 75 in December and 159 a year 
ago. With the recent oil price declines, the number of active rigs 
is almost sure to fall further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's farm sector has also begun to show the first distant 
glimmerings of recovery. Ag analysts in the district confirm our 
observation in the last Redbook that the new Payment-in-Kind (PIK) 
Program should bring some relief to district farmers. They feel that 
the worst may be over and report that farmers are more optimistic 
about the future than they were prior to PIK. Several ag bankers 
support that contention, stating that land prices appear to have 
stopped falling and, in a few isolated instances, have even 
increased. An economist with a farm supply company also reports that 
its dealers appear less worried about credit problems than several 
months ago. The executive secretary of the Retail Farm Equipment 
Association of Minnesota and South Dakota states that farmers have 
started to show more interest in purchasing farm equipment. 
Attendance at his organization's Northern Farm Show in January was 
up considerably from a year ago. Although these developments suggest 
that some relief is in sight, these individuals caution that the 
road back to farm prosperity could be "long and bumpy."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Governments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite signs of a strengthening recovery, district state 
governments are struggling to obtain funds to maintain public 
services. The recent recession seriously eroded revenues in 
Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and these states 
are not anticipating any marked revenue rebound during the next few 
years. In addition, recent declines in oil prices are expected to 
reduce state revenues in Montana and North Dakota during the next 
biennium by $24 and $35 million, respectively. To obtain revenues to 
fund their next biennium budgets, Minnesota and North Dakota are 
resorting to general tax increases. In Minnesota, the governor has 
asked that a temporary 10 percent income tax surcharge and a 1 
percent sales tax increase be extended, and that state property tax 
relief be reduced. In North Dakota, the legislature has already 
enacted a 1 percent sales tax increase and is seeking ways to raise 
another $150 million. Montana and South Dakota have not had to enact 
any general tax increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      In three district states, well-intentioned economic development 
programs are being promoted to offset the recession's severity. 
These initiatives will, of course, require funding—and at a time 
when revenues for basic public services are already tight in those 
states. Minnesota's governor has proposed a $75 million jobs program 
for those who have exhausted their unemployment benefits, a $30 
million program to weatherize public buildings and develop 
alternative energy resources, a "New Minnesota Enterprise Fund" to 
finance small businesses, and a series of tax breaks to encourage 
small businesses to start up and stay in Minnesota. Montana's 
governor is pushing a "Build Montana" Program that would use 25 
percent of the state's coal tax trust fund to assist local 
governments, build highways, increase capital assistance to 
business, and upgrade the state's economic development and tourist 
promotion efforts. South Dakota hopes to become a financial service 
center and has recently enacted legislation allowing outstate bank 
holding companies to charter South Dakota state banks so that they 
can go into the insurance business nationally. Governor Janklow has 
stated that as many as 30 outstate bank holding companies may be 
interested in establishing South Dakota banks for that purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For several months, our Redbooks have been reporting weak loan 
demand and this trend continues. Bank directors indicate that 
district bank lending has remained weak in early 1983, as it has 
nationally. Their comments are confirmed by loans outstanding at 
district county banks, which were essentially unchanged between 
early January and early March.
