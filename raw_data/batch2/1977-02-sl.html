      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The coldest winter on record has affected economic activity in the 
  Eighth District. Although the losses in plant operation and days 
  worked have apparently been relatively mild compared to some parts 
  of the country, losses have occurred over a wide range of industries 
  in the District. The underlying strength of the economy is, thus, 
  difficult to judge in view of the abnormal weather conditions, but 
  the generally improving conditions in recent months do not appear to 
  have been changed. In fact, retail sales in January were 
  surprisingly strong. Part of this spending, however, was induced by 
  the unusually cold weather. Furthermore, some of the production 
  losses, which resulted from weather-induced inefficiencies and gas 
  shortages, can be made up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales have held up well despite the severe January weather. 
  The composition of the sales, however, was heavily influenced by 
  weather conditions. As a result, the experience of retail outlets 
  varied widely depending on the types of products offered for sale. 
  Fast selling items included snow tires, batteries, auto parts, and 
  warm clothing. Some stores reported that inventories of many of 
  these items were virtually exhausted. Even vacation sportswear was 
  selling fairly well as winter vacations were spurred by the weather. 
  Automobiles were also selling at a brisk pace, possibly reflecting 
  weather-induced problems with older cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity has been slowed somewhat by the severe 
  weather and related energy shortages, though the loss in production 
  and employment has been relatively minor compared with reports from 
  other areas of the country. Lack of fuels, particularly natural gas, 
  has resulted in some temporary losses in production and employment 
  in the District, though particular regions of the District have 
  suffered more than others. Plant closings due to fuel shortages have 
  occurred in the Memphis and Little Rock Branch zones, while activity 
  in the St. Louis zone generally has been unhampered by gas cutoffs. 
  Most of the plant closings were only for a few days and the plants 
  are now back in operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Beside fuel shortages, manufacturing activity has been hampered by 
  other weather-related problems. Some plants have been hampered by 
  lack of raw materials due to transportation delays and plant 
  closings in other areas. For example, some automobile assembly 
  plants in the St. Louis area have been affected by a lack of parts 
  caused by plant closings elsewhere or by lack of shipping 
  facilities. One assembly plant in St. Louis employing several 
  thousand workers has been closed for a week and another plant has 
  cut back on the number of hours worked. Also, many firms have 
  experienced high absenteeism and inefficiency in operations induced 
  by adverse weather conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some delays and inefficiencies have also occurred in the 
  homebuilding industry due to the weather conditions. Most 
  construction work has been confined to interior work and relatively 
  few new foundations have been poured. These problems, however, are 
  not expected to alter the long-term outlook for the homebuilding 
  industry which continues to be quite bright.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage interest rates in the St. Louis area have held steady in 
  recent weeks at around 8-1/2 percent on an 80 percent loan. Savings 
  inflows into thrift institutions have continued briskly in January. 
  The larger savings and loan institutions in the St. Louis area have 
  recently reduced their rates paid on time and savings deposits. Some 
  of the larger institutions now are paying rates 1/2 percent below 
  the legal maximums, while others continue to pay the legal maximums.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural production has experienced weather-related 
  difficulties. Poultry production has been less profitable due to 
  increased heating requirements and reduced rates of growth. Cow-calf 
  operators have experienced higher than normal losses of cattle, and 
  heavy feeding of scarce hay and other feeds has been necessary. This 
  year's fruit crop is believed to have been affected by the extreme 
  cold. The peach crop in the St. Louis area may be down sharply while 
  the apple crop may still be reasonably good. Tobacco markets in 
  Kentucky were reported to be operating on a reduced schedule and 
  sales were substantially below normal. A low level of soil moisture 
  remains a potentially severe problem in many parts of the District.
