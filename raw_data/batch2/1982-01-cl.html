      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       January 27, 1982
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Fourth District respondents expect the economy to 
reach its trough near the end of the first quarter, and anticipate 
recovery in real CNP by year-end in a 3%-4% zone. Capital-goods 
producers are generally pessimistic, citing low capacity utilization 
and high interest rates. Steel shipments should begin to rise near 
the end of the first quarter, as the current phase of rapid 
inventory liquidation by steel users about runs its course. Some 
relief from steel imports should also boost shipments in the second 
quarter. Department store sales fell sharply in January, and bank 
installment loans show weakness. A little improvement is expected in 
national car sales but car sales locally are very weak. Prospects 
for house construction, house financing, and savings and loan 
associations in the District remain dismal.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most respondents expect the recession to reach its trough 
near the end of the first quarter, as inventory adjustment is 
largely completed, although one bank economist expects the trough 
near the end of the second quarter. All respondents expect the 
recovery to be sluggish by historical standards with perhaps 3% or 
4% (a.r.) growth in real GNP in the fourth quarter. No respondent 
looks for either consumer or business spending to surge in 1982. An 
economist with a major automobile producer asserts that if the July 
tax cut was canceled or delayed consumer confidence and auto sales 
would fall sharply. He asserts Chrysler and Ford would go bankrupt, 
and General Motors would have to sell some non-automotive assets to 
obtain cash.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Capital-goods producers are generally pessimistic, 
rejecting the notion that capital goods could lead the recovery. To 
the contrary, some expect a trough next quarter and cite low 
capacity utilization, sluggish sales of consumer goods, and high 
interest rates as reasons for expecting a mild second half recovery. 
One producer sees no sign of higher business spending in response to 
changes in the tax code, and notes that rising interest rates in the 
second half could choke off recovery in capital-goods production. A 
producer of machine cutting tools notes that his shipments are being 
supported by backlogs, but backlogs are falling rapidly because 
shipments to customers exceed new orders by a ratio of 3 to 1. Users 
of his capital goods are still laying off workers and he expects it 
may be 1983 before real spending on capital goods increases. Another 
capital-goods producer reports that the long decline in his orders 
seems to have bottomed out in recent months, but he expects a "U" 
shaped instead of a "V" shaped recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An economist for a major steel producer reports that 
shipments, new orders, backlogs, and employment at his firm are 
expected to fall again in January. He expects more layoffs and 
shorter work weeks in the first quarter. An economist for another 
major steel producer notes that steel mill inventories are still 
high, and the near-term production outlook is dismal. Steel users 
currently are engaged in a very rapid inventory liquidation that he 
believes will be largely completed in the first quarter, permitting 
an upturn in shipments at the end of the first quarter. He expects 
some relief from imports in the second quarter because of anti-
dumping and countervailing duty petitions and he expects some 
stimulus in the third quarter from an increase in steel consumption. 
He notes some weakness in demand for oil country goods used in 
shallow wells, although demand for deep well goods is still firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Excess inventories of new autos, auto-related products, 
steel, and aluminum will hold down operating rates to 60% or lower 
at least this month and next. A retailer, however, believes sales of 
department store-type goods were underestimated in December and that 
inventories thus were overstated. Consequently, inventory adjustment 
this quarter should be less than last. A major appliance producer 
reports that the sharp production cutbacks in recent months were 
associated more with effects of declining housing starts than with 
excess retail inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some respondents believe the trough in real 
consumer spending occurred in October, although recovery will be 
sluggish this half year. Sales of department store goods apparently 
fell sharply in January. One economist notes that price promotions 
usually held in January were moved to pre-Christmas, causing 
December to borrow from January sales. Another economist believes 
January sales were depressed by unusually bad weather. He expects 
growth in real consumer spending this year of about 2% or 2 1/2%. 
Some local bankers report a collapse of demand for installment 
loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobiles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An economist for a major producer looks for slowly 
rising sales in 1982, from 7.8 million (a.r.) (including imports) 
this quarter, to 10.0 million (a.r.) in the fourth quarter, assuming 
no change in the scheduled tax cut and no price reduction from 
GM/UAW bargaining. First quarter sales should be helped by price 
promotions (Chrysler and Ford) and introduction of some new models.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large domestic automobile dealer notes that his sales in the first 
19 days of January were the worst he has ever experienced. Sales are 
retarded by high interest rates and customers waiting for price 
reductions from GM/UAW negotiations. Another dealer of both domestic 
and foreign automobiles reports that traffic in his import showroom 
has slowed as much as in his domestic showroom.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Thrifts
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Officials associated with the thrift industry 
in the District anticipate a very sluggish recovery in housing 
starts in 1982. Very little loan business has been transacted 
because of prevailing mortgage rates. Some officials believe 
mortgage rates no higher than 14% will induce substantial demand, 
because inflationary psychology is no longer a factor since prices 
of houses have stopped increasing. They are also skeptical that 
nonconventional financing will support a recovery, and assert that 
neither some lenders nor buyers are yet adjusted to variable rate 
mortgages or other kinds of nonconventional financing. Thrifts are
very cautious about commitments and loans because of uncertainty 
over deposit flows. Many aggressively promoted the new IRA account 
but one thrift official claims that IRA deposits in January amounted 
to only three-fourths of one percent of their deposits. He also 
complains that the new accounts are adding further to their cost of 
funds, which in 1981 was about 10.9% and which he expects will rise 
to 11.8% in 1982. Some officials are also concerned that cash flow 
generated from repayments of existing mortgages has been cut by 
almost one-half in the past two years. A few savings and loan 
associations that made slight profits last year expect losses in 
1982. They assert that costs cannot be cut much further because 
substantial reduction in employment and salaries has already taken 
place. A major regional builder of houses in the District plans to 
respond to the bleak outlook by building smaller houses in 1982. He 
expects mortgage interest rates to be higher in the second half of 
this year than the first, and will build and market as many new 
houses as possible this half.
