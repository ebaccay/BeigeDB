      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

       March 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Tenth District retailers report that a second winter of bad weather 
  has reduced sales to about the level of 1977's first quarter. While 
  a rebound in demand is predicted for spring, slow deliveries due to 
  continued bad weather or the coal strike might result in the loss of 
  sales. Auto dealers, too, report sales about equal to last year—a 
  surprising result considering the national decline in auto sales. On 
  the agricultural front, both near-term and futures prices for grain 
  crops have been advancing, but the likelihood of ample supplies may 
  point to lower prices later on. Loan demand in the Tenth District 
  has been mixed, with large city bankers reporting weak demand, but 
  bankers in outlying areas reporting strong demand, especially for 
  cattle feeder loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Due to the repeat this year of the severe winter weather, dollar 
  retail sales in the Tenth District have about equaled the levels 
  reached in the same period in 1977. Though the timing varied across 
  metropolitan areas, sales in either January or February were 
  generally worse than last year, with the other month offsetting this 
  decline. While the Denver area has not experienced bad weather, 
  reports from retailers there were mixed. Most District retailers 
  feel that, while March sales have been unsatisfactory to date, a 
  strong month is possible if the weather improves. Looking ahead, 
  spring sales are projected to increase 6 to 20 per cent over last 
  year. However, fears of a fall slow-down in the economy were 
  expressed by some respondents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inventories at District retailers appear to be at desired levels 
  despite the effects of the weather-induced sales slowdown. 
  Nevertheless, several retailers reported problems in obtaining 
  supplies from the East and certain hard-hit areas of the Midwest. 
  One respondent also noted a problem in obtaining shoes from Ohio and 
  Indiana due to coal strike-related energy cutbacks. Though not yet 
  serious, a much longer delay in receipt of spring fashions could 
  cause a loss of sales. One respondent also expressed concern about 
  the negative impact on retail hiring that the rising minimum wage 
  has had and will have on his industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenth District auto dealers report that, on balance, unit sales are 
  averaging about the same as last year. Those who report a decline in 
  sales point to the bad winter weather as the major factor. One 
  dealer also mentioned that the weather has tied up rail cars and, 
  thereby, has reduced sales by delaying delivery from manufacturers. 
  However, most dealers expect that, with spring, sales will "take 
  off." Additionally, some dealers mentioned that tax refunds will 
  soon start increasing the purchases of new cars.
       </p>
       <p>
        As to auto size and features, it appears that small and intermediate 
  cars are the best sellers, with extensive options included. It also 
  seems that imports are facing stiffer competition through heavier 
  advertising of domestic small cars and more small cars being offered 
  for sale. Although there is some short-term pessimism, dealers are 
  all extremely optimistic about sales expectations for the rest of 
  the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Futures market prices for major Tenth District grain crops advanced 
  during the past month. However, near-term price advances exceeded 
  those of the more distant contracts for soybeans and hard winter 
  wheat. March soybean futures advanced sharply (94 cents per bushel) 
  while advances of 7 cents per bushel were recorded for hard winter 
  wheat and for corn. A number of factors accounted for these price 
  increases. Among them are increased livestock feed consumption in 
  the United States, CCC loan participation by wheat and corn 
  producers, grain transportation problems associated with severe 
  winter weather, and decreases in production estimates for southern 
  hemisphere crops. However, grain stocks data, winter wheat condition 
  reports, and planting intentions for these grain crops all point to 
  the likelihood of very ample supplies for 1978. Thus, recent price 
  gains may give way to lower prices later on. On the subject of the 
  farm strike, one Bank Director noted that the strike was having very 
  little effect in his area and that he expects .... .all of the 
  farmers to be back at work come spring." According to this Director, 
  the cold, wet winter has resulted in very good prospects for the 
  wheat crop but, simultaneously, has caused ranchers to lose up to 30 
  per cent of this spring's calf crop.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most large city bankers contacted in the Tenth District report weak 
  loan demand. This contrasts with strong loan demand in outlying 
  areas. Demands for cattle feeder loans have been heavy at both small 
  and large banks, with large banks also reporting continued strong 
  demand for natural resource and energy development loans. However, 
  unusually severe weather conditions have had an adverse impact on 
  consumer, real estate, construction, and other business loans at the 
  larger banks. Credit conditions at Nebraska banks, which were 
  extremely tight last fall, have eased considerably, as small banks 
  continue to pay down correspondent loans that were used to finance 
  agriculture. Deposit growth is strong at most banks contacted. 
  Demand deposits are up sharply, but time and savings deposit trends 
  are mixed. Small banks report strong time and savings deposit gains, 
  but most large banks report only moderate increases or declines. One 
  large bank reports extremely rapid savings growth, due to the 
  offering of small denomination bearer CD's. Large negotiable CD's 
  were reduced at large banks in response to their weak loan demand.
