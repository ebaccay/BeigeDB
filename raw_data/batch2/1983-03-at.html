      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence of recovery has become more widespread and consistent since 
January, and respondents expect this trend to accelerate in most 
sectors. Previously reported improvements in construction and auto 
sales are triggering inventory and employment expansion in related 
industries. Mortgage rates have resumed a downward trend after 
rising earlier this year. Retail sales growth has tapered somewhat, 
but many merchants are expanding inventories in anticipation of a 
resurgence in consumer spending. Savings deposits at banks and 
thrifts continue to expand although less rapidly, and consumer 
lending has picked up slightly for the first time in months. The 
upturn in tourism is extending to more areas and markets. Farm 
lenders are less pessimistic than when previously polled, even 
though delinquencies and foreclosures are still mounting.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      More signs of recovery are appearing in 
manufacturing. Local orders for auto parts are rising substantially 
in response to increasing auto sales. The upturn in construction is 
stimulating lumber yards to rebuild inventories and building 
materials manufacturers to recall workers. Even heavy industries are 
beginning to report increases in orders and expansion plans. A sharp 
drop in Florida's February unemployment rate to the single-digit 
level strongly signals the end of recession since Florida's cycle 
lags that of other states. Oil, petrochemicals, shipping, and 
aluminum remain depressed, however. A survey of Louisiana 
petrochemical plants reveals no significant change in production 
levels or capacity utilization, but hope remains that lower costs 
for petroleum-based raw materials will boost the industry. Reduced 
oil prices should also aid Louisiana's Offshore Oil Port, which is 
now handling one-third of break-even volume, but they would 
adversely affect regional synfuel projects, such as coal 
gasification.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that the upward trend in 
consumer spending is continuing but at a slower rate than in 
January. They cite atypically mild weather as the reason that the 
Southeast fared better than the nation in February. A poll of 
regional department store officials indicates that most are building 
"heavier-than-usual" stocks of apparel and appliances, which are 
moving well. Ordering for most other merchandise, however, remains 
cautious. Car dealerships report increased floor traffic this month 
and reviving demand, although sales at Ford's regional dealerships 
fell almost 5 percent last month from year-ago levels. Because of 
customers' recent responses to lower interest rates and falling
gasoline prices, dealers are expanding inventories, particularly of 
large models carrying high profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A poll of realtors reveals high optimism. March sales 
are running even with or above February levels. Most respondents 
expect the progressive improvements of the past months to continue. 
A survey of building permit departments indicates that applications 
appear to be coming in at a faster rate than last month. Even more 
depressed cities, such as Birmingham and Chattanooga, are beginning 
to report a quickened pace. Conventional mortgage rates continue to 
ease after edging back up in January and early February. By mid-
March the rate structure in Atlanta drifted down from early 
February's range of 12 to 13 5/8 percent, with most lenders at 13 
1/4, to a range of 12 to 13 percent, with most lenders at 12 3/4 
percent. Discount points on FHA and VA loans firmed slightly the 
second week of March. As many as 6 3/4 points are being charged on 
some mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total deposits at large commercial banks fell slightly last 
month relative to the previous month for the first time since last 
August. However, buoyed by money market deposit accounts (MMDAs), 
savings deposits at banks and thrifts continued to grow, albeit more 
slowly than the 26-36 percent rates prevalent at year-end. 
Commercial banks report continued uncertainty about the maturity of 
assets against which to match this new instrument. Investments, 
particularly treasuries, are currently favored. Construction and 
commercial loans should receive a large portion of these funds once 
their stability is determined. Growth in corporate and real estate 
loans moderated last month after jumping sharply in January. 
Consumer loans grew slowly for the second successive month after a 
quarter of decline. District banks are pioneering innovation in 
financial services. Next month a bankers' bank, offering 
correspondent services to 50 independent banks, will begin business 
in Florida. Two southeastern banks have entered a joint venture with 
two other financial firms and a major publisher to offer national 
financial services, including home banking and cash management, 
through a videotex system. A Georgia bank will offer banking, 
insurance, and travel agency services in three Atlanta supermarkets 
by May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although improvements in travel and tourism remain 
concentrated geographically, reports of nascent recovery come from a 
widening arc. For the first time in months, business travel has 
begun to pick up, according to industry representatives polled. 
EPCOT is filling central Florida hotels to capacity, and bookings 
are "solid" through Easter. Even south Florida's hotels are 
experiencing rising occupancies relative to last year, but 
international tourism remains off. A strike by Eastern Airlines, 
Miami's largest private employer, would exacerbate the area's woes. 
It might also temporarily reverse the growth in passenger traffic at 
Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, which has finally reported the first 
monthly increase from year-ago levels since September 1981. Only in 
Tennessee and Louisiana have respondents yet to perceive harbingers 
of an upturn. Certain markets, such as family tourism and 
conventions, also remain soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of farm lenders reveals a continuing climb in 
liquidations and bankruptcies relative to a survey taken last fall 
and to historical norms. Nonetheless, only a minor portion of the 
District's farmers face severe insolvency. Lenders believe less than 
10 percent of farmers are undergoing partial liquidation and less 
than 3 percent, complete liquidation. Only one-fifth of farm lenders 
surveyed anticipate worsening farm financial conditions in the 
coming two quarters, whereas last autumn a clear majority expected 
deteriorating conditions. Produce prices are rising. Excess rains 
have caused a temporary shortfall in shipments of vegetables, and 
two years of freezes have reduced yields and raised costs for citrus 
growers. However, new duties should prevent foreign producers from 
making serious inroads into Florida's orange juice market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Panel of Economists
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the bank, business, and academic 
economists polled believe the FOMC's monetary policy is consistent 
with the goals of recovery and nonaccelerating inflation, but 
business economists regard money supply growth as too rapid for the 
continued restraint of inflation. No consensus exists regarding the 
optimal monetary aggregate on which to focus attention. The majority 
of economists are more optimistic about the strength of national 
recovery than they were in January, and state forecasters have made 
upward revisions in their predictions of state recovery. However, 
most bank economists hold the same views about local recovery as in 
January. New signs of regional improvement noticed since our last 
survey are in the areas of disinflation, business services, consumer 
spending, and housing- and auto-related industry and some light 
manufacturing. In addition, more respondents see amelioration in 
construction and auto sales. Economists expect consumer durables, 
basic manufacturing, and migration to begin reviving in the next 
phase of recovery. Most panelists see no signs of rekindling 
inflation, but a few discern such a trend in housing and building 
supplies.
