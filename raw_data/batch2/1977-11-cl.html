      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth in real GNP is expected to continue to moderate throughout 
1978, according to economists who met at this Bank on November 4. 
The economists are skeptical that gains in any major spending sector 
next year will exceed 1977. Steel output may be considerably 
improved from recent levels, if imports are curtailed as a result of 
Treasury rulings on dumping. Thrift institutions report no evidence 
of disintermediation.
      <p>
       Economists who attended the November 4th economic outlook session 
  held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shaded their forecast 
  of real GNP growth to an annual rate of 4.6% from the fourth quarter 
  1977 to second quarter 1978. Moreover, they expect real GNP to 
  increase at only a 3.2% annual rate in the second half of 1978. The 
  economists were skeptical that any major spending sector, except for 
  Government, would provide more thrust to overall activity in 1978 
  than in 1977. They anticipate consumer spending to exceed 1977 
  totals only slightly, but residential construction and business 
  fixed investment are expected to show smaller gains over the period 
  ahead than in 1977. While several members pointed out that 
  stimulative monetary and fiscal actions should result in strong 
  economic growth in 1978, others expressed concern that these actions 
  would result in higher prices rather than higher output. Although 
  the group as a whole seemed convinced over prospects for limited 
  growth, only one of the 27 economists forecast an outright decline 
  in real GNP, expected in fourth quarter 1978.
      </p>
      <p>
       The group's view on fixed investment typifies its scaled-down 
  expectations for economic growth. In contrast to last June when 
  accelerating gains in spending in several industries were expected, 
  a leveling out or reduced gains are now anticipated for 1978. The 
  median forecast anticipates a 13.2% increase in fixed investment 
  from the fourth quarter 1977 to fourth quarter 1978, a considerable 
  slowing from the 16% rise for the comparable year earlier period. 
  One economist pointed out that his company's orders for capital 
  equipment this year have not been uniformly strong and that a 
  forecast of slow growth in output, especially in the second half of 
  1978, would tend to dampen real gains in capital spending in 1978. 
  Similarly, the upswing in machine tool orders in this expansion has 
  not been broadly based and will apparently peak this year largely 
  because next year's orders for retooling of autos have already been 
  placed. According to one economist, capital spending by steel 
  producers is likely to decline because of negligible growth in 
  retained earnings, inadequate depreciation allowances, and the 
  industry's inability to raise funds in either debt or equity 
  markets. Weakness in capital spending by a producer of glassware and 
  packaging reflects a low return in investment, lack of confidence 
  about current and future economic conditions, weak prices, and 
  uncertainty over Government tax and energy policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increased October sales have encouraged retailers and producers of 
  consumer goods, although they are still cautious over near-term 
  sales prospects. Department store officials report a sizable sales 
  pickup last month following September's drop, but they point out 
  that sales levels were not much above August. Slow growth in real 
  income should continue to cause month-to-month fluctuations in 
  sales, according to an economist with a major department store 
  chain. He also indicated recent sales promotions may have the effect 
  of borrowing from sales in the fourth quarter. More than usual sales 
  promotions this quarter will likely be needed to stimulate consumer 
  spending, according to some officials. Auto producers are guardedly 
  optimistic over sales for 1978. An economist for a major producer 
  expects domestic new car sales to amount to 9.3 million units in
  1978, about the same as in 1977. Although sales in October rebounded 
  from September, this economist expressed some uncertainty because of 
  softer-than-expected sales of Chrysler and AMC cars, which in turn 
  led to plant shutdowns. In addition, some 1978 intermediate-size GMC 
  cars have not sold as well as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the gloom that has dominated the steel industry in recent 
  months appears to be eroding as a result of a recent Treasury ruling 
  that affirmed dumping of steel in the U.S. by Japanese producers. An 
  immediate effect of the ruling has been a sharp increase in steel 
  plate orders by domestic producers. According to an economist with a 
  major steel producer, a higher volume of orders is booked for 
  November than at a comparable period in October, and orders for 
  December delivery are higher than at a comparable period in 
  November. Four large steel producers in the District have filed 
  separate dumping complaints involving a variety of steel products. 
  Because Treasury rulings probably will be made by the end of March 
  1978, some Japanese steel producers will not make commitments on 
  steel prices after February 1978. The result of these rulings could 
  sharply curtail steel imports, which could fall to 10-to-12 million 
  tons in 1978 compared with an estimated 20-million-ton annual rate 
  of imports in recent months. Should this occur, one steel economist 
  predicts steel earnings in 1978 would improve, and steel operations 
  would rise to close to capacity in the second half of 1978, compared 
  with the present operating rate of about 73% of capacity. Some steel 
  officials also seem buoyed by the recent bottoming out in steel 
  operations this quarter, in contrast to the continued slide that 
  occurred late last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thrift institutions report no signs of disintermediation in recent 
  weeks, despite narrowed yield spreads between rates on time deposits 
  and money market instruments. Deposit flows in October and early 
  November have been strong in both passbook and time accounts. 
  Although some officials anticipated lessened growth in deposit flows 
  next year, they have not cut back commitments. Loan demand for
       <br/>
       single-family dwellings remains strong, and revival in
       <br/>
       multi-family 
  units, especially apartments, seems to be strengthening as a result 
  of recent boosts in rent prices. Some S&amp;L officials believe the 
  higher proportion of deposits in certificates will enable them to 
  cope with the effect of disintermediation better than they did in 
  1973 and 1974.
       <br/>
       Also, liquidity for some is still considerably higher 
  than legal requirements, and several indicate ample opportunity to 
  increase borrowings, if needed.
