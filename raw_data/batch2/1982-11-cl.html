      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 16, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Forecasts of fourth quarter economic activity have been scaled down. 
Steel and automobile manufacturers plan inventory reductions this 
quarter. The housing outlook remains bearish. Personal consumption 
expenditure is expected to grow modestly. Manufacturers expect 
shipments, inventories, backlogs, employment, and hours worked to 
decline in November, while orders stabilize at the low October 
level. Automobile, steel, and capital goods producers face 
continuing weak sales. District unemployment rates exceed the 
national rate as additional plants are being shut down and workers 
laid off. Some firms are obtaining labor-cost concessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       National Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists who attended the Fourth District roundtable meeting on 
October 29 at this Bank scaled down their forecasts of economic 
activity from their June forecasts. The median of 30 forecasts now 
shows a 2.6 percent annual rate of increase in real GNP in the 
fourth quarter, 3.1 percent in the first quarter, 3.0 percent in the 
second quarter, and 4.0 percent in the second half of 1983. Only 
three of the forecasts show declines in the fourth quarter, and none 
show declines in the first and second quarters. However, several of 
the roundtable participants prepared their forecasts before third 
quarter preliminary GNP data were available, and some of those now 
expect a decline in the fourth quarter. The median forecast shows 
the Implicit Price Deflator accelerating to a rate of 6.1 percent in 
the fourth quarter and then moving to 5.6 percent in the first 
quarter and 5.9 percent in the second quarter. The median forecast 
has unemployment averaging 10 percent in the fourth quarter, 9.8 
percent in the first and 9.7 percent in the second.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Additional inventory decumulation appears likely this quarter. A 
steel firm forecasts steel mill inventories will fall an additional 
1 million tons by year-end, bringing to 4 million tons the total 
mill inventory reduction in 1982. The firm, however, expects no 
further decline in customer steel inventories. Automobile producers 
plan to reduce their inventories in the fourth quarter. A steel firm 
expects truck inventories to be reduced in the fourth and first 
quarters. However, a major producer of consumer electrical durables 
says inventories are not excessive at the manufacturer or retail 
level. Fourth District observers expect inventory liquidation to be 
complete by year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing industry economists are quite bearish on prospects for 
starts. Interest rates are not yet down to attractive levels, 
consumers are cautious, the inventory of unsold houses is large, and 
houses have lost their appeal as an investment vehicle. One thrift 
industry economist forecasts 1.09 million (a.r.) housing starts in 
the fourth quarter and 1.33 million for 1983. A producer of 
insulation reports only a seasonal rise in orders and expects fewer 
than 1.3 million starts in 1983. A bank economist predicts that, 
because of the lag in their decline, mortgage interest rates will 
not be down to attractive levels until spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Personal consumption expenditure remains sluggish. Real PCE 
nationally will increase 3.5 percent (saar) in the fourth quarter, 
2.5 percent in the first quarter, and 3.7 percent in the second 
quarter, according to the median forecast of economists at this 
District's roundtable meeting. Spending is retarded by high 
unemployment, sluggish growth of real disposable personal income, 
and declines in real house price, but encouraged by declines in 
inflation and consumer interest rates and the rally in stock and 
bond prices. Overwithholding of the July tax cut should result in 
larger tax refunds early next year, stimulating consumer spending in 
the second quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of household consumables says their real sales were 
up in the third quarter and that the consumer is buying. A major 
producer of consumer electrical durables reports a sharp rise in 
early October orders compared with a year ago, following months of 
declines. An official with a large department store reports that 
recent improvement in sales has prompted officials to raise their 
near-term sales forecasts from September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Preliminary results from the November survey of Fourth District 
manufacturers indicate continued weakening in that sector. Shipments 
and inventories are expected to decline more in November than in 
October, while employment and hours worked are expected to decline 
slightly. New orders are expected to stabilize after falling in 
October. Backlogs fell in October and are expected to fall again in 
November.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile and capital goods sales are weak. A major auto 
manufacturer reports domestic producers have reduced their fourth 
quarter planned output to a 4-3/4 million unit annual rate. 
According to a major capital goods producer, orders are weak, and no 
pickup is expected until the second quarter. He says output of 
capital goods is falling more than capital spending because export 
sales are falling more sharply, in response to strong appreciation 
of the dollar. A diversified producer of capital goods expects his 
real sales to decline 8.7 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter and 
rise 14.4 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, after which they will 
still be 25 percent below the level of four years ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      The steel industry is in great distress. A major steel firm asserts 
that falling auto production and extreme weakness in capital goods 
output are undermining steel consumption and extending the period of 
customer inventory liquidation. Steel mills are closing plants to 
cut costs and lengthen the time span before huge operating losses 
produce financial collapse. An early cyclical recovery in the 
economy is essential to preserve the viability of the U.S. steel 
industry. Another steel firm expects no increase in steel 
consumption in 1983, but thinks shipments will improve because steel 
user inventories will stop falling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets in the District remain weak. Unemployment rates are 
higher than the national rate, as temporary and permanent layoffs 
and plant shutdowns continue. A major steel firm is shutting down a 
seamless pipe mill for three weeks, idling 500 workers. At one steel 
plant, 40 percent of the hourly employees have been reduced to a 
four-day work week. Another steel firm has suspended all operations 
at a plant for an expected three months, laying off 450 workers. 
Another steel firm is shutting down two blast furnaces and other 
facilities indefinitely and laying off 900 more workers. A foundry 
that has been operating at 25 percent of capacity is closing for six 
weeks. A duplicating-machine-parts plant that employs 300 workers 
closed permanently after union members rejected a three-year package 
of concessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some firms are obtaining labor cost concessions. A major 
manufacturer of aircraft and automotive components obtained 
givebacks worth $1.77 per hour in a new three-year contract. A large 
producer of machine tools obtained substantial givebacks in a three-year contract for one plant and gave no pledges of job security. 
Workers at another automotive parts manufacturer recently authorized 
union leaders to open concessions negotiations with the company. 
Most major steel firms in the Fourth District have imposed 5 percent 
to 10 percent pay reductions on non-union, salaried workers.
