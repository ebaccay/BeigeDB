      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 16, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the First District reported strong sales, which they 
hope are the beginnings of a consumer recovery. In previous months, 
good sales were achieved only through aggressive promotion. 
Manufacturers, on the other hand, do not see a pickup. However, for 
most of those contacted, orders and production are no longer 
declining. Defense is very strong. While retailers are satisfied 
with their inventories, manufacturers are divided on whether they 
will have to make further cutbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the First District reported strong sales growth in 
October. Some said the sales pickup, which is not explained by 
special promotional activity, may hint at a consumer upturn. They 
cautioned, however, that the growth is somewhat overstated because 
October last year was weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      The strength was widespread, appearing quite generally in all the 
New England stores of those contacted. No particular geographic 
areas or product groups were especially strong or weak. One big 
department store chain, which has been "upgrading" its merchandise 
to "address the demographics," reported "better goods" were 
strongest. A building materials specialty house and a discount 
department store detected no product shifts aside from the usual 
seasonal changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those with related companies elsewhere in the nation said that New 
England appeared to be stronger than other regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retailers reported that they are planning on continued solid 
growth and a good holiday season. Although their plans do not 
project a continuation of October's "super" sales levels, their 
"lean and clean" inventory positions should translate good sales 
into reasonable profit levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The dominant message from the manufacturing sector is that there is 
no evidence yet of any upturn, but that conditions are no longer 
deteriorating. Most of the firms contacted are in capital goods 
industries and do not look for a significant recovery in their own 
operations until the second half of 1983. However, the defense 
business is vigorous, and in non-defense areas some firms have been 
able to increase sales with new products and aggressive marketing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents from the manufacturing sector have seen no 
significant increases or decreases in demand in the past two months. 
Among the products for which no change was reported were roofing and 
related housing products, milling machines, industrial hardware, 
printing equipment and tires. In a few areas—major appliances, 
consumer hardware, printing supplies and energy-related capital 
equipment—there seems to have been a very modest pickup in demand, 
but the increases are too small to be interpreted as evidence of a 
solid upturn. The increased orders for capital equipment are based 
upon capital spending plans which were canceled in the early part of 
1982 but which have now been revived. Products for which declining 
sales were reported were machine tools, aircraft equipment and
building materials for commercial construction; the last had been 
holding up quite well until recently, based on sales in the western 
states. Respondents have been reporting for some time that exports 
to Europe are very disappointing; but this month two high technology 
firms mentioned Japan as well and a third worried that the high 
value of the dollar relative to the yen might affect exports. Mexico 
is also creating problems, but for different reasons. A large 
company with a Mexican subsidiary says that, because the subsidiary 
is unable to pay dollars for its imports from the United States, the 
parent is having to pay. Other firms in a similar position are 
taking payments-in-kind from their subsidiaries, but in this case 
the subsidiary sells only to the Mexican market.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the overall demand for manufactured products has not picked 
up, two firms, producing test instruments, appliances and airplanes, 
report that they have been able to increase sales through new 
products or aggressive marketing. According to one executive, people 
and firms have the money to buy more but they have gotten out of the 
habit and must be persuaded. The defense business is strong and 
getting stronger as Reagan's policies are only now starting to take 
effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the firms contacted believe that the demand for their 
products lags the business cycle and consequently, they do not 
expect a recovery in their own operations until the second half of 
1983 and, in the case of machines tools, early 1984. Most executives 
seemed a little more reconciled to the slow recovery than they were 
several months ago—perhaps because orders have stabilized. 
Respondents split on the question of whether they can continue to 
operate at present rates without further cuts in inventories and 
employment. Some believe they have made all the necessary 
reductions; others are planning additional layoffs and extended 
plant closings. Layoffs in the computer and office automation 
industries may be quite substantial in the next few months, 
according to one executive. Firms in these industries enjoyed rapid 
growth through 1980 and 1981 and when the slowdown finally came they 
thought it would be very brief and they did not react. However, the 
slowdown continues and they are now cutting back.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein and Houthakker were available for comment this 
month. Eckstein believes the market has "overdiscounted" the demise 
of monetarism at the Fed, and it expects a further cut in the 
discount rate sometime soon. Although Eckstein is leery of 
overstimulating money growth, he believes some further decline in 
yields may be warranted. First, the growth of the higher order 
monetary aggregates must be decelerating, reflecting the lack of 
economic growth in October. Except for housing and defense, 
aggregate demand has no momentum. Second, Eckstein believes that the 
money growth guidelines should be raised perhaps as much as 1 
percentage point in 1983. "We have learned that the guidelines in 
the past failed to supply enough credit to provide for growth." He 
believes that future velocity growth, like past velocity growth, 
will not be large enough to bail the economy out, so "unless we are 
wildly optimistic about inflation (you have to believe inflation is 
only 4 percent) the money growth targets will not accommodate even a 
mild recovery." Eckstein believes unit labor costs will rise 5 
percent next year because "2 percent productivity growth is about 
all we can expect with 3 percent GNP growth in 1983." Price 
increases will then exceed 5 percent because of increasing social 
security taxes, rising excise taxes, natural gas deregulation, and a 
restoration of business markups.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker at first doubted that the Fed had abandoned monetarism 
last month, and now he believes it "even less." He believes we have 
made substantial progress in reducing inflation, although we cannot 
declare victory yet. Raw materials prices are depressed, and he 
foresees 5 percent increases in new wage settlements. "With 
productivity increases of 2 or perhaps 3 percent next year, unit 
labor costs should increase much less than 5 percent," allowing 
inflation to decelerate further. Houthakker believes that growth 
will be very slow until the second or third quarter of 1983 and that 
capital spending may not recover until 1984.
