      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 29, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of economic deterioration in the Second District appeared 
to be slowing in August and September. While it is still too soon to 
tell when the recovery will begin, economic conditions do appear to 
be less bleak than they were in our last report. Retail sales have 
improved slightly. Construction activity has held steady with the 
residential sector still in the doldrums and nonresidential building 
strong. In manufacturing, layoffs have continued but generally were 
smaller than in previous months and some recalls occurred. The 
reopening of a major steel facility offset other plant closings. 
Business leaders still expected no significant upturn before the end 
of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity improved slightly from July's low level but has only 
now returned to year-ago levels. Merchants had hoped for larger 
gains from back-to-school shopping and so were somewhat 
disappointed. Nonetheless, sales were actually better in the Eastern 
region than elsewhere around the country for at least some of the 
national retailers contacted. Apparel remained one of the stronger 
lines; the slump in big-ticket items like furniture and appliances 
showed no signs of ending. Stores intended to continue heavy 
promotions and aggressive pricing to move merchandise, and were 
restraining their own buying until signs of an improvement appear. 
Inventories tended to the high side at a few stores, but stocks were 
not expected to pose problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The construction picture was essentially unchanged from that 
reported over the last six months. Residential construction remained 
depressed in much of the District. Some builders expressed hope, 
however, that the usual autumn increase in demand for new homes to 
be delivered in the spring will manifest itself again this year. 
While the recent decline in mortgage rates has not had a stimulative 
effect on new home building, it has sparked some renewed interest in 
the purchase and renovation of existing homes. Home prices have 
generally held steady in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential real estate activity remained strong with the outlook 
still cloudy. Projects currently underway were viewed as sufficient 
to maintain construction employment at current levels for at least 
the next few months. But softness in the office market was still 
evident in the New York City metropolitan area with vacancy rates up 
marginally and rents stable or down slightly. Consequently, 
developers were reluctant to make long term commitments and were 
expected to continue to postpone some groundbreakings until the 
economy revives and the office market tightens. New startups have 
not disappeared entirely, however. Projects begun included office 
complexes in Queens and on Long Island, a shopping center in 
Rochester, and a large truck stop in Buffalo.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business leaders cited conflicting evidence on whether the economic 
slowdown in the District was bottoming out. These mixed signs marked 
at least some improvement from the pervasive deterioration observed 
in August. Permanent shutdowns occurred at plants producing computer 
circuits and paper products, as well as at the Courier-Express, a 
major newspaper in Buffalo. In addition, layoffs continued in a wide 
range of industries, including autos, chemicals, electronics, office 
equipment, and machine tools. But the workforce reductions appeared 
to be generally small relative to those of the past couple of 
months. Moreover, a few firms, even in some of these same 
industries, indicated that their businesses had finally stabilized 
and that some had even recalled workers. Another encouraging sign 
was the reopening of a major steel facility, surprising employees 
who had been worried that the plant would be phased out altogether, 
despite company assurances to the contrary.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business leaders remained skeptical of any significant upswing 
before year-end, but overall the pessimism did not appear as deep as 
in August. Although our contacts reported that many businessmen 
across the District still forecast stagnation or even further 
deterioration into 1983, more now saw a glimmer of hope for early 
next year. One survey of upstate companies' plans for the fourth 
quarter found that the majority expected to maintain stable 
employment levels through the rest of the year, and that those 
hoping to hire new workers slightly outnumbered those anticipating 
workforce cuts. As for retailers, many feared that the expected 
resurgence in consumer spending would be thwarted by concern over 
continued weakness in the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from David Jones (Aubrey C. Lanston&amp;Co.), Robert Stone (Irving Trust), and Alfred Wojnilower (First 
Boston Corp.): Their views, of course are personal, not 
institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jones: The recessionary U.S. economy has, in all likelihood, not yet 
hit bottom. Consumer psychology has deteriorated sharply. Businesses 
are continuing to try to cut back on spending on inventories and 
plant and equipment. There is increasing emphasis on cost cutting 
measures including wholesale layoffs of white-and blue-collar 
workers. It may well be that interest rates, particularly in the 
longer term corporate bond and mortgage markets, must fall 200-400 
basis points further in order to set the stage for recovery. Further 
declines in interest rates, particularly in the longer term areas, 
are likely to be limited by the clash between heavy Federal
government borrowing and desperate businesses seeking to borrow long 
to repay short-term debt. The Federal budget deficit for fiscal 1983 
could climb to $l60-l70 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      The income velocity of money is likely to fall far below its normal 
3 percent growth trend both this year and next. The Fed's current 
tentative Ml target for 1983 leaves virtually no room for economic 
recovery. Given this prospective drop in velocity growth, the Fed 
might consider raising the upper limit of its tentative 1983 target 
for Ml growth, from 5 1/2 percent to perhaps 6 1/2 or 7 1/2 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stone: It seems to me that monetary policy is exactly on course. It 
is appropriate that the Fed persist in its efforts to limit the 
growth of the money supply. But given the state of the economy, the 
existence of serious financial problems, and the continuing 
uncertainties surrounding the interpretation of the money supply, it 
is also appropriate that the Fed be pragmatic and flexible in its 
approach to limiting its growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      The System has earned a good deal of credibility among market 
participants, and I think there is little danger in losing it by 
being flexible in its approach to controlling the aggregates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: Reports from sources in industry continue grim as to 
both current business conditions and attitudes toward the future. 
They do reflect, however, considerable disinflationary momentum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Institutional investors assume that the summer's Federal Reserve 
actions mark a fundamental shift away from money-supply rules toward 
an employment-oriented policy focused on interest rates such as is 
believed to have prevailed before October 1979. The stock market 
advance resembles the similar rather brief and spectacular bull 
markets that used to occur toward the end of recessions when the 
economy was seen as bottoming and the Federal Reserve as 
guaranteeing stable or falling short-term rates until the fact of 
sustainable recovery had become statistically certain. As a result 
the financial community is quite complacent that all will turn out 
well, and tension in regard to potential default problems has 
subsided to an amazing degree.
