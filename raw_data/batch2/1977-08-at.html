      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Continuing improvement characterizes the southeastern economy. 
Agricultural producers have received a drought-breaking rain, but 
the ill effects of hot weather on corn, cattle, and egg producers 
persist. The outlook for reliable energy supplies is improving as a 
result of two projects which provide port facilities and emergency 
storage for petroleum. A utility company has successfully tested a 
clean-burning fuel derived from coal. Manufacturers of carpet and 
industrial gases report continuing gains in their industries. 
Competition is growing among financial services firms.
      <p>
       The agricultural outlook has brightened in recent days as a result 
  of sustained extensive rainfall. The corn crop appears to be almost 
  entirely lost, but tobacco, peanuts, and soybeans will benefit from 
  badly needed moisture. Some portions of the District report an 
  upturn in retail purchases in response to an improved crop outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Livestock producers remain in a precarious position. The impact of 
  the drought on pasturage, as well as the high cost of feed, is 
  maintaining the pace of herd reduction by cattle producers. It 
  appears likely that producers will enter the winter season with very 
  limited reserves of feed, even if improved moisture conditions are 
  conducive to the growth of forage crops. Thus, limited cattle 
  numbers and high feed costs are likely to result in sharply higher 
  cattle prices early next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Southeastern poultry producers state that reports of poultry losses 
  due to excessive heat have been exaggerated. In reality, the 
  percentage loss by broiler producers has been minuscule. Instead, 
  the major effect of the weather has been to retard weight gains. 
  Slow gains in weight usually result in low returns to producers and 
  higher costs per pound to consumers as a result of fixed costs of 
  production and processing. Commercial egg producers are suffering 
  because of drastic declines in egg size, which sharply reduce 
  revenues. A glut of small and medium eggs has resulted in more eggs 
  being sold to processors of liquid egg products; as a result, the 
  price of this important food ingredient has fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several events have occurred which may enhance the reliability of 
  energy supplies. In southern Louisiana, imported oil is now arriving 
  for storage as part of the nation's emergency energy reserve. The 
  oil is being pumped into subterranean salt dome formations. Another 
  petroleum-related development is the announcement by participants in 
  the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) venture that the deepwater 
  oil port will proceed as planned despite the withdrawal of one 
  company. This announcement follows the cancellation of plans for a 
  similar oil-receiving facility which was to have been constructed 
  off the Texas coast. Construction on the LOOP project is expected to 
  begin in early 1978; operations are scheduled to begin in 1980.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Southern Company, a major southeastern electric utility holding 
  company, announced the successful test burning of solvent-refined 
  coal. This experimental fuel, consisting of coal which has been 
  chemically processed to remove pollutants, reportedly offers 
  improved reliability in addition to reduced air pollution. Although 
  the fuel is now prohibitively expensive, production in commercial 
  quantities should reduce its cost substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Industry sources cite steady improvement in key sectors. Georgia's 
  carpet industry, which produces nearly 60 percent of national 
  output, reports continuing solid gains in shipments and may equal 
  the previous peak set in 1973. This industry is experiencing no 
  shortages or bottlenecks. Although plants are producing at maximum 
  output, additions to capacity are very limited. Most manufacturers 
  have completed provisions for use of stand-by fuels to avoid a 
  repeat of last winter's debacle. Processes are being developed to 
  use manufacturing waste materials as a fuel source.
      </p>
      <p>
       A leading producer of industrial gases has experienced improved 
  business in recent months. Its sales of gases and materials, closely 
  linked to activity in a variety of metal fabricating industries, 
  including construction and transportation equipment, are well above 
  last year's levels. Its equipment sales, consisting of capital 
  investment items, have also participated in this advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the financial sector, several significant developments are 
  resulting in increasing competition. First, Atlanta has been 
  selected as one of three locations for tests of Merrill Lynch and 
  Company's new package of consumer financial services. Their "cash 
  management account," to be inaugurated in September, will permit 
  customers to use balances held in margin accounts by means of drafts 
  and credit cards and will provide the ability to borrow up to 50 
  percent of the value of securities on deposit with the firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a large Mississippi savings and loan association, whose 
  difficulties precipitated last year's closure of the state's 
  privately insured savings and loan associations, reopened in mid-July. The remaining associations have either obtained Federal 
  insurance, have merged with federally insured institutions, or have 
  liquidated without losses to depositors.
      </p>
      <p>
       International banking activity continues to grow in the Southeast. A 
  leading Swiss bank has recently received approval to open an agency 
  in Atlanta. Two foreign banks have opened Atlanta facilities within 
  the past year, while three other institutions have been granted 
  approval to open facilities. The State of Florida's banking 
  regulations were changed in late May to allow foreign banks to 
  locate facilities there.
