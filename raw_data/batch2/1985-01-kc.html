      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 30, 1985
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the important exception of agriculture, modest improvement 
seems to characterize the Tenth District economy at the turn of the 
year. Although Christmas sales generally fell short of expectations, 
they were better than a year earlier and retailers are mildly 
optimistic about 1985 sales. Retail inventories are higher than 
desired and will be trimmed. Mortgage demand at thrift institutions 
is expected to increase as mortgage rates are expected to remain 
flat or decline slightly in early 1985. Both farmers and farm 
lenders continue to experience difficulties, with little relief as 
yet coming from the recent federal debt adjustment program. Interest 
rates on farm operating loans have declined, however, as has the 
prime rate. Both loan demand and deposits are up at district banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers report that 1984 sales were up 5 to 10 percent over 
1983. Oklahoma is an exception, as the depressed oil industry has 
contributed to weaker sales. Consumer electronics are reported to be 
selling very well in all areas. In recent months, respondents in 
Kansas City and Denver report only moderate improvement while 
elsewhere in the district sales are reported as flat to worsening. 
Although Christmas sales compared favorably to previous years, they 
fell short of the expectations of most retailers. Those expectations 
led to higher than desired inventory levels and will likely cause 
inventory purchases to decline. Retailers are mildly optimistic 
about sales for 1985 and expect no significant price changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Dealers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      About half of the automobile dealers contacted report recent sales 
above year earlier levels. Easier credit market conditions have 
allowed adequate financing for both dealer floorplanning and 
customer purchases. Some respondents report large inventories, but 
others say that inventory levels may not be satisfactory to meet the 
strong demand expected in the near term. Most dealers expect 1985 
sales to improve over 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents report input prices through the fourth quarter of 
1984 up to 10 percent over a year earlier. They also expect price 
increases in a range of 2 to 8 percent for 1985. Inventories are at 
satisfactory levels but mote moderate further trimming is planned 
for early 1985. There are no reports of problems in getting 
materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders report that housing starts in 1984 exceeded those in 
1983 with the biggest gain occurring in multi-family starts. Sales 
of new homes in 1984 were at or slightly above 1983 sales. Prices of 
new homes have remained about constant. Prices for most housing 
materials have remained stable or have risen only slightly. The 
demand for mortgage funds and mortgage commitments at savings and 
loan institutions is expected to increase in 1985, but not before 
spring. Mortgage rates in the first half of 1985 are expected to 
remain near their current levels or decline slightly and then to 
remain flat or rise slightly in the second half of 1985. Lower 
minimum deposit requirements on MMDA's and Super NOW's have brought 
improved inflows of new savings deposits to some institutions, while 
others are not reducing minimum requirements at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Farmers Home Administration's (FmHA) new debt adjustment 
program, effective November 1984, is meeting with only limited 
success in the Tenth District. Although some non-FmHA borrowers and 
lenders in Nebraska and Oklahoma have attempted to qualify for this 
program, the overall response has been weak. Even where farm 
borrowers have shown interest in the program, many are failing to 
qualify. Agricultural bankers cite excessive paperwork and stringent 
positive cash-flow requirements as reasons for the program's 
apparent ineffectiveness to date.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paydowns on agricultural loans at the end of 1984 were below average 
in most of the Tenth District, and below earlier expectations. 
Bankers in Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado 
estimate that 50 to 90 percent of their farm borrowers made 
unsatisfactory or no loan paydowns in 1984. Several Tenth District 
banks report that 5 to 10 percent of their farm borrowers will 
receive no more credit. As a result, agricultural lenders expect to 
see more liquidations in 1985, and, therefore, they expect to 
experience losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Interest rates on operating loans have continued to decline, with 
rates ranging from 12.75 to 14.5 percent. Agricultural lenders in 
all district states but Oklahoma report interest rates falling by as 
much as one and a half percentage points over the past eight weeks. 
In Oklahoma, however, rates are largely unchanged at 14 to 14.5 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents at Tenth District banks report increased loan demand, 
with advances in virtually all categories except agricultural loans, 
which are unchanged. Deposits are also up, with demand deposits, 
conventional NOW's, Super NOW's, IRA'S, large CD's, and MMDA's all 
showing gains. Only small time deposits, which have been essentially 
flat, and passbook savings accounts, which have shown some falloff, 
have failed to advance. The prime rate stands at 10.75 percent at a 
majority of the banks, with some banks coming down recently to 10.5 
percent. Consumer lending rates have shown little change with few 
banks having lowered their rates, but roughly half expect to do so 
if the prime rate continues to fall. Most respondents have not yet 
made a final decision about lowering the minimum deposit on MMDA's 
and Super NOW's to the allowable $1,000; those that have reached a 
decision have elected to do so. Lowering the minimum deposit is 
viewed as necessary to match competitors, rather than as a means to 
generate more deposits.
