      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Retail Christmas sales were up by double digits over last year for 
  many Western firms. Since these sales were typically larger than 
  expected, inventories were typically leaner than planned by year 
  end. An apparent end to the drought is filling both agricultural 
  reservoirs and mountain ski lifts, both of which were nearly empty 
  for most of last year. Western firms are still highly liquid and 
  western banks are comfortably liquid, though there were two reports 
  of mild disintermediation. Related to the U.S. trade deficit, 
  concern was expressed over the lack of competitiveness of U.S. 
  goods.
       </p>
       <p>
        Christmas sales were higher than expected and end-of-the-year 
  inventories lower than expected in almost all areas of the district. 
  Most areas experienced double digit increases in their Christmas 
  sales over year-ago levels. In the Los Angeles area, sales of 
  practically all items, except autos, were up 10 to 15 percent over 
  last year, and this strength has abated only slightly in the post-
  Christmas period. A Chamber of Commerce survey of another Southern 
  California city found this year's Christmas to be selling 17 percent 
  better than last year's. In Portland, the largest department store 
  reported a 12 percent increase and a large local chain a 21 percent 
  increase in Christmas sales. Particular strength was seen in 
  electronic games, food processors and TV/stereo items, and even 
  foreign autos were selling nicely in Portland. In Seattle, even
  Christmas-week food sales topped last year's level by 20 percent, 
  according to one large chain. Christmas sales were reported to be 
  unusually heavy among both large and small retailers in various 
  parts of Idaho, and Salt Lake City's major retail outlets were 
  ringing up 12 to 15 percent more sales than a year ago. The only 
  declines in retail sales were reported on an Oregon Indian 
  Reservation and in a drought-damaged agricultural part of Idaho.
       </p>
       <p>
        The unexpectedly high level of sales left unexpectedly lean 
  inventories. One Southern California city reported shortages in 
  certain lines of toys, women's clothing and small appliances. One 
  large Portland store reported that inventories were depleted a full 
  week to ten days before expected. Lower than planned inventories 
  were reported in virtually every part of the district. One note of 
  concern came from a large California banker who characterized the 
  season as a "credit card Christmas" and feared that optimistic 
  retailers may restock inventories as if such sales would continue, 
  while consumers will begin to feel overextended in their debt load 
  and cut back their spending.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are reports from the forest products industry that the supply 
  of raw timber is down because environmental groups have blocked 
  timber sales from government lands. The end of the drought has put 
  the Western ski industry back on the road to financial health since 
  extremely good snows are bringing droves of people to the mountains. 
  The weather has imparted mixed blessings on California agriculture. 
  While deepening snowpacks and rising reservoir levels mean more 
  water for farming in 1978, the hurricane-force winds which ripped 
  through California's Central Valley on December 20 have reduced 
  farmers' net income by an estimated 20 million dollars. Up to half 
  of the damage was confined to avocado losses, but damage was also 
  reported in vineyards, citrus and almond groves, some field crops, 
  green houses and irrigation systems.
       </p>
       <p>
        When asked to comment on press reports of liquidity problems among 
  banks and non-financial corporations, Twelfth District directors 
  responded that such reports appeared exaggerated and alarmist. Two 
  years of strong profit growth combined with modest plant and 
  equipment expenditures was said to have left corporations in strong 
  cash positions. Most major forest products firms are able to fund 
  their planned investments largely through internally generated cash. 
  There was one report of a firm repurchasing its own stock. Overall, 
  there was not a single report of a liquidity problem among Twelfth 
  District firms, and many firms were reported to be in highly liquid 
  positions. The only liquidity problems appear to be among farmers 
  who are squeezed between low prices and high costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most banks also report no liquidity problems, though one Salt Lake 
  City bank hints that strong loan demand may soon spark a rise in 
  interest rates and two Southern California banks have observed some 
  disintermediation. In particular, one of these latter banks reported 
  a 20 percent decline in savings certificate balances between August 
  1 and mid-December.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several of our directors commented on the persistent U.S. trade 
  deficit. Some echoed the prevalent explanation that the lagging 
  economies of our trading partners were responsible for weak foreign 
  demand and that our rapid import growth was due to purchases of 
  foreign oil. A natural gas producer recently turned to Japan for "malleable pipe fittings" because U.S. fittings were of such poor 
  quality, and for small trucks because the U.S. did not produce an 
  equivalent product. One banker noted that foreign autos now capture 
  41 percent of Oregon's new car sales due to their high quality. He 
  also noted that Oregon capital goods producers are losing their 
  competitive edge due to government restrictions concerning ecology, 
  human rights, boycotts and due to relatively non-aggressive action 
  by U.S. export financing agencies (such as the Export-Import Bank).
