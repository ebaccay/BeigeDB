      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 20, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the District continues to improve. The 
employment situation is mixed, as firms have been reluctant to 
recall workers, and are stressing overtime and productivity 
increases. Retail sales were strong in the holiday and post-holiday 
seasons. Manufacturing activity continues its strong growth from 
recently depressed levels. Production of flat-rolled steel for 
consumer goods is strong but demand for other steel products remains 
weak. Capital goods production is strengthening from a low base but 
imports are hindering recovery for some products. Demand for 
automobiles is growing and some parts suppliers have reached 
capacity limits. Firms are cautious about increasing capacity; 
capital spending is emphasized for modernization rather than 
expansion. House construction may have topped out. Loan demand, 
especially for commercial and industrial loans, is strengthening.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in this District show mixed trends, and the 
unemployment rate remains well above the national average. In Ohio, 
the numbers of employed and unemployed workers both declined (s.a.) 
in December. The unemployment rate has fallen to 10.42%from 11.5% in 
September (s.a.) but remains 2.2 percentage points above the 
national rate. Unemployment (n.s.a.) rates in eleven major SMSAs in 
the District in November ranged from 8.5% in Columbus, Ohio to 14.1% 
in Youngstown.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production workers in Ohio manufacturing firms achieved record 
average weekly earnings in November as overtime work continued to 
increase. Hourly earnings increased slightly but the average 
workweek increased by one-half hour to 42.5 hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District retailers report an active holiday season, and 
express optimism over the first quarter sales prospects. Some report 
sales were unusually strong in the first two weeks after Christmas. 
General merchandise sales are roughly 10 to 14 percent above year-
ago levels, according to three major retail chains the district. 
Sales gains were achieved in almost all merchandise categories, 
especially apparel and household furnishings. Fourth District sales 
of both domestic and import cars were also brisk during the holiday 
period. Import dealers are not currently experiencing shortages, but 
most expect shortages to develop again by early February. Domestic 
new-car dealers indicate that inventory positions are near desired 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continues its upward trend in this District. 
A survey of Cleveland area purchasing managers for December 
indicates production was higher than in the preceding month for a 
larger percentage of respondents than any time since April 1977, and 
new orders were higher for a greater percentage of respondents than 
any time in over ten years. Respondents report rush orders and split 
shipments are becoming more common. Finished goods inventories are 
rising slowly. Employment is unchanged, suggesting that firms are 
using overtime to expand production.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of purchasing managers in the Cincinnati area indicates 
production, new orders, and backlogs are growing, although less 
rapidly in December than in October. Strong price pressures are 
reported for commodities. Delivery time is increasing and split 
shipments are becoming more common. Finished goods inventories are 
rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      This bank's survey of Fourth District manufacturers indicates that 
firms expect moderate growth of shipments, new orders, and 
inventories in January. Employment is expected to hold steady while 
average weekly hours worked is expected to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production of flat-rolled steel used in consumer goods is near 
capacity but demand for oil-country goods and construction steel 
remains weak. A major steel producer reports gradual improvement in 
demand from the capital goods sector. Another firm reports December 
shipments strengthened as buyers anticipated early 1984 steel price 
increases. Industry production is currently about 70% of capacity, 
adjusted for plant closings. One firm estimates the new breakeven 
point, given present prices, is 68%-70% of capacity, and suggests 
that all producers can expect to make a profit in 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for heavy duty trucks have been strong since August because 
of the need to replace the existing fleet of trucks. The recent 
surge in demand has caused supplies of some truck components to be 
tight. A supplier reports being at full capacity in truck-related 
production, partly because his capacity was reduced in 1982 and 
1983. Demand for parts for construction machinery is beginning to 
improve but parts demand for aircraft and agricultural equipment 
remains weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      A machine tool producer reports orders have doubled from six months 
ago but nevertheless are still at a low level. Orders are unlikely 
to reach their previous peak because foreign producers now have 40% 
of the domestic market. Nevertheless, production of machinery to 
produce some electronic equipment is at capacity, and a producer 
expects large productivity gains from electronic equipment to dwarf 
interest costs as a consideration by purchasers in 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobiles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of new cars rose substantially in 1983:IVQ, following a 
supply-constrained third quarter. Orders are continuing their 
gradual strengthening, but dealers are keeping inventories tight. A 
major producer reports some suppliers are at capacity, sometimes 
hindering automobile production. A need for additional capacity by 
parts suppliers is reported because many suppliers went bankrupt 
during the last recession. Nevertheless, suppliers are reluctant to 
expand capacity because of uncertainty about the duration of the 
current expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for new houses are down, and are unlikely to match last year. 
Builders of single-family homes report that new orders in the fourth 
quarter were down by 10% to 12% from a year earlier. The outlook for 
housing construction in 1984, according to a major Fourth District 
builder, is fairly good, but won't match 1983's performance because 
pent-up demand is not as strong as in early 1983, and interest rates 
are not expected to fall to the 12 1/2% levels reached in early 
1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to have strengthened at Fourth District banks in 
recent weeks. An increase in loan volume is evident for virtually 
all loan categories and especially for commercial and industrial 
loans and loans to financial institutions. Demand, saving and time 
deposit growth were not exceptionally strong. District banks 
apparently funded loan demand by running down their holdings of 
liquid assets and by issuing large denomination certificates of 
deposit. In particular, bank holdings of short-term Treasuries and 
federal fund sales both declined.
