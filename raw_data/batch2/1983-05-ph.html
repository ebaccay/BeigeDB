      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 18, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District in May are that business 
activity is generally on the upswing. Local manufacturers report 
substantial improvement in business conditions since March. 
Retailers say sales at area stores are growing steadily. Loan 
activity has turned mixed recently; retail lending has gained ground 
but commercial loans have slipped slightly. In the construction 
industry, overall activity is healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District contacts foresee these trends continuing for the next 
six months. Gains in industrial activity and retail sales are 
expected to continue at a brisk pace into the fall. In the banking 
sector, declining interest rates should reinforce current diverging 
lending trends. Strong demand for housing will bolster residential 
construction, according to builders, but commercial demand looks 
weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives of the Third District construction industry indicate 
that construction activity is in good shape in May. Real estate 
brokers report a steady increase in sales at current mortgage rates, 
with more sales spilling over from pre-owned homes into the market 
for new units. As a result, residential construction is showing the 
first real signs of strength in over two-and-a-half years. Builders 
say demand is sufficient to sustain, if not boost, the current pace 
of residential activity, but expansion at the present rate will 
press on already tight supplies of building materials. Commercial 
construction business has also improved recently, despite relatively 
high vacancy rates. Commercial developers, however, say demand for 
office space is very weak and expect office-building to wind down 
considerably.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to the Business Outlook Survey indicate that industrial 
activity in the Third District continues to pick up steam. The gains 
reported in April and May are on a par with the vigorous growth 
recorded earlier this year, providing further evidence that a 
sustained recovery is underway. Specific indications of the pick-up 
include booming new orders and shipments. Producer backlogs have 
also increased for the first time since mid-1979, and delivery times 
are getting longer. Inventory liquidation continues, but some 
employers have begun adding to payrolls and extending working hours 
as activity levels have climbed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Survey respondents are very confident that industrial rebuilding 
will continue and are projecting more gains for the next six months. 
Expanding new orders and shipments are forecast by four out of five 
respondents to the May survey, and businessmen are planning to hire 
additional workers and to lengthen the average workweek by late 
fall. In addition, modest growth in stock levels is foreseen, and 
increased outlays for capital equipment are in the works.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increased activity is pushing industrial prices up slightly in May, 
according to survey results. Input costs have risen at just over 
one-quarter of area plants, and a few reports of price hikes for 
finished products have surfaced this month, too. Respondents foresee 
further escalation in raw material prices by November and, to a 
lesser extent, are planning to boost their own prices over that 
time, as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales at Third District department stores have climbed steadily 
through April and into May. Dollar volume is right where retail 
executives expected it to be, about 5 percent to 6 percent ahead of 
a year ago. Merchants say an improving economic climate has buoyed 
consumers' confidence and, as big tax refunds keep rolling in, 
customers are parting with more dollars. In addition, this spring's 
excellent weather is credited with taking the edge off the usual 
post-Easter sales slump. Activity remains good across the board 
including some new movement in durables, especially household 
furnishings, which are benefiting from the housing pick-up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers predict that sales will continue to grow over the next six 
months. Declining unemployment rates and an expanding economy are 
expected to provide an increasingly strong stimulus to sales. Larger 
tax refunds will still be a factor, according in contacts, and the 
mid-summer tax cut also should give retail business, particularly 
durable goods, a boost. Merchants are projecting that, by November, 
sales activity will be 6 percent to 8 percent ahead of the year 
before.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stock levels are about even with those of a year ago, and retailers 
report a little easing in their tight grip on inventories as sales 
have improved. Inventories remain very lean, nonetheless, and there 
are no plans at the present time for further rebuilding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan activity at Third District banks has turned mixed since the 
last Redbook. C&amp;I; loan volume, as expected, has dropped slightly 
since March, owing to weaker commercial loan demand and cutbacks in 
below-prime lending, according to contacts. Reports of commercial 
loan volume now range from 6 percent below a year ago to 4 percent 
above a year ago. Retail loan activity, on the other hand, is 
building slowly. Although interest rates are still high enough to 
keep a somewhat tight lid on demand, consumers' attitudes toward 
credit have improved this spring, according to bankers. In the wake 
of a push by lenders, consumer loan volume has risen by 5 percent to 
10 percent from a year ago. Area banking contacts say these trends 
in borrowing are likely to continue into the fourth quarter. Lenders 
expect that demand for commercial loans will be soft for the next 
few months. The shift to the bond market is likely to be enhanced by 
further declines in interest rates, and a "hesitating" economic 
recovery should keep capital investment plans flat until fall. Lower 
rates, however, are likely to bolster retail lending activity, 
especially if economic indicators continue to point to strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate has held steady at 10.50 percent at major banks in 
the Third District. Pressures are building, according to bankers, 
that should push rates down between 50 and 100 basis points by the 
middle of the third quarter. These pressures include good inflation 
news and weak demand for commercial credit. By fall, however, much 
of the downward pressure should begin to disappear as more 
consistent economic growth awakens business loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows are still very strong in May, although activity has 
settled down recently. Demand deposits are a healthy 4 percent to 6 
percent ahead on a year-over-year basis, down slightly from March 
levels. Bankers attribute that slide to April seasonal problems and 
a surge of IRA activity at tax time. Time deposit growth has slowed 
as well, indicating that the shift to MMDAs may be nearing 
completion. In fact, some outflows from MMDAs have been reported. 
Nevertheless, time deposits remain far ahead of year-ago levels.
