      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 11, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Some softening in economic activity is reported by businessmen in 
the Tenth District, along with continuing increases in both costs 
and prices. Housing starts are down substantially, and savings and 
loan associations are pessimistic about savings inflows for the rest 
of the year. Cattle feeders in the District have been experiencing 
some losses, and many farmers are having difficulty repaying loans. 
Loan demand is variable across the District, and total deposit 
growth appears to be stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      The majority of Tenth District retailers questioned this month 
report mostly moderate gains in current dollar sales through 
February 1980 compared to February 1979, but sales have apparently 
softened since the last quarter of 1979. Most retailers remain 
optimistic about total dollar sales for the remainder of 1980, with 
expected gains ranging from 5 per cent to 20 per cent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers report moderate price increases. Most increases have 
resulted from increased cost of petroleum-based products and 
increased cost for metal products such as jewelry and tableware, 
with costs of merchandise and transportation slowing somewhat. All 
retailers report that they are trying to maintain inventory markups 
and profit margins. Tight inventory control has become standard 
policy for all retailers. While some retailers report higher levels 
than desirable, no serious problems were noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly all the purchasing agents contacted report substantial input 
price increases over the past year. Major suppliers have raised 
prices during the past three months, and further increases are 
expected before summer. Input availability is not a current problem 
in the District. Continued high interest rates and pessimistic 
outlooks for the economy lead most purchasing agents to desire low 
materials inventory levels. While over half of the purchasing agents 
still plan to trim their inventories further, a few report plans of 
inventory expansions to prepare for future delivery problems, as 
well as to compensate for earlier reductions that were too drastic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District home builders' associations indicate that housing 
starts in the area are down at least 20 per cent compared to last 
year, with single-family housing starts doing considerably worse 
than that. There is some hope for a rebound later in the year if 
more prospective buyers are able to qualify for loans. Association 
spokesmen report that sales of new homes are mixed, and many new 
home prices are easing off.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan associations in the Tenth District are decidedly 
pessimistic about the future of their savings inflows as the year 
progresses. There seems to be considerably less demand for mortgage 
funds so far this year, and commitments are being held down. 
Mortgage rates have been steadily rising and are currently around 14 
per cent, but some savings and loan association spokesmen feel that 
mortgage rates will not rise much further.
     </p>
     <p>
      Grain prices throughout most of the Tenth District have stabilized 
after the fluctuations caused by the grain embargo to the Soviet 
Union. Despite lower than desired prices, farmers in many areas are 
selling grain to meet current financial obligations or because the 
cost of carrying the grain for any longer period offsets any 
expected gain in price. Farmers in many areas are having 
difficulties repaying loans as they come due, especially farmers 
attempting to service large real estate debts. Higher interest rates 
are expected to cut loan demand somewhat. Continuing higher costs 
associated with irrigation of corn are forcing some farmers to 
reconsider spring planting options.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cattle feeders within the District have experienced some losses in 
recent months due to the high price of feeder cattle and the 
increased interest costs associated with their purchase. Many 
smaller feedlot operators are not refilling the lots as the fed 
cattle are sold. While large feeding operations have also 
experienced losses, excellent rates of gain due to the mild winter 
weather in many areas have helped to limit those losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of bankers in the Tenth District shows decidedly mixed 
results for loan demand. Total loan demand appears to be strongest 
at Colorado banks, with areas of weakness reported in Nebraska, 
Oklahoma, and Kansas City. Consumer loans, except autos, and energy-related loans show the greatest strength. Some banks report 
unexpectedly weak demand for agricultural loans, particularly in the 
livestock area. District banks continue to make few, if any, real 
estate loans. Several banks feel that strength in commercial and 
industrial loans may be coming from short-term financing of 
inventories and slower collection activity. Larger banks continue to 
raise their prime rate in line with increases at money center banks. 
Most banks surveyed report tightening their nonprice terms of 
lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total deposit growth is reported to be stable by most banks. Some 
banks report a decline in demand deposits as customers continue to 
shift into interest-bearing accounts. While passbook savings 
deposits are down substantially, growth in money market certificates 
is quite strong. All banks surveyed offer 30-month certificates, 
with mixed success. In those cases where the certificates have 
proved popular, most of the funds shifted appeared to come from 
existing deposits at the bank rather than from new deposits. Recent 
ceilings on these certificates have not yet had an impact.
