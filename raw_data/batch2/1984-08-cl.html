      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 6, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in this District continues to improve, with some 
signs of slower growth and no indications of accelerating inflation. 
Labor market conditions continue to improve. Auto sales remain 
strong but general merchandisers report slower growth of sales. 
Growth in manufacturing  activity is slowing. Inventories are 
growing slowly. Housing markets show more signs of weakening. 
Business and consumer loan demand, except for home mortgages, 
remains strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions in the District continue to improve and use 
of overtime is declining. Unemployment fell and employment rose in 
Ohio in June, reducing the unemployment rate to 9.0% (s.a.) from 
10.2% in May. Manufacturing employment in Ohio continues to increase 
slowly but average weekly hours worked by production workers have 
fallen from 42.8 (n.s.a.) in December to 42.2 in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Price Pressures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts generally report little upward pressure on prices. A survey 
of purchasing managers suggests the rise in commodity prices has 
slowed sharply in the last three months. Some contacts report 
wanting to raise their own prices to restore historical profit 
margins but are unable to make increases stick, even though sales 
are rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several contacts report producers of corrugated paper containers are 
at capacity and raising prices. A producer of television bulbs 
reports no price increases despite strong sales because of world-
wide overcapacity in glass. A producer of railroad ties reports 
difficulty obtaining raw wood because it is being diverted to the 
pulp and paper industry, yet wood prices are not rising. Prices of 
steel remain weak. There has been some easing of shortages of chips 
and microprocessors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales reports for July were mixed. Auto dealers 
continue to report strong sales gains with some sales lost because 
of a lack of inventory. Preliminary sales figures for general 
merchandisers indicate some weakening in sales. Most reported that 
July gains were below expectations because a dip in soft goods 
removed some of the strength seen in first and second quarter gains. 
One analyst, however, believes the July slowing was due in part to 
the large June increase. He expects sales to remain soft in August 
and turn up in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth of manufacturing activity shows some signs of slowing. This 
Bank's survey of District manufacturers indicates they expect 
business conditions in July will be little changed from June. 
Producers of components for durable goods report orders are 
generally strong except for some weakening in orders from producers 
of appliances and other consumer durables. Orders from the 
industrial sector are strong with no sign of slowing. Orders from 
producers of plastics-making machinery and construction equipment 
are particularly strong. Orders from heavy truck producers are being 
received at a high but slowing rate but orders from producers of 
agricultural machinery remain weak. Producers of components for 
refrigeration equipment, autos and trucks report production is at 
capacity. Production of chlorine for the plastics industry is at 
capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major steel producer reports orders for steel have been falling 
because of seasonal automobile model changeovers and inventory 
reductions of flat-rolled products, especially by steel service 
centers. Mother steel producer reports that the decline in new 
orders experienced since March appears to have ended in June. 
Competition from imports remains a key concern of the industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts generally report strong efforts to keep inventories leaner 
than usual. Purchasing managers report general vendor performance 
continuing to deteriorate but inventories continue to grow very 
slowly. One contact sees producers building inventories of materials 
and supplies later than normal in this recovery. Some general 
merchandisers report some involuntary inventory accumulation in 
July, but auto dealers are unable to build inventory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for housing is gloomier than a month ago as housing 
markets exhibit more signs of easing. One market participant 
described the current market as a "buyers' market without buyers."
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors are experiencing a significant deceleration in the volume 
of contracts being closed, which is expected to worsen. Adjustable 
rate mortgages (ARMs) have been sustaining greater-than-typical 
activity for recent levels of interest rates, but recent negative 
publicity about the  "payment shock" of ARMs is reducing consumers' 
acceptance. Builders have become extremely cautious and are reducing 
inventories of unsold homes and undertaking new business by order 
only.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage loan activity at banks is slipping; two large banks report 
activity is 50 percent below last year's pace. Bankers say consumers 
increasingly are demanding interest rate and payment caps on ARMS. 
Partially offsetting the effect of higher mortgage rates is the 
revival of mortgage revenue bonds under the recent deficit reduction 
legislation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand has been strong at Fourth District banks in recent 
weeks. The business loans category registered the largest rise in 
outstandings during the past month. Bankers expect business loan 
demand to remain at its current, fairly strong level. Banks report 
sizeable gains in consumer loans and expect demand for auto and 
credit card loans to remain quite good in the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail deposit growth at Fourth District banks has been relatively 
flat during the past month. Banks appear to be financing loans by 
issuing large CDs and reducing their holdings of securities.
