      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        First District respondents are generally pleased with the present 
  economic situation. Manufacturers are experiencing growth ranging 
  from moderate to very strong. Christmas retail sales were very good. 
  Inventories seem to be under control and the inflation rate appears 
  to be holding steady. The only negative notes are concern about the 
  continued weakness of foreign economies and worry over the 
  possibility of higher short-term interest rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Christmas retail sales in the First District were very good. Several 
  respondents described them as "fantastic." Moreover, indications of 
  after-Christmas sales are also favorable. The head of a large 
  department store chain who was previously worried about a widespread 
  inventory buildup now feels that no substantial inventory correction 
  will be necessary. The strong Christmas sales enabled retailers to 
  work off any excess. Consumers also appear to be spending freely on 
  tourism. The ski industry in northern New England is off to a very 
  good start. Volumes are well above last year, which was a record. 
  One banker did report that the demand for consumer retail loans is 
  tapering off. However, he felt that this was to be expected given 
  the unusually high volumes of recent months. The demand for auto 
  loans was flat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most manufacturers contacted are continuing to see an increase in 
  sales. Even in Connecticut where several firms with special problems 
  had extensive layoffs, manufacturing production was up and 
  employment held steady. Sales of household products, particularly 
  small appliances, have been doing well. Auto products have also been 
  moving briskly and although growth in 1978 is not likely to be as 
  strong as in 1977 some gains are still expected. A supplier of 
  capital goods to the chemical industry reported a sharp pick-up in 
  his order. rate. International prospects, however, are a source of 
  uncertainty. A chemicals producer expressed concern about the 
  weakness of the overseas market: recent sales in Europe were very 
  disappointing.
       </p>
       <p>
        None of the manufacturers contacted felt that inventories were 
  likely to be a problem for them. Price increases have been pretty 
  much as expected and no one foresees any difficulty obtaining 
  materials or fuel. One manufacturer, however, was quite worried 
  about short-term interest rates. This firm is a frequent borrower of 
  working capital, and while they are not experiencing a problem now 
  they are very concerned about the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial banks in the First District report good deposit inflows 
  although one banker expressed concern about disintermediation should 
  market rates increase more than another 50 basis points. Consumer 
  loan demand continues to improve and is expected to be strong 
  throughout 1978 with bank credit supplying an increasing share of 
  corporate borrowing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, and Tobin were contacted 
  this month. All but Tobin expressed reservations about intervention 
  on behalf of the dollar. Eckstein feels avoiding getting locked into 
  fixed exchange rates is of singular importance. On the other hand, 
  when our major creditor, Saudi Arabia, insists that something be 
  done, token intervention may be a wise near-term political 
  expedient. Houthakker believes intervention may occasionally be 
  necessary when market conditions become disorderly as may have been 
  the case in the early days of the new year. Further intervention, 
  however, is not necessary and not in the best interests of the 
  United States. Lower import prices would help meet Germany's and 
  Japan's concern about inflation and provide them with more elbow 
  room to pursue expansionary policies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although declines in the dollar do contribute to our inflation, the 
  magnitude of the impact so far is one we can live with. Unlike 1972 
  and 1973, the rise in the prices of our imports have not been 
  accompanied by sharp increases in the price of exported goods. Tobin 
  does not object to short-run intervention to stabilize irrational 
  day-to-day speculation but does oppose trying to peg the exchange 
  rate. Tobin doubts that the dollar would be overvalued if Germany 
  and Japan were operating at reasonable levels of capacity, and 
  questions whether it is overvalued anyway. Recent declines reflect 
  portfolio shifts by OPEC investors that have little to do with the 
  fundamental value of the dollar. A policy which would enhance 
  confidence in the economic recovery and boost the stock market would 
  help to restore the capital inflow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eckstein believes the long-run monetary growth targets should be 
  left unchanged. Houthakker urged the Fed to stick to its target 
  range; stabilizing M1 growth at the 7 percent rate recorded over the 
  past year would be a satisfactory policy. Tobin reiterated his view 
  that quantitative targets should be set for GNP, rather than 
  monetary, growth. Monetary policy should aim at a 10 to 13 percent 
  growth in nominal GNP.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the exception of auto sales, Samuelson feels economic data are 
  favorable. The tax cut proposal will act like a safety net—adjusted 
  down if the economy proves stronger than expected and augmented if 
  the economy is weaker. Samuelson is concerned that preoccupation 
  with the stability of the dollar be used as an excuse of deliberate 
  acceptance of a growth recession. A real growth target of at least 4 
  1/2 percent would not create demand pull inflationary pressure.
