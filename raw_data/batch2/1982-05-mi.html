      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Whatever the harbingers of economic recovery are indicating at the 
national level, we see scant evidence of a turn-around in the Ninth 
District so far. Instead of recovering this spring as we had earlier 
hoped, the Ninth District economy has continued to atrophy. The 
decline in farm income persisted, and this has hurt farm-related 
businesses and agricultural land values. High technology 
manufacturing, which had been an important source of strength until 
recently, started slowing, and other industrial activity continued 
to decline. In addition, general merchandise and home sales remained 
poor in April. Reflecting these weaknesses was the continuing 
softness in bank lending. The only bright spots in the District this 
spring were some signs that agricultural conditions may be 
improving, and a continued strengthening in motor vehicle sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural income slipped further this spring. For the third 
consecutive year, over 50 percent of district bankers responding to 
our spring Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey indicated that 
their areas' farm incomes were down from a year ago. During each of 
the last three years this percentage has increased, and this spring 
94 percent reported falling farm incomes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The persistent decline in farm income has strained farm-related 
businesses. Rural bankers and farm suppliers indicate that many 
farmers are having difficulty paying their bills which, in turn, has 
hurt the liquidity of farm-related businesses. Consequently, many of 
these businesses have either reduced credit to farmers or eliminated 
it. Also, with incomes so low, many farmers have cut back sharply on 
their purchases of feed, seed, fertilizer, and machinery, which 
could reduce output next fall. This combination of falling sales and 
a liquidity squeeze has driven some farm-related firms out of 
business. The number of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans in 
South Dakota liquidated in March, for example, was up 50 percent 
from a year ago. An SBA official attributes a substantial part of 
the increase to failures of farm implement dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reduced farm income has also, not surprisingly, eroded the value of 
the farmer's principal asset—land. Conversation with bankers, 
Federal Land Bank officials, and real estate agents indicate that 
farm land values throughout the district are down, or at best 
unchanged from a year ago. An informal survey of farm real estate 
agents in west central Minnesota, for example, indicated that area's 
farm land prices were down 5 to 10 percent in the last year. This is 
in marked contrast to the previous five years when the average 
annual increase in Minnesota farm land values was about 13 percent. 
Farmers may be having trouble getting even the currently asked 
prices, for our contacts indicate that very little farm land is
actually changing hands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite these poor conditions, area bankers expect that most farmers 
will survive, and there are some indications that the situation may 
be improving, at least for livestock producers. A reduction in hog 
output began to boost livestock prices late last year, and these 
prices are expected to continue to rise into the summer. Combined 
with low feed costs, these higher prices should provide at least 
some temporary relief. Also, the possibility of a rapid cut in dairy 
price supports, which according to some Minnesota and Wisconsin 
bankers would have caught many dairy farmers unprepared, apparently 
has been postponed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Glimmerings of near-term optimism are fainter for crop growers. 
Despite recent strengthening in grain and soybean prices due to 
seasonal factors and concern over Argentina's ability to export, 
these prices remain low. The best that can be said is that grain 
export shipments have recently firmed a bit and that the sign-up for 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's set-aside acreage program was 
high, with farmers at least contemplating reduced seeding on 80 
percent of the eligible acreage. The set-aside program will probably 
not reduce grain output much. However, farmers who continue to 
participate in the program will be able to receive government loans 
in return for storing their crop next fall, thereby guaranteeing 
their cash-flow and strengthening fall prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      High technology manufacturing has been an important prop to the 
district economy during the past three years when farm income was 
shrinking. Very recently, this group began to wobble too. Declining 
orders for computers and peripheral equipment caused one 
manufacturer in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area (24,000 employees) to 
encourage its employees to take unpaid vacations. A spokesman for 
another computer manufacturer in the Twin Cities (10,500 workers) 
states that his firm's business has recently "stalled." Also, a 
local manufacturer of super computers recently cut the number of 
computers it plans to ship this year from 16 to 14.
     </p>
     <p>
      Along with the very recent let-up in high technology manufacturing, 
the decline in other manufacturing, as reported in recent Redbooks, 
has continued. Firms producing temperature controls, packaging 
materials, industrial filters, and mobile homes have all recently 
reported reduced orders and production. Confirming these declines, a 
spokesperson for a large Minneapolis/St. Paul trucking firm states 
that recent shipments from manufacturers have been falling.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mining and forest products also continue in the doldrums. Shutdown 
iron mining operations are going to be resumed later than expected; 
and, except for paper mills, forest product operations have been cut 
back further at both ends of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending has continued to slip. Two large Minneapolis/St. 
Paul retailers report weak sales in April as they have for several 
months. Also, after home sales showed some signs of reviving in 
February and early March, the president of the Greater Minneapolis 
Board of Realtors indicates that they leveled off in April and were 
down 42 percent from a year ago. In contrast to home sales, motor 
vehicle sales have continued their earlier improvement into April. 
Regional sales managers for two large domestic motor vehicle 
manufacturers attribute this improvement to rising light truck 
sales. Their companies' small truck sales in the district in April 
were up about 15 percent from a year ago, and they are even worried 
about the sufficiency of current inventories. Auto sales, they 
report, have been substantially less strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The slippage in the district's real economy is reflected in 
continued weakness in bank lending. According to a Minneapolis/St. 
Paul banker, loan demand at Twin Cities banks remained sluggish in 
April. Outside the Twin Cities, 47 percent of the bankers responding 
to our spring Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey termed their 
loan-to-deposit ratios as "lower than desired." This was the highest 
percentage of respondents expressing this view in the 17-year 
history of the survey.
