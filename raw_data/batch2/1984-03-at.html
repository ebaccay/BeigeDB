      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      No slowdown is apparent in recent reports on sales and employment. 
In fact, employment in most regionally important industries is 
increasing. Consumer spending continues to grow at a healthy pace, 
although cold weather adversely affected some localities. Bank loan 
demand softened in late February. Mortgage lending at thrifts 
remains strong; deposit growth, although modest, is better than 
usual for the period. Single-family residential construction and 
sales continue to rise, but excess capacity has slowed multifamily 
building. Although cold weather reduced vacation travel to Florida, 
convention travel is improving. Credit problems have yet to diminish 
for a large portion of southeastern farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Sustained growth in auto and housing sales has stimulated the paper 
and carpet industries: packaging used in making a car requires 200 
pounds of paper; that used in building a house amounts to 1,000 
pounds. The American Paper Institute predicts record production in 
1984. The South produces about 50 percent of the nation's paper. 
Industry spokesmen expect the boom in carpet sales to continue. 
Manufacturers are satisfied with current levels of inventories and 
do not foresee substantial price increases during the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       The phosphate and farm chemical industries are expanding production 
in anticipation of an increase in farm acreage this year. Projected 
growth in phosphate fertilizer consumption ranges from 14 to 20 
percent. Mines in Florida, the nation's largest phosphate producer, 
already are recalling laid-off workers. Louisiana's farm chemical 
companies, which produce 40 percent of the nation's ammonia-a 
primary ingredient in fertilizer and pesticides-are adding staff 
selectively. These reports suggest a continuation of the improvement 
reflected in labor market statistics for January, when unemployment 
rate fell in three of the six District states and the regional 
average dropped to 8.6 percent, seasonally adjusted. However, 
steadily declining rig counts portend renewed weakness in the oil 
and gas industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report February sales rose by healthier-than-expected 
margins. Their comments indicate that double-digit increases in 
January taxable sale are continuing. Sales promotions introduced 
during the President's Day holiday stimulated traffic and sales in 
areas not adversely affected by weather. Men's and women's apparel, 
appliances, and other home furnishings were the most popular items. 
New car sales in January and February maintained the high growth 
rates achieved In 1983. However, contacts from such diverse retail 
sectors as restaurants, clothing, furniture rentals, auto 
dealerships, and discount stores report increased prices or 
shortages and delays for intermediate goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Transfers and trade-ups by present homeowners account for strong 
sales of single-family homes. Area lenders report that capped 
adjustable-rate mortgages recalculated yearly have become the major 
financial planning tool. Continuing strength in sales augurs well 
for the substantial growth in single-family permits issued during 
January. However, home purchases by former apartment tenants are 
exacerbating problems of excess supply in multifamily construction, 
permits for which dropped sharply in four states. The Department of 
Housing and Urban Development has issued a moratorium on new 
multifamily housing insurance in southern Mississippi. Commercial 
construction and absorption are proceeding at a healthy pace in 
Nashville and Tampa. However, Atlanta's nonresidential markets have 
softened because of large supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for business, real estate, and consumer loans decelerated 
after strong growth in early February. Mortgage applications at S&amp;Ls 
in early March are continuing at high levels. Contacts at 
southeastern banks and S&amp;Ls  say deposit inflows range from flat to 
good into early March. This is a sign of strength, since deposits 
normally decline in January and February.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Georgia legislature enacted the Southeast's first regional 
banking legislation. The law will allow banks and bank holding 
companies, but not thrifts, to merge with and acquire other 
institutions in states with similar legislation; it does not 
sanction interstate branching. Meanwhile, Georgia's Attorney General 
has challenged the legality of remittance processing centers, or 
corporate lock boxes, operated in Atlanta by several out-of-state 
banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts report substantial improvements in convention business in 
Jacksonville, Atlanta, Mobile, Orlando, and Nashville in early 1983. 
However, projected occupancy rates for Mardi Gras were a less-than-
normal 80-85 percent because of New Orleans' greatly expanded supply 
of hotel rooms. Vacation travel to Florida is below year-earlier 
levels. Sources attribute the decline to cold weather, the high 
foreign exchange rate of the dollar (which discourages foreign 
travel to the United States and encourages American travel abroad), 
and the sharp growth in visitors last year. Atlanta had a two 
percent drop in airline-passenger volume in January because of 
cutbacks in discount fares, and data from major trunk line servicing
Atlanta portend a repetition of this decline in February.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Financial distress is no better than a year ago. Georgia and Florida 
maintain Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) loan delinquency rates 
in excess of 50 percent, among the highest in the nation. Florida's 
delinquencies represent only 4 percent of the state's farmers, but 
Georgia's are 10 percent. Mississippi, where one-fourth of the 
state's farmers are FmHA customers, also is experiencing 
considerable financial difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
       A freeze in early March, accompanied by high winds, inflicted 
additional damage on Florida's agriculture. Damage was less 
widespread than in December, although some vegetable crops suffered 
heavy losses. As much as 50 percent of the early corn crop perished.
