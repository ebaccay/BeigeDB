      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The business improvement in the Seventh District continues, but the 
uptrend in retail sales slowed in the early spring and housing 
activity ebbed, allowing for seasonal trends. Employment has 
increased further, but gains are still concentrated in 
manufacturing. Despite sharply higher profits, cost reduction 
programs are still being pressed vigorously. Output of motor 
vehicles, paper products, gypsum board, and household appliances is 
high, often at or near full capacity. Nonresidential construction is 
showing new life, both private and public. Demand for most 
mechanical capital equipment has improved, but only moderately. Two 
major public utilities have serious financial problems, with no 
resolution in sight. Although leadtimes on deliveries of goods have 
stretched out further and price increases are more frequent, most 
items continue to be readily available. Inventory building is 
underway on a broad front, but appears to be voluntary and in line 
with plans. Despite evidence of slower growth, most District 
executives anticipate further gains in a highly competitive 
environment. Pressures to restrict imports are building, supported 
by business and labor groups. Farmland values declined again in the 
first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Cost-Cutting
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Various companies whose sales and profits have increased sharply 
since the low point of the recession continue to press cost-cutting 
programs—eliminating marginal and replacing better-paid employees, 
consolidating functions, selling or closing less profitable 
operations, etc. In past expansions such efforts often were relaxed. 
New hirings require special approval, and early retirements are 
encouraged. Staff reductions through attrition are difficult 
because, reflecting slack labor demand, quit rates are a small 
fraction of the postwar average, and the lowest since the 1930s. 
Also cutting staff are banks, insurance companies, and other 
financial service companies facing intense competition. The medical 
field--hospitals, laboratories, and medical supply firms—has been
     </p>
     laying off workers, after expanding rapidly for many years, because 
of pressures for "cost containment."
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Climate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Interested groups are much concerned about publicity given to recent 
studies indicating that Midwest states are "inhospitable" to 
business. Problems cited include high wages and benefits, 
restrictive work rules, energy costs, taxes, unemployment insurance 
and workers' compensation, government regulation, and lack of 
special incentives to locate, expand, or remain in the region. Some 
charge that evaluation methods of the surveys are unfair and 
inaccurate, but there is general recognition that unfavorable 
"scores" have foundation in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Job Markets
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Increases in manufacturing employment in the District since the low 
point in late 1982 compare favorably with increases in the nation, 
mainly because of callbacks in the motor industry. Nonmanufacturing 
employment, however, has increased less than in the nation. For both 
manufacturing and non- manufacturing the District experience 
compares unfavorably with the nation relative to the 1981 peak or to 
earlier years. Nevertheless, many factories are working long hours—seven-day weeks, heavy daily overtime, and extra shifts. Major food 
chains in the District have cut compensation of union workers 
substantially despite existing contracts. Executives say these moves 
were necessitated by growing competition from food discounters. Cuts 
in labor costs have been reflected in lower food prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Merchants were somewhat disappointed by April sales, at least of 
soft goods. However, it is not believed that the underlying strength 
of the upturn has deteriorated. Sales of appliances, led by 
microwaves, have been "phenomenal". Other hard goods also have done 
well. Inventories, overall, are now slightly higher than had been 
budgeted, especially when goods on order are included, but not a 
cause of concern. General merchandise prices, up 2 percent in 1983, 
are expected to rise 3 percent this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Capital Equipment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Orders for capital equipment are rising, but with wide variations by 
category. Farm equipment remains very weak. Light construction 
equipment has improved, but not heavy types. Freight car orders are 
somewhat higher, but only specialized types, including piggy-back 
flatcars, auto carriers, and some bulk carriers. Machine tool orders 
have exceeded shipments this year, but the industry remains in "dire 
straits" because of sharply reduced cash flow. The paper industry is 
starting a new wave of expansion. There is no activity in new 
chemical plants, oil refineries, electric utilities, ore processing, 
cement, and gypsum board. A leading steel producer may build a 
large, modern cold-rolled sheet mill. Output of heavy trucks and 
trailers is at full capacity, and this is expected to continue into 
the second half. Traffic handled has increased sharply, and the 
trucking fleet aged and deteriorated in the past several years of 
low investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Housing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       For the first quarter, housing permits were one-third above 1983, 
and four times the pitiful level of 1982, but less than half that of 
early 1977 or 1978. Sales of new and used homes slowed in the pest 
month, except in particularly "hot" markets. The housing slowdown is 
attributed to a reduction in the overhang of deferred purchases, and 
concern over the soundness of ARMs that involve artificially low 
starting rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Nonresidential Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The uptrend in office building construction has gathered strength, 
but mainly in the Chicago area. Additional large buildings are 
getting underway. (Factory work is up, from almost zero, but still 
very low.) Leasing activity is up substantially and rents have 
firmed, belying "expert" forecasts early last year that the overhang 
of space would take several years to absorb. Highway construction 
projects are moving forward at a very rapid pace, after lagging 
earlier in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Steel
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Shipments of steel are expected to continue to rise through the year 
with a less than seasonal decline in the summer. Demand is strong 
for lighter steels to be used in vehicles, appliances, and housing, 
with output at virtual capacity. Inventories are building, on a 
voluntary basis, but remain low by past standards. Structurals are 
improving, but demand for heavy plates used in capital goods. 
remains weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Our survey of agricultural bankers indicates that farmland values in 
the District declined nearly 3 percent in the first quarter, ranging 
from virtually no change in Indiana and Michigan to an unusually 
large decline of 6 percent in Iowa. Overall, farmland values were 5 
percent below the year-ago level and 18 percent below the 1981 peak. 
Weakness in farmland values partly reflects asset adjustments by a 
small number of farmers. The major cause of forced sales has been 
debt-financed investments in the boom of the late 1970s, at high 
prices and high interest rates.
