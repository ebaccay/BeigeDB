      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's economy continues to strengthen but the unemployment 
rate remains stubbornly high. Retail sales have been strong. 
Manufacturing activity continues to increase but many major steel 
producers are not yet generating profits. Coal demand is rising but 
remains at a low level. Residential construction and house sales are 
slowing. Business lending has not expanded recently but bankers 
expect strengthening soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The labor market is displaying mixed trends and unemployment remains 
high. Employment and unemployment have risen in the last three 
months and the unemployment rate has risen from 9.3% in February to 
10.2% (s.a.) in May. Although the unemployment rate has declined 3.2 
percentage points from a year ago, in May it stood 2.7 percentage 
points above the national rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates in eleven major metropolitan areas in this 
District in April ranged from 7.8% in Columbus to 12.0% in 
Youngstown. Manufacturing employment continues to rise but the 
average workweek in Ohio manufacturing in April, 42.5 hours 
(n.s.a.), was at the same level as in November 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales remained strong in May, with general merchandisers 
reporting year-over-year gains of 9% to 13%. Although these 
increases represented some moderation from earlier in the year, 
several retailers noted that they were above internal projections 
for the month. Moreover, the May gains were largely accomplished 
without an unusual number of promotions. One retailer however, 
suggested that some of the May strength may have been due to demand 
for seasonal goods that had been depressed by adverse weather during 
the March-April period. The inventory buildup that resulted from the 
March-April slowing in sales has been of little concern to District 
retailers because inventory-to-sales ratios remain at acceptable 
levels. District merchandisers expect retail sales gains to slow 
cyclically over the months ahead and are building inventories in 
line with those expectations. Most area auto dealers report 
virtually no easing in demand for domestic or foreign cars. They 
report that consumer lending rates haven't risen enough to have an 
effect on sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders, employment, output and prices continue to rise. A survey of 
northeastern Ohio purchasing managers indicates production, 
employment and prices paid rose faster in May than in April and new 
orders accelerated in May after three months of slowing gains. 
Inventories of supplies and materials continue to grow and some 
managers report they are increasing stocks to hedge against price 
increases and slower deliveries. A survey of Cincinnati area 
purchasing managers indicates production and new orders are rising 
at a steady rate, employment growth is slowing, and order backlogs 
are falling slightly. Inventories of supplies and finished goods 
show little change. Vendor performance continues to worsen, and 
prices paid for commodities continue to rise but at a slower pace 
than earlier this year. A survey of financial officers of major 
midwestern manufacturing firms indicates new orders continue to 
increase at the same rate as in the first quarter while inventories 
are rising at an increasing pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Primary Metals
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major steel producer reports effective capacity has increased 
since early spring and customer inventory growth has slowed; 
therefore, the industry is no longer producing flat rolled steel at 
current effective capacity. Output of flat rolled steal is likely to 
be reduced in the third quarter because of further auto industry 
model changeovers and because steel service centers will be 
reversing their recent excessive inventory buildup. Demand for steel 
plate remains weak. Overall, the domestic industry has the ability 
to ship 95 million tons of steel per year but is expected to ship 
only 77 million tons in 1984 and 83 million tons in 1985. Prices are 
not rebounding as they usually do during an economic expansion. 
Prices charged by major steel producers remain weak because of 
competition from imports and domestic minimills. Major steel 
producers had losses in the first quarter and may break even in the 
second quarter but little profit is expected before 1985.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major aluminum producer reports that some softness in order rates 
has developed recently. Spot market prices for ingot aluminum 
continue to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Coal
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for coal has increased recently because some users are 
building stockpiles in anticipation of a possible strike by the 
United Mine Workers, but the levels of demand and production remain 
low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity is showing signs of slowing 
significantly from its rapid first quarter pace. Builders are 
experiencing a downward racheting in new orders, despite 
undiminished buyer traffic. Demand in the move-up market is becoming 
quite weak because of recent rises in mortgage interest rates. 
Realtors, who were very bullish at the beginning of the year, are 
experiencing a steady decline in listings, a moderate rise in the 
average length of time a house is on the market, and a significant 
increase in closing time.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to mortgage lenders, prospects for high and climbing 
interest rates portend a gloomy housing outlook. Borrowers 
increasingly are becoming wary about adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) 
instruments because of recent negative publicity. Lenders expect ARM 
demand to weaken moderately in the next two months, and doubt that 
ARMs can sustain the robust pace of housing much longer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to have weakened at Fourth District banks in 
recent weeks. Although the demand for consumer installment loans was 
robust, there was no further expansion in business lending. 
Nevertheless, bankers generally expect both consumer and business 
loan demand to be strong throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposits increased at a strong pace during the last month. It 
appears that District banks relied primarily on these funds to 
finance loans since their holdings of large certificates of deposits 
and borrowed funds did not increase during the last month.
