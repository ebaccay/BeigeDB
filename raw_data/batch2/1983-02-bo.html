      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from First District businesses were generally more positive 
than they have been in some months. The change was particularly 
marked among manufacturers. At the time of the last Red book survey, 
none of the manufacturers contacted saw any evidence of a recovery; 
however, several now report a definite pickup in orders, while 
others describe conditions as a little better". For some firms, 
there has been no improvement; but among those contacted, even these 
have no immediate plans for layoffs. Reports from the retail sector 
are mixed, with the Christmas season described as both "outstanding" 
and "disappointing". Retail inventories are said to be lean.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the First District gave mixed reports on sales in the 
Christmas season. Comparison shopping and competitive pressures 
increased the importance of promotional activity, with some adverse 
effects on profit margins. Inventories are generally at satisfactory 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      One department store in southern New England expressed 
disappointment at five percent sales growth in December; widespread 
discounting reduced gross margins. A medium-price chain reported 9 
percent growth for its New England stores in December, a 
considerably better performance than their stores elsewhere in the 
nation. An appliance and audio-video electronics chain in the Boston 
area had an "outstanding high-teens" increase over last year's sales 
and an even greater growth in profits. The stores with the 
"outstanding" and "disappointing" sales both attributed their 
results to careful comparison shopping. Store results were fairly 
uniform across product lines, although sales of television and 
video-related products and kerosene heaters were especially strong.
Sales were more concentrated in the last few days before Christmas 
than they were in previous years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are lean, and goods are reported to be available as 
needed from suppliers. Merchants say they are planning for a 
continuation of their own recent performance over the next half 
year, and are stocking accordingly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In marked contrast to last month when no one saw any sign of an 
upturn, three or four manufacturers report significant increases in 
orders. Several others report that the decline has stopped and that 
orders appear to be a little stronger, but the improvement is too 
small to be interpreted as evidence of a recovery. A few firms see 
no change for the better and even further declines in orders and 
backlogs. A similar pattern is apparent in a recent survey of New 
England purchasing agents. About half of the purchasing agents 
reported that orders and backlogs did not change in December; 
however, for the first time in over a year more agents reported that 
orders and backlogs increased in the month than reported decreases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among the firms contacted, the most encouraging report came from a 
manufacturer of castings. A spurt in activity in a variety of areasâ€”defense, automotive and sporting goodsâ€”has caused this firm to 
revise upwards its profit estimates for 1983 three times. A 
manufacturer of home furnishings has seen a pickup in orders for 
carpeting; previously this product was described as a "disaster 
area". Sales for furniture and other housing-related products also 
seem to be improving. The other firms reporting an upturn in sales 
were machine tool firms, for which the auto industry is the largest 
customer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms in which there appears to have been a slight improvement, but 
one too weak to be considered evidence of a recovery, include 
manufacturers of energy-related capital goods, printing supplies, 
replacement auto parts, and optical instruments. Firms which 
reported no improvement or further declines were a supplier of 
precision materials to basic industries and a machine tool 
manufacturer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The firms contacted were generally satisfied with their inventory 
levels; they described their customers inventories as very low and 
one machine tool maker reported that buyers have started to request 
rapid delivery. Most firms do not plan any more layoffs and two of 
the firms reporting an upturn have cautiously started to rehire 
people. The one auto assembly plant in New England has recalled half 
its workforce.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several firms emphasized how "lean and mean" they had become. They 
expect to enjoy good profits when the recovery gets underway; 
however, there is an awareness that other firms are also mean and 
lean and that caution in building inventories and rehiring workers 
will slow the recovery. All those contacted expect the recovery to 
be modest. However, several of the firms reporting at least a faint 
pickup in activity are capital goods producers and had previously 
said they did not expect a recovery in their own operations until 
the second half of 1983 or later.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein and Houthakker were available for comment this 
month. Professor Eckstein believes the recovery has begun. But the 
recovery will be weak because, however strongly the other components 
of GNP grow, sluggish investment spending, state and local 
government outlays, and net exports will restrain overall growth. 
This recovery, unlike other postwar recoveries, will not rekindle 
inflation, stirring our fears of a runaway boom. Both this year and 
next, Eckstein expects inflation to average about 5.5 percent. "The 
recovery deserves to be nursed." He "can't argue for a large decline 
in short-term interest rates, but bond rates are much too high." 
With low inflation bond yields should fall, but the problem is to 
"sustain the recovery with a reasonable management of the aggregates 
to avoid frightening the credit markets."
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker has no complaints so far about the course of monetary 
policy. He suggests that the Fed might use some measure of credit as 
a guide for policy until Ml's adjustments are complete. Houthakker 
too believes the recovery is at hand: "fourth quarter final sales 
were the highest of any quarter in 1982â€”the increase in final 
sales is more important than the decline in GNP." Despite December's 
favorable CPI report ("a fluke"), there appear to be no signs of 
improvement in the inflation rate, and one must look very hard to 
see much improvement in the rate of wage increases. Houthakker 
expects that unit labor costs will rise 2 or 3 percent in 1983. As a 
result, inflation could average 3 percent next year, but 1983's 
fourth quarter inflation rate may rise to 4 percent.
