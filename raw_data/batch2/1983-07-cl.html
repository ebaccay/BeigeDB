      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic conditions in the Fourth District continue to improve. 
Employment is rising steadily and unemployment rates, although very 
high, are falling. Manufacturers remain optimistic about the near-term outlook for price and wage inflation. Retailers report 
improving sales. Manufacturing orders and production are mixed. 
Automobile-related production continues to improve, while capital 
goods orders and production remain flat at a low level. Steel sales 
and prices are weak, as last winter's spurt in orders has ended. 
Housing construction shows signs of weakening recently, but office 
construction remains strong. Commercial banks are very liquid, as 
deposit growth is strong and loan demand is weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       District Labor Market Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment is rising steadily in this District. Total employment in 
Ohio edged up in May for the fourth consecutive month and 
manufacturing employment has risen for five consecutive months. 
Average weekly hours of manufacturing production workers increased 
slightly in May for the fourth consecutive month. Local indexes of 
leading indicators point to continued improvement in Pittsburgh and 
Cleveland. Indexes for both areas have risen for six consecutive 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates in the District are falling but remain well above 
the national average, unemployment rates have fallen in each of the 
District's eleven largest SMSAs and averaged 13.3% (nsa) in April, 
down from 15.4% in January. However, the unemployment rate for Ohio 
edged up from 12.8% (nsa) in April to 12.9% in May, as labor force 
growth exceeded the gain in employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Labor Compensation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District manufacturers remain optimistic regarding the near-term path of price and wage inflation. List prices for their own 
product lines have generally remained stable since January, and 
although discounts are still common, they are gradually narrowing as 
market conditions improve. They do not expect to have a significant 
degree of pricing flexibility until the fourth quarter, at the 
earliest. With a few exceptions, including natural rubber, natural 
gas, and inputs for specialty steels, material input prices have 
also been stable over the past several months. Labor cost increases 
have been moderate because of a series of concessionary labor
contracts, reductions in fringe benefits, easing of work rules, and 
business cycle-related productivity gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Major retailers report improving sales. Sales gains have been good 
for several months and especially good in the first half of June. 
Retailers report higher priced goods selling especially well, while 
also noting that customers continue to place strong emphasis on 
price and price promotions. Inventory levels are satisfactory and 
firms plan to expand them cautiously in line with sales gains. 
Retailers are optimistic about the sales outlook for summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District is mixed, with some producers 
expanding output and others showing no change. However, few firms 
report declining output.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Bank's June survey of Fourth District manufacturers shows 
little progress in manufacturing activity in May and June. 
Employment, hours worked, shipments, new orders, and order backlogs 
are flat. Inventories continue to fall and about 20% of firms report 
increases in prices they pay for materials, components, and 
services.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of purchasing managers in the Cincinnati area indicates a 
steady slowing in April and May in the rate of gain in production, 
new orders, and order backlogs. Inventories of raw materials and 
finished goods are falling. Firms report a decline in employment in 
May after two months of increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing of light trucks and automobiles, especially large 
autos, is strong. Producers of these vehicles and their components 
report expanding hours and employment, but remain cautious about 
building inventories. Production of parts for the auto after-market, 
which remained fairly steady during the recession, is rising slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tire manufacturing is improving mildly. Tire manufacturers report 
shipments of original equipment auto tires up substantially over 
last year in line with improved new car sales, while replacement 
tire shipments are up only slightly. Production is up only 
moderately over last year because original equipment sales account 
for only a small share of the business. Manufacturers have stopped 
inventory drawdown but are taking a cautious approach to inventory 
building.
     </p>
     <p>
      The machine tool industry is depressed but deterioration apparently 
has ended. Orders, production, and shipments are flat, and order 
backlogs are very low. Employment is stable, with firms reporting 
neither layoffs nor recalls or increases in hours. The low capacity 
utilization levels of customers may increase the customary lag 
between general economic recovery and improved demand for machine 
tools.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Primary Metals
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for steel is weak. The spurt in orders that occurred in 
February and March has ended. Orders have been weak and flat since 
then, causing order backlogs to shrink. Steel prices remain very 
weak, putting great pressure on profit margins. Production in the 
industry currently is only about 55% of capacity. The industry 
expects to ship about 69 million tons this year, little better than 
last year's very low 62 million tons. Advance orders for the third 
quarter are so weak that production, employment, and hours may 
decline in July and August. Producer inventory liquidation has ended 
except for oil pipe, for which liquidation is likely to continue 
through yearend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity is one of the stronger sectors of the 
District's economy. Housing construction activity is much greater 
than a year ago, although recently its improvement appears to have 
slowed substantially. Most houses are being built on contract, 
rather than on speculation. The mix of demand is shifting toward 
higher-priced homes. Prospective buyers are reported to be very 
sensitive to interest rates and are shopping for small rate 
advantages. The recent increase in mortgage interest rates is 
reported to have slowed or stopped the rise of, but not decreased, 
sales of new and used houses. Office construction is likely to 
remain strong in the District for another year or two as major 
projects already underway are carried to completion, but few new 
projects are being planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Banks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks are very liquid as deposits growth is strong and loan demand 
is weak. Money market demand accounts continue to grow extremely 
rapidly, although not nearly as fast as earlier in the year. Total 
deposits are showing solid growth. Business loan demand is flat or 
down. Consumer credit demand is generally flat except for some 
strength in credit card credit and variable rate loans. Automobile 
loan demand is reported strong in Pittsburgh in response to rate 
competition.
