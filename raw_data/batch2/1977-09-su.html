      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <div>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1977
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The general consensus that emerges from the August district reports 
is of continued moderate growth in consumer spending and little 
prospect of significant advances in plant and equipment investment. 
Retail trade, particularly automobile sales remains strong and 
residential construction continues at a brisk pace. Concern over a 
slowdown in economic activity during the next six months has 
produced a cautious inventory strategy and restrained new business 
investment. Consumer loans remain strong, but sluggish business 
lending is common in most districts. The combined effects of bumper 
crops and drought have reduced farm income and increased 
agricultural indebtedness in many areas.
        <p>
         Consumer spending was generally strong during August. Solid gains in 
  department store sales were achieved in Boston, New York, Atlanta, 
  Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas, although Philadelphia 
  merchants describe sales as below expectations and St. Louis reports 
  only modest gains. Philadelphia and San Francisco report strong 
  sales of durables, such as furniture and appliances, matching the 
  growth in residential construction. Sales of 1977 model automobiles, 
  apparently stimulated by price increases announced for next year's 
  models, continued to be excellent in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, 
  Kansas City, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both residential and non-residential construction continued their 
  vigorous advance in many areas, although scattered reports of labor 
  and material shortages have appeared. Dallas reports that housing 
  starts are down only slightly from the record June pace and that 
  shopping center construction in Texas is triple the level of last 
  year. The Atlanta, Chicago Kansas City, and St. Louis housing 
  markets remain robust. The housing boom continues on the west mast, 
  but San Francisco reports that the rate of increase has apparently 
  reached a plateau in most areas. While no district is experiencing a 
  shortage of mortgage funds, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Dallas 
  report spot shortages of various building materials and skilled 
  construction workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Manufacturing activity presents a mixed picture, with materials 
  shortages appearing in some districts and concern over the health of 
  the steel industry growing in others. Dallas reports a continued 
  rise in industrial production, led by increases in the output of oil 
  field equipment and building materials. Shortages of brick and 
  cement are reported to be widespread, however. Record offshore oil 
  and gas production has stimulated shipbuilding activity in Atlanta, 
  but "serious shortages" of all types of oil handling equipment have 
  developed. In New York, production cutbacks announced by a major 
  steel producer will further retard the sluggish recovery of the 
  western part of the state. Cleveland expresses concern over layoffs 
  and salary cuts at steel plants in its district. Manufacturing 
  output continues to increase at a moderate rate in St. Louis, 
  particularly among consumer goods, although steel shipments are down 
  10 percent or more from year earlier levels and new orders for 
  several lines of chemicals slowed in August. Reports from other 
  districts are more optimistic. Growing manufacturing activity has 
  provided new jobs in Minneapolis, and is expected to continue to do 
  so. Shipments were generally up in Richmond, but new orders showed 
  little change. In Boston, on the other hand, a slight drop in 
  production reflecting normal seasonal influences is expected to be 
  reversed in the near future due to an increase in new orders for 
  defense goods. Philadelphia reports a rise in industrial production, 
  especially in durable goods, while Kansas City is experiencing an 
  energy-sector led increase in business activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Investment in inventories and capital projects may best be described 
  as cautious. In view of the slowdown in business activity expected 
  in many districts over the next six months, current low 
  inventory/sales ratios are generally regarded as satisfactory. 
  Inventories appear to be at desired levels in Boston, Philadelphia, 
  St. Louis and Dallas. Excessive inventories in specific industries 
  are mentioned by New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Business 
  surveys in the Richmond district suggest some unintended inventory 
  accumulation, with an increase in the number of respondents who view 
  their inventories as excessive. Less optimistic business 
  expectations are also reflected in the behavior of plant and 
  equipment expenditure. New York reports "very conservative" capital 
  spending plans; only 37 percent of firms surveyed in Philadelphia 
  plan increases in capital spending over the next six months; Kansas 
  City, Cleveland, and Atlanta cite energy and tax legislation as 
  important causes of business uncertainty; San Francisco sees capital 
  spending as generally weak in the west, with a significant portion 
  of new investment tied to pollution control equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loan demand continues its familiar pattern, with consumer loans, 
  particularly for automobiles, remaining strong and business loans 
  remaining flat in most districts. Commercial loans are up in Boston, 
  but the funds are being used primarily for plant modernization 
  rather than for new capacity. Atlanta and St. Louis note that a 
  recent court decision in Tennessee upholding the 10 percent limit on 
  consumer loan interest rates has caused a virtual halt in consumer 
  lending in that state. Bankers in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and 
  Philadelphia districts expressed fears of possible disintermediation 
  due to the recent rise in short rates, although current deposit 
  inflows have remained strong in these and other districts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Agriculture is a particular concern in many districts. In some 
  areas, record harvests, by driving prices down, and unprecedented 
  drought, by driving costs up, have reduced farm income, increased 
  agricultural indebtedness, and decreased the demand for heavy 
  agricultural implements. This basic pattern is mentioned by Chicago, 
  Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. In other areas, 
  such as Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta, the crop-reducing effect of 
  the drought has had the most pronounced effect on farm income. 
  Atlanta notes that prices for Florida citrus fruits are double last 
  year's level, however.
