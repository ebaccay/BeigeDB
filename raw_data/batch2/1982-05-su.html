      <strong>
       May 12, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in most sectors slackened further in 
April and early May, according to District reports. Consumer 
spending was generally lackluster although automobile sales picked 
up in a few Districts. The weakness in manufacturing became more 
pervasive, spreading to energy-related and high technology fields. 
Layoffs did not appear to slow, and capital spending continued to 
decline. New residential construction remained depressed, but some 
very modest improvements were noted in a few local housing markets. 
In the agricultural sector, liquidations and bankruptcies rose as 
farm incomes and land values continued to fall. Consumer borrowing 
was sluggish although commercial lending varied somewhat among 
Districts. In contrast to last month, none of the District reports 
expressed any optimism that a turnaround was at hand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales were lackluster in most areas of the 
country although automobile sales picked up in a few Districts. 
Despite the general weakness among department stores, merchants in 
Boston, Philadelphia and Dallas experienced moderate gains in their 
overall sales. In many Districts, increased reliance on markdowns 
and promotional activity spurred lagging sales but put considerable 
pressure on profit margins. Only retailers in Cleveland, St. Louis 
and Kansas City reported excessive inventories. As for automobile 
sales, strong response to rebates and special financing plans was 
noted in St. Louis and Minneapolis but such measures did little to 
stimulate sales in San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Throughout most of the country, conditions 
worsened in the manufacturing sector, with weakness spreading even 
to industries which had been weathering the recession well. In many 
Districts, already distressed industries deteriorated further, 
including steel, machine tools, building materials, and textiles. 
The weakness spread to other, previously strong industries which had 
bolstered the economies of several Districts. Conditions softened in 
such high technology industries as computers and telecommunications 
equipment, according to the Boston, Atlanta, and Minneapolis 
reports. Orders for oil production equipment dropped sharply in 
Dallas, Atlanta, and Chicago. Cutbacks in state and local government 
dampened purchases by the public sector. Layoffs and reduced hours 
were widespread, and many Districts reported several plant 
shutdowns, both temporary and permanent. Capital spending was being 
postponed or canceled. Inventories were generally lean, although 
manufacturers in Richmond still viewed stocks as excessive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New residential construction was uniformly described 
as depressed, although modest improvements were noted in a few local 
housing markets. Demand for luxury cooperative apartments remained 
high in Manhattan and housing sales showed some strength in other 
parts of New York City. In Dallas, housing sales and new starts 
regained year-ago levels, but the slight upturn in new housing 
starts in San Francisco—February had marked a post-World War II 
low—was offset by further declines in the sales of new homes. 
Creative financing was cited as providing some support to sales in a 
number of Districts. In the nonresidential sector, construction 
activity remained strong in a few urban centers, but San Francisco 
reported the cancellations of several commercial projects. Some 
softening was evident in New York's previously buoyant office rental 
market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the agricultural sector remain generally 
grim, especially in the Midwest and California. In California, heavy 
rains impeded the Spring plantings, according to the San Francisco 
report. With crop prices having fallen to low levels, crop farmers 
throughout the country are caught in a squeeze of high interest 
charges and low income. As a result, land prices have fallen 
sharply, and farmers have had difficulty in paying their bills. Farm 
foreclosures and bankruptcies have increased sharply. Livestock 
producers, however, have benefited from the recent rise in livestock 
prices which, in combination with the low crop prices, have widened 
their profit margins. Nevertheless, the generally bleak conditions 
in agriculture have strained the solvency of such related businesses 
as farm machinery, seed and fertilizer sales, and elevator 
operations according to reports from Cleveland and Minneapolis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer borrowing was generally weak, while commercial 
lending varied somewhat among Districts. In Philadelphia, business 
borrowing was slightly ahead of last year, but bankers expected loan 
demand to soften. Slackening in the energy sector had divergent 
effects on loan demand, increasing lending activity in Dallas and 
decreasing it in Kansas City. Flat loan demand was reported in 
Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. San Francisco banks 
experienced a sharp rise in problem and delinquent loans as 
bankruptcies increased among forest products; and construction 
industries and small firms in general.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In contrast to last month none of the District reports 
expressed any optimism that a turnaround was at hand. Instead, 
conditions appear to have worsened and forecasts of a recovery have 
been postponed until later in the year. Economists in Boston felt an 
upturn, albeit an "anemic" or "modest" one, would begin in the 
second half of the year despite deteriorating conditions in April 
and early May. Among manufacturers, some were looking for a pickup 
in business activity within the next six months, while others were 
less sanguine. Retailers, too, were divided with some expecting an 
upturn to follow the July tax cut while others, such as those in 
Richmond and in Kansas City, did not see any imminent upturn in 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the price outlook, there was little feel for whether the 
recent slowdown was cyclical or permanent. In Chicago, price 
discounting is more common than at any time since the l930s and is 
especially prevalent in steel, nonferrous metals, building 
materials, paper, and transportation, though a large surge in these 
prices is anticipated with recovery. Similarly, in Kansas City, 
prices for new materials were down between 5 and 18 percent from 
last year but are expected to be stable or rise slightly for the 
rest of the year. Wage settlements not far below those of a year ago 
were reported by several Districts. For example some Chicago firms 
in depressed industries recently negotiated contracts calling for 8 
to 10 percent first year wage increases.
