      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 5, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity is 
  moderate to slow this month. Area manufacturing has posted its third 
  consecutive no-growth month, and retail sales, which are starting to 
  slow anyway, have been pushed down farther by gasoline problems. As 
  for the future, Business Outlook Survey respondents are forecasting 
  an imminent recession and retailers are being ultraconservative 
  about fall and early winter sales. In the banking sector, loan 
  demand is reported to be up. Interest rates have been cut at some 
  banks, and no further hikes are anticipated in general. The gasoline 
  shortage's major impact so far in the Third District has been on 
  vacation business which is reported to be down significantly at many 
  resorts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondents to the latest Business Outlook Survey say local 
  manufacturing activity remains unchanged for the third consecutive 
  month. Shipments are higher once again, but new orders have not kept 
  pace, causing stock levels to tumble for the seventh time in eight 
  months. On the employment front, area labor seems to be holding its 
  own. Industrial employment is reported to be about the same as it 
  was in May and the length of the average workweek remains unaltered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Present conditions, however, are not expected to last much longer. 
  Survey respondents foresee some weakness in the economy in the 
  coming months, and are forecasting an imminent downturn. Just how 
  far into the predicted slump we'll be by year-end, or how severe it 
  will be by that time, is open to question though. Neither new orders 
  nor shipments are projected to drop between now and December and 
  responding manufacturers do not expect at this time to cut payrolls 
  within the next six months. Moreover, over one-fourth of the 
  respondents report plans to increase outlays for plant and equipment 
  in the near future. Thus, it appears that although a slowdown is 
  generally expected, manufacturers do not presently look for a 
  precipitous drop-off in business by year-end.
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial prices are reported to be up sharply in the region this 
  month. Eighty-six percent of the respondents report paying higher 
  prices for inputs in June, and over 40 percent are charging more for 
  their finished goods. For the longer term, more of the same is 
  expected-recession or no recession. Manufacturers were nearly 
  unanimous (94 percent) in predicting further hikes in the cost of 
  raw materials over the next six months, and over 60 percent plan to 
  raise the prices of the goods they sell.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third District retail executives paint a much bleaker picture this 
  month than do their industrial counterparts. Retail activity in the 
  region is generally sluggish in late June with reports of current 
  dollar sales ranging from 4 percent above to 8 percent below sales 
  levels for the corresponding period in 1978. Sales are also reported 
  to be below planned levels for the period by 5 to 20 percent. 
  Suburban stores are doing much worse than downtown branches, 
  probably a direct result of gasoline availability problems. However, 
  a Director of this Bank in the retailing industry feels this problem 
  will be rectified shortly, when newly imposed gas rationing plans 
  take effect. Despite sluggish sales inventory, levels have not 
  become a problem as retailers, in anticipation of a general slowdown 
  this year, have been aggressively cutting stock. Merchants cite 
  myriad causes for the observed sluggishness in sales, including the 
  coolest and wettest spring in recent memory, gasoline shortages and 
  prices, the erosion of purchasing power by "soaring inflation," and 
  the possibility that the long awaited recession has finally arrived. 
  It should also be noted, however, that near-record gains were 
  reported in June 1978, making large year-over-year increases at this 
  time less likely in any case.
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking ahead to the balance of 1979, retailers are being more 
  conservative in making their forecasts than they've been in some 
  time. Projections of December sales volume range from 3 to 7 percent 
  over year-earlier figures, but merchants at the upper end of the 
  scale believe their projections are optimistic. Most expectations 
  have been toned down as fear of an imminent recession grows.
       </p>
       <p>
        Area bankers say loan demand is generally strong. Reports of C&amp;I 
  loan volume range from 3 to 14 percent over last June. Consumer 
  loans are also up, but by less. Bankers currently anticipate a 
  slowing in loan demand throughout the rest of 1979. Loan volume 
  projections for year-end are very conservative, about even with 
  December 1978. Fear of a coming recession was generally noted by 
  bankers contacted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Banks in the District are currently quoting a prime rate of either 
  11 1/2 or 11 3/4 percent. Forecasts for interest rates vary, but no 
  further hikes are anticipated currently. Projections range from a 
  drop in the prime to 10 percent by December to no further changes as 
  inflationary pressures keep it at 11 1/2 to 11 3/4 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        No major problems are reported with savings flows in late June. 
  Consumer deposits are reasonably good and corporate savings are 
  holding their own. Money market certificates continue to creep up.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gasoline is generally available in the Third District at this time, 
  and, as all three states in the District are currently on an odd-even ration plan, lines have grown shorter. Overall, the local 
  economy appears to have suffered very little from the gas shortage 
  thus far. Deliveries of food and commodities seem to be on schedule 
  and no major problems with employee attendance have been noted. The 
  businesses hit hardest by the crisis have been those affiliated with 
  vacation spots. Shore resorts along most of the South Jersey coast 
  report a slow season so far, with business down as much as 20 to 25 
  percent from last year. This comes as a surprise to many seashore 
  businessmen, who thought that gasoline problems would encourage 
  people who normally would have taken longer trips to go to South 
  Jersey instead. These spots have been suffering from more than 
  gasoline shortages though. For one thing, unseasonable weather has 
  been the rule so far this spring. For another, Canadian visitors 
  make up about one-fourth of the vacationing population in some 
  resorts, and current exchange rates are not favorable to Canadians 
  traveling in the U.S. The one exception to seashore sluggishness 
  this year is Atlantic City where legalized gambling continues to 
  draw record crowds, especially with the opening of the city's second 
  casino.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism in the Pocono Mountains is running about even with last 
  summer, according to contacts in that area. This of course means 
  business is below planned levels, but most of the loss has come from 
  a drop-off in day trips. Prearranged trips such as bus tours, 
  conventions, and honeymoons are up about 12 percent over last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        As for the rest of the summer, resort businessmen and officials feel 
  that things will shape up if gasoline supplies improve. They do 
  note, though, that business that has been lost to this point is lost 
  forever. It cannot be made up.
