      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although economic weakness still characterizes business activity in 
the District, record-setting temperatures and the effects they have 
caused received the most attention this month. Consumers are holding 
spending only to items needed. Residential housing construction is 
still weak; however, savings and loans report renewed consumer 
interest in loan applications. Manufacturers of carpet, steel, and 
aluminum have had substantial layoffs. Parts of Georgia and 
Mississippi were declared disaster areas due to drought-caused 
losses by farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Layoffs and threat of layoffs, declining real incomes, and very high 
energy bills have all led to cautious consumer spending. Department 
store sales are about even with year-ago figures, implying a decline 
in real terms. Durable goods sales for the most part remained weak; 
however, purchases of window air conditioners and fans are up 
sharply. Several movie theaters reported long lines as patrons seek 
refuge from record-setting temperatures. Television sales and 
servicing were thriving as more people stayed home in an attempt to 
avoid the heat and conserve money. Consumers continued to search for 
bargains and limited their use of credit cards. Sales promotions are 
becoming more prevalent in an effort to reduce inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      A spokesperson for the Southern Company, a holding company for 
utilities in the Southeast, said that electricity demand was 
expected to reach a new high for the entire system in July. 
Generating capacity was said to be adequate, with most generating 
plants in good condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales are still very weak. However, our central Florida, 
eastern Tennessee, and central Alabama directors reported recent 
improvement in sales. The used car market has become more active, 
with heightened demand for both small- and large-sized used cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      At least temporarily, the downturn in residential housing has 
bottomed out. Home sales have turned up in various parts of the 
District. Applications are increasing considerably at savings and 
loans, particularly in Florida, but builders of single-family houses 
are not yet convinced that the housing slump is over. Residential 
construction is especially weak in areas with rising unemployment 
such as central and northern Alabama.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand is soft at many banks due to uncertainty about the 
duration and severity of the current recession. Delinquency rates 
are rising but not enough to warrant concern. There appears to be a 
discernible effort by businesses to reduce their outstanding loans 
and refrain from borrowing new money.
     </p>
     <p>
      A substantial weakening in employment has become evident throughout 
the District. The latest declines have been concentrated in 
manufacturing, but slower growth and declines are also occurring in 
other sectors. Layoffs have been high in the North Georgia carpet 
industry, which has been harder hit than in the 1974 recession 
because of the construction and credit squeeze. Sixty-five percent 
of carpet sales are on credit. In addition to the steel plant 
cutback, northern Alabama has had recent layoffs in its aluminum 
industry due to declining demand for aluminum from the auto 
industry. Jobless claims have accelerated rapidly in most District 
states but seem to be leveling off.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tourist trade can be characterized as mixed. While attendance at 
state parks is booming, more expensive commercial campgrounds are 
almost empty. Traffic counts along major tourist arteries have sunk 
appreciably since last summer. Occupancy rates at a chain of 
"economy motels" are only matching that of last year, and a higher 
priced chain reports lower occupancy rates. More families are 
driving at night and lodging during the day because of the heat and 
lower day rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital spending projects of note include plans for "Little 
England," a huge tourist attraction reproducing English history from 
the Stone Age to modern time. The $500-million complex will be 
constructed near Disney World and is expected to attract more than 9 
million visitors per year and employ more than 10,000 workers by 
completion in the late 1980s.
     </p>
     <p>
      An expansion of the Port of Miami, announced recently, is one of the 
largest projects in South Florida history. By doubling its size, the 
estimated direct and indirect economic effect of the port will 
ultimately add about $3.8 billion of income to the port.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lockheed-Georgia Company was selected as the primary contractor for 
retrofitting the wings of C-5A "Galaxy" transports. A spokesman for 
Lockheed- Georgia reported that the retrofit program will permit the 
"rolling over" of 2,000 company employees currently working on the 
C-141 program.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Farmers Home Administration declared parts of Georgia 
and Mississippi disaster areas because of the heat and drought 
damage in June and July, making farmers eligible for low interest 
loans. Georgia crop losses are valued at $450 million. Hay and 
pasture suffered the largest losses, followed by corn, soybeans, and 
peanuts. Record temperatures and high humidity have also damaged the 
poultry industry in Georgia and Mississippi. Broiler prices had just 
begun to climb to break-even levels in Mississippi before the bird 
losses began. The losses are expected to result in an increase in 
broiler prices at the retail level. A brighter picture is that 
vegetables in Florida have done very well; a record tomato and 
watermelon crop was harvested there.
