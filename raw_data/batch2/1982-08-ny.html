      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 18, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Second District continued to languish in July and 
early August, displaying more evidence of deterioration than 
recovery. Almost all sectors suffered from depressed business 
activity. Retail sales turned down at many stores. Residential 
construction showed no signs of pulling out of its persistent slump. 
Nonresidential construction, however, continued to be the healthiest 
segment of the region's economy. In the manufacturing sector, 
production schedules were cut through layoffs and shorter workweeks. 
Business leaders saw no reason to expect an upturn before the end of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity was flat or down at almost all stores contacted. Few 
merchants achieved their July goals, and some reported that business 
had distinctly worsened during the first week of August. No 
respondent had yet observed any stimulus from the July tax cut or 
social security increase. Only a few nondurable products, such as 
apparel and cosmetics, demonstrated any strength, and big ticket 
items continued to move slowly. Department stores maintained the 
heavy promotions of the past twelve months, and one reduced markups 
to their lowest levels in recent years. Furthermore, buying plans 
were tight, although inventories generally were not considered high. 
Retailers had become more uncertain about the next few months but 
were hopeful that back-to-school shopping would bring a modest gain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction remained depressed. The few bright signs 
noted during the past two months have not led to any significant 
improvement. Even the construction of high-priced condominiums and 
single-family homes, which had been accounting for most of the 
activity, appeared to have slowed. Many homebuilders experienced 
severe cash flow problems as suppliers pressed for faster payment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prospects for new nonresidential construction activity remained 
weaker than a few months ago, but that sector was healthy relative 
to the rest of the economy. While the recent softening in the office 
market persisted, as reflected in a small rise in vacancy rates, a 
considerable surplus of space that had been anticipated by some real 
estate brokers has not materialized. Observers nonetheless believed 
that few new buildings would be started in New York City until the 
economic recovery was well underway. However, ongoing projects were 
sustaining a high level of construction. Suburban areas showed some 
promise of renewed strength, including the commencement of two large 
scale ventures—an office park and a luxury hotel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business leaders throughout the District reported that economic 
activity had been flat at best, and many observed evidence of 
additional deterioration. Capital goods producers cut production 
further, with one firm considering the permanent closure of a plant. 
In addition, a large steel company just filed for bankruptcy. Auto 
production, which picked up in June, leveled off. And, high 
technology companies and producers of a variety of goods, including 
firearms, pianos, and silverware, were hurt by a lack of orders. 
Many of these firms shortened workweeks to four days or extended 
vacation shutdowns for a week or more. Workforce reductions, both 
blue and white collar, continued in a broad range of industries. 
While scattered recalls were noted at a few plants, they amounted to 
only a small proportion of the workers that had been laid off by 
those establishments. A rising number of companies forecast real 
reductions in capital spending over the next year, and inventories 
were being held at very tight levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business leaders felt that the economy would drift along at its 
current languid pace through the rest of the year. Even our contacts 
who had previously been the least pessimistic saw no indication that 
any pickup was imminent. One respondent believed that an almost 
total lack of confidence by both businessmen and consumers would 
thwart any recovery. Another expressed the view that while the 
economy was on a low plateau, a renewed deepening of the recession 
was more likely than an upturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Donald Maude (Merrill Lynch), 
Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty Trust), and Francis Schott 
(Equitable Life Assurance Society): Their views of course are 
personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maude: Strains anticipated in the financial system have been 
alleviated to some degree by recent easing in Federal Reserve 
policy. The easing has been accepted by the financial community as 
appropriate and desirable because of the perception that the 
recession still persists and the present turbulence in the financial 
sector. But as signs of economic recovery become more evident and 
the wave of financial shocks recede, the Fed's credibility will be 
scrutinized more critically. The most recent easing moves combined 
with normal cyclical forces will probably lead to a renewed 
acceleration in money supply growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, while interest rates will generally trend down, there 
will be occasional pressures on rates and a risk of renewed 
recession over the first half of next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: Business conditions are poor and worldwide credit problems 
continue to mount. The Fed appears to be properly shifting its focus 
toward concern about the weak economy. At the same time it would be 
reassuring to the capital markets for the Fed to define more 
precisely its longer goal for the inflation rate, which in my view 
should be zero.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: The widely forecast business recovery for the second half is 
not yet a reality. Erosive effects of weak cash flow are becoming 
more apparent in the industrial sector. Repercussions in the 
financial sector are also spreading.
     </p>
     <p>
      Federal Reserve policy is mildly supportive of recovery. More may 
have to be done.
