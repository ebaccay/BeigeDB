      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 18, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District economy continued to show evidence of recovery 
in recent weeks. Major retailers reported that consumer spending 
remained strong, and sales generally were above plans. The 
residential real estate market picked up further, but some slowdown 
in nonresidential construction was anticipated. The upswing in 
manufacturing spread to more areas, and firms in many industries 
were increasing hours and workforces. On the financial side, retail 
deposits at all classes of depository institutions have grown with 
the introduction of MMDAs and Super NOWs. The consensus among 
business leaders is that the economy will continue to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers continued to enjoy year-over-year sales gains over the 
past two months, despite some temporary weakness in early April. 
Business at most department stores was running ahead of their plans. 
One respondent did note, however, that promotional efforts ''light-years ahead of last year'' were necessary to coax shoppers into 
buying. Soft goods and electronics continued to be sources of 
strength. One merchant indicated that furniture began to pick up as 
well. Inventories remained at desired levels, with one store keeping 
them "aggressively heavy." The outlook varied by respondent. One 
discount chain was considering an upward revision in its sales 
goals, while another retailer felt that the general optimism about 
the economy was unfounded.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential real estate market showed further improvement 
recently and respondents believe that an upswing is definitely 
underway. Both sales and starts showed healthy increases. Most of 
the growth was limited to high priced homes, however. Some contacts 
believe a further drop in mortgage rates is needed before low- and 
middle-priced homes will move. While no one foresees a boom, 
builders expressed a good deal of optimism about the next few 
months. The outlook for nonresidential construction remained cloudy. 
Brokers reported that the absorption of office space improved in 
recent weeks. A number of major leases were negotiated or signed in 
New York City and surrounding suburbs. But observers see the pace of
construction slowing. With new space being completed and vacancy 
rates trending up, rents have been flat and landlord concessions 
more prevalent. Consequently, new projects are expected to be 
limited.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The onset of recovery in the manufacturing sector was confirmed by 
recent reports from business leaders around the District. Areas hit 
particularly hard by the recession finally noted signs of an upturn, 
and regions that had remained relatively healthy reported somewhat 
faster growth. The upswing in auto-related industries has continued. 
Furniture orders finally rebounded, leading one supplier to that 
industry to believe that recent signals could foreshadow one of his 
best years ever. As backlogs developed and delivery times 
lengthened, firms picked up production schedules. Shortened 
workweeks became much less common. While some more layoffs occurred, 
such diverse industries as autos, aluminum, and communications 
equipment were adding to their workforces.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business leaders are virtually unanimous in believing that the 
recovery has arrived. Although there is some disagreement concerning 
its strength, our contacts have become more confident that the 
upswing will be sustained. One respondent noted that while 
businessmen are still cautious, they are expressing as much 
enthusiasm about the future as he can remember. Another believes 
prospects for economic growth look good for the next two or three 
years. But one state labor official still fears that the recovery 
will be one of the slowest on record.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reflecting national trends, home mortgage rates offered at banks and 
thrifts in the Second District have fallen by as much as 5 
percentage points since last summer. While some of the institutions 
contacted offer only variable rates on home mortgages, most of those 
that offer both fixed and variable rates report that a very high 
proportion of new mortgages (about 75 percent) have fixed rates. In 
part, this reflects a narrowing of the spreads between the fixed and 
variable rates. In addition, most said that at least 20% of the 
mortgages now being made represent refinancings wherein households 
prefer to substitute one fixed rate instrument for another.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of the banks and thrifts contacted said that they are selling 
the bulk of their new mortgages in the secondary market. One 
institution specified that it is now mainly selling the fixed rate 
mortgages and using MMDAs to fund the variable rate mortgages. All 
in all, the institutions appear aware of the potential for 
mismatching assets and liabilities resulting from the inflow of 
MMDAs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since the introduction of MMDAs and Super NOWs, all classes of 
depository institutions in the Second District have gained retail 
deposits. The commercial banks, however, were clearly the biggest 
gainers, in both dollar volume and market share. According to our 
estimates, between mid-November 1982 and mid-March 1983, Second 
District commercial banks raised their share of the retail deposit 
market by as much as 5 full percentage points, from 30 percent to 35 
percent. By comparison, in the rest of the nation it appears that 
the commercial bank gains in retail market share were considerably 
smaller. Some New York banks have expressed concern about the need 
to replace funding sources as the market for money-center CDs 
shrinks along with money market mutual funds. Perhaps because of 
this concern, competition for MMDA money has been particularly keen 
in New York City, where the rates offered on these accounts have 
been consistently higher than the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from David Jones (Aubrey Lanston &amp; 
Co.,), Donald Maude (Merrill Lynch) and Albert Wojnilower (First 
Boston Corp.). Their views of course are personal, not 
institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jones: The "critical mass" for economic recovery is now in place and 
the question now is whether the recovery will be moderate or brisk. 
The seeds of recovery were planted by a sharp decline in interest 
rates in the second half of last year. More recently, there has been 
a pick-up in demand in such interest-sensitive sectors as housing, 
autos, and other durable goods. In the improved economic climate, 
businesses cut their rate of inventory liquidation roughly in half 
in the first quarter of this year and some actual restocking may 
begin in the second quarter, thus further strengthening new orders, 
production, employment and income. The recovery is, however, likely 
to remain moderate and uneven through 1984. Serving to limit 
economic gains are likely to be abnormally high real rates 
reflecting the clash between recovery-related increases in consumer 
and business credit demands and excessive Federal borrowing demands 
arising from mounting structural deficits. Accordingly, the recovery 
is likely to stall from time to time as business spending on new 
plant and equipment remains depressed (both because of high real 
rates and a huge margin of unused capacity) and as U.S. exports 
continue weak (because of a strong dollar). All in all, real GNP 
might show gains of 5.0 percent in the second quarter, 2.0 percent 
in the third quarter and 4.0 percent in the fourth quarter. In 1984, 
the pattern might be 6.0 percent in the first quarter, 7.0 percent 
in the second quarter, 3.0 percent in the third quarter and 4.0 
percent in the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maude: While progressing at an uneven pace, as is almost invariably 
the case in the early recovery phase, the present economic recovery 
should remain intact going into 1984 in an environment of restrained 
inflation and inflationary expectations. Presently, we envision a 
second half 1983 gain in real GNP of 5 percent and an annual rate of 
increase of 5.7 percent in the consumer price index. Under such 
conditions, private credit demands throughout the remainder of the 
year should remain sufficiently restrained to allow the Treasury to 
raise a projected 110-120 billion net new cash over the final two 
quarters of 1983 without much disruption to the financial markets on 
balance. However, even a controlled slow growth recovery runs the 
risk of being aborted as early as the first half of 1984 as rising 
private credit demands begin to clash with fiscal 1984 Treasury 
financing requirements exceeding $200 billion—potentially leading 
to a meaningful upward spike in interest rates. Indeed, even at 
present real interest rate levels, the sustainability of the 
recovery remains tenuous. However, monetary policy is once again 
perceived by the financial markets as credible and latitude for 
further accommodation in an interest rate sense presently exists.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: Domestic business contacts suggest that the economic 
recovery is broadening somewhat and that confidence for the longer 
pull has increased materially. At the same time, the nearly 
explosive attitude displayed previously by executives in some 
segments of the department store, steel, and building materials 
industries has sobered, as what in their perception were initially 
extraordinary sales gains have slowed considerably. In the security 
markets large amounts of new issues of all types continue to be 
placed. Demand by foreign investors is enormous but a torrential 
reversal well might ensue if policies to weaken the dollar were 
officially adopted. During a visit to Europe last week, I gathered 
the impression that the reported business pickup on the continent 
may be more an improvement in sentiment than in performance. In 
France, of course, a sharp setback in business is anticipated. In 
the United Kingdom, Mrs. Thatcher's reelection is taken virtually 
for granted and people are quite sure that business is rebounding.
