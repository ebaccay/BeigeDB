      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District generally view the 
growth potential of the economy as strong and expect a quick rebound 
in real GNP if interest rates fall. Real retail sales are expected 
to show only mild gains over the next few months. Current interest 
rate levels, along with a slowdown in orders, have led to deferring 
of some capital spending projects and liquidating of inventories. 
District employment continues to slide toward the 1980 recession 
trough level. Effects of dollar appreciation on exports and imports 
are mixed, but few respondents expect exports to rebound. Large 
savings outflows at S&amp;Ls continued in July.
     </p>
     &lt;&gt;
     <strong>
      &gt;Output and Prices
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Most respondents have scaled down their third and 
fourth quarter forecasts of real GNP, but the core inflation rate is 
expected to remain around 9%. A bank economist, who previously 
forecasted strong growth in real GNP for the second half of 1981, 
now expects only 1% growth in the third quarter and 2.5% in the 
fourth quarter. A steel economist and a retail trade economist see 
prospects for a negative third quarter and possibly fourth quarter, 
if interest rates do not fall. However, several respondents expect 
that tax cut incentives and declining interest rates will provide 
stimulus by September to support a positive third quarter. The fall 
in interest rates assumes that business loan demand weakens and 
monetary policy eases.
     <p>
      <p>
       Inflation continues to be a major concern of respondents, with a 
widespread view that further moderation involves bringing down wage 
and employment cost increases. Also, several respondents are 
concerned that the effects of tight monetary policy on output will 
limit productivity gains that are necessary to reduce the core rate 
of inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Goods
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Some retailers expect sales, excluding autos, will 
grow at a slower pace the balance of the year than earlier this 
year, because of the slow growth of income and rising unemployment. 
An economist for a major department store chain projects a 2% 
increase in real retail sales of department store-type goods during 
the second half of 1981. A nondurable goods producer reports that 
sales volume has been soft in recent months, with year-over-year 
gains at 1-2%, rather than an anticipated 3-4%. While several 
department stores report small gains in real sales, a local chain 
store that caters to blue-collar workers reports declines in real 
sales. An area auto dealer reports new car sales rose slightly in 
the last 10-day period of July, partly because of a revised Ohio 
sales tax law that can reduce sales tax on new cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       High interest rates and slackened final 
demand are contributing to some curtailment of inventories and 
deferment of capital spending. While most respondents report that 
inventories at the plant and customer level are generally lean, some 
spot excesses have occurred in recent weeks. Larger-than-desired 
inventories are apparent, especially in steel, petroleum, and 
construction supplies. A petroleum economist reports that refinery 
operating rates range between 66-70% because of an excess of crude 
stocks. A steel economist states that the moderate buildup of steel 
inventories in the second quarter of 1981, while low by historical 
standards, is in the process of being cut back. Steel orders 
generally have weakened as a result of unwanted inventories and 
rising imports. Order rates in the last few weeks are equivalent to 
only a 60% operating rate, compared to the current 75% operating 
rate. An official with a machine tool producer reports that new 
orders amount to 50% of capacity and that production, which has been 
at capacity, will be cut back by the end of the year even if orders 
rebound. Several respondents state that some capital spending 
programs are being deferred because of slackened demand and high 
interest rates. A steel economist expects business fixed investment 
to improve if the volume of sales returns, regardless of the 
interest rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Employment conditions in the District have been 
weakening steadily in recent months. Nonagricultural employment, 
which peaked in November 1980, is currently approaching the July 
1980 trough level. Nonmanufacturing employment, especially 
government and construction, accounted for most of the decline from 
the November peak. Manufacturing employment has drifted downward 
since March, with declines concentrated in the auto industry. An 
auto economist reports that temporary layoffs are likely to continue 
throughout the third quarter as plants are closed for a week at a 
time. A steel economist expects that slackening in steel orders and 
production will cause shortened work weeks and some layoffs 
throughout the second half of 1981. The latest monthly Survey of 
Fourth District Manufacturing has shown a steady decline in rate of 
employment expansion since the end of last year, and virtually no 
change in hours worked since February.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Exports/Imports
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Respondents acknowledge the difficulty in 
differentiating effects of dollar appreciation on U.S. exports and 
imports from economic weakness abroad. Several small 
producer/exporters in the District report little loss in export 
business despite dollar appreciation, while several others attribute 
the recent decline in their exports to dollar appreciation and 
softness in economics abroad. A machine tool builder reports growing 
competition for orders from foreign producers and estimates that 25% 
of his market is absorbed by imports. A manufacturer of pigments for 
appliance paints states that sales in Europe have been declining 
since mid-June and expects the decline to continue for the next few 
months. In contrast, a chemical manufacturer reports a 10% increase 
in sales during the first half of 1981 over the first half of 1980. 
Imports have been rising noticeably in the steel industry, according 
to a steel economist, but may partly reflect attempts to maintain 
production levels abroad as demand softens. A chemical manufacturer 
reports shifting to foreign sources of raw materials because of the 
price advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Savings Flows
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The heavy outflow of funds from S&amp;Ls continued in 
July, as many area S&amp;Ls look to new four-year certificates, "all-
savers" certificates, and repurchase agreements for new sources of 
funds. Savings outflows, according to an economist for a regional 
FHLB in the District, were not as severe in the second 10 days of 
July, compared with the first 10 days, but were still massive by 
historical standards. S&amp;Ls appear to be more aggressive in promoting 
the new four-year certificate and retail-repurchase agreements than 
banks. Some banks are apparently reluctant to make long-term 
commitments at present interest rates, but an S&amp;L official states 
that the new saving instrument adds stability to their source of 
funds. A local S&amp;L offers both a fixed and a variable rate on its 
four-year certificate. An economist for a large S&amp;L expects the "all 
savers" certificate to be more helpful to the industry than the 
four-year certificate in attracting funds and should shift funds 
away from the money market certificates. Retail repurchase 
agreements are being promoted in several major metropolitan centers 
of the District, mainly by S&amp;Ls.
