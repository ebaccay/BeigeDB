      Beige Book: National Summary

     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in most Districts showed some signs of 
improvement except in the manufacturing sector. Weakness in 
manufacturing remained pervasive with some further layoffs reported 
and, for the most part, little or no upturn in new orders. Consumer 
spending strengthened in November but several Districts noted 
sluggish early-December sales. Housing sales and starts registered 
gains in most regions although the oversupply of office space kept 
nonresidential construction generally slow. In several agricultural 
areas a further decline in farm income and land values overshadowed 
the few bright spots that appeared. Commercial bank lending was 
essentially flat in most reporting Districts. The general outlook 
ranges from a slight upturn during the next six months to little 
pickup until late 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since the last report, consumer expenditures posted some gains on 
both a month-to-month and year-over-year basis, helped in part by 
promotional activity. Nonetheless, no real exuberance was displayed. 
Auto sales picked up in several areas in response to lower finance 
charges but these lower rates are scheduled to end soon. With regard 
to the overall outlook for retail sales during the holiday season, 
the most optimistic report was from Boston ("solid but 
unspectacular"). Several Districts experienced good consumer buying 
immediately after Thanksgiving but sluggish sales thereafter. One 
factor cited was the trend in recent years of a shift in sales to 
the end of the holiday season. Inventories were generally in line 
though one District reported that inventories overall were high. The 
San Francisco and Atlanta Banks noted relatively strong tourist 
demand at areas in Hawaii, Oregon and Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The manufacturing and mining sectors continued to languish 
throughout the nation. Although a few Districts observed scattered 
signs of improvement, most reported that shipments and new orders 
remained stagnant or declined further in a broad range of 
industries. San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Chicago reported that 
timber mills, iron mines, and producers of steel, industrial 
equipment, and castings were operating at half capacity or less. In 
Cleveland, manufacturers of steel mill and other industrial 
equipment were hurt by the cancellation of customers capital 
expansion plans. Boston and New York expressed some concern for 
future bankruptcies in manufacturing if sales did not turn up soon. 
Even the business of high technology firms slackened in some areas. 
In many industries, widespread cost-cutting measures continued, 
including layoffs, shorter workweeks, and longer-than-usual 
Christmas shutdowns. Despite the pervasive sense of sluggishness, 
however, a few bright spots emerged. In Richmond, sales of textile 
firms increased significantly, and in St. Louis, food processors 
noted a slight improvement. Several Districts indicated that 
suppliers of building materials and selected home furnishings were 
beginning to feel a pickup from the increased activity in the 
residential construction sector. Defense contractors were still 
doing well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing market improved in many parts of the country. A few 
Districts even experienced substantial gains. St. Louis, for 
example, reported that new home sales were greater this November 
than in any other November in recent years. In Kansas City, 
increased activity reduced new home inventories to an all-time low, 
and led to a significant increase in housing starts. These 
improvements in the residential real estate market were largely 
attributed to the decline in interest rates and to stable or lower 
home prices. The office market, however, continued weak in most 
areas of the country due to a glut of existing office space from 
overbuilding and decreased demand. Chicago and San Francisco were 
especially hard hit, whereas New York and Richmond reported modest 
strengthening in some areas of their Districts. These latter two 
Districts, along with Dallas, also noted a slight pick-up in 
industrial construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general the agricultural sector continued to experience low net 
income resulting from depressed prices and little or no decline in 
overall costs. Grain, corn, and soybean farmers saw only a small 
chance of profit from the 1982 crops and Dallas beef producers were 
preparing cattle for slaughter rather than for breeding because of 
unfavorable economic conditions. Some farmers, however, were doing 
well. For example, prices were up and the cost of feed held steady 
or declined for Minneapolis and St. Louis hog producers, and good 
crop yields were expected to bring a profitable year for Atlanta 
cotton growers. The downtrend in the price of farmland continued in 
areas such as the Richmond District where, in addition, farm 
business failures were still above normal. In the Northwest the 
timber industry remained depressed due to low domestic and foreign 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial bank lending was essentially flat in most reporting 
districts. In Minneapolis and Philadelphia corporate lending was 
down as businesses turned to the bond market, but consumer borrowing 
strengthened. In Kansas City, however, the reverse occurred: 
corporate loans increased while consumer loans were flat. Deposit 
flows improved somewhat at most commercial banks and at some thrift 
institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In many Districts, a number of signs pointed to somewhat brighter 
prospects for consumer spending and construction. Retailers were 
cautiously optimistic that recent gains would continue into the new 
year. While the outlook for commercial construction remained weak, 
homebuilders were hopeful that their modest pickup would accelerate. 
As for manufacturing, there was no consensus on how soon the 
advances in retail and construction activity would result in 
increased production. Several Districts did note that orders of a 
few firms were beginning to improve. But manufacturers in many 
Districts saw little chance of a general upturn before the second 
half of 1983 or even early 1984, and many have turned more 
pessimistic because the recovery has been so slow in coming. 
Inventories in manufacturing are lean in most regions and when 
business activity does turn up, production should rise quickly to 
meet the higher demand.
