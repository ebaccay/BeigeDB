     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 13, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District continued to be mixed in 
April, with marked improvement particularly evident in the consumer 
sector. Several retailers experienced exceptionally large sales 
gains, and there was strength in some parts of the automobile 
market. While new orders for capital goods remained weak, the 
backlog of unfilled orders has sustained production levels. 
Inventories were at acceptable levels in all sectors. Unexpectedly 
strong growth in first quarter GNP prompted business economists to 
revise upward their forecasts of real activity in 1981. Slower 
growth is still expected for the second quarter, however, followed 
by a general pickup in the latter half of the year. On the financial 
side, activity in the home mortgage market is far below year-earlier 
levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail store sales strengthened significantly in April, without 
unusually heavy promotional activity. Growth generally was higher 
than expected at a wide variety of stores throughout the Second 
District. One retailer reported that sales grew at twice the rate 
indicated in the store's plan. While year-to-year comparisons are 
especially difficult to interpret this month due to last year's 
credit controls, transit strike and earlier Easter season, the 15 to 
25 percent gains reported over last April by several stores reflect 
unusually strong growth. Apparel merchandise has moved particularly 
well. Inventories are somewhat above anticipated levels, but are 
well in line with the higher volume. While respondents anticipate 
continued real growth in sales, a repetition of April's surprising
showing seems unlikely.
     </p>
     <p>
      The demand for higher-priced domestic automobiles continued strong 
while sales of less-expensive American models remained sluggish. 
Dealers attributed weakness of the latter to high prices and high 
costs of financing. Meanwhile, a dealer of relatively expensive 
domestic cars reported his third consecutive month of record sales. 
Foreign car sales improved, but remained weaker than a year ago. No 
inventory problems were indicated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued mixed in the Second District. 
Capital goods manufacturers reported a softening of sales, but the 
backlog of unfilled orders helped to maintain production. Moreover, 
many firms expected orders to pick up later in the year, in part 
because of anticipated changes in business taxation and increases in 
subcontracts from defense firms. Activity related to primary and 
secondary metals appeared to be fairly strong. In general, 
inventories were not seen as being out of line, although some firms 
are making adjustments to accommodate anticipated changes in demand. 
For the most part, capital spending is proceeding on schedule, but 
some concern over interest rates was voiced.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An informal survey of 15 of the larger savings and loan associations 
in New York and New Jersey shows that activity in the home mortgage 
markets is far below year-earlier levels. Only two of the 15 S&amp;L's 
report an active market, secured mainly through aggressive 
advertising and pricing campaigns. Most associations indicate that 
many of the customers who apply for mortgages at the average rate of 
15 1/2 percent (plus 2 1/2 to 3 points) on fixed rate mortgages do 
not meet the thrifts income qualifications. While rates are slightly 
lower on flexible rate mortgages, they are not as low as the 14 1/2 
percent rate that one organization cited as the threshold level for 
an active market. Approximately one-half of the S&amp;L's surveyed offer 
both fixed rate and variable rate mortgages; one-fourth offer only 
fixed rates and the remaining one-fourth offer only variable rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several business economists have increased their real GNP growth 
forecasts for 1981 by about a percentage point, to 2 - 2 1/2 
percent. Nonetheless, doubt was expressed that real GNP growth in 
the first quarter was as high as the preliminary estimate of 6 1/2 
percent. For the second quarter, slower or no real growth is 
forecast with gradual improvement to follow. Proposed tax cuts may 
boost consumer sales, but there was concern that continued 
volatility and high levels of interest rates may depress credit 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Comments this month are from James J. O'Leary (United States Trust 
Company of New York), Francis H. Schott (Equitable Life Assurance 
Company), and Albert M. Wojnilower (First Boston Corporation). Their 
views are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      O'Leary: With a clash between forces toward a stronger expansion in 
real output, with continued high inflation, and monetary policy 
aimed at squeezing down the expansion of money supply, both short-
term interest rates and long-term rates are likely to remain very 
high through 1982. The expectation that inflation will remain high, 
and that interest rates will remain high and volatile, is drying up 
the availability of funds for the purchase of long-term, fixed-rate 
bonds and mortgages. Borrowers are thus forced to continue to borrow 
short-term, much of it in the commercial banks, with the effect of 
giving an upward bias to the expansion of the money supply. Should 
interest rates, on average, remain high and credit tight for an 
extended periodâ€”say through 1982â€”there will be a severe crisis
for many thrift institutions and probably for some life insurance 
companies. The need to place greater weight on fiscal restraint to 
help the monetary authorities is great.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: The financial market reaction to the strength of the economy 
and the run-up in the money supply figures is exaggerated and likely 
to be short lived although it is understandable. Borrowers and 
investors alike are uncertain how much additional interest rate 
fluctuation is going to be induced by strict emphasis on monetary 
aggregates. Hence, there is precautionary borrowing, and great 
reluctance to lend in the face of possible further major 
disintermediation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The level of interest rates is excessive relative to business 
conditions and underlying inflation. There will be a correction as 
soon as the money aggregates return to roughly target levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: The current business situation appears flat and slightly 
up. Businessmen, except in the housing and auto industries, are 
virtually unanimous in their optimism about the short and long run 
business outlook. Financial markets are more than ever preoccupied 
with day to day swings in security prices.
