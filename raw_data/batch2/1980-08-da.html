      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Eleventh District continues to expand slowly in 
the current recession. A survey of department stores showed little 
improvement in unit sales, while sales of new cars have picked up 
slightly from their previously very depressed levels. Some pickup in 
speculative residential building is underway, and nonresidential 
construction continues its relatively strong pace. Lending at most 
S&amp;L;'s and commercial banks is showing slight response to declining 
interest rates. Manufacturing output is soft, with some improvement 
in orders from suppliers to the construction industry. Drought 
conditions are having substantial impact on agricultural production 
in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unit sales at department stores throughout most of the District 
remain lackluster, although stores in the Houston and Austin areas 
report increases from last year's levels. Credit sales are 
rebounding from the low level following March 14 but remains a 
smaller proportion of total sales than in the previous year. 
Department stores continue to rely heavily on sales and promotions 
to generate store traffic and move merchandise. Inventory levels are 
generally described as desirable, although a few retailers have 
excess stock where sales have not met projections. The outlook for 
the rest of the year is optimistic, with an aggressive sales push 
planned for the Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales in the District are still as much as 50 percent below 
last year's levels, but a few, dealers are reporting substantially 
increased sales in recent weeks. Foreign auto manufacturers have 
significantly expanded market share in the last year, but domestic 
dealers describe the sales of larger models as currently surpassing 
those of smaller cars. Dealers attribute the improved sales volume 
to the increased availability of funds and the lower interest rates 
on auto loans. Most inventories of new cars are lean, and dealers' 
floorplan costs have eased with recent declines in the prime rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      While residential construction permits are 32 percent below 1979's 
level and many unsold homes remain on the market, recent declines in 
interest rates and improved home sales have led some builders to 
begin limited numbers of speculative starts in Dallas and Houston, 
while such activity appears considerably stronger in San Antonio and 
in the Rio Grande area. Commercial construction activity has offset 
much of the slump in the residential sector. The number of non-
residential projects underway in the Eleventh District has declined 
less than 9 percent from last year's levels. Commercial and 
industrial building activity is strongest in the Dallas-Ft. Worth 
area, as well as in areas where the oil and gas industry is 
important. Nonbuilding construction for highways and utilities shows 
continued strength. Projects formerly shelved are being reconsidered 
as interest rate drops make financing more feasible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for mortgage loans at District savings and loan associations 
remains sluggish, except in Dallas-Ft. Worth, where lending is 
brisk. In the south of the District, mortgage commitments are 9 only 
percent below last year's levels, but much of this strength is due 
to loans for residential construction rather than the purchase of 
homes. Savings inflows are positive at S&amp;L's, with most of the funds 
going into 30 month and jumbo certificates of deposit. With yields 
on money market certificates currently not competitive, 30-month 
CD's are attracting a rising proportion of savings. S&amp;L's are 
reducing the high levels of liquidity recently accumulated by 
repaying advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank as well as 
attempting to increase mortgage lending. In Dallas, rates have moved 
up slightly from 11 5/8 to 12 percent in response to the strength of 
mortgage loan demand. Elsewhere in the District, the outlook is for 
lower rates on mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand at commercial banks remains flat, except for interim 
construction lending to the oil and gas industry. Consumer lending 
continues to be soft and is declining in some areas of the District. 
Consumers are expressing greater interest in auto loans, but many 
are not willing to pay the currently high rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing output in the Eleventh District continues to slump, 
despite a recent rebound in orders from the construction industry. 
Utilization of capacity for most steel manufacturers remains at 
about 50 percent, while producers of aluminum, chemicals, and 
primary nonferrous metals foresee no changes in their currently low 
production levels. Oil refineries are at 75 percent or less of 
capacity, due to substantial inventory buildup in the Gulf. 
Suppliers of construction steel and air conditioning however, report 
a 30 to 50 percent rebound in orders from the low levels at the 
first of the year. Manufacturers of computers and other high-
technology electronic equipment have had sales growth of 30 percent 
over last year's levels, while sales for producers of fabricated 
metals and machinery to the oil and gas industry have grown 25 
percent from 1979. Inventories are lean for most of the District's 
manufacturers. Electrical companies report few problems in meeting 
demands created by the current heat wave.
     </p>
     <p>
      The toll of the unusually hot, dry weather on the District's 
agricultural production is becoming substantial. Feedgrain output 
may be reduced by one-third or more, while livestock herds are being 
trimmed heavily in Southwest Texas to levels that dry grasslands can 
support. The impact on the District's most important crop, cotton, 
is not yet described as serious, although much of the crop is under 
stress and yield potential will decline rapidly if the current 
conditions continue. Approximately one-half of the nation's cotton 
acreage is in the Eleventh District.
