      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Fourth District remains sluggish. Inventory 
  corrections in the steel and chemical industries apparently are 
  nearing completion, but manufacturers stocks of major appliances 
  remain excessive. Among materials producers, only the rubber 
  industry is rebounding strongly and rebuilding stocks. Recovery in 
  capital goods is still not pervasive. Reports from retailers remain 
  cautious. Savings and loan executives expect downward pressure on 
  mortgage interest rates as well as rates paid on deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory adjustments continue to curtail production in the 
  District. An exception is the rubber industry, where production is 
  rising rapidly as an aftermath to the long strike that slashed 
  inventories of tires and of industrial rubber products. An economist 
  with a major tire producer expects capacity operations for 
  conventional tires through the first quarter of 1977, after which 
  inventories are likely to be either adequate or too large. Capacity 
  operations for radial tires are expected for most of 1977. 
  Liquidation of steel inventories is apparently nearing completion, 
  according to economists with major steel producers in the District. 
  Operating rates fell below 70 percent of capacity in recent weeks, 
  but a moderate pickup in steel orders for December and January 
  delivery suggests an end to the 6-month slide in production and 
  shipments. Steel economists reduced their forecasts of domestic 
  steel shipments for 1977 from 105 million tons to about 100 million, 
  compared to an estimated 89 million tons in 1976. Chemical and 
  plastics producers report operations have steadied in recent weeks 
  at about 82 percent of capacity. Inventory correction for some 
  products, including polyvinyl chloride, has apparently ended, and 
  orders for December are higher than for November. Another producer, 
  however, expects some further decrease in stocks in December as 
  users trim stocks for balance sheet and tax valuation purposes. 
  Excess stocks of major appliances held by manufacturers are likely 
  to carry inventory correction in that industry into the first 
  quarter of 1977, according to an economist with a major appliance 
  producer. Its stocks at the end of November were 20 percent higher 
  than planned and 10 percent higher than for the same month a year-ago. The producer commented that without a $10 to $15 billion 
  permanent tax cut and further improvement in new housing starts, the 
  inventory adjustment could carry into the second quarter of 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in capital goods remains selective. Machine tool builders 
  continue to report steady improvement in orders and backlogs, which 
  will be reflected in a sharp improvement in shipments in 1977. 
  Orders for motors have also picked up; and one manufacturer reports 
  a sharp boost in orders for industrial equipment during November, 
  especially for international and defense-oriented business. Its 
  trend in orders has been climbing somewhat faster than suggested in 
  the latest Department of Commerce plant and equipment survey. On the 
  other hand, an official with a construction machinery producer 
  reports irregular improvement in orders for construction machinery, 
  especially hydraulic cranes and excavators. Inventories held by
  dealers are still judged about twice normal size. Business this year 
  will be about 50 percent below its peak in 1973, and a projected 14 
  percent increase for 1977 implies capacity utilization will not be 
  much higher than rates that prevailed in the early 1970's.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from retailers continue mixed. A director associated with a 
  department store chain notes that sales gains over a year earlier 
  continue to narrow and that it may take longer than one quarter to 
  work off excess inventories. Another director associated with 
  houseware products describes business as good and backlogs as 
  rising. November retail sales hold about even with October, 
  according to an economist with a major retailer. He expects 
  aggressive promotional selling during the remainder of the Christmas 
  season if merchants are to realize an expected 10 percent gain from 
  last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Preliminary results of this Bank's latest monthly survey of 
  manufacturers show the highest proportion of respondents reporting 
  price increases since late 1974, with little indication of let-up 
  expected for December. The recent 6 percent increase in flat-rolled 
  steel prices is expected to hold, according to several economists 
  associated with major steel firms. Among reasons for this 
  expectation, they cite the following: flat-rolled steel products are 
  still the best selling products; relative prices of flat-rolled 
  products have not increased as much as other steel products since 
  wage-price decontrols; major users, especially auto producers, have 
  not resisted the increases. Chlorine and chlorine solvent prices 
  were increased December 1 in response to strong demand, but a 
  financial officer with a chemical firm was uncertain if the 
  increases will stick. He indicated that discounting from list prices 
  is most prevalent now than 3 months ago. A major plastics resin 
  producer also reported that transactions prices for its products 
  have weakened in the last 3 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thrift institutions are adopting different strategies in response to 
  continued strong deposit flows and easing in interest rates. Some 
  are concentrating on controlling costs of funds while others seek to 
  stabilize future flow of funds. One S&amp;L raised the minimum on 
  savings certificates from $1,000 to $5,000 and withdrew offering 
  certificates with less than 2-year maturities, which they consider 
  hot money. Another association lowered rates on 1-year certificates 
  to 6 1/4 percent and on 6-year certificates to 7 percent. It 
  discontinued offering certificates of less than one-year maturity 
  and will limit deposits on certificates over $10,000. A third 
  association also lowered rates to a maximum of 7 percent for a 6-year certificate, and reduced its mortgage rate to 8 percent for a 
  29-year loan. None of the associations changed their rates on 
  passbook savings. Officials at these associations took as a sign of 
  further downward pressure on both mortgage rates and rates paid on 
  savings the recent actions of two large Cleveland banks that reduced 
  interest on corporate savings to 4 1/2 percent.
