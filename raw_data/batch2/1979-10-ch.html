      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 10, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Except for housing, motor vehicles, and other sectors directly 
  affected by rising fuel costs, the impact of the economic slowdown 
  has been moderate in the Seventh District. Nevertheless, job markets 
  have eased, and retail sales are sluggish. Some capital goods 
  producers still report rising backlogs, but others note a distinct 
  slackening in demand. Inventories are generally quite adequate, but 
  not burdensome. No significant shortages of materials, components, 
  or services are evident. Availability of skilled workers has 
  improved. Nevertheless, the rate of increase in prices and worker 
  compensation remains about as rapid as earlier this year. The 
  dichotomy between strength in nonresidential construction and
  weakness in housing is increasingly evident. Bumper corn and soybean 
  crops seem assured, but storage and transportation facilities are 
  serious bottlenecks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most informed observers in the district believe that real GNP will 
  decline moderately into the spring of 1980. Business managements 
  have been warned about the impending recession for a year or more, 
  and most have conducted their operations in such a way as to avoid 
  becoming overextended. Double-ordering, rampant in l973-74, has been 
  avoided, and manufacturers have allowed backlogs to build up, rather 
  than schedule additional overtime and use other high-cost 
  expedients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Settlement of the GM-UAW confrontation without a strike was greeted 
  with mixed feelings. Disruptions associated with a major auto 
  industry strike were avoided, but employers were locked into a very 
  expensive three-year contract. Information on the details of the 
  auto pact is still somewhat vague, but it appears that the three-
  year boost in worker compensation will be about 35 percent, assuming 
  an 8 percent rise in the CPI, and more if prices rise even more 
  rapidly. This would raise average total labor cost per production 
  worker from $30,000, currently, to $40,000. Compensation of nonunion 
  employees will rise about in step. This comes at a time of poor 
  sales and heavy layoffs which might have stiffened company 
  bargaining in the pact.
       </p>
       <p>
        The auto pact will set the basic pattern for the farm and 
  construction equipment workers this year, and steel next year. Since 
  October 1, about 55,000 workers have been on strike at Deere and 
  Caterpillar. International Harvester workers have agreed to extend 
  their contract awaiting developments. Layoffs have occurred at 
  plants not on strike because of parts shortages. The issue in the 
  strikes is said to be additional time off and other technicalities, 
  rather than the basic package. In these industries, as in the case 
  of autos and steel, the strongest firms can pay higher compensation 
  at levels that might threaten the viability of weaker competitors. 
  For some months prior to the strike deadline, production of farm and 
  construction equipment had been maintained at higher rates than were 
  justified by current sales so that inventories of finished goods 
  could be increased as a strike hedge.
       </p>
       <p>
        The market for larger cars and light trucks continues very weak with 
  some new models selling so poorly as to require temporary plant 
  closings. The industry's ability to produce more small cars will be 
  quite limited for at least six months. Total auto assemblies are 
  scheduled at 12 percent below last year in October, while truck 
  assemblies will be off 33 percent. Similar year-to-year declines had 
  been reported for the third quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Heavy truck sales will set a record for 1979 as a whole. However, 
  new orders have dropped sharply in recent months, and inventories 
  have increased. Production schedules have been reduced accordingly. 
  The downward phase of the heavy truck "cycle" is expected to 
  continue to mid-1980 with reductions in sales and output of about 30 
  percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel orders have leveled off at a lower rate with virtually all of 
  the decline traceable to motor vehicles and oil country goods. Steel 
  orders for capital goods remain vigorous. Lead times are now "normal" compared to abnormally long periods last spring. An 
  industry analyst expects mill shipments of 23 million tons in the 
  fourth quarter, down from 24.5 in the third quarter and 26.6 in each 
  of the first two quarters. Users are trying to reduce inventories 
  which are not generally excessive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Orders for machine tools and freight cars have slowed substantially, 
  but order backlogs remain very large. Some machine tool producers 
  expect orders from the auto industry to keep their operations at 
  full capacity into the 1980s. Demand for construction equipment, 
  especially types associated with home building and site development, 
  have declined significantly. However, orders for some types of 
  mining equipment, mechanical power transmission units, and 
  industrial cranes have continued to exceed shipments, somewhat to 
  the surprise of the producers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dry weather during September hastened the maturity of district corn 
  and soybean crops which are now safe from frost except for the 
  northern fringe. Harvesting is only slightly behind normal progress, 
  despite late plantings. Apparent settlement of the Rock Island 
  Railroad strike will help move grain which has been piling up. 
  Liquidity pressures are still widespread at rural banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Home construction and sales are off much more sharply in the 
  district than in the nation. Single-family permits in the Chicago 
  area are running 50 percent below last year. Some builders have 
  halted all speculative starts.
