      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 28, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity is 
sluggish at this time, but hold some hope for improvement by mid-year. Manufacturers report no change in overall industrial activity, 
but continue to make small cuts in payrolls and working hours. They 
expect a sharp upturn in the industrial sector to come sometime in 
the first two quarters, though. Local retail merchants report sales 
to be slow in January and expect only slight improvement, at best, 
by July. Credit collections are said to be good. In the financial 
sector, area bankers report mixed loan activity in January as C&amp;I 
loan volume is up but consumer loans are off. Looking ahead to July, 
District bankers expect modest increases in overall loan activity. 
On the residential construction scene, sales are down again this 
month as high mortgage rates have discouraged many buyers. In the 
meantime, contractors and developers are holding the line on new 
groundbreakings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The new year appears to be starting off on a stable note, as area 
manufacturers responding to the January Business Outlook Survey 
indicate no real change from last month in overall industrial 
activity. In terms of specific indicators, both new orders and 
shipments have increased marginally in January, and inventories 
appear to be growing slightly as well. On the employment front, 
however, local manufacturers continue to make small cuts in payrolls 
and working hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead to the next six months, survey respondents remain 
optimistic, anticipating a significant upswing in general industrial 
activity. Over one-half of the survey participants expect new orders 
to grow in the first half of 1981, while a slightly smaller portion 
project increased shipments between now and July. Manufacturers are 
playing a close hand, however, and are planning cautiously. 
Respondents to the survey are projecting no changes in stock levels 
or the average workweek and plan to hold off on new hirings as well. 
Increased expenditures on plant and equipment, however, are 
anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices are up again in January in the industrial sector. Input costs 
are higher for about 65 percent of the survey participants and 
almost 40 percent report charging more for their finished products. 
For the longer term, 9 out of 10 of the responding manufacturers 
expect to be paying higher prices for raw materials by July, while 
about 8 out of 10 plan price hikes for the goods they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Following last month's record Christmas sales, area retailers report 
sales to be sluggish in January compared to year-ago figures. 
According to District retailers, this is pretty much in-line with 
their expectations, though, as most shoppers did their major buying 
last month for the Christmas holiday. Credit card sales are about 
even with last year's levels and collections are very good. Sales of 
soft goods, particularly men's and women's quality sportswear, are 
doing well, while domestic goods such as blankets, towels, and 
sheets are moving more slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area retailers continue to plan cautiously for the next six months, 
expecting sales to run only slightly ahead of year-ago figures, 
owing partially to the lack of strength in consumer disposable 
income. According to local merchants, sales performance in the first 
quarter will set the trend for the first half of 1981. At best, only 
slight improvement is expected by mid-year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers report mixed loan activity in January. C&amp;I; 
loan volume is up 4 to 16 percent over year-ago figures, with some 
banks reporting below-prime lending which has boosted their loan 
volumes to the upper end of this range. Consumer loan activity, 
however, has dropped 5 to 9 percent this month, but some improvement 
is expected by mid-1981. January's loan activity is in-line with 
area banker's expectations, for the most part. Looking ahead to 
July, contacts expect business loans to show a modest increase, 
about 5 percent. Retail loans are expected to grow as well, but at a 
slower rate. District bankers feel that consumers anticipate lower 
rates in the near future, which will "increase their willingness to 
borrow." were not caught in short supply last month 
despite the last minute Christmas rush and, therefore, January 
inventories are in good shape. Area retailers remain cautious and 
plan no changes in stock levels within the next two quarters.
      <p>
       Local bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 20 percent. Loan 
activity should be sluggish over the next six months, they say, 
which will cause the prime to drop between 300 to 575 basis points 
from its current level.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the legalization of NOW accounts effective December 31, 1980, 
area bankers report vacillating deposit flows in January. The rate 
of growth of the accounts is faster than had been anticipated for 
the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Housing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Housing sales in the Third District are down sharply again this 
month compared with year-ago levels. New residential sales are 
reported down 30 to 35 percent from January '80 figures, while 
resales have fallen 25 to 50 percent. Prices are reported to have 
been stable over the last six months because mortgage rates of up to 
15 percent have discouraged many buyers. At the same time, 
contractors and developers are holding off on new groundbreakings 
until interest rates come down. Even then, however, there is some 
speculation that builders may go back to work only if buyers can 
secure a mortgage commitment ahead of time.
