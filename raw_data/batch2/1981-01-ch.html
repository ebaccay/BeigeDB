       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economy of the Seventh District is probably the weakest 
  in the nation, with no improvement in sight. Its dominant durable 
  goods industries, both consumer and capital goods, are operating 
  well below capacity. Some companies, however, report a recent 
  uptrend in orders. While credit is available, high interest rates 
  are severely restricting activity, especially housing and vehicles, 
  but also inventory and capital spending policies generally. Some 
  S&amp;Ls face possible financial crises. Unemployment is high and jobs 
  are hard to find. Retail sales were strong just before and after 
  Christmas, but may have slowed recently. Farmland values rose again 
  in the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Seventh District problems
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District has probably been 
  impacted more severely than any other by the economic problems of 
  the past two years. Industries concentrated here—especially motor 
  vehicles and components, farm equipment, and construction equipment—are in deep trouble with no improvement seen in the months ahead. 
  Instead of counterbalancing a slump in industry, as has happened in 
  the past, the district's farm sector also has been depressed. 
  Economic stringencies, strongly reinforced by outward migration of 
  people and industry, have made the housing situation much worse here 
  than nationally. High and rising energy prices have had a relatively 
  more harmful effect here, mainly because of heating costs. The 
  district has received little benefit from the energy boom or the 
  defense buildup.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets. New unemployment insurance claims remain at high 
  levels throughout the district. Help-wanted lineage in Chicago 
  papers was 40 percent below a year ago in the fourth quarter, and 
  January has been about as bad. Although computer programmers, 
  nurses, and certain other specialties are in short supply, demand 
  for workers, generally, is very weak. Some examples: (1) an 
  erroneous report that a Chicago-area major steel company was hiring 
  attracted several thousand people, who created a dangerous mob 
  scene; (2) an ad for bus drivers in Milwaukee brought a deluge of 
  applicants that overwhelmed interviewers; (3) a trucking company 
  reported a much improved supply of qualified drivers; (4) a bank in 
  a smaller Indiana city reported 60 applicants, two-thirds qualified, 
  for one clerical position paying $7,500. Companies interview many 
  people "overqualified" for available jobs. Quality of entry-level 
  job applicants in the larger cities, however, is deplorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      High interest rates. Record high interest rates clearly are holding 
  back many types of activity. Loans of all types continue to be 
  available to creditworthy borrowers, in contrast to the situation 
  last spring. However, tighter lending criteria turn away increasing 
  numbers of marginal borrowers. More important, interest as a cost 
  has become an overriding consideration for many businesses, and 
  institutions. Car dealers are being forced out by "killing" floor 
  plan rates-22 1/2 percent, recently. High rates have kept 
  inventories abnormally low for many manufacturers, distributors, and 
  retailers. Some smaller manufacturers who had been expanding 
  steadily are deliberately shrinking their operations in order to 
  hold down interest costs. More larger firms are restricting outlays 
  to internally-generated funds. High rates paid for CDs are seriously 
  undermining many S&amp;Ls, some of large size.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Credit problems
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Firms with a "receivables problem" are increasingly 
  widespread. A dramatic stretchout in payments on receivables 
  occurred for some firms in the past year. Partly, this is because of 
  weakened financial positions of customers, but it also reflects a 
  desire to reduce borrowing costs, and, in the case of cash-rich 
  firms, to increase earnings on liquid assets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Backlogs for most types of capital equipment and 
  components appear to be declining, but there are notable exceptions. 
  Farm and construction equipment are especially weak with some plants 
  closed. Railroad equipment is in a steep decline and heavy trucks 
  have softened. In contrast, the oil and gas field is swamped with 
  orders. Heavy castings picked up in December, but output is only 
  about 50 percent of capacity. One diversified capital goods producer 
  reported an uptrend in orders in December, followed by a surprising 
  surge in early January, but the reasons are not clear, and this 
  improvement is not reported by companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Output schedules for cars and trucks are being 
  reduced, and sales estimates for the year have been scaled down. The 
  new slump has affected even the most popular small U.S. and imported 
  cars. The auto industry blames the Federal Reserve for its plight, 
  playing down higher prices. Since consumer loan rates are widely 
  subsidized, the "perception" of high rates is blamed. Dealerships 
  continue to close, and many of the strongest are said to be losing 
  money.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Steel orders have slowed somewhat, with lead times 
  shortening. Some companies say shipments will be relatively good in 
  January and. February, but March is doubtful. However, a leading 
  company is shipping at capacity and expects to continue to do so 
  through March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise and specialty store sales surged 
  just before Christmas, helped by price cuts, and remained at a good 
  level into early January. In recent weeks, however, sales slipped 
  back. Several long-established chains are closing marginal stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transportation. Railroad traffic, except for coal and grain, is 
  depressed. Newly-purchased freight cars are standing idle. Trucking 
  companies are experiencing intense competition under deregulation. 
  Rates are being discounted, and fluctuate daily. Many companies are 
  expected to fold up or merge with stronger firms. Operators facing 
  nonunion competition are expecting aggressive bargaining with the 
  Teamsters in 1982.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home mortgage rates are quoted in the 14 1/2 to l6 
  1/2-percent range, but few customers apply. "Creative financing" takes many forms, for example, one-year rollover mortgages. Housing 
  starts in large district centers were off 70 to 90 percent in 1980 
  from the 1977-78 level, and virtually zero in some smaller towns. 
  The current picture suggests an even bleaker 1981 if rates do not 
  decline soon. Office building construction continues strong in 
  downtown Chicago with important new projects being started.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our farmland survey shows a 4 percent rise in values in 
  the fourth quarter, following a 5 percent rise in the third quarter. 
  Liquidity of rural banks continues to improve. A high proportion of 
  these banks are net sellers of federal funds, in part because of 
  soft demand for loans at current rates.
