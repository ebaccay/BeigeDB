     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 10, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery continues to gain momentum in most of the Southeast. 
Deposits and loans at large financial institutions increased in the 
early summer, and the improved climate is stimulating innovations 
and expansion of services. Manufacturers in housing-related 
industries are operating at substantia1ly increased levels of 
capacity. The resurgence in construction is helping to buoy consumer 
spending as well. However, spokesmen for the construction industry, 
as well as some realtors and manufacturers, are apprehensive that 
recent increases in mortgage rates may curtail the current, brisk 
pace of growth. Strength in the tourist industry remains 
concentrated in Florida and Georgia. Adverse weather presages 
declining crop revenues in the troubled agricultural sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Comments from industry representatives reinforce the strength shown 
by the latest labor market statistics. The southeastern unemployment 
rate in June dropped to single-digit levels for the first time in 
eight months. Respondents indicate that the upturn in housing and 
auto sales has boosted production in the textile industry. Georgia 
mills are now running at about 80 percent of capacity, the highest 
utilization rate in 30 months. For the first time in three years 
some Georgia carpet manufacturers are concerned about production 
keeping pace with demand: a recent uptick in the price of carpet 
yarn suggests acceleration of demand growth. North Georgia carpet 
mills produce about 60 percent of American-made carpets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Southeastern corporations producing timber-related products are 
registering marked increases in activity; they are approaching full 
productive capacity and 95 percent employment levels. However, 
industry contacts are concerned about the possible negative effects 
of the recent rise in mortgage rates. Louisiana's petrochemical 
industry is beginning to experience a general increase in orders, 
but firms are not yet recalling workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending is maintaining the strong performance reported 
earlier this summer. June taxable sales in the District rose 12.8 
percent from 1982 level. Increases of over 20 percent in Florida and 
Georgia outweighed decreases in Louisiana and Tennessee. Some 
retailers report increases in June of up to 40 percent over their 
1982 levels. Most merchants polled expect sales figures for July to 
be lower than in June, but they confidently anticipate back-to-
school sales in August will prove strong. June was the best month 
yet in 1983 for new motor vehicle sales in the Southeast. Georgia 
led the District in sales. Not only durables and home furnishings 
but also apparel and personal luxury items are moving well in most 
localities. Merchants expect these increases to continue as the
improved housing market and heightened consumer optimism stimulate 
new purchases. Retailers report little effect from the July 1 tax 
cut except that it augmented consumer confidence. A number of 
retailers point to the increased use of credit as an indicator of 
growing consumer confidence in the economic recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A month-long increase in mortgage rates during July has raised fears 
that the pace of recovery in the housing industry may decelerate. As 
of August 1, FHA/VA interest rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages 
increased by a full percentage point to 13.5 percent. Because FHA/VA 
mortgage rates are determined at closing, some home buyers will not 
be able to close loans for which they applied up to nine to twelve 
weeks ago when rates were 11.3 to 12.5 percent. The industry's near-term outlook for mortgage rates is mixed. Some lenders feel that 
rates are now plateauing and will decline later in the year, but 
others believe that federal deficits will continue to compete for 
funds and will keep mortgage rates high. Although the rise in 
mortgage rates should reduce required discount points, the higher 
rates will raise minimum income levels required to qualify for loans 
and thereby eliminate some buyers. Realtors expect the rise in 
FHA/VA rates to reduce sales by 5 to 8 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to real estate agents polled, residential sales remained 
vigorous through July although sales were not quite as strong as in 
May and June. Building permit activity continued an upward trend 
through June. Single-family permits in the District rose by 2.2 
percent. Contacts indicate that building permits were holding up 
well through July. In some areas single-family permits issued were 
running 50 percent ahead of year-to-date figures for last year. The 
commercial real estate sector is finally gathering some momentum. 
Leasing companies report that office vacancy rates are dropping 
throughout the Southeast They attribute this increased activity to a 
"recovery psychology." Reportedly, many managers believe the
recession is over and are leasing new offices before increased 
demand begins to put upward pressure on leasing prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Both thrifts and commercial banks added to their deposit bases in 
June. With the exception of business loans, which backed off 
slightly from their May levels, loan demand at large District banks 
continued strong in June. Southeastern bank earnings, at several 
Florida institutions in particular, improved in the first half of 
1983 because of the declining cost of funds and growing loan 
activity. The improved business climate seems to be encouraging 
regional banks to introduce innovations and expansion of services, 
such as discount securities brokerages and statewide automated 
teller networks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The travel industry is faring best in Florida and Georgia. 
Conditions have changed little since June except for an apparent 
slowing of the "boom" in central Florida. Although the most popular 
attraction is doing well, its margin of growth relative to last year 
is less now than in the winter and spring, and occupancy rates at 
central Florida hotels have dipped somewhat from near capacity 
levels earlier this year. Other attractions, particularly in south 
Florida, report that attendance is flat or off from 1982 levels. 
Miami's cruise ship industry is suffering from overbuilding and 
price cutting; some lines are offering 50 percent discounts on 
fares. However, expansion and refurbishing continue in anticipation 
of continuing growth in certain younger markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pass-through traffic into Florida is contributing to the strong 
performance of Georgia's tourism industry. The Georgia Hotel/Motel 
Association reports that hotel occupancy along interstate routes is 
quite healthy. Convention business in Atlanta's central business 
districts has been off 10 percent during the first six months; 
however, this drop-off may be more a lagged effect of earlier crime 
problems than of recent economic trends. Overall attendance at 
Georgia attractions is, more than, 18 percent over last June. In 
other southeastern states, summer tourist business has been off. 
June 1odgings tax receipts in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee 
were below year-ago levels. Attendance at a number of Tennessee 
attractions also is below last year's levels, and at some it is 
below even 1981 levels. Travelers to Tennessee's largely middle-income tourist market are reportedly quite cost-conscious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent hot and dry weather throughout most of the Sixth District is 
having a severe impact on crops, especially corn, soybeans and 
cotton. Soybeans face the greatest potential loss because plantings 
occurred later than usual, and crops lacked sufficient maturity to 
withstand prolonged dry conditions. Weather seems to have had the 
least effect on corn in southernmost parts of the District because 
crops there are near maturity. Reliable estimates of yield losses 
are not yet available, but preliminary figures suggest a decline of 
up to 10 percent on average and a concomitant 15-25 percent drop in 
net farm revenue. Reduced acreage, unfavorable weather conditions, 
and plant diseases augur a near 40 percent reduction in revenue for 
the District's 1983 tobacco crop.
