      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 6, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Tenth District continues to grow 
moderately. and price increases are expected to be relatively small 
for the rest of the year. Inventories of input materials are 
satisfactory but retail inventories are somewhat high. No major 
inventory adjustments are anticipated, however. Higher interest 
rates are restraining mortgage commitments, as well as housing 
starts and sales. Automobile dealers are also concerned about the 
impact of rising rates on new car sales. Loan demand has increased 
somewhat at commercial banks, in spite of increases in the prime 
rate and in consumer loan rates. The district wheat crop was 
generally good, and fall-harvested crops are also in good condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that year-to-date sales are slightly ahead of a 
year ago, but results for the last three months are mixed. Sales of 
home furnishings and mens and women's apparel have been particularly 
strong. Inventories are generally reported to be somewhat high, but 
little adjustment is anticipated in the near future. Clearance sales 
are occurring on schedule. Retail prices have remained approximately 
constant during the last three months and are not expected to change 
significantly before the first of the year. Expectations of sales 
for the remainder of the year are mixed, but no large changes from 
current rates are predicted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District continue to report 
improved sales in 1984 relative to 1983. Credit market conditions 
are satisfactory and financing is available for both floorplanning 
and customer purchases. Host dealers express concern over rising 
interest rates, indicating that further rate increases would 
restrict sales. Attempts to expand inventories have been frustrated 
by a lack of availability, with highly demanded models in short 
supply. Dealers anticipate strong sales for the balance of 1964.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Over half of the purchasing agents contacted report input price 
increases over the past year ranging from 1 to 8 percent. Increases 
were concentrated in the second quarter of this year. Expectations 
of price movements for the remainder of 1984 vary by industry, with 
stable or falling prices expected by several soft goods producers. 
Some respondents report difficulties in getting materials because of 
strikes at suppliers and heavy demands placed on suppliers by the 
automobile industry. Most respondents are satisfied with their 
materials inventory levels, having slightly trimmed or maintained 
these inventories recently. Most intend to maintain or slightly trim 
inventories the rest of the year. None of the respondents report 
bottlenecks in skilled labor or plant capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders in the Tenth District report mixed results when housing 
starts in the first half of 1984 are compared to year-ago levels. 
Starts of multi-family units are generally up, while starts of 
single family units vary across the district. Higher interest rates 
have slowed housing starts since early June and are expected to 
continue to do so through the remainder of the year. Sales of new 
homes are down from last year, with prices holding steady to 
slightly higher. Inventories of unsold homes vary considerably 
across the district. Building materials are in good supply at 
generally steady prices. Savings inflows at savings and loan 
associations are unchanged to slightly higher than a year ago, and 
are expected to remain steady throughout 1984. Mortgage demand has 
declined due to higher interest rates and is expected to soften 
further for the rest of the year. Fewer mortgage commitments are 
being made. Mortgage rates are expected to rise somewhat more in 
1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand was moderately higher than last month at most Tenth 
District banks. At all of the banks surveyed, commercial and 
industrial loans and consumer loans were either flat or up slightly, 
while agriculture loans were either flat or down slightly. 
Residential and commercial real estate lending was considerably more 
variable, rising sharply at some respondents but falling or 
remaining unchanged at others. Total deposits were higher than last 
month at a narrow majority of the respondents. Most of the increases 
were in conventional NOW's, Super NOW's, and MMDA's, but some 
respondents reported weakness in these categories. The prime rate 
was 13 percent at most of the banks surveyed, up a half point over 
the previous month. Consumer lending rates were slightly higher at 
about half of the respondent banks and unchanged at the other half. 
Several respondents expect to raise their consumer lending rates in 
the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The wheat crop in the Tenth District is generally good this year. 
Most wheat has been harvested, though rain has delayed cutting in 
Colorado. New Mexico and parts of Colorado report excellent crops, 
but production is lower than normal in Nebraska and dry conditions 
lowered production in parts of Oklahoma. Some farmers have sold 
enough wheat to cover immediate expenses, but are holding the rest 
of the crop. Producers are selling more wheat in Oklahoma, Missouri, 
and Nebraska than in other district states. Although some producers 
are actively selling harvested crops forward, there is not much use 
of forward selling or futures. The district's corn and milo crops 
are in generally good condition, though slightly behind in 
development. There are reports of localized hail damage, some of it
heavy. The soybean crop is also in good condition but it, too, lags 
normal development. Moisture conditions are good to excellent in New 
Mexico, Colorado, and parts of Nebraska. The rest of the district 
reports dry conditions and some concern about the lack of rain. At 
the same time, land that was flooded earlier this spring did not dry 
out enough to be replanted, except in isolated higher areas.
