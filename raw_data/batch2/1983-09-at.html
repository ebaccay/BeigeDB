      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of recovery in the Southeast is showing signs of slowing, 
but most sectors continue to expand. Consumer spending remains 
strong although unseasonably hot weather resulted in lower-than-anticipated back-to-school clothing sales. Industrial employment and 
orders are generally rising, but some reversals appear imminent 
especially in the forest products industry. Higher mortgage rates 
have reduced sales of new homes from levels attained earlier this 
summer. In the financial sector deposit and loan growth is weaker 
than in June. The surge in central Florida tourism shows further 
indication of ebbing. Drought-induced crop shortages are likely to 
increase food prices and lower revenues for crop and livestock 
farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment has been expanding, but some setbacks seem likely. Tire 
and automotive glass manufacturers report markedly increased 
activity. At least one large tire plant is operating seven days a 
week. Major government contracts for defense and the space shuttle 
will soon create new jobs in Alabama and Louisiana, respectively. In 
contrast, representatives of the forest products industry indicate 
that the jump in interest rates has diminished orders for and 
production of lumber. Building material inventories are increasing 
beyond desired levels. Moreover, reduced demand for coal has 
prompted layoffs in Alabama's mines. Contacts at industrial 
development agencies remark that recent capital expansion plans are 
designed more to improve productivity and efficiency than to meet 
additional demand. For example, many petrochemical firms in 
Louisiana are planning cogeneration projects that would produce 
electricity from wasted heat, thereby reducing fuel requirements by 
10 to 13 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that consumer spending in August and September 
continued to exceed 1982 levels. Southeastern taxable sales rose 7.0 
percent in July over 1982 levels. Florida's 21.0 percent increase 
offset a 28.1 percent decrease in Mississippi and a smaller decline 
in Louisiana. New car sales are well ahead of the depressed levels 
of August 1982. Home entertainment and personal computer items 
continue selling well. Sales of fall clothing are strong but less 
vigorous than anticipated by merchants. Nearly all of those polled 
had stocked back-to-school inventories earlier and on a larger scale 
than last year. However, sparked by the prolonged heat spell, 
purchases of summer clearance items accounted for an unusually large 
portion of consumer expenditures during the back-to-school season. 
Notwithstanding less-than-expected sales of fall apparel, most 
retailers plan to maintain higher inventories in anticipation of a 
good fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After three months of rising mortgage rates, housing sales fell 
during August and early September and have yet to revive even though 
the FHA/VA mortgage rate fell 50 basis points to 13 percent as of 
August 22. Miami and north metro-Atlanta realtors report little 
change from the strong sales activity earlier this summer, whereas 
Birmingham, New Orleans, Macon, Knoxville, and Chattanooga have 
experienced significant drops in single-family housing sales. In 
areas of Birmingham, sales fell by 30 to 40 percent. However, 
lenders generally believe early September mortgage rates will hold 
steady through autumn, and realtors expect improved sales in the 
fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate, especially suburban office space and 
shopping center developments, continues to improve in spite of the 
recent rise in interest rates. Markets in most central business 
districts. including Atlanta's, are also tightening. However, gluts 
in office space continue in Orlando and New Orleans. Because of 
expected ongoing improvement in the economy, industry contacts 
foresee a spurt of commercial construction contracts throughout the 
region within the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Deposits at thrifts and large banks continued the slow growth of 
July into August, according to preliminary, unadjusted data. S&amp;L
money market deposit accounts have been declining since spring, 
whereas two other interest sensitive categories-jumbo savings 
accounts and six-month money market certificates-have shown 
strength. The savings gains by southeastern S&amp;Ls are attributable to 
larger investors who can afford the minimum deposits required to 
open these accounts, not to smaller savers whom the S&amp;Ls have taken 
pains to attract. Loan activity, particularly business lending, grew 
more slowly in August than in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regional bank executives have proposed the creation of a 
southeastern banking zone, whereby southeastern state banking laws 
would allow mergers and acquisitions only by financial institutions 
headquartered in the region. This arrangement would allow 
southeastern financial institutions to consolidate their competitive 
positions before large-scale interstate banking becomes a reality. 
Several major, money center banks recently applied to Florida 
banking authorities to establish industrial savings banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The boom in central Florida tourism shows further signs of slowing 
since earlier this summer. The number of visitors registering at 
Florida Welcome Centers in August declined slightly from 1982 
levels, whereas the margin of growth in the previous three months 
had ranged from 12 to 17 percent. Lodging receipts are up statewide, 
but occupancy in many areas is even with or below last summer's 
levels. The addition of 850 rooms in the next six months should 
cause further softening in the Miami market, where established 
hotels are sharply discounting room rates to boost occupancy enough 
to cover fixed costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist trade appears strong in Alabama and Georgia, where late 
summer attraction attendance, lodgings tax receipts, and visitor 
center registrations rose above year-ago levels. Georgia's tourism 
industry representatives attribute much of this year-over-year 
improvement to an increase in auto travel relative to air travel as 
a consequence of cutbacks in discount airfares. Prospects for the 
1984 World's Fair in New Orleans improved in the late summer: a 
number of exhibitors firmed commitments, and several auto and bus 
associations purchased a total of 500,000 Fair tickets. However, 
Fair construction is hampering access to New Orleans' tourist 
district and thereby exacerbating already depressed conditions in 
that sector of the local economy. Mississippi tourism spokesmen 
blame the rather lackluster level of business this summer on the 
Fair, which, they say, is causing travelers to defer trips to 
Mississippi until next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The first widespread rainfall in weeks relieved the drought across 
the eastern portion of the region during the Labor Day weekend. 
Although rains arrived too late to reverse the damage to most crops; 
late-planted soybeans and pasture grasses should achieve additional 
growth. Louisiana and Georgia experienced less crop damage than 
Mississippi and Tennessee. Corn in southern Georgia achieved 
acceptable yields, whereas north Georgia corn was extensively 
damaged. Prospects of sharply reduced supplies have caused 
substantial increases in soybean and corn prices. By early September 
average prices of both important livestock feed commodities had 
increased about 65 percent from year-ago levels. Facing severe 
losses, livestock farmers have hastened animals to market. Calf 
prices, having declined 14 percent since June, are well below 
last year's levels. Reductions in poultry and egg output, partially 
a result of heat stress and death losses, have already produced 
substantial retail price increases for these food items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Georgia and South Carolina growers, who lost much of their crop to a 
late spring freeze. will now find it difficult to sell their 
smaller, drought-stricken apples in the retail market and will have 
to divert such fruit to lower revenue outlets, such as processing or 
juice.
