       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic activity remains very weak. The 
expected, or hoped for, spring upturn has not developed. At best the 
decline is leveling off, but further softening is evident in 
producer goods. There is no evidence that a significant pickup will 
occur soon. Consumers are very cautious. Deepening financial 
problems are causing corporate executives to push austerity 
programs. Purchasing managers reported continuing declines in 
output, employment, inventories, and orders in April, but the rate 
of decline apparently moderated. Inventories are said to be low, but 
are being reduced further. Price cutting is widespread. The high 
value of the dollar is aiding foreign competitors. Construction 
activity probably will set a postwar low this year. Farmers are 
encouraged by the rise in livestock prices, but income prospects, 
overall, remain poor and farmland values have been declining since 
last fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       A Dismal Profile
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region of the Seventh District has been in a 
depressed state for three years. In March, total payroll employment 
in the five-state area was 7 percent below March 1979. Nationally, 
despite the recent decline, it was still up 2 percent. Manufacturing 
employment was down 19 percent in the district, compared to a 
decline of 8 percent for the nation. The situation appears to have 
worsened somewhat since March—with further layoffs in a wide 
variety of activities. Weakness is pervasive, not only in 
manufacturing, but in construction, transportation, trade, 
agriculture, and state and local government. Michigan has the most 
serious employment problem, but all district states compare 
unfavorably with the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Austerity Programs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With hopes fading for an early recovery, many 
individuals, businesses, farmers, and state and local governments 
are retrenching on new outlays and commitments. Businesses are 
cutting staff, reducing compensation (when possible), paring 
inventories, and postponing or canceling capital expenditure 
projects. Less essential outlays on travel, public relations, market 
research, advertising and sales promotion are under very close 
scrutiny. Under the circumstances, the danger of a cumulative 
downturn is greater than at any time since World War II.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Bankruptcies and Closings
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial stress is reflected in a wave 
of bankruptcies and closings of factories and retail establishments. 
Chapter 11 filings have shot up. In one jurisdiction there were more 
Chapter 11 cases in March than in all of 1981. Bankruptcies of 
smaller manufacturers, retailers, truckers, real estate companies, 
and farm-related enterprises are most frequent. Some larger firms, 
technically insolvent, are operating under special arrangements with 
creditors or are being kept afloat by parent companies. Many stores 
have been closed either because of bankruptcy or unprofitable 
results. Permanent plant closings are also frequent, especially 
manufacturers who have lost supplier contracts with OEM's. One 
result of shutdowns is the large volume of forced sales of 
relatively new vehicles and other equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A dramatic shift in the inflation picture has occurred 
since the start of the year. Price discounting is more common that 
at any time since the 1930's, and is especially prevalent in steel, 
nonferrous metals, building materials, paper, and transportation—rail, truck, and air. Many observers believe that discounted prices 
will surge once sales improve. The drop in petroleum prices is 
believed to have ended. Prices of medical and utility services, and 
many manufactured goods, continue to rise at a rapid pace. 
Nevertheless, assumptions on the long-term inflation rate have been 
scaled back from 10 percent to 8 percent or less.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Layoffs, either temporary, indefinite, or permanent 
continue not only in manufacturing but also in trade, 
transportation, real estate, and finance—particularly S&amp;L's. 
Facilities of state employment offices are hard pressed. Many 
workers are exhausting unemployment benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Concessions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Negotiations for concessions on labor contracts 
continue. In the main, these agreements have merely slowed increases 
in total compensation. Some new labor agreements call for first-year 
wage boosts in the 8-10 percent range, even in depressed industries. 
The auto industry seems to have reconciled itself to high domestic 
labor costs, now $21 per hour, with a view to substantially 
increasing foreign sourcing of major components, including engines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor Vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small truck sales rose sharply in the first quarter, 
partly reflecting a favorable reception for new domestic compact 
trucks. Demand for heavy trucks remains very weak. Total car sales 
slipped back in April after major rebate programs expired. 
Nevertheless, output of cars will rise substantially in the second 
quarter because inventories were reduced in the first quarter. Truck 
output is above last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Expenditures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for producer durables continues to 
deteriorate. Various manufacturers report orders off 30 to 60 
percent from last year's mediocre levels, with backlogs 
"evaporating". Support for "safe harbor" leasing is very strong. 
Among the weakest lines are equipment for railroads, trucklines, 
construction, and agriculture. Machine tools and oil and gas field 
items are declining rapidly. The largest locomotive plant, scheduled 
to close, will remain open due to orders booked recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for steel has been much weaker than expected, 
especially for heavy products. Estimates for 1982 shipments have 
been reduced further. Some facilities are being closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State and Local Governments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Virtually all state and local governments are seeking to prevent or reduce large prospective 
budget deficits. Efforts to reduce employee compensation, or 
moderate increases, are meeting strong union opposition. Various 
programs are being scaled down and facilities are being closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales and residential construction remain at a 
very low ebb. Housing permits in the Chicago area were under 800 in 
the first quarter, compared to 2,300 a year ago, and over 7,000 in 
the first quarter of 1978. Creative financing is helping to move 
some existing properties but is not boosting new construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although the district agricultural picture remains 
bleak, livestock producers are enjoying modest profits due to higher 
prices and low feed costs. Capital expenditures by farmers remain 
weak overall, especially for machinery, but orders for grain storage 
facilities have improved recently. Our latest quarterly survey of 
agricultural banks shows district land values down 4.5 percent since 
the beginning of the year, and down 7.5 percent since last 
September. The number of real estate transactions is down and 
foreclosures and forced sales account for a small, but much higher-than-normal, share of the total. Field work, after a somewhat late 
start, has progressed rapidly.
