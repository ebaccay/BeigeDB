      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 16, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from business leaders throughout the Second District 
suggested that the region's economy has stopped declining though 
concrete signs of an upturn remained limited. Retail sales exhibited 
some sluggishness at the beginning of October but improved modestly 
in recent weeks. Although residential building was still at 
depressed levels, builders have turned more optimistic. 
Nonresidential construction activity continued strong. In 
manufacturing, further layoffs occurred but at a greatly reduced 
rate. Even with some emerging signs of stabilization in the 
District's economy, few of our business leaders foresaw an immediate 
upturn. Concern over the future course of interest rates was voiced 
by a wide range of our contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity was sluggish at some stores at the beginning of 
October but improved modestly in more recent weeks. For the month as 
a whole sales generally ran above the year-earlier pace. 
Nevertheless sales volume did not meet expectations of some 
merchants. However, national retailers again reported that sales 
tended to be better in the Eastern region than elsewhere around the 
nation. Basic apparel and fashion goods were mentioned as strong 
items and one store noted a pickup in home furnishings. Inventories 
were generally in line for the holiday season, but a few merchants 
reported some excess, but not worrisome, accumulation. Most 
retailers expected sales to hold up for the remainder of the year, 
but only with continued heavy promotional activity and aggressive 
pricing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For the first time in several months, the residential construction 
market showed some signs of life. While actual starts and sales of 
new homes remained slow in many areas of the District, builders were 
generally more optimistic than they had been earlier. Real estate 
people noted a decided pickup in buyer inquiries which they 
attributed in part to the decline in mortgage rates. The continued 
high level of interest rates on construction loans, however, 
dampened builder enthusiasm for initiating new projects. Home prices 
in the region remained steady with sellers still offering 
concessions such as buy-downs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity continued strong as a result of 
projects currently underway, but announcements of major new projects 
were still scarce. Nevertheless, respondents felt that an upturn was 
closer at hand. Even though the office market in the suburbs 
remained soft, Manhattan experienced a small but definite increase 
in leasing activity, the first such increase in over six months. 
Moreover, office rents have stopped slipping and the amount of 
vacant space did not increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from business leaders throughout the District reinforced the 
view that the region's economy may have hit bottom. Although layoffs 
continued, they occurred at a much reduced rate. Business activity 
for many defense contractors, high technology manufacturers, and 
finance and other service companies held strong. Unemployment rates 
in the region remained below the national rate, rising less rapidly 
here than nationwide since the beginning of the year. Initial claims 
for unemployment insurance have basically held steady, in contrast 
to the recent sharp upturn at the national level. Many of our 
respondents had previously expressed fears that the current 
recession would eventually trigger a repeat of the greater-than-
national decline of the District's economy as occurred in the early 
seventies. They now, however, feel more confident of the ability of 
the region to ride out the recession without a major collapse. Some 
areas of the region, including New York City, have even weathered 
the recession thus far without experiencing any year-over-year drop 
in employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While the local economy appears to have stopped declining, few of 
our respondents saw signs of an immediate upturn. Indeed some 
respondents feared that the national economy had not permanently 
bottomed out but had merely paused before resuming its downward 
slide. Uncertainty over the outlook grew from concerns that 1) the 
large deficits projected for all levels of government would bring 
back high interest rates; 2) the recession would continue at the 
national level and begin to permeate the nonmanufacturing sector; 
and 3) increases in the number of workers exhausting their 
unemployment benefits would dampen consumer spending. Skepticism as 
to the likelihood of any quick rebound was reinforced by a New York 
State Department of Labor official who found no strengthening in the 
average number of hours worked per week, normally a precursor of any 
improvement in the economy. Nevertheless, manufacturing inventories 
remained lean and companies appeared ready to step up production in 
response to any strengthening in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Irving Auerbach (Aubrey Lanston) 
and John Olcay (New York representative of London's W. Creenwell): 
Their views of course are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auerbach: Saw no prospects for a significant recovery unless 
interest rates fall much further. Even if that should happen soon, 
the impetus to greater output would not take effect before the 
second quarter of next year. So it is unlikely that 1983 will turn 
out to be strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Olcay: Echoed similar thoughts. An immediate cut in short-term 
interest rates of about 2 percentage points is both warranted and 
necessary for any recovery to begin. The risks in terms of 
inflationary expectations are minimal, because the European 
economies are very weak and will not snap back until a U.S. recovery 
is well underway (by which time the Federal Reserve can again safely 
target Ml). So commodity markets will not tighten. Olcay put 
particular emphasis on the dollar's strength, which has severely 
eroded U.S. export competitiveness. It means that the domestic 
economy will have to grow by 1-2 percent just to keep overall GNP 
level.
