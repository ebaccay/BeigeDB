      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists have scaled down their forecasts of economic 
activity for 1982. Unemployment rates in the Fourth District are 
higher than the national rate and more layoffs are expected. 
Manufacturers report little sign of recovery in orders and sales, 
although declines appear to have bottomed, except in capital goods. 
Inventory liquidation probably is complete in consumer goods and 
some industrial products but further liquidation is expected in 
primary metals and capital goods. Little recovery in housing is 
expected. A variety of financial strains are reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economists who attended the Fourth District Roundtable 
Meeting on June 11 at this Bank scaled down their forecasts of 
economic activity for 1982 from their March forecasts. The median of 
29 forecasts now shows a 0.5% annual rate of increase in real GNP in 
the second quarter, 3.5% in the third quarter, and 3.3% in the 
fourth quarter. Twelve of 29 forecasts show declines in the second 
quarter, while none expects a negative third or fourth quarter. The 
median forecast shows the implicit price deflator accelerating from 
a rate of 5.0% in the second quarter to 6.4% in the third quarter 
and 6.7% in the fourth quarter, and the unemployment rate gradually 
receding from a peak at 9.5% in the second to 8.6% in fourth
quarter. They expect fourth quarter 1982 to fourth quarter 1983 
increases of 3.7% in real GNP and 6.4% in the implicit price 
deflator.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets in the District remain weak, and 
unemployment rates are generally much higher than the national rate 
despite a decline in May. Most of the major metropolitan centers in 
the District have double-digit rates of unemployment. The Cleveland 
Press, an afternoon daily, failed in June idling 900 workers. Our 
latest monthly survey of manufacturers suggests employment will 
decline again in June, particularly in the District's steel industry 
where the drop in orders has resulted in the banking of numerous 
blast furnaces in Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
     </p>
     &lt;&gt;
     <strong>
      &gt;Manufacturing Activity
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A variety of manufacturers in the District 
report little sign of recovery in orders and sales, although the 
declines appear to have bottomed except for the typically lagging 
capital goods industries. Producers of personal safety equipment for 
industrial uses, basic chemicals and reinforcement fiber glass 
report orders and sales have flattened in recent months but no 
improvement has yet occurred. Sales of residential glass are flat to 
down a little but sales of commercial building glass continue 
strong. Coatings and glass sales to the automotive industry 
apparently bottomed in April, but sales of house paint continued to 
decline in May. A producer of corrugated boxes (sales of which 
apparently closely parallel industrial production) reports a small 
sales increase in May over April, and a petroleum refiner reports 
gasoline sales in May were the best in the last two years. Capital 
goods producers generally report further deterioration in orders and 
shipments. Orders for bearings from the construction, agricultural 
and railroad equipment industries weakened further in May, and a 
producer of electrical capital goods reports that their orders 
deteriorated in June. A producer of pneumatic and hydraulic parts 
reports orders from industrial machinery manufacturers have dropped 
severely recently. Machine tool orders remain very weak, even for 
robotic equipment, and no turnaround is expected until well after an 
economic recovery because of weakened balance sheets and cash flows 
of capital intensive industries.
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Inventories
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most respondents in the District report that inventory 
liquidation of consumer goods and select products in industrial 
markets has probably run its course but further liquidation remains 
in primary metals and capital goods. A producer of major home 
appliances has cut inventories "below the bare minimum" and could 
not respond quickly to an upturn in orders. A diversified producer 
of industrial materials reports that their inventories have been 
reduced from a 5 to 6 month supply to 30 days and are down "as far 
as they can go." Dealer inventories of tires for agricultural 
implements are also reported to be extremely low. Crude oil 
inventories are expected to decline more in the second quarter than 
in the first, according to a petroleum economist. Refined product 
inventories are expected to grow in the third quarter. An auto 
manufacturer reports their inventory reduction in the second quarter 
was much less than in the first. There are still some inventories 
that are high. A pneumatic and hydraulic parts producer reports 
inventories of construction and agricultural machinery and some non-
electrical machinery are high. Steel producers expect inventory 
liquidation again in the third quarter, although not as severe as in 
the second quarter. One expects no improvement in steel production 
until the fourth quarter, which should be the best of the year as 
users begin to rebuild inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Housing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Neither lenders nor suppliers to the housing industry 
expect much of a recovery in housing, at least in the near term. A 
producer of major home appliances forecasts little recovery in house 
construction in 1982-1983 as an increase in the number of units is 
offset by reductions in house size. A housing industry economist 
projects a weak recovery in housing because mortgage rates are not 
expected to fall much, consumer income is constrained by the 
sluggish economic recovery, and savings institutions are weak. He 
reports there is not yet any pickup in S&amp;L loan commitments in this 
region. House sale closings are at one-third the level of 1978, 
delinquencies are up sharply in the last 18 months, and foreclosures 
are also rising.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Conditions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Bank officials in Cleveland and Pittsburgh 
report business loans are still strong, although banks in some 
smaller metropolitan centers report all kinds of loans, business and 
consumer, are weak. One banker reports delinquencies on consumer 
loans have not yet been a problem despite widespread layoffs in his 
area, but another predicts mortgage foreclosures and bankruptcies 
will increase unless economic conditions improve next half.
      </p>
      <p>
       A variety of financial strains are reported. A major public 
accounting firm reports that many client firms are in severe 
financial difficulty. One auto producer reports that their credit 
company is not encouraging new business and has been advising 
dealers to seek credit from local banks. Another reports that an 
estimated one-third of the new car market is unattractive to lenders 
because of usury law limits on interest rates. He estimates that the 
prime rate would have to fall to 12% for new car financing to be 
attractive to lenders in all 50 states. Thrifts in the District are 
preoccupied with their continued deterioration in net worth and are 
concentrating on merger plans rather than making mortgage loans, 
according to an economist in this District. Thrifts generally report 
very little loan activity.
