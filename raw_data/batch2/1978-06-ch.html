      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Concern over accelerating inflation is uppermost in the minds of 
  many businessmen, lenders, and consumers. Some analysts are 
  apprehensive that imbalances associated with the payments deficit, 
  sharply rising prices, higher interest rates, and reduced 
  availability of funds will slow or reverse the economic expansion 
  early in 1979. Tighter mortgage credit has already had an impact on 
  residential construction, but nonresidential construction is showing 
  new strength. Demand for capital goods is generally vigorous. Job 
  markets are very strong. Consumers are spending freely. Farmers have 
  made rapid progress with plantings after a late start.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any assessment of the impact of the 6-month "T-rate" certificates, 
  permitted since June 1, must still be tentative. Institutions 
  offering these instruments are paying maximum rates. Promotions have 
  been aggressive in Chicago, Indianapolis, and Des Moines, variable 
  in Detroit, but nonexistent in Milwaukee. In general, the largest 
  banks and S&amp;Ls have taken the lead. Reports from Chicago and Detroit 
  indicate that response, so far, has been less than expected, with a 
  large share, perhaps 60-90 percent, of the funds transferred from 
  existing deposits. Bankers describe the movement as "defensive," i.e., helping to prevent deposit outflows. Many fear that 
  competition for T-rate CDs will raise costs without commensurate 
  benefits in terms of deposits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Uneasiness over the duration of the expansion is not supported by 
  new signs of weakness in demand. Purchasing managers in Chicago and 
  Milwaukee report output, employment, orders, backlogs, and 
  inventories rising faster than a few months ago. Recent readings on 
  some data are the strongest since 1973 or l974.
       </p>
       <p>
        Price increases in wholesale markets appear to be averaging over 7 
  percent on an annual rate basis. A wide variety of commodities and 
  services are involved—steel, aluminum, castings, leather, glass, 
  packaging materials, chemicals, and fasteners are mentioned. Not all 
  announced price increases are holding up, at least not in full. 
  Order lead times are lengthening, but there are very few serious 
  shortages. Placing customers on allocation, widespread in 1973-74, 
  is unusual in today's markets, except for building materials. 
  Problems in obtaining a variety of building materials are likely to 
  ease later in the year, if housing starts decline as expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Limited availability of skilled workers is a frequent complaint. All 
  metalworking trades and clerical workers, such as secretaries and 
  typists, are mentioned most frequently. Help-wanted advertising is 
  very heavy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another problem area is transportation. Movement of goods in and out 
  of plants is hampered by availability of freight ears, locomotives, 
  and highway transport. Orders for new freight cars, locomotives, and 
  other railroad equipment are causing a buildup of backlogs. 
  Forecasts of sales of heavy trucks for 1978 have been raised again 
  recently, and the year may set a record. Some railroad car builders 
  have converted plants to produce hopper cars, auto transports, and 
  lumber flat cars.
       </p>
       <p>
        All fuels are in adequate supply. Various natural gas utilities are 
  adding commercial and industrial customers again, after a lapse of 
  several years. A prominent petroleum analyst is greatly disturbed by 
  reports that the DOE is seriously considering use of quotas to cut 
  imports of oil by two million barrels per day. Even a cut of one 
  million barrels (less than 5 percent of total supply) would soon 
  cause "utter chaos." Apparent surpluses of oil products are really 
  quite thin.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Chicago area, new permits for both homes and apartments were 
  well below year ago in April. As a result, the four month total also 
  was down. This trend is expected to continue. The rate on standard 
  conventional mortgages is now close to 10 percent in the Chicago 
  area, plus two or three points. Higher rates alone do not seem to 
  deter inflation-conscious home buyers. S&amp;Ls have restricted new 
  loans to established customers, to owner-occupied homes, and by 
  raising down payments. The trend toward condo conversions continues 
  unabated, thereby increasing demand for mortgage loans. Prices of 
  existing condos are rising more rapidly than in past years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel firms in the Chicago area report a good order book for the 
  third quarter. One company is operating above its rated capacity. A 
  larger share of steel orders is for structural steel and equipment, 
  which are in a "long overdue expansion." Important industrial, 
  utility, and mining projects are reported to be in the early stages 
  of design and construction. Steel imports are believed to have 
  dropped sharply after May 1 when "trigger prices" became fully 
  effective. However, much of the record volume of steel imported in 
  the first four months is believed to be still in the hands of 
  distributors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our information on business capital spending suggests greater 
  strength than was indicated by the most recent DOC survey. Figures 
  on bidding volume and new plans are up sharply. Outlays by the auto 
  industry to produce more efficient cars and trucks will be enormous 
  for years to come. New commercial construction is showing 
  substantial strength. Demand for equipment for rail and motor 
  transport is excellent. Orders for machine tools, industrial 
  presses, castings, forgings, diesel engines, and various components 
  are all far ahead of last year. Most of these companies report 
  business to be "very good," but still not comparable with the 1973-74 boom. Construction machinery is another strong sector, 
  particularly smaller types. Farm equipment sales will be down this 
  year, but by a smaller proportion than had been expected earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        With improved weather in late May retail sales picked up on a broad 
  front. A growing share of total sales seems to be going to the 
  larger, more aggressive chains. Not all car models have been selling 
  well, but overall sales have exceeded expectations in recent months. 
  Sales of recreational vehicles and light trucks have been stronger 
  than autos with some models "sold out." Regional polls report deep 
  consumer pessimism, but consumers appear to be buying big ticket 
  items aggressively.
