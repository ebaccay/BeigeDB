      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 2, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Third District reveal an overall improvement in 
local economic conditions in January. Area manufacturing has posted 
minor gains this month while industrial prices remained stable. 
Retail sales are doing well, encouraged by favorable weather 
conditions and successful promotions. In the financial sector, both 
business and consumer loans are up. Mortgage rates have dropped 
further, bringing new life to the real estate market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District contacts foresee a slow but sustained recovery for 
area business. Upswings in both manufacturing activity and 
department store sales are projected by industry spokesmen, but a 
hint of caution is evident in their plans. Bankers are expecting 
further growth in retail loan demand but predict that commercial 
lending will flatten out by midsummer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The turnaround in the Third District housing market has continued 
over the past two months. With conventional mortgage rates declining 
to a range of 12.50 to 13.50 percent, sales have firmed up 
considerably. Following an "almost normal" December, volume in 
January is up between 20 to 50 percent on a year-to-year basis. Most 
activity is still in the pre-owned home market. As a result, housing 
starts remain stalled and new home prices continue to drop. Brokers 
indicate, however, that a dip in rates below 12 percent this spring 
would give sales of new houses a shot in the arm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturing activity is showing marginal 
improvement in January, according to the most recent Business 
Outlook Survey. New orders posted their biggest gains since last 
March, and shipments registered a smaller but significant increase. 
On the negative side, local factory employment plunged further this 
month, according to the survey, and the average workweek was pared 
again.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, respondents' prognoses for the economy remain 
bullish. Nearly 9 out of 10 of the executives polled in January are 
forecasting a business pickup within six months. New orders and 
shipments are expected to show major improvement by midsummer, along 
with factory payrolls and working hours. Light growth in inventories 
is still planned, but only marginal capital spending increases are 
likely.
     </p>
     <p>
      The slowdown in inflation, evident for most of last year, has 
carried over into 1983. Survey results indicate that industrial 
prices in January are unchanged from December levels. Moreover, 
inflation is expected to remain at reduced levels for at least the 
next six months. Only half of this month's respondents, the lowest 
portion in seven years, anticipate higher prices by July for either 
raw materials or finished goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Department store sales in the Third District have gotten off to a 
flying start in 1983. Year-to-year sales gains of 15 to 18 percent 
are reported. Retailers attribute much of the current strength to 
unusually cooperative weather and across-the-board promotional 
activity. Moreover, current sales are being compared to depressed 
levels last January. Nevertheless, sales are much better than 
merchants had anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail contacts have become slightly more optimistic about future 
activity. Sales are projected to maintain their brisk pace into 
midsummer as consumer sentiment improves. By July, volume should be 
5 to 6 percent over the previous year, resulting in some real dollar 
gains if inflation stays low.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail inventories have been trimmed again in January. Stock levels 
are now well below those of last year and are in better shape than 
many merchants had expected. Retailers are still planning 
"conservatively," though, expecting to keep inventories tight over 
the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District lending activity has improved modestly since the last 
Redbook. Commercial loans, edging upward since December, are ahead 
of year-earlier levels by about 8 percent, and are pretty much in 
tune with bankers expectations. On the consumer side, retail loans 
have grown slightly again this month. Lower interest rates and a 
greater willingness on the part of bankers to lend, have helped 
boost consumer loan volume. Area lenders foresee loan activity 
turning mixed in the near future. Projections of a slow recovery, 
increased long-term borrowing by corporations, and minimal retail 
and industrial stock levels point to flat activity for commercial 
loans over the next six months. Even with such sluggish improvements 
in economic conditions, however, consumers' attitudes are expected 
to improve, encouraging further retail loan growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate charged by banks in the Third District has been cut 
to 11.00 percent since the last Redbook. Although they expect the 
prime to be cut another 50 basis points by the end of the second 
quarter, banking contacts say the decline in interest rates is 
slowing because credit markets are reacting to uncertainties about 
the direction of Fed policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows in the Third District have been significantly affected 
by the introduction of the Money Market Deposit Account. Heavy 
volume in the new account, termed a "bonanza" by one local banker, 
has pushed time deposit levels up as much as 30 percent over a year 
ago. Representatives from several large commercial banks report that 
25 percent to 35 percent of MMDA deposits is new money, attracted 
from Money Market Funds and some of the smaller thrift institutions 
in the District.
