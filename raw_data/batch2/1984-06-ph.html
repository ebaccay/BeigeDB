      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 25, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the Third District say the business environment is still 
healthy. Although some signs of a weakening of the expansion are 
appearing. Retailers have posted significant sales growth and bank 
contacts report continuing healthy increases in both commercial and 
retail lending. Manufacturers, on the other hand, indicate increases 
in activity which are softer than those of the first quarter, and 
real estate contacts have seen a sharp slowdown in sales over the 
past six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the remainder of 1984 reflects a similar pattern. 
Retailers and bankers are forecasting strong growth for the rest of 
the year. Manufacturers anticipate continued growth, but are 
increasingly less enthusiastic, and realtors foresee a prolonged 
slump in their industry, barring an unanticipated decline or 
leveling-off of mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to recent Business Outlook Surveys report healthy growth 
in manufacturing activity for May and June, although the portion of 
respondents reporting increases continues to slip. The June survey 
finds 37 percent indicating an increase in activity over May levels 
and 8 percent noting a decline. Specific indicators also have posted 
less robust increases in June than in May. While new orders and 
shipments continue to advance, producer backlogs and delivery dines 
are unchanged. Additionally, employment has edged upward only 
slightly and inventory levels are just fractionally higher than in 
May.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although respondents are not as enthusiastic as they were in the 
first quarter, the outlook for Third District manufacturing activity 
remains bright. Almost half of the manufacturers surveyed predict 
expansion through the end of 1984, whole only 16 percent foresee a 
decline. Executives polled expect healthy growth in new orders and 
shipments, yet predict little change in either employment or 
inventory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices have risen again in June, but, as in May, the 
percentage of respondents indicating higher prices has fallen—37 
percent (compared to May's 42 percent) report paying higher prices 
this month, while 14 percent (18 percent in May) say they are 
receiving more for their finished products. The outlook, however, 
continues to reflect widespread anticipation of hirer prices over 
the next six months. In June's survey, 77 percent of the respondents 
are forecasting higher input prices by year-end and 57 percent feel 
they will be receiving more for their output.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District merchants continue to enjoy excellent sales growth in 
mid-June. Retailers report 10-percent to 25-percent increases in May 
over year-ago levels, and they expect similar results for June if 
sales hold up after Father's Day. The performance is attributed 
partly to heavy promotions in May, along with unseasonally hot 
weather in early June. The heaviest sellers have been "hot weather" 
apparel and appliances, such as fans and air conditioners. Inventory 
reports vary, but stock levels generally are said to be a little 
heavy, though not enough to warrant extensive markdowns.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers say that a combination of continued strength in consumer 
demand and extensive promotions will result in strong sales growth 
for most of the remainder of 1984, and project 8-percent to 20-percent increases in sales over 1983 levels. Some merchants 
anticipate a definite easing in the general economy and a respective 
slowdown in retail growth toward the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers continue to report significant loan growth in 
both the commercial and the retail sectors. C&amp;I; activity has been 
especially strong in the past six weeks, with contacts indicating 
growth between 2 and 3 percent since mid-May. Commercial loans 
outstanding are currently running 15 percent to 25 percent above 
comparable periods of a year ago. Most bankers also report continued 
strength on the retail side. Currently, credit card and general 
installment lending are setting the brisk pace, while mortgage 
activity has been slowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for loan activity through 1984 is a positive one. 
Although contacts express mixed views over whether the current 
increases in C&amp;I loans can be sustained, the majority feel that 
demand is strong enough to keep loans outstanding 10-to-15 percent 
higher than year-earlier levels throughout the remainder of 1984. On 
the consumer side, forecasts are generally positive, although some 
bankers see rising rates occasionally interfering with otherwise 
widespread consumer demand for bank credit. Specifically, they note 
the possibility of "bargain" financing packages offered by auto 
dealers cutting into the retail lending market.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prime rate at Third District banks is currently 12-1/2 percent, 
up from 12 percent six weeks ago. Interest rate forecasts of local 
bank economists have changed very little since the last report; most 
contacts foresee gradually, but steadily, increasing rates through 
the end of the year. The prime is expected to move to 13-1/2 percent 
and the federal funds rate to 12 percent by the end of the fourth 
quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District real estate activity has slowed considerably since 
the beginning of June, according to contacts. Although some realtors 
say sales were fairly good through May, one local builder reports 
that activity has been flat for the past six weeks. Rising mortgage 
interest rates are mentioned as a key factor, if not the only 
factor, in causing the slump. Rates on 30-year, 3-point, fixed rate, 
conventional mortgages have climbed 50-75 points since late April 
and currently range from 14 percent to 14-3/4 percent. Consequently, 
about half of all new homebuyers are financing their purchases with 
adjustable rate mortgages. Realtors and builders believe that if 
mortgage rates fell, or simply held steady, for several months, 
activity would pick up. With rates forecast to rise even further, 
however, contacts expect the sales drought to continue.
