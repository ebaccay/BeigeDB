      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 13, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, recent economic activity in the Eighth District has 
exhibited no marked change from earlier in the year, according to 
area businessmen. Retail sales apparently are keeping pace with 
inflation. Manufacturing activity is mixed: appliances, automobiles, 
metals and paper are among the weaker sectors; chemicals, military 
equipment, and oil and gas equipment are among the stronger ones. 
Homebuilding remains at a low level, and, with higher mortgage 
interest rates, builders fear even further declines. Loan demand at 
District banks is stable. Prospects for this year s crops continue 
to improve with the recent rainfall in drought areas of Missouri and 
Arkansas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending has remained constant in real terms in recent 
weeks. However, department store representatives report that sales 
in nominal terms are running well ahead of last year's level and 
that sales in April were above those in March. A weakness in sales 
of automobiles and appliances was reported; automobile sales were 
down 15 percent or more in April from March. This weakness, however, 
was partly attributed to the end of the rebates. Truck sales, on the 
other hand, have remained stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several manufacturing industries have shown little strength in 
activity in recent weeks. Demand was described as unchanged for 
steel and declining for aluminum. The drop in the demand for 
aluminum began last fall, in large part as a reflection of reduced 
orders from Japan and Western Europe. Moreover, an upturn in demand 
for steel or aluminum is not expected until later this year or early 
next year. One representative of an appliance manufacturer reported 
that production has been adjusted at his firm by so-called "tuning 
days," whereby plants are closed for extended weekends or holidays. 
Automobile manufacturing in the District remains at the low level of 
a year ago. A representative of the paper and boxboard industry 
reported no change in sales in recent weeks, although the shipments 
in units are below a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing sectors exhibiting some strength include chemicals, 
military equipment, and oil and gas equipment. A representative of a 
major chemical firm noted that sales this year have been better than 
expected. Demand for industrial chemicals and plastics has picked 
up, and demand for agricultural chemicals remains at a high level. 
Increased government spending on military equipment has resulted in 
increased activity for military hardware producers in the District 
and further increases are expected on the basis of the current 
military budget. Commercial aircraft manufacturing activity is 
currently remaining at a high level, based on sizable backlogs of 
orders built up in 1980; new orders, however, have begun to decline 
and are expected to continue declining for the rest of this year. 
Demand for equipment for the oil and gas industries continues to be 
a source of strength for producers of such products as pipes, pipe 
coatings, regulators and valves.
     </p>
     <p>
      No substantial inventory problems were reported by either retailers 
or manufacturers. Automobile inventories were trimmed by the rebate 
program, and appliance manufacturers report that they have kept 
inventories at desired levels by curtailing days worked, despite 
weakness in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity remains far below normal levels throughout the 
District, although seasonal gains were registered in March and 
April. Builders' expectations about home sales this year were jolted 
by recent increases in interest rates which were counter to earlier 
expectations. Some observers note that many residential builders are 
in considerable financial difficulty and may be unable to survive 
another year of "low" housing sales. Commercial construction, on the 
other hand, continues at a high level in the District, particularly 
in the St. Louis metropolitan area where a number of large projects 
are under way.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand is reported by District bankers to be unchanged. 
However, the prime interest rate on bank loans has been increased 
along with those in the national money markets, while interest rates 
on home mortgages have risen to around 16 percent in the St. Louis 
area. With no increase in loan demand, many banksâ€”especially those 
in rural areasâ€”are investing funds in money market instruments. 
Officials of savings and loan associations report little growth in 
their deposits, and most associations report that they are not 
actively seeking mortgage loans. lather, they are restricting loans 
to present customers and building liquidity by investing in bank CDs 
and other short-term liquid assets. S&amp;L officials reacted favorably 
to the recent regulatory change allowing federally chartered 
associations to offer variable rate mortgages. One official 
predicted that such mortgages would be available at his institution 
within 30 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Low moisture conditions over the eastern portion of the District 
have about disappeared with the rainfall in recent weeks. Farmers in 
the region plan to expand rice acreage somewhat, while keeping their 
cotton and soybean acreage about the same. In Missouri, which was 
hard hit by last summer's drought, farmers are planning to decrease 
corn acreage, but increase acreage of grain sorghum, which is more 
drought-resistant. Planting of corn, cotton and rice is proceeding 
at a rapid pace, and land preparation for soybeans is well under 
way.
