      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Our latest survey of Fifth District business conditions shows 
further gains in business activity in April, in both the 
manufacturing and retail sectors. Manufacturers report further 
increases in shipments, orders, and order backlogs. Employment and 
weekly hours also continued to move up among manufacturing 
respondents. Inventories showed little change and are now more 
nearly in line with desired levels than has recently been the case. 
Prices continued to rise across a broad front in April. 
Manufacturers responding to the survey remain optimistic, with a 
majority expecting further improvement in business conditions over 
the next six months. Retailers, on the other hand, apparently 
foresee little or no change in the level of activity over that time 
period. In the banking sector, commercial loan demand has weakened 
over the past few weeks, but real estate loans, consumer installment 
credit, and agricultural loans have all advanced steadily. Fifth 
District farmers surveyed on April 1 reported intentions to increase 
the total acreage planted to field crops this spring by some 280,000 
acres or around 2 percent over last year.
      <p>
       Concerning the question of the impact of the proposed energy program 
  on business investment, a telephone survey of several of our 
  Directors revealed that while the proposal has contributed to a 
  general feeling of uncertainty, it is unlikely to have a significant 
  effect on investment at this time. The consensus appears to be that 
  in a business environment where uncertainty stemming from 
  environmental regulations, possible changes in business taxes, 
  inflationary pressures, and similar existing factors is already 
  prevalent, additional unanswered Questions cannot help but are 
  unlikely to have a major effect in the immediate future. On the 
  positive side, it was noted that at least the President's proposal 
  represents a concrete effort to come to grips with a pressing 
  problem and that from this standpoint it could be encouraging to 
  some people. On the other hand, it was generally agreed that the 
  plan offers no incentive for the production of energy and apparently 
  fails to recognize some of the problems of particular industries. In 
  summary, responses suggest that the impact of the proposal itself 
  should not be significant but could lead to some delays in 
  proceeding with specific investment plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly half of our manufacturing respondents reported shipments as 
  being up from a month ago and almost as many experienced similar 
  increases in the volume of new orders and in backlogs of orders. 
  Inventories were essentially unchanged over the month, but fewer 
  respondents now feel current levels to be excessive, and some now 
  view their stocks as inadequate. Employment was up slightly in April 
  according to our manufacturing respondents, as were hours worked per 
  week. Prices, including employee compensation, were reportedly 
  higher in April than in March. One-half of those surveyed paid 
  higher prices last month. Current plant and equipment relative to 
  desired levels was about the same in April as in March, although the 
  number of firms viewing it as inadequate increased slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of our retail respondents reported a higher level of sales in 
  April than in March, but there was only a very slight increase in 
  the relative sales of big ticket items. Inventories at retail were 
  unchanged and are now near or slightly below desired levels. As with 
  the manufacturers, prices paid and received by retailers were 
  broadly higher. In fact, retailers were unanimous in reporting 
  increases in employee compensation and in prices paid. The number 
  and size of outlets remain in line with desired levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the banking sector, lending of the real estate, agricultural, and 
  consumer installment varieties has continued a steady advance in 
  recent weeks. Commercial loans, however, have weakened in the 
  District in line with the national pattern. This weakness has been 
  concentrated primarily in durable goods manufacturing, e.g., metals, 
  and in some nondurable areas, particularly the food, liquor, and 
  tobacco group and in textiles. Demand for loans to retailers and 
  wholesalers has held up and is particularly strong among 
  wholesalers. Large CD's outstanding have declined in line with loan 
  demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the April 1 planting intentions survey, soybean 
  acreage, expected to be up some 10 percent, will account for most of 
  the rise in acreage planted to field crops, although fairly 
  significant increases in cotton and hay plantings are also intended. 
  Plans for a slight reduction in feed grain acreage and a 13 percent 
  cut in tobacco plantings will be partially offsetting. District farm 
  income improved significantly during January and February, rising 13 
  percent over that in the same period last year compared with about a 
  3 percent gain nationally. Although increases in both crop and 
  livestock receipts contributed to the District advance, most of the 
  upturn was due to a 31 percent gain in crop receipts. Higher prices 
  and larger marketings caused by the delayed harvest of some 1976 
  crops were primarily responsible for this sharp increase.
