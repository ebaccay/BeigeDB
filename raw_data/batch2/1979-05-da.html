      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 16, 1979
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors and businessmen report economic activity in the Eleventh 
  District continues to grow at a moderate and steady pace. Retail 
  sales in real terms are running slightly ahead of a year ago and are 
  expected to remain fairly strong through summer. Loan demand at 
  banks appears to have dipped slightly in recent weeks from the 
  strong level of earlier months, and some bankers anticipate somewhat 
  slower growth in loan volume in coming months. Net deposit inflows 
  to banks and savings and loan associations are up from April but 
  have not recovered to the moderate growth rates that had prevailed 
  in the first quarter. Conventional mortgage lending activity remains 
  depressed mainly by usury ceilings. The Texas legislature is 
  expected to raise the usury ceiling rate following FNMA's reluctance 
  to purchase FHA/VA mortgages that exceeded the state's 10-percent 
  usury ceiling. Manufacturing activity continues to grow steadily, 
  and many industries are near full capacity utilization.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales are strong with no letup expected through the summer 
  months. Spring auto sales are increasing on the strength of small 
  cars sales and are slightly above the level a year ago. Bad weather 
  and low inventories of small cars are hampering sales at some 
  dealers. A few dealers expressed the desire to keep lower inventory 
  levels because of the rising cost of financing inventories. 
  Department store sales are running slightly ahead of a year earlier 
  in real terms. Retail store executives remain optimistic for the 
  short term, but they anticipate a mild slowing of consumer spending 
  later this year. Inventories are being managed closely and are 
  generally near planned levels.
      <p>
       <p>
        Gasoline prices continue to increase rapidly with the wholesale 
  price of regular gasoline now selling for 84 cents a gallon in the 
  Houston spot market, up from 70 cents a month ago. No major 
  shortages have developed at the retail level, but many gas stations 
  are closing early on weekdays and all day on Sundays. Most oil 
  companies and refiners in the District do not expect the shortage to 
  become so severe as to warrant rationing. A spokesman for a major 
  oil company said that demand would have to decline 5 percent 
  nationally this summer from a year ago if shortages are to be 
  avoided. The tightest supplies of gasoline are expected in late 
  summer when refiners shift more of their production runs to heating 
  oils.
       </p>
       <p>
        &gt;Some softening in loan demand is noted by bankers, and a generally 
  slower rate of growth of loan demands is anticipated in coming 
  months. Loans outstanding continue to advance briskly, and the 
  strength is broad based. Bankers continue to report commercial and 
  industrial and real estate loans as particularly strong. Deposit 
  growth has resumed following April's poor showing, but growth rates 
  do not appear to have returned to the levels that existed in the 
  first quarter. Funds continue to be diverted into MMC'S with banks 
  apparently getting a small amount of funds from thrifts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Net savings inflows at savings and loan associations are returning 
  marginally to the black after many S&amp;Ls experienced losses in 
  April. Personal income tax payments contributed significantly to the 
  losses experienced in April, and the change in the terms offered on 
  MMC's is keeping the expansion of savings below earlier levels. 
  S&amp;Ls have increased substantially their holdings of non-mortgage 
  investments as usury ceilings in Texas discourage lending activity. 
  Mortgage lending is picking up seasonally but remains well below 
  year-earlier levels. Home improvement loans are at historically high 
  levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most mortgage bankers in Texas temporarily halted origination of 
  FHA/VA loans after FNMA expressed concern that the higher interest 
  ceiling on these types of loans might conflict with the state's 
  usury statutes. Although there are laws that exempt FHA/VA loans 
  from the state's usury ceiling, they are untested and may prove to 
  be unconstitutional if adjudicated. Some mortgage bankers have 
  resumed lending at the 10-percent rate but are not charging a one-
  point origination fee to the borrower. With conventional mortgage 
  lending severely limited by the usury statutes, the state 
  legislature is expected to raise the usury ceiling to a maximum 12 
  percent on a floating basis tied to the 10-year Treasury bond rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Industrial output continues to expand at a moderate rate from an 
  already high level. Capacity utilization generally remains high, and 
  many industries report rising backlogs of unfilled orders. Recently, 
  however, a major producer of drilling equipment announced plans to 
  reduce output and lay off workers because of the industry-wide 
  slowdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturing activity for firms producing consumer products appears 
  to be improving after a sluggish first quarter. Apparel 
  manufacturers report improving sales levels, although capacity 
  utilization remains low for most firms. Much higher prices for 
  synthetic yard goods and lengthening delivery times for material 
  inputs are reported. Furniture manufacturers have a mixed outlook 
  and are faced with higher lumber prices and, in some cases, 
  difficulty in securing certain types of lumber. Manufacturers of 
  home appliances report increased dealer orders, but sales to new 
  home developments are down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumers and businessmen express little optimism that inflation 
  will soon ease. Although a few retailers report some inflation-induced sales, the large majority of retailers see a reduction in 
  sales volumes as consumers' real incomes decline. Inventory building 
  by manufacturers as an inflation hedge appears minimal. Many 
  manufacturers have implemented cost-cutting measures, but low 
  productivity caused by declining labor quality and near full 
  capacity utilization is offsetting cost-cutting efforts.
