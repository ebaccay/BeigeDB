      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The First District economy appears to have softened in the last 
month. The downturn is most pronounced in the retail sector with 
sales falling sharply from the relatively healthy volumes of 
September. There has not been a comparable deterioration in 
manufacturing; rather the weakness that has characterized this 
sector since the summer has continued and become more pervasive. In 
banking, smaller banks serving smaller businesses are encountering 
increasing numbers of problem loans. The all-savers certificates 
have been somewhat less popular than most respondents expected; 
several banks have estimated that between two-thirds and three-
quarters of their all-savers funds are transfers from accounts in 
the same banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retail sector has weakened. Several "soft goods" retailers 
reported October sales well below the reasonably strong September, 
and only slightly ahead of last year in nominal terms, thus not 
matching inflation. The weak sales and resulting rise in inventories 
are visible across the board, but two department store 
representatives mentioned that the downturn is particularly 
noticeable in women's, misses, and junior sportswear. Because these 
lines usually contribute more than proportionally to gross margin, 
slack here has a greater impact on profits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants are "wary" about the next six months. They intend to 
control inventory investment carefully, stimulate sales with 
discounts and other promotional activities, and watch expenses. 
Because some stores began placing orders for next spring's products 
in August, inventory adjustments can be made only with a substantial 
lag and have consequences for later next year. One retailer said 
little change in employment is planned because the workforce is as 
"lean" as is consistent with customer service and store security.
     </p>
     <p>
      In manufacturing, signs of weakness are less pronounced than in the 
retail sector but longer term and more pervasive. After a vigorous 
recovery in the early part of the year, manufacturing activity 
leveled off early in the summer and has remained fairly constant—
well below capacity. For many products this continues to be the 
situation; a local survey of purchasing managers has shown little 
change in the past several months. However, signs of further 
weakness are beginning to appear. The most dramatic deterioration 
has been in the already weak home furnishings business. A 
representative of this industry reports that at a recent home 
furnishings show, attendance was down 50 percent from attendance in 
1980 which was down, in turn, 30 percent from attendance in 1979. He 
characterized this industry as a "disaster area" and predicted 
numerous bankruptcies in the carpet, yarn, and furniture industries. 
The wire and cable industry, which like home furnishings, is 
affected by the level of new housing construction has also begun to 
experience difficulties. Other products which were identified as 
problem areas included original equipment tires, jewelry, lumber, 
and belting for farm machinery. New orders for packaging have also 
begun to fall, indicating a more general slowdown. A manufacturer of 
packaging for products ranging from cookies to chemicals to medical 
supplies reports that sales were good through September and October, 
but in the last couple of weeks there has been a slowing in orders 
for packaging for consumer products and a marked downturn in the 
demand for industrial packaging.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the weakness in manufacturing, all respondents reported 
success in keeping inventories down. Several firms have seen an 
increase in accounts receivable, but most respondents have been 
watching receivables closely and have been able to prevent 
increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial respondents report large inflows to the "all-savers 
certificates" in the first ten days of October. Interest has tapered 
off since then although there was some pickup in early November. 
Overall, the response to the all-savers has been somewhat less than 
expected. Most of the funds for the all-savers are transfers from 
other deposits within the same institution. According to three bank 
spokesmen, only a quarter to one-third of the all-savers at their 
institutions represent new money. Loan difficulties appear to be 
more pronounced among smaller banks serving smaller businesses. Two 
small-to-medium-sized banks in northern New England report that bad 
loans are appearing with increasing frequency. On the other hand, 
representatives of two of the region's larger institutions claim 
that, despite some problems, loan losses compare relatively 
favorably with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson and Solow were available 
for comment this month. Eckstein summarized his remarks at the 
academic consultants' meeting as follows: (1) the Fed should allow 
interest rates to fall with the recession but maintain a positive 
real rate of interest (2) the FOMC should make sure to hit at least 
the mid-point of the 1982 growth targets for the monetary aggregates 
(3) the Fed should plan seriously for use of its lender of last 
resort function.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although Houthakker remains an "unreconstructed hard money man," he 
anticipates a considerable downturn in the economy, with the 
unemployment rate rising to 10 percent. In contrast to most previous 
recessions, the foreign sector will hinder rather than help real 
growth this time. He believes this will help reduce wage inflation 
and he expects a 5 to 8 percent increase in the CPI next year. He 
does not favor a formal incomes policy but recommends establishing a 
dialogue with labor unions to stress the implications of inflation 
when monetary policy limits the increase of nominal GNP.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson noted that the signs of a recession are fairly clear. The 
Federal Reserve has no mandate from the Congress, the 
Administration, or the American public to initiate or countenance 
another recession in the name of fighting inflation. In the interest 
of preserving long-run credibility—and bound by a previous 
commitment, however misguided—the Fed should encourage lower 
interest rates and allow M1B to return to within its target range. 
M2 growth should not deter these efforts. Notwithstanding the 
historical association between "old" M2 and GNP, there is no reason 
to expect the velocity of the part of M2 that provides market yields 
would be the same as its low-yield components.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solow felt there is a good chance of five consecutive quarterly 
declines in real GNP. His major concern is that the Fed has been so 
sensitized by attacks by Secretary Regan and so intent on avoiding 
being perceived as "caving in" that it will be too rigid to allow 
the short-term easing that it normally would have done. An objective 
of achieving a prolonged period of minor slack in the economy does 
not preclude short-term variations to lean against the cyclical 
winds. Solow urged the Fed to use the opportunity of "the stupid M1B 
being below the stupid target" to support the economy. The time has 
come for the Fed to abandon monetarism on the grounds that in the 
modern financial world "as soon as you impose a rigid target on any 
particular aggregate, the financial system will find its way around 
that aggregate." The Fed's goal should be to try to influence the 
economy not any particular monetary aggregate.
