      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand. A 
public transit strike kept the lid on retail sales in the 
Philadelphia area through the first week in May, but good gains are 
reported in areas not directly affected by the strike. Moreover, the 
manufacturing sector shows additional expansion although at a 
somewhat slower pace. New orders and shipments are higher while 
inventories are unchanged. At the same time, employment in this 
sector has improved for the third straight month. For the longer 
term, both retailers and manufacturers look for additional 
expansion. Planned increases in capital spending six months out are 
less widespread than in previous months, but this reportedly 
reflects unusually large outlays in the current period rather than 
any increase in uncertainty over economic prospects.
      <p>
       Manufacturers responding to the latest Business Outlook Survey say 
  that business is better than last month. Forty-two percent of the 
  respondents report gains in general business activity. This is down 
  from April, however, when 56 percent were reporting improved 
  business conditions. New orders are higher at slightly more than 
  one-third of the firms sampled, and a similar proportion of the 
  respondents indicate higher levels of shipments. In April, by 
  comparison, one-half the surveyed executives indicated gains in 
  these categories. Inventories are unchanged this month after 
  increasing in the previous survey. At the same time, both employment 
  and the average workweek are expanding for the third month in a row.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the longer term, manufacturers look for additional expansion, 
  although expectations of gains are somewhat less widespread than in 
  April. Two-thirds of the respondents look for better business 
  conditions six months out—down from three-fourths in the previous 
  survey. New orders and shipments are expected to climb over the next 
  two quarters, but inventory levels are projected to be no higher 
  than in the current period. This is the first time that the six-month inventory projection has been for no change since last 
  November. At the same time, employment and working hours are 
  expected to increase although the proportion of firms planning to 
  hire additional workers six months out is down from April.
      </p>
      <p>
       The President's recent energy proposals have produced no evidence of 
  any weakening in capital spending plans. Thirty-nine percent of the 
  respondents expect their levels of capital expenditures six months 
  from now to be higher than current levels while 7 percent anticipate 
  lower levels. This "net increase" of 32 percentage points is down 
  from 40 points in April and is the lowest since last summer. 
  However, a check with those respondents who report plans for curbing 
  capital outlays indicates that this arises from unusually high 
  expenditures in the current period rather than from any increased 
  uncertainty as a result of the President's energy proposals. In 
  fact, manufacturers contacted say that the proposals are so 
  tentative that they have not given them much consideration thus far. 
  The only concrete impact reported involves a regional auto parts 
  supplier in New Jersey who is expanding his inventory of parts for 
  smaller cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices in the industrial sector continue to climb, but the increases 
  are no more widespread than in April. In the current survey, 54 
  percent of the respondents report higher prices for supplies and 32 
  percent report higher prices for their finished products. By 
  November, 95 percent look for higher prices for inputs and 76 
  percent anticipate higher prices for the products they sell. Both of 
  these proportions are about 10 percentage points higher than last 
  month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department store sales in the region exhibit about the same pattern 
  as last month. While a public transit strike put a damper on sales 
  in Philadelphia's central business district, stores in the outlying 
  areas are experiencing good sales gains. The transit strike, which 
  lasted from March 25 through the first week in May, had a definite 
  impact on sales according to merchants contacted. One estimates that 
  normal sales volume at his downtown store was cut in half as a 
  direct result of the strike. Another retailer feels that people had 
  begun adjusting to the lack of public transit, but he guesses that 
  normal sales near the end of the strike were still reduced by about 
  a third.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside of the immediate strike area, sales are reported to be good 
  with gains of up to 10 percent over year-ago levels. Generally these 
  gains are "not quite up to expectations, but close nonetheless". 
  Housewares and T. V.'s are said to be selling well, and a few 
  merchants note that soft goods in general are not keeping pace with 
  their expectations. For the longer term, retailers look for further 
  gains in sales. For the remainder of this year, one merchant with 
  stores outside the immediate Philadelphia area looks for gains in 
  current dollars of more than 10 percent over the same period in 
  1976. Merchants whose stores are concentrated in the Philadelphia 
  metropolitan area, however, look for gains closer to 5 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers report that business loan volume is flat or down in April. 
  However, all of those contacted say there is some pickup in 
  discussions of financing terms with potential business borrowers. 
  One notes that while the numbers don't show up in the books, 
  commitments are up at his bank and he is "definitely encouraged" by 
  the pickup in interest on the part of local businesses. He feels 
  that businessmen are becoming more encouraged by the longer-term 
  economic prospects and they feel that inflation, while still too 
  high, is "manageable."
      </p>
      <p>
       For the longer term, bankers look for only moderate increases in 
  business loan volume over the remainder of this year. Interest rates 
  are expected to move upward during this period. Forecasts of 5 3/4-6 
  percent for Fed funds and 7-7 1/4 percent for the prime seem to be 
  the norm.
