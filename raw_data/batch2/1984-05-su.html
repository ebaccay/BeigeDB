      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall economic picture in the nation is fairly bright, 
according to reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts, 
although a few industries are still weak. Retail sales in many 
Districts bounced back in April from a March slump and are expected 
to continue their growth. Auto sales are very strong, with near-capacity production levels at many auto plants. Other manufacturing 
industries are also doing well, especially paper products and 
consumer durables. Residential construction remains strong, although 
some signs of slowing have appeared in recent weeks. Bankers in the 
Eastern and Southern parts of the nation report increases in both 
business and consumer loans, while borrowing in other areas has 
remained flat. Probably the weakest sector in the economy at this 
time is agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural sector has suffered in recent months due to a 
combination of factors. Plantings in the Southeast and Midwest have 
been delayed by heavy rains, while Dallas and Minneapolis report 
that overly dry conditions have held down winter wheat production. 
Both Dallas and San Francisco, however, say cotton growers are 
having a good year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pork farmers in the Atlanta District have been reducing inventories 
in response to higher feed prices, but that cutback might be near an 
end. Dairy farmers in the northern Midwest continue to experience 
financial problems, and they do not expect much help from the new 
Federal diversion program. Contacts in Kansas City say this year's 
calf crop is about average. Poultry farmers in the Richmond District 
continue to be troubled by avian influenza outbreaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both Chicago aid Kansas City report a further drop in farmland 
values. Kansas City also says farm credit problems are as bad this 
year as they were last year, and that farm asset liquidation is 
likely to increase unless debt is reduced.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining/Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity in the mining and energy sector appears to be 
mixed in April. Both production and prices are up in the coal 
industry in the Midwest. Cleveland attributes some of the strength 
to utilities' stockpiling coal against the possibility of a strike 
by the United Mine Workers in September. San Francisco reports, 
however, that the coal companies in the West have been laying off 
workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The oil industry remains weak. The increase in drilling apparently 
stems from lower costs and more favorable leasing terms rather than 
from growth in demand. Dallas says these factors have accounted for 
a 38 percent increase in the number of offshore rigs since the first 
of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction/Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The underlying upward trend in the residential construction industry 
persists, according to most Districts, despite a recent slowdown and 
anxiety about the future course of interest rates. New York and 
Cleveland report brisk sales of homes, but indicate that buyers and 
builders are very conscious of mortgage rates. In most other 
Districts, residential sales slowed in recent weeks, the result of a 
combination of bad weather and higher mortgage rates. Higher rates 
have given a further boost to adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). 
Kansas City reports that over 80 percent of new mortgage loans in 
that District are ARMs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction remains generally strong despite concern 
about overbuilding. In New York and Chicago the demand for office 
space continues to grow. The market for industrial space, however, 
is mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The nation's industrial sector is continuing along a path of 
expansion. Although capital goods industries are weak in some 
Districts, the overall picture is bright in virtually all areas. The 
paper industry is probably the strongest at this time, followed by 
consumer durables, primary and fabricated metals, and electronics. 
San Francisco indicates rapid gains in the production of missiles 
and space vehicles, and Cleveland and Chicago both report that many 
motor vehicle manufacturing plants are operating at capacity. 
Manufacturers' stock levels are generally stable, and there are no 
reported plans for significant inventory-building. Industrial prices 
are mixed. The only real weakness in manufacturing is in exports. 
Boston reports, however, that there has been a pickup in sales of
foreign subsidiaries of domestic firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail/Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      About half of the District report that retail sales have made a 
brisk comeback in April after a sluggish March. The strongest gains 
were posted in Philadelphia, where sales are running as much as 35 
percent ahead of the same time last year; about half of that gain 
was due to the later Easter holiday this year. In other Districts 
reporting rebounds, gains range from 8 percent to 26 percent. Even 
in those areas which have not seen an increase in sales, retailers 
believe the underlying strength in consumer spending is still 
present. Consumer durables appear to be leading the surge in 
spending, bolstered by the strength of the housing market. 
Nondurables, however, are also doing quite well. Retail inventories 
in most Districts have increased relative to sales, but merchants 
are not concerned and are not planning any special moves to cut 
back. At least part of the inventory buildup is intentional and 
being undertaken in response to continued strength in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are also reported to be vigorous. Foreign cars and larger 
domestic autos seem to be leading the pack, although Atlanta reports 
healthy sales of compact vehicles as well. Some shortages of the 
more popular domestic models are reported, and delivery times for 
foreign cars are being stretched out. Recent increases in consumer 
loan rates in some parts of the country do not appear to have 
dampened the demand for cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Virtually all Districts in the Eastern and Southern parts of the 
nation report strong growth in loan demand this month. Business 
loans remain brisk in those areas, with both large and small 
companies borrowing for a variety of reasons. Consumer borrowing is 
also up, especially loans for autos. Deposit flows, however, are 
weak at many financial institutions, and loans are being made with 
borrowed funds. Districts in the Western part of the country say 
there has been little or no loan growth in March and April.
