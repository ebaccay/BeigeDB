      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Warmer weather has revitalized major parts of the southeastern 
economy.
      <br/>
      A special survey elicited indications of pervasive, 
tenacious price increases. The construction industry continues to 
benefit from strong home construction, while apartment building 
lags. Financial developments largely reflect the trends in 
construction. Retail sales are vigorous, in general, with particular 
strength evidenced by auto sales. Tourist traffic and expenditures 
have revived. Trends in transportation, inventories, and new orders 
suggest increasing economic vitality. Federal Government review of 
water resources projects may pose a threat to economic prospects in 
several parts of the Southeast.
      <p>
       Responses to a special survey of directors suggest that persistent, 
  widespread price increases are continuing, partly in response to 
  adverse weather. In Florida, in addition to the price increases 
  resulting from the reduced juice yield of citrus fruit, the heavy 
  demand for harvesting labor has boosted labor costs 10 to 20 
  percent. Vegetable growers in South Florida are now shipping their 
  first replanted crops of beans, yellow squash, and zucchini, but 
  tomatoes will remain in short supply until late April. Growers in 
  central Florida report ideal conditions in recent weeks, promising 
  high yields.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers of products which use petroleum-based raw materials, 
  such as fiberglass boats and tires, anticipate price increases 
  stemming from the forthcoming energy program. Energy-dependent 
  producers, such as transportation, utility, and lumber companies are 
  requesting or posting price hikes. A large aluminum producer notes 
  that recent aluminum price increases are "sticking." They expect 
  additional price boosts resulting from power cutbacks in the 
  northwestern U. S. and a lack of sufficient capacity in other 
  regions to offset the production losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food manufacturers are presently increasing their list prices but 
  are maintaining transaction prices by offering discounts. No 
  immediate increases in wholesale food prices are anticipated. 
  However, the price of beef has been held down by cold weather. Feed 
  supplies were cut sharply by the adverse weather, which maintained 
  the supply of cattle for slaughter. The resulting herd depletion may 
  eventually result in a sharper upturn in prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction executives note that home prices are rising in step 
  with materials prices and that increasing costs of construction will 
  gradually be reflected in prices of industrial commodities and in 
  apartment rentals. Observers also note a shift in a number of 
  industries from fixed price to flexible price contracts containing 
  pass through clauses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors also indicate that single-family construction continues to 
  dominate the District's construction recovery. In most areas, large 
  increases from year-ago levels in home construction and sales are 
  reported. In some areas, sales have doubled. Areas where sales have 
  not increased sharply are those where sales were already strong. 
  Multifamily residential unit sales continue to gain, reducing the 
  stock of unsold units; in some cases this decrease is quite rapid. 
  The foundation appears to be developing for a slow recovery in this 
  depressed sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apartment construction has increased in Alabama. In other District 
  states, high costs of construction and financing, as well as the 
  conversion of condominium units to rentals in some areas, have 
  limited the construction of new apartment units.
      </p>
      <p>
       Financial developments primarily reflect construction activity 
  trends. Savings and loan associations have felt increased demand for 
  construction loans in some, but not all, areas. Despite decreasing 
  vacancy rates, lenders are reportedly reluctant to lend for 
  apartment construction as a result of previous adverse experiences. 
  However, inquiries about financing of new condominium projects are 
  reported. These are mostly small projects in the mid- to upper-price 
  range. Stringent terms of lending and financial standards are 
  reportedly being applied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales are improving, according to most reports, although some 
  retailers found March sales disappointing in view of an early 
  Easter, which was expected to boost sales. Concern is voiced about 
  the inhibiting effects of increased utility bills, the cost impact 
  of the minimum wage increase, and the response by consumers to 
  higher prices on fall merchandise. Inventories remain in a 
  satisfactory range.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto sales are very strong; the strength continues to be centered in 
  the large- and intermediate-sized models. Dealers are still 
  experiencing difficulty in obtaining deliveries of the models most 
  in demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourist traffic has rebounded strongly in the Southeast, following 
  the dampening effect of severely cold weather. Hotel and motel 
  occupancy has risen markedly; highway traffic and air passenger 
  arrivals have increased sharply. In Florida, tourist attractions and 
  beaches are packed. Retailers are enjoying increased sales. 
  Employment in service businesses has grown. However, one director 
  notes doubts concerning the strength of tourism by sources within 
  the industry, based on a sustained weakness in business prior to the 
  cold weather period and the absence in recent weeks of an 
  appreciable upsurge.
      </p>
      <p>
       General business developments include an improved, although erratic, 
  pattern of truck rental and leasing business in Florida and Alabama. 
  Strong rental business is said to indicate that industrial shippers 
  are moving large quantities of goods. A Louisiana trucking executive 
  cites recent contacts with his accounts that indicate a general 
  increase in the volume of their business. In Florida, an employment 
  increase is noted in business support services, including 
  janitorial, engineering, and computer services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Appliance manufacturers are reportedly building inventories to meet 
  an anticipated expansion in demand. Some retailers report plans to 
  increase their inventories, while the improved retail sales picture 
  in Florida is attributed, in part, to better selections of 
  merchandise resulting from increased stocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       An office and home furniture manufacturing division of a national 
  firm reports a recent significant increase in orders. Heavy domestic 
  and international demand for phosphate has caused congestion at the 
  Port of Tampa docks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Georgia mobile home plants should benefit from recently enacted 
  legislation permitting 14 foot wide mobile homes to be transported 
  on state highways. Employment and the number of firms in the 
  industry have fallen sharply in recent years. Restrictions on 
  transportation were viewed as a major impediment by the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The major development affecting employment is the impending layoff 
  of as many as 15,600 employees of a major shipbuilder located in 
  Mississippi. Fortunately, some of these workers may be hired by New 
  Orleans shipyards which have a substantial backlog.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent scrutiny of Federal water resource projects has raised 
  questions concerning the continuation of several major projects in 
  the Southeast, including the Richard Russell Dam on the Savannah 
  River, the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in Alabama and Tennessee, 
  and the Red River navigation project in Louisiana. Each project is 
  regarded as significantly affecting current and prospective economic 
  development in its surrounding area.
