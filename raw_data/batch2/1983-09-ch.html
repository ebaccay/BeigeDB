      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic recovery in most Seventh District centers continues to 
lag the national pattern, except for areas concentrating on 
automotive products. Even in that industry, operations are far short 
of the peak levels of the late 1970s. Major Midwest companies are 
still engaged in far-reaching cost-reduction programs to restore or 
improve profitability and to counter the high value of the dollar. 
Employment improvement, overall, is slower than in the U.S., but few 
new layoffs of importance are imminent. Retail sales were at 
favorable levels in August, aided by hot weather. Demand for capital 
goods produced in the region has shown only slight improvement, 
except for a surge in orders for truck trailers. Steel demand 
remains concentrated in lighter products, and has been disappointing 
in total. Single-family home sales and permits slowed in the summer 
as a result of higher interest rates, but leasing of office space 
has accelerated in downtown Chicago. State governments now 
anticipate surpluses rather than deficits because of increased taxes 
and tight budgets, but some local governments remain under severe 
strain. Corn and soybean crops have been severely damaged by hot 
weather and drought. Higher crop prices will boost income for many 
farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of cars would be even stronger if more large, rear-wheel-drive 
domestic models and more Japanese cars were available. Supplies of 
popular domestic models have been limited by capacity, which had 
been reduced, while the Japanese export quota has determined the 
level of U.S. sales of their cars. U. S. production schedules have 
been raised for the remainder of the year and appear firm. Measures 
are being taken to increase large car production capacity even 
though government penalties for failure to meet CAFE standards could 
be imposed under existing regulations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Cost Cutting
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Various Seventh District companies have announced ongoing programs 
to reduce costs substantially relative to the general price level 
over the next two or three years. The main reason for urgency is the 
substantial advantage foreign competitors have because of the high 
value of the dollar. Steps include drastic reductions in overhead 
staff; pressure on unions to accept concessions, on compensation and 
work rules; closing of high-cost facilities (usually in the Midwest) 
and consolidation in more efficient units; pressure on suppliers to 
cut prices; and "outsourcing" components, previously made "in 
house", if cheaper supplies can be obtained from others, either in 
the U.S. or abroad.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Substantial increases in employment in the District since last 
December have been concentrated in the automotive industry and 
residential construction. The bulk of the expected automotive 
callbacks probably already have occurred. New claims for 
unemployment compensation are down sharply. While few important new 
layoffs are in immediate prospect. announcements of closings of 
long-established facilities continue. Where closings involve major, 
older facilities, the announcement is merely the coup de grace 
following a long period of attrition. Other plant closings follow 
failures of labor and management to agree on concessions. On the 
other hand, some closed plants have been reopened following 
successful concession negotiations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Purchases
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several merchandise retailers reported strong August sales, with air 
conditioners and other warm weather merchandise leading the uptrend. 
However, virtually all classes of goods have sold well, Including 
furniture, appliances, and carpeting, which tend to be associated 
with house sales. The pickup in furniture was too late to save a 
number of well known stores, which went out of businessâ€”casualties 
of high interest rates according to managers. Recreational vehicles 
have had a very good year. Airline travel continues to show large 
gains in volume with promotional fares still a factor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As reported in the last Commentary, the important capital goods 
producers of the District have not participated proportionately in 
the uptrend in the national aggregates. Many plants remain closed 
and others are operating at less than 50 percent of capacity. 
Imports and loss of foreign markets have reinforced sluggish 
domestic demand. Some say that the high value or the dollar also 
makes investments in production facilities abroad more attractive. 
In most cases where increases in orders have been reported-for 
example, machine tools and heavy trucks-the rise has been modest and 
from a very low base. One sector that is going strong is tandem 
trailers, permitted under the new federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Slows
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Higher interest rates slowed housing activity in July and August. In 
the District, July home permits were down sharply from June. 
Conventional mortgage rates in the Chicago area had moved up to the 
14 percent range in the summer, but have been reduced since late 
August by nearly half of the lenders surveyed by one-eighth to one-
half percentage points. The state of Illinois recently provided $70 
million obtained by sales of tax-exempt bonds for mortgage loans at 
10.55 percent-3 to 3-1/2 percent below the market. The money was all 
spoken for at participating lending institutions in an hour or two, 
with some rancor evidenced by disappointed applicants.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Building
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory construction and new utility projects are at a very low 
level. However, a number of large new office buildings have been 
announced for downtown Chicago, and more announcements are expected. 
(Downtown Chicago has been the only strong area in the District for 
office buildings.) Earlier this year. some experts predicted that 
the glut of office space in the Loop would last for years. Recently, 
however, leasing activity accelerated markedly, rents firmed, and 
concessions to lessees were cut back.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State and Local Governments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the last legislative sessions, all five states of the District 
enacted tax increases to eliminate current or potential deficits. 
Higher taxes, tighter expenditure control, and the pickup in the 
general economy now are expected to produce budget surpluses in all 
five states in the new fiscal year. Increased rates were levied on 
corporate and personal incomes, retail sales, and gasoline. Rarely 
have the states moved in unison with such vigor to increase 
revenues, but the need was urgent because state deficits are 
illegal. Meanwhile major cities are wrestling with revenue 
shortfalls and demands for higher salaries for public employees, 
including teachers, police and fire personnel who have called 
strikes in some cases. Some layoffs and short weeks have been 
ordered.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continuing searing drought through August caused the USDA to reduce 
its estimate for the corn crop of the District states by a further 
20 percent. With large acreage cuts, the corn crop is now expected 
to be 53 percent below last year. The soybean crop, also badly 
damaged, is now expected to be down 28 percent. The extent of the 
drought damage varies widely and is most severe in Illinois and 
Indiana. Because of higher prices, earnings of farmers who were 
least affected by the drought, and those receiving PIK grain, will 
improve significantly.
