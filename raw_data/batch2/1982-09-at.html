      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 29, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Late summer economic conditions in the Sixth District remain weak. 
Consumer spending patterns show no increase from mid-summer. 
Employment conditions are worsening. Falling grain and soybean 
prices threaten to reduce farm income further. Only the lower-cost 
sectors of the tourist industry show improvement over last year or 
earlier this season. Virtually the sole harbinger of recovery in the 
region's economy is construction, which has begun to realize a 
previously predicted upturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional labor markets display further 
signs of deterioration in August and September. Reports of layoffs 
and plant shutdowns combined with preliminary, partial employment 
figures indicate the likelihood that the District's unemployment 
rate rose again in late summer. Alabama's August unemployment rate 
climbed to 14.1 percent (S.A.). Layoffs have recently been announced 
in such diverse industries as pharmaceuticals, rubber, food 
processing, shipbuilding, agricultural chemicals, paper, lumber, 
textiles, apparel, electrical and agricultural machinery, steel, 
aluminum, and coal. At some companies, such as McDermott, the large 
offshore construction firm headquartered in New Orleans, layoffs 
extend to white-collar personnel. Even firms which traditionally try 
to retain employees through periods of slack demand, such as 
Stockham Valves and Fittings and American Cast Iron and Pipe, have 
furloughed workers. Although respondents are generally optimistic 
that the recession has passed its trough, almost none have plans to 
increase hiring in the next few months. Since the Red Book 
employment panel is weighted toward the most successful 
manufacturing firms headquartered in the District, this response 
does not augur well for the region's near-term employment outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders at regional pulp and paper mills are weak, and paper 
inventories in Tennessee are termed by one observer as "exploding." 
Aluminum and steel inventories remain at high levels in Louisiana 
and Alabama, respectively. A spokesman for the petrochemical 
industry in Louisiana reports that no chemical processing companies 
in the state have expansion plans at present. In fact, most plants 
are operating substantially below capacity. One encouraging sign in 
Florida is that phosphate rock and fertilizer inventories have 
dwindled significantly. The first-half downtrend in capital spending 
appears to be continuing in the third quarter. General Electric 
postponed indefinitely plans to build a $1.5 billion plastics plant 
in Alabama.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      August taxable sales were up moderately (in real 
terms) over last year in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee but down in 
Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Retailers report generally flat 
back-to-school sales. Although hopeful of improvement by the 
Christmas season, they are ordering conservatively and holding 
inventories taut. Consumers, too, are widely reported to be very 
cautious. Sales of big-ticket home furnishings remain weak, 
reflecting the depressed housing sector, while first-time purchases 
of such new products as microwave ovens, video recorders, and 
personal computers remain strong. Auto sales still appear to be 
sharply below last year's levels. Factory incentive plans are 
proving less effective for southeastern dealers than earlier 
customer rebates, and the tax cut has not spurred car sales. Dealers 
also link weak August-September sales to consumer uncertainties 
regarding employment, interest rates, and 1983 car prices. Dealers 
are ordering new models cautiously.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to our survey of building 
codes departments, real estate firms, and savings and loan 
institutions (S&amp;Ls), housing has begun to improve slowly. Codes 
departments report a slight rise in August building permits for 
single-family residences and a moderate increase in some areas 
during the first half of September. Building permits for "additions" 
remain strong. S&amp;Ls indicate that loans are up somewhat. Commercial 
sales and leasing remain slow but steady. Even more encouraging are 
reports from realtors that home sales are finally improving, 
especially in Atlanta, Jacksonville, Knoxville, and Nashville. 
However, slower growth areas as well as much of Alabama and 
Louisiana have yet to pick up. Moreover, realtors and thrift 
officers repeatedly state that mortgage rates need to fall to 12-13 
percent before the market really gets moving. Many potential home 
buyers are reportedly postponing purchases to see if rates decline 
further or stabilize. Aside from these qualifications, the mood in 
the District is definitely more positive than earlier this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist industry representatives and partial statistics 
indicate that higher priced sectors of the industry continue to 
languish; moreover, the bright spot of earlier reports-the World's 
Fair-has continued the decline reported in August. If average daily 
attendance does not increase, the Fair will not reach the break-even 
level of 11 million visitors. Fair officials, however, remain 
optimistic. Across the District, less expensive facilities, such as 
campgrounds and state and national parks, are enjoying sharply 
increased usage, especially by in-state visitors, whereas hotels and 
motels have fewer guests, and convention business, particularly in 
Atlanta, is off from last September. Florida and Louisiana remain 
the weakest areas. New Orleans' most popular restaurant reports that 
this summer was the worst in its history. Respondents continue to 
attribute Florida's poor performance to recession here and abroad 
and to the World's Fair; in addition, many have begun to suggest 
that the October 1 opening of Disney World's EPCOT is postponing 
travel to the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farm income prospects have become decidedly more dismal 
in recent weeks. Soybeans produce about two-fifths of the region's 
noncitrus crop income. Prices have fallen 10 percent in the past 
month, reducing prospective soybean income by $350 million and 
dropping the estimated total 13 percent below last year's drought-
reduced level. Prices of most other crops have also declined 
recently, leaving tobacco as the sole bright spot with prices 
averaging 9 percent above last year. Income prospects of livestock 
producers have been bolstered somewhat by recent price gains for 
hogs and calves. On balance, however, aggregate net farm income in 
the District will be lower than in 1981, and debt problems of 
farmers will grow more severe. A major lender reports that an 
increase in foreclosures of relatively large Mississippi Delta 
farming operations is already occurring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of Sixth District banking and thrift 
institutions regarding the new 7- to 31-day small time deposits 
reveals little consumer interest in these accounts, which only the 
larger institutions have offered. Because alternative instruments 
which yield competitive rates and/or offer substantially the same 
maturity are available, our contacts believe no market exists for 
this service. They view it as a defensive move to maintain customer 
relationships. The Sixth District's experience with these accounts 
suggests that third-party transaction privileges and much smaller 
minimum deposits are necessary to elicit adequate consumer interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Panel of Economists
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our panel of state forecasters and academic, 
banking, business, and investment economists continue to approve of 
current monetary policy, finding it conducive to moderate recovery 
without rekindling inflation. A smaller majority recommends monetary 
growth in excess of targets, while nearly one-third of those polled 
urge a rapid return to within-target growth. Virtually all feel 
their state is near the trough of the business cycle, with no signs 
of recovery and some of further deterioration. The majority, 
revising their previous outlook, foresee a later, weaker recovery. 
All respondents mentioned lower, stabilized interest rates as 
critical to inducing increased consumer spending; a majority also 
regard GNP growth as important to overcoming consumer resistance. 
There is no clear consensus among those surveyed regarding the 
recent drop in business loan demand, but bank economists note that 
recent corporate loan demand has been better here than in the 
nation.
