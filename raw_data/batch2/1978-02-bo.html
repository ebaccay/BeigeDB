      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 21, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The experience of the First District during the past month has been 
  dominated by adverse weather conditions. These have reduced retail 
  sales and disrupted production. However, respondents are generally 
  confident that the underlying trend for the region's economy 
  continues to be one of steady growth. On the financial side, thrift 
  institutions report some slowing in deposit inflows but mortgage 
  rates remain stable.
       </p>
       <p>
        New England has experienced two major snowstorms during the past 
  month. The second was the most severe in the region's history and 
  literally shut down much of southern New England for almost a week. 
  All but emergency travel was prohibited in eastern Massachusetts and 
  Rhode Island, so that almost no one was able to go to work or visit 
  retail establishments for four to six days. In addition, flooding in 
  coastal communities destroyed many homes and businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Much of the loss in production and retail sales caused by the storms 
  is expected to be made up in later weeks. However, impulse purchases 
  and purchases of certain services and food away from home are lost 
  forever. If one were to adjust for weather conditions the retail 
  sales situation would be mixed, but on balance favorable. One large 
  department store chain in southern New England reports that through 
  the first week of February—before the most recent storm but after 
  the first—sales in 1978 were 30 percent above the same period a 
  year ago. Retailers in northern New England, on the other hand, have 
  been disappointed with their recent sales experience; however, that 
  sector of the industry associated with ski resorts is doing very 
  well. Once again New England ski areas are enjoying a very 
  successful season. Until the most recent snowstorm retailers' 
  inventories were well under control and stores were having no 
  difficulty obtaining merchandise.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the financial sector, one large company reported keen competition 
  among New York banks wanting to lend it money. The company was 
  redesigning its revolving credit arrangements, which involve loans 
  of about three or four years duration. The New York City banks 
  seemed very eager to handle the loans and were offering very 
  attractive terms. A large Boston bank reported that it too is 
  pricing loans aggressively. However, because of recent increases in 
  loan demand, this bank expects the need for price cutting to 
  diminish. Most of the increased demand has been for intermediate-term fixed interest loans. The bank is raising money for these loans 
  with a large note issue and by moving toward longer-term 
  certificates of deposits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although savings inflows at mutual savings banks slowed in New 
  England there is no sign of distress as yet. Mortgage rates are 
  remaining stable after declining slightly during 1977. Mortgage 
  demand remains fairly strong and a continuation of present trends is 
  expected. Most thrift institutions are reasonably liquid and are not 
  expecting any crunch in the short term. Disintermediation is not 
  expected to become a serious problem unless short term rates 
  increase by 100 basis points or more. Many thrift institutions in 
  New England are not offering ceiling rates on certificates of 
  deposit now so they have some room to remain competitive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professors Houthakker, Eckstein, Tobin, and Samuelson were available 
  for comment this month. All respondents believe that the Fed should 
  not make the stability of the dollar on foreign exchange markets a 
  primary concern for monetary policy. Houthakker, in particular, 
  noted that monetary policy should respond to our domestic needs and 
  that changing exchange rates are the appropriate market responses 
  which accommodate differing national policies: "It is foolish to 
  acquiesce to foreign monetary policies" which are not appropriate 
  for our needs by attempting to peg the dollar.
       </p>
       <p>
        All respondents also believe that the adverse weather during the 
  first quarter will have no lasting effect on the economy. Unlike 
  last year, however, real growth during 1978:I will suffer because it 
  will not benefit from pent-up sales of autos and trucks (the Ford 
  strike settlement) and because it must carry the added burden of an 
  extended coal strike. The major legacy of the bad weather may be 
  that many economic indicators will be very noisy for the next 
  several months; it will be hard to identify trends and get bearings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Houthakker anticipates 4.5 percent real growth during 1978. Although 
  this performance will not reduce unemployment rates dramatically, it 
  does not invite the risk of excessively rapid expansion. Without 
  violating the announced targets, money growth near the upper target 
  is sufficient to maintain healthy economic momentum. He sees little 
  risk of a credit crunch during 1978.
       </p>
       <p>
        Samuelson believes the Fed should continue the policy of the past 
  few years: grudgingly giving ground both to rising interest rates 
  and to above-target money growth. However, should housing, 
  investment, or durables consumption weaken significantly, further 
  interest rate increases should be resisted. He feels that 4.5 
  percent growth for 1978 is the lowest defensible goal because many 
  of the signs which mark the late stage of an expansion are not yet 
  evident, the real growth target could be as high as 5.5 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tobin and Eckstein, noting the gloom of the investment community, 
  report that businessmen fear a credit crunch perhaps as early as 
  this year. The Fed's announced money growth targets appear to put it 
  on a collision course with the Administration's forecast of 4.5 to 
  5.0 percent real growth. Accordingly, declining bond and stock 
  prices reflect lower profits forecasts and expectations of higher 
  interest rates. These developments, in turn, jeopardize the outlook 
  for housing and investment. Both Tobin and Eckstein believe that 
  there is no reason for the Fed to validate these forecasts. It would 
  be "foolish" to increase interest rates at the moment—the Fed 
  should convince the business community that the economy is not on a 
  path to a recession.
