      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Further strengthening occurred in the Southeast. Despite concern 
  about natural gas supplies, a number of steps are being taken to 
  maintain adequate supplies of energy. Consumer spending has 
  increased, although rural areas are feeling the pinch of energy 
  costs. Inventories may be inadequate if vigorous holiday sales 
  continue. Auto sales are spotty, with some signs of price resistance 
  to new models. The winter tourist season has been boosted by cold 
  weather, investments in convention and tourist facilities are 
  increasing, along with major plant investments or expansions in 
  paper, rubber, and transportation. In contrast to this cheerful 
  picture, payment problems and the termination of some major ventures 
  echo the effects of the recession. Savings and loan associations are 
  enjoying rapid growth in the Southeast.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy resources remain a key influence on economic activity. 
  Concern continues in parts of Tennessee that industrial use of 
  natural gas will be curtailed, causing unemployment. This outcome 
  appears likely in some areas if the abnormally cold winter persists. 
  Looking toward the future, an immediate decision by the Federal 
  government is expected on construction of the Louisiana Offshore Oil 
  Port, a facility to receive oil shipments from supertankers. Several 
  nuclear power plants are under construction in the Southeast, 
  including one north of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and another in 
  Southeastern Florida. Construction of a third plant on the Southeast 
  Florida coast has been halted by environmental interest groups. 
  Seven to eight hundred construction workers have been laid off. A 
  highly promising new oil and gas strike off the Louisiana coast 
  illustrates the possibility of further development of offshore oil 
  resources. Extraction of methane from salt water in deep-drilled oil 
  wells is being investigated as a potential source of additional 
  natural gas supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rising energy prices in connection with abnormally cold weather are 
  reducing consumption outlays in rural areas. Rural residents who 
  depend on liquefied petroleum gas for heat have recently experienced 
  a doubling of their fuel costs in some areas. A brighter consumer 
  spending picture emerges elsewhere in the District. Most department 
  stores report enlarged post-Thanksgiving sales volume, although some 
  expect to do no better than last year. Last month's suggestion of a 
  bifurcated consumer market has been confirmed by current reports 
  that strength is concentrated in the more luxurious lines of boats, 
  automobiles, and department store goods. Inventories of retailers 
  and wholesalers are unusually low. If the present sales growth 
  persists, sales volume will be lost due to unavailability of goods. 
  Especially strong sales are found in eastern Tennessee, which 
  benefits from the high incomes of coal miners in neighboring states, 
  and in central and south Florida, where tourist traffic has been 
  boosted by abnormally cold weather elsewhere in the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of automobiles are spotty. Buyers rejected the smaller cars 
  but are now responding to the rebate offers in some areas. Large 
  models, especially luxury cars, are enjoying the strongest sales. 
  However, several areas report disappointing sales in November for 
  dealers unaffected by the recent strike. There are also some reports 
  of resistance to the higher prices on 1977 models.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism promises to remain the District economy's bright spot. The 
  winter season in Miami and Fort Lauderdale is off to a fine start as 
  a result of severe weather elsewhere. Tourism continues to lead 
  central Florida's recovery. New Orleans's restaurant population is 
  growing rapidly; new hotels and motels are adding to the city's 
  dining facilities, established hotels are renovating, and several 
  new restaurants are also being built. A new hotel and convention 
  center is under construction at Opryland in Nashville. The circus 
  world theme park in central Florida will double the present size of 
  its operation during 1977. International flights have been approved 
  for the Orlando Airport.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some additional strength is evident in capital spending. In 
  Tennessee, announced spending for new and expanded plants through 
  the end of September exceeded the 1975 total. Industrial power usage 
  reported by TVA has shown an upward trend and is close to the pre-recession level. In Georgia, new capital investment announcements 
  through October are two-thirds greater than in the first ten months 
  of 1975.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for paper products remains weak, with several mills taking 
  down time. Backlogs of orders have dropped. Still, a bleached kraft 
  market paper plant, with an investment of $286 million, is being 
  built in Alabama.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Goodyear facility in Gadsden, Alabama, will undergo a major 
  expansion, becoming the largest tire plant in the world. Employment 
  will expand by 400. Surface transportation facilities are also 
  rapidly expanding. A large trucking company is building freight 
  terminals in three Florida cities for service to cities in the far 
  West. In Atlanta, a long delayed $50-million super truckstop will be 
  built on a 280-acre site.
     </p>
     <p>
      Less favorable developments include indications of slowness in 
  payments to milk producers in Florida. In Atlanta, an innovative 
  high-rise amusement park located in a new downtown office-hotel-retail-condominium complex has ceased operations; a six-month trial 
  period failed to achieve profitability. a major hotel chain has 
  decided to withdraw from managing a luxury hotel in another multi-use complex located near the downtown area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong savings and loan activity is reported throughout the 
  District. Healthy gains in savings inflows and in lending activity 
  are widely reported. In Florida, over a five-year period, deposits 
  at savings and loan associations have almost tripled; they have 
  risen during this period from about one-half the level of total 
  commercial bank deposits to approximately equal bank deposits.
