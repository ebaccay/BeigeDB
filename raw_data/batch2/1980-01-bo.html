      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 2, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in the First District report growing evidence of a 
slowing in economic activity. Retail sales are disappointing. In the 
manufacturing sector, business is generally good, but most firms 
have some product lines for which demand has weakened. Loan demand 
is no longer growing but remains at a high level; all banks 
contacted have ample funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The major retailers in New England report that Christmas sales are 
not good. A few have seen a pick up in the past few days but others 
have become more pessimistic. People are said to be rebelling 
against higher prices, although top quality items are selling well. 
The head of one large department store chain says he is very worried 
about the first half of next year. Despite the weakness most 
retailers do not expect to have serious inventory problems. Most had 
been managing their inventories cautiously; in addition they are 
reacting to the weakness with more promotions and reduced prices. 
There are more sales than normal for this time of year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity has leveled off. More firms are reporting 
that particular products are becoming difficult to sell; however, 
these same firms usually have some divisions which are doing well. A 
manufacturer of cooking stoves has seen a pronounced decline in 
demand; competitors have been trying to maintain sales volumes by 
cutting prices. Housing fixtures and other housing products are not 
selling as well as they were. The demand for cameras is said to be 
low for this time of year. At the same time, the electronics and 
aircraft industries are doing well, sales of industrial safety 
equipment are picking up after a period of weakness, and military 
business is extremely good. No one has seen a significant slowing in 
the rate of price increase for materials and parts, although a 
recent survey of local purchasing agents found that delivery lead 
times are shortening. All those contacted believe their inventories 
are under control.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banking respondents claim to have ample funds and most are seeking 
additional customers. However, one banker from northern New England 
believes that some of the banks in his area are heavily loaned and 
do not have enough liquidity; he expects some consolidations. Loan 
demand has softened but is still high. Residential mortgage demand 
has definitely weakened. Despite this decline several directors 
observed that the level of real estate activity remains high. An 
increasing number of people are thought to be using cash for home 
purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Houthakker and Samuelson were available for comment this 
month. Both respondents agree that a mild recession is underway, and 
both expect the economy to remain sluggish beyond the middle of next 
year. However, they disagreed about the consequences for the real 
economy of the latest round of OPEC oil price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Describing the economy's current performance as "obscure," Professor 
Houthakker nevertheless thinks that the available data indicate that 
a mild, but perhaps prolonged, recession has begun. In his view the 
recently announced OPEC price increases will have no major effect on 
either inflation or real output, so he argues that monetary policy 
need not be adjusted to the new oil price regime. While it is too 
early for a firm judgment on the effectiveness of the October 6 
policy switch, Houthakker believes that the current rate of M1 
growth of about 5 percent is consistent with an improvement in 
inflation without undue pressure on employment. Houthakker is 
hopeful that inflation will ease somewhat next year. He notes that 
there has been no acceleration in inflation as measured by the NIA 
deflators, and he expects a reduction in the rate of CPI increases 
in coming months as the extensive sales at the retail level induced 
by high inventory carrying costs are reflected in this index. 
Houthakker is concerned that recent rapid gold price increases may 
become "a self-fulfilling prophecy" that will contribute to the 
weakness of the dollar unless the nervousness in the gold market is 
alleviated. Since the October 6 actions were evidently not 
sufficient to reduce international anxiety over the dollar, he 
recommends that massive Treasury gold sales (perhaps as many as five 
million ounces) be undertaken in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Samuelson also expects a mild but prolonged recession. The 
recession will be mild because institutional reforms have apparently 
reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy for a given change in 
interest rates; it will be prolonged because the high rates do still 
weaken real activity eventually and because the latest round of OPEC 
price increases will sustain the pressure for tight macroeconomic 
policies. Samuelson thinks that the new monetary policy operating 
procedures may bring closer control of the aggregates. However, he 
notes that stabilizing the aggregates will not stabilize GNP as long 
as money demand continues to shift unexpectedly. Thus, it is too 
early to tell whether the greater control afforded by the new 
procedure will be an advantage over the at least partial 
adaptability to demand shifts automatically produced by the old 
procedure.
