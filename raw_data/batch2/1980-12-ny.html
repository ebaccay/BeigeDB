      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Second District was mixed in November. 
Retail sales were generally flat on a constant-dollar basis during 
the month. Foreign car sales picked up, but domestic car sales 
continued to stagnate. Outside the consumer sector, signs of 
weakness were spreading among machine toolmakers and in the steel 
industry. The respondents, for the most part, do not anticipate any 
major economic recovery before mid-1981. On the financial side, the 
suspension of usury ceilings in New York State is expected to raise 
rates sharply on personal borrowing and weaken demand for such 
loans. Strong demand for business loans was reported. In the 
mortgage market, financing has generally been available, but the 
demand weak because of the high rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the Second District advanced 
during November only because of price increases. After adjusting for 
inflation, retail sales were either flat or showed slight declines 
except for a few isolated areas of strength. There were reports of 
higher retail inventories, but these are not a source of concern at 
this time of year. Christmas sales are generally expected to show a 
moderate increase in nominal terms, but to be flat on a real basis. 
The recent removal of usury ceilings on most types of consumer 
borrowing in New York State is expected to be of little consequence 
for Christmas sales. Evaluations of the longer-term impact were 
uncertain, but retailers anticipate at least some negative effects, 
especially in cases where customers have maintained fairly high 
average balances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales in the Second District followed the pattern of the 
last few months. Imports have shown consistent strength, while 
domestic car sales have been generally stagnant, as consumers 
continue to show resistance to the high prices for the newly 
introduced small cars. Used car sales are still sluggish. Reactions 
to the lifting of state usury ceilings varied. Although some 
negative impact on car sales is anticipated, most dealers feel that 
the high auto prices will be the primary factor limiting sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Manufacturing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Outside the consumer sector, results were 
variable. In contrast to most other sectors, sales of paper products 
and chemicals were reported strong. The recent strength in 
chemicals, however, was credited to the respondent's aggressive new 
management and not to increased demand throughout the industry. 
Sales in the petroleum industry were down in November, continuing a 
year-long trend which has been attributed primarily to price 
increases. Demand for such items as digital watches and small 
calculators has been strong, but this was viewed in part as an 
indirect result of consumer reluctance to purchase large-ticket 
items. Inventories of durables were reported to be too high, and 
some cutback in production is anticipated early next year. Some 
machine toolmakers were reporting weakening sales, particularly for 
lower-priced items.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook of most District respondents remains 
bearish. Most expect no improvement in general economic conditions 
before the middle of 1981. Higher interest rates were cited as a 
principal cause of the sudden slowdown in the economy. Indeed, 
recent developments in interest rates have altered the outlook for 
the steel industry significantly because of its heavy dependence on 
plant and equipment spending and on the production of durable 
consumer goods. All of these are expected to be adversely affected 
by rising interest rates. Respondents also believe that the housing 
market will decline significantly because purchasers will be 
reluctant to make commitments at such high rates, although mortgage 
money will be available. In the business sector, borrowings by large 
firms from commercial banks at below prime rates are expected to 
increase. Respondents also observed that because industrial 
production is too high for the level of retail sales, inventories 
will begin to accumulate and this will add to the demand for 
business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the suspension of usury ceilings on 
personal loans effective December 1, consumers in New York State 
will pay sharply higher rates on personal borrowing. With rates of 
19 percent for unsecured loans and 18 percent for secured loans, 
demand for personal loans is expected to be weak. In the mortgage 
market, the December 4 rise in the discount rate has heightened 
concern over the availability of mortgage money. New commitment 
activity is down, though this is partially seasonal. Demand is weak 
throughout the region but is least sluggish in New Jersey. Although 
there was a net inflow of deposits at S&amp;Ls during November, 
following outflows the previous two months, mortgage lending is not 
expected to increase as a result. In the corporate sector, even 
though demand for business loans is strong, banks are still 
aggressively competing for loan customers. There seems to be little 
demand for capital improvement loans, strong demand for inventory 
financing, and some substitution of business loans for commercial 
paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Donald Riefler 
(Morgan Guaranty Trust Company), Francis Schott (Equitable Life 
Assurance Society), Albert Wojnilower (First Boston Company). Their 
views of course are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: The Fed's policy is beginning to work. Inflationary 
expectations as reflected in the commodity markets (and to some 
degree the stock market) are being adjusted downward. Before too 
long money supply numbers will also weaken. The long-term financial 
markets have shown remarkably good stability, given what has 
happened to short-term rates. It is important to remember two 
things: Markets do overshoot and interest rate levels are 
reversible. Because rates can come down, there is less reason to be 
fearful about the longer-term impact of today's interest rates on 
the economy. Prospects for autos and housing are not great, but 
otherwise spending should not fall precipitously in the months to 
come.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: A renewed slowdown in the economy—again led by housing and 
automobiles—is now in the making, provided the Federal Reserve 
sticks to the objective of curbing the growth of the aggregates. 
Interest rates in excess of previous peaks may be required to 
accomplish the objective, partly because there are no direct credit 
restraints and partly because some sectors of the financial market 
are still in a relatively liquid position. The alternative to 
restraint now is even more restraint later since underlying 
inflationary forces are very strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wojnilower: Economic activity is still expanding rapidly, though 
less so than a few weeks ago. Except for usury-related kinks in bank 
credit for autos, credit is freely available. There is virtually no 
institutional interest in long-term fixed-rate bonds, nor is such 
likely to revive in view of the impending conflict between fiscal 
and monetary policy.
