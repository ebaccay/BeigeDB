      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 16, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Most observers in the Seventh District believe a slowing in total 
  activity has already occurred. They believe that the second half 
  will see at best a level trend in real GNP. One observer expects a 
  decline in the fourth quarter at a 6 percent rate. Tight supplies of 
  oil products casts a pall over the future, both near and longer 
  term. Many business managers who accept this prognosis for the 
  general economy expect their own industries to continue to operate 
  at very high levels. Demand for most capital goods and their 
  components continues to tax capacity, but there are a few signs of 
  softness. Good workers are in short supply. Consumer buying appears 
  to have leveled off with sales of low-mileage vehicles down sharply.
  The farm sector is prosperous, with credit demands substantial. 
  Residential activity, both in new construction and transactions, is 
  off sharply.
       </p>
       <p>
        As far as we can determine, vehicle traffic in our district has not 
  been significantly affected by gasoline allocations. Doubtless some 
  auto trips have been deferred voluntarily. For May, the largest 
  marketer in the district is allowing dealers 80 percent of their 
  supply in May 1978. For a number of detailed reasons this is not 
  nearly so severe as it seems. However, dealers have shortened hours, 
  and some have limited purchases. A real test of the situation may 
  not occur until the Memorial Day week end. Diesel fuel also is 
  allocated for highway vehicles. Inventories of both motor fuel and 
  heating oil are uncomfortably low. The basic problem is reduced 
  crude oil imports with US firms refusing to bid the highest prices, 
  partly because of federal pressure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lead times on manufacturers' new orders continued to lengthen in 
  April. For some companies the main reason is inadequate 
  transportation, both rail and highway. Equipment of the right type 
  often is not available, on time and in sufficient quantity. Demand 
  for heavy trucks, trailers, freight cars, and locomotives remains 
  intense. A producer of heavy trucks placed a penalty on order 
  cancellations after a certain date and was surprised that only 5 
  percent of affected orders were canceled. Freight car component 
  capacity is being expanded, apparently on the belief that demand 
  will remain high in the 1980s. The truck strike of early April and 
  the more extended steel haulers' strike did not seriously affect 
  activity in the district, although temporary disruptions occurred.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for equipment for metalworking, materials handling, 
  construction, agriculture, and logging has held up well. Longer lead 
  times on certain equipment have caused customers to look abroad. 
  Castings and forgings are bottlenecks for various producers. Foreign 
  sourcing for such components has proved unsatisfactory in some 
  cases. Heat treating and welding capacity is fully utilized.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, capital equipment producers continue to report vigorous 
  growth with rising backlogs. However, a producer of small drives and 
  other components sold "off the shelf" says demand for these items, 
  which led the expansion, has softened. Sales of oil exploration 
  equipment have declined significantly. Producers of some types of 
  coal mining equipment are operating well below capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some steel companies are booked through the third quarter. Orders 
  for virtually all types are strong. Estimates of shipments for the 
  year have been raised. Competition from foreign steel has dropped 
  off as markets have strengthened abroad.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although intermittent layoffs were associated with the truck strikes 
  causing claims for unemployment compensation to rise, demand for 
  experienced and trainable workers continues to exceed supply. As in 
  1973-74, foundries are ready to hire "warm bodies" for this rather 
  disagreeable work. Through early May, help-wanted ads in Chicago 
  papers have been running about 20 percent above the advanced level 
  of a year earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales have varied substantially by line and establishment. 
  Credit use may have slowed somewhat, but large retailers report that 
  delinquencies remain at a low level. A very large retailer has been 
  reporting large declines in dollar volume from year ago with 
  inventories on the high side. Increased promotions and price cuts 
  are planned to boost sales. But other chains report sales to be at 
  budgeted levels with inventories under close control. Prices of 
  general merchandise, which had been rising at a rate of only 4 
  percent, are expected to accelerate to about 7 percent because of 
  increases for petrochemicals, natural fibers, rubber, and leather.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the lines that have weakened are appliances and furniture. 
  Fuel stringencies have depressed sales of recreational vehicles, 
  power boats, and light trucks. Sales of four-wheel drive trucks, in 
  short supply until quite recently, have declined precipitously.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although seasonal problems are still difficult to sort out, both new 
  residential construction and transactions in the resale market 
  appear to be significantly lower than year ago. Only half as many 
  residential building permits were issued in the Chicago area in the 
  first quarter as in the same period of last year, with single-family 
  homes down 58 percent. Total permits were slightly less than in the 
  very depressed period of 1975. These comparisons may be somewhat 
  improved in the second quarter because the January-February 
  experience was "dismal." Single-family homes are staying on the 
  market much longer than last year, partly because more offerings are 
  available. Desirable condos are selling well at steadily rising 
  prices. The going mortgage rate in the Chicago area has increased to 
  a record 10.5 percent, plus two points for fees. Loans are said to 
  be "available" at going rates, unlike the situation in earlier 
  periods of tight money. Usury ceilings are not an immediate problem 
  anywhere in the district, reflecting more flexible rules in certain 
  states.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sales of residential building materials, such as gypsum board and 
  insulation, are still setting new records, partly because of 
  nonresidential requirements. Ready-mix concrete companies are 
  working full blast to make up for a long period of weather-enforced 
  idleness during the winter. Order backlogs, in tonnage, are at 
  record levels. Ready-mix companies are choosing jobs carefully, 
  partly with an eye to the cost and availability of diesel fuel. 
  Structural steel demand is strong, but is not at record levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our survey of rural bankers indicates that District farmland values 
  averaged 2.4 percent higher in the first quarter, and now exceed 
  year-earlier level by 16 percent. The first quarter increase was one 
  of the smallest increases since 1972.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liquidity pressures are still very evident among rural banks, 
  despite robust farm earnings in recent months. Demand for farm loans 
  has been very strong. The first quarter rise in loan-to-deposit 
  ratios was unusually large.
       </p>
       <p>
        Interest rates charged on farm loans by rural banks have risen 1 
  percentage point in the last six months and 1.5 percentage points in 
  the past year. Seasoned bankers say they cannot recall a period when 
  rates on farm loans have risen so rapidly.
