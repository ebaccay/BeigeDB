      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from First District directors and businessmen indicate that 
the favorable experience of recent months is continuing. However, 
expectations of somewhat slower growth later in the year are 
widespread. Retail sales have remained strong. This has been 
reflected in increases in consumer loan demand, particularly the 
automobile component. Production seems to have declined slightly but 
this is attributed to summer vacations. New orders and capital 
spending appear to be up. Inventories are being watched closely but 
few think that they are excessively high.
      <p>
       Retail sales appear to have been very satisfactory in August. One of 
  the region's largest retailers reports a softening thus far in 
  September, but he does not expect this weakness to continue. 
  Reflecting the strong retail activity, several banks have seen 
  significant increases in consumer loan demand. Autos have accounted 
  for a large portion of the increase but all aspects have been 
  represented. The summer tourist season in northern New England was 
  the best within memory by a considerable margin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail inventories are being watched closely. One retailer thinks 
  that the successful summer may have caused buyers to be somewhat 
  over-optimistic and that the inventory level for the trade as a 
  whole may be too high. In manufacturing, inventories seem to have 
  risen slightly but they are not seen as excessive and most 
  purchasing agents plan to maintain current levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Production appears to have dropped slightly but this is attributed 
  to normal vacation shutdowns. New orders are increasing, 
  particularly for hardware products and capital goods. One respondent 
  reports that the shoe companies in his area are advertising for 
  workers for the first time in a long while. The region continues to 
  be very successful in securing defense contracts. The latest, 
  Sikorsky's contract for naval helicopters, will create new jobs in 
  both Connecticut and Massachusetts. In addition to the actual jobs 
  created, these contracts have boosted business morale considerably. 
  One negative aspect of the industrial picture, at least for northern 
  New England, occurs in the agricultural sector. Drought in northern 
  parts of the region will reduce the hay and corn crops with possible 
  adverse impacts on the dairy industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan volume is up. The increase is most marked in the southern 
  states where demand had been weak earlier. All categories have 
  shared in the increase: auto loans, consumer installment credit, 
  residential mortgages and commercial loans. Investment loans are 
  primarily for plant modernization and equipment replacement rather 
  than new building capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite their own relatively favorable experience, a number of 
  businessmen expect a slowdown in national growth in the second half 
  of the year. Several companies with forecasting units report that 
  projections for real GNP for the rest of this year and 1978 have 
  been revised downward. Weak capital spending caused by business 
  uncertainty seems to be an important consideration in this gloomier 
  outlook. Also, although it is not directly represented in the 
  region's economy, some New England businessmen are concerned about 
  the long-term future of the nation's steel industry. This concern is 
  justified according to one of our industrial consultants: large 
  capacity reductions at one major company and delayed expansions at 
  others could cause serious supply problems after 1980.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook for prices seems somewhat less pessimistic. Several 
  businessmen report that the rate of price increases seems to have 
  plateaued at an annual rate of 6-7 percent. Lumber prices, which had 
  been increasing very rapidly, are expected to rise at a much more 
  moderate rate in the future. According to a local consulting firm 
  recent price increases have been caused by the demand pull of very 
  strong housing demand in conjunction with the cost push of the 1972-73 increase in stump prices on public lands in the West. The 
  increase in stump prices did not become apparent until timber 
  available under old contracts was depleted. However, most of the 
  influence of both these demand and supply shifts is already 
  reflected in today's prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professors Samuelson, Tobin, Eckstein, and Houthakker were available 
  for comment this month. Samuelson and Tobin were most concerned 
  about the high risks of a growth recession in 1978. Samuelson 
  believes that the strength of the world recovery is so uncertain and 
  the prospects for more vigorous investment spending so tenuous that 
  the Fed should err, if at all, toward excess stimulus until the 
  outlook is more secure. Fearing that a loss of momentum will be 
  difficult to recover, Samuelson believes that a growth recession 
  could only contribute to the economy's lasting structural problems, 
  perhaps worsening the prospects for controlling future inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobin believes that increasing the federal funds rate further as the 
  pace of growth falls may constitute a mistimed policy. Business 
  confidence in the recovery is already fragile enough that the Fed 
  should avoid further restraint during the current slowdown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noting that private demand "has not fallen apart," Eckstein believes 
  economic growth will average just under 5 percent during the next 
  four quarters. The major uncertainties in the outlook are that 
  foreign demand for exports may deteriorate and that Federal 
  expenditures may fall well short of budget entitlements. Although 
  Eckstein believes that short-term interest rates can increase 50 to 
  75 basis points during the next four quarters, it is better for now 
  to hold the federal funds rate constant until the extent of the 
  slowdown in activity can be assessed with more certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Houthakker is "mildly satisfied" with recent economic performance, 
  and he does not believe that a major growth slump is likely in the 
  near future. The rate of inflation appears to be falling, and there 
  is no indication that price increases should re-accelerate in the 
  near future. Houthakker is critical of the recent instability in the 
  growth of Ml, however; the Fed appears to be increasingly unable to 
  meet its stated aggregate targets.
