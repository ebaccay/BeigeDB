      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 2, 1983
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary—A Better Look
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic picture in the Seventh District brightened 
significantly in the past six weeks. Morale has improved and more 
consumers and businesses are activating deferred spending plans. The 
recent monthly meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of a group of 
economists representing leading District companies was the most 
positive in at least two-and one-half years. Most of those present 
reported gains in demand and there were few new weaknesses. Also in 
October, purchasing managers' associations in Chicago and Milwaukee 
reported accelerating orders, output, and employment for September. 
Leadtimes on new orders have stretched out further, backlogs are 
rising, and more price increases are occurring. Retail sales are 
strong, but less so in the District than in the U.S. Inventories, in 
all but a few lines, remain lean, but are increasing in line with 
activity. Steel orders are rising, but still concentrated in the 
lighter grades. Residential construction plans have been dampened by 
high interest rates, probably more here than in the nation, but 
commercial construction has shown new strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       But Far Short of Prosperity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recent improvement in District activity should be kept in 
perspective. This region is still generally depressed. Its 
performance gap relative to the nation probably has widened during 
the recovery. Despite increased hirings, jobs are still hard to 
find. Where increases in demand for manufactured goods have been 
substantial, activity usually remains far below the peaks of the 
late 1970s. Agri-business remains very depressed despite prospective 
gains in farm income. The high value of the dollar continues as a 
powerful restraint on exports while encouraging imports. With the 
exception of a boom in truck trailers, orders for capital goods 
produced in the District have not improved much from the depression 
levels reached earlier in late 1982 or earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Improvement in Chicago and Milwaukee
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Monthly reports of purchasing managers in Chicago and Milwaukee have 
shown a gradual strengthening trend this year. In most respects, 
reports on September developments were the most vigorous of the 
year. Chicago managers found the area's economy "forging ahead," 
with "surging production" and "strong backlogs."  The Milwaukee 
report showed "substantial improvement" with the highest proportion 
of respondents reporting higher production and new orders than at 
any time since the monthly survey was started in 1969. This recent 
improvement was from a very low base. Activity is still far short of 
prosperous levels. Perhaps the most significant aspect of these 
reports is the evidence that badly eroded confidence is rebuilding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Jobs and Income
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment has increased gradually in the District since last 
December, but probably not as fast as in the nation. Total payroll 
employment in the five-state area is still about 9 percent below the 
level of 1978-79. Manufacturing is off about 22 percent. Hiring 
intentions surveys and help-wanted ad volume indicate further gains 
for the months ahead. Unemployment rates are down, but welfare rolls 
are at record levels. Many long-term unemployed who have lost 
medical insurance are relying on public health programs. Nonunion 
employers are planning wage and salary increases in the 5 1/2 to 6 
1/2 percent range for 1984, less than in past years, but 
surprisingly large in view of the weak job market. A number of long 
strikes are in progress in manufacturing, with unions resisting 
concessions on wages, benefits, and work rules. Chicago teachers 
settled a record 15-day strike on October 24, gaining a 5 percent 
salary boost, for which funds are not yet available. Their average 
salary is about $26,000 with liberal benefits. They eventually will 
be paid for all but one of the strike days.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for cars strengthened dramatically in the summer and 
continues unabated in October. Dealers speak of "desperate" 
shortages of popular cars. Stock-outs of large, rear-drive, 8-
cylinder cars have caused dealers to quote three-month delivery 
times--a situation unknown for many years. A similar problem exists 
for some Japanese models. Producers did not foresee this surge in 
demand for large cars. They are striving to boost production, 
hampered by some "quality problems."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Truck trailer producers are expected to operate at capacity well 
into 1984. Mostly, this reflects the new size limits, but analysts 
believe that underlying demand also is improving. Companies report 
scattered increases in demand for communications equipment, heavy 
trucks, materials handling equipment, and a variety of components. 
Sales of equipment for mining, rail transport, marine transport, 
construction, agriculture, and metalworking have remained poor. With 
some exceptions export demand is "terrible." Much good used 
equipment is available at bargain prices. Capital expenditures of 
most firms are concentrated on outlays for replacement and 
modernization, including computers and other electronic equipment, 
rather than major new facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders for steel have improved, but demand is still concentrated in 
lighter products with plates and structurals very slow. Order 
leadtimes for cold-rolled sheet and coated sheet are out three 
months, as far as bookings are taken. Some idle finishing capacity 
is being activated. Demand for steel for frames for trucks and large 
cars is strong. Shipments to service centers are up "sharply." 
Demand for oil pipe and railroad rails increased recently from very 
low levels. There is no evidence of inventory building by customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cold weather brought immediate gains in sales of fall and winter 
apparel. Consumers are in a confident mood and are using credit 
freely. According to big chains, sales are up less in the Midwest 
than in the rest of the nation. Inventories are tight and some sales 
may be lost if the Christmas season is strong, as is generally 
expected. Gains over last year's poor performance are likely to be 
substantial. Wholesale prices of general merchandise are expected to 
increase somewhat faster in 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction in the District continues well above last 
year's extremely depressed level, but has probably declined since 
midyear after allowance for seasonal trends Rates on fixed-rate, 
long-term mortgages are now in the neighborhood of 13.5 percent. 
Variable rate mortgages are offered at about 150 basis points less, 
but are shunned by most home buyers. A wide variety of plans are 
offered. A general easing of terms probably is necessary to keep 
residential construction from declining further.
