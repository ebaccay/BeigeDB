      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The nation's economic activity, as reported by the twelve District 
Banks, was generally slow during August and September. Only Dallas 
reported a relatively strong regional economy. Consumer spending was 
weak for most goods and services in most districts. Automobile 
sales, even with rebates and promotions, were strong in only three 
districts. Manufacturing orders and production were sluggish. Some 
inventories increased in some districts. Construction, particularly 
for new homes, was slow almost everywhere. Agricultural growing 
conditions were very good in most districts, and farm prices 
generally declined. The demand for most types of loans slowed, and 
the quality of loan portfolios at financial institutions 
deteriorated somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending generally has declined in most districts, with 
only a few bright spots. General merchandise sales are reported weak 
or mixed by nine districts, and San Francisco reports that even 
retail food sales are slowing in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of consumer durables, such as major appliances, have been 
languid in most of the nation. Sales are "down" in St. Louis, 
"disappointing" in Kansas City, "weak" in Cleveland, and similarly 
slow in many other districts. Only Dallas reports that appliances 
are "selling well."
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of automobiles have been stimulated by rebates, interest 
subsidies, and other promotions, but they are still low in most 
areas. Richmond calls auto sales "weak." Chicago notes that 
production schedules for the fourth quarter have been cut. Only 
Dallas, St. Louis, and New York have experienced strong auto sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some districts observe that certain other goods and services were 
selling well. St. Louis and Philadelphia report strong sales of 
electronic equipment and entertainment systems, such as video tape 
recorders; Philadelphia and Boston report a good showing in sales of 
soft goods, such as apparel; Dallas indicates that back-to-school 
sales were strong; and Minneapolis reports that tourist spending was 
good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing orders and production have been sluggish. Except for 
Philadelphia, all districts report that orders and production have 
been weak or declining. Boston attributes the weakness in 
manufacturing to the strong U.S. dollar making U.S. goods 
uncompetitive overseas. Minneapolis, St. Louis, Atlanta, and San 
Francisco attribute the weakness to the soft homebuilding industry, 
which has depressed the forest products industry. Cleveland and New 
York attribute it to cutbacks in capital spending; St. Louis 
attributes it to poor auto sales; and Chicago attributes it to both 
of these developments. Oil field equipment is the only product that 
has enjoyed strong orders and production.
     </p>
     <p>
      In spite of the sluggishness in new manufacturing orders, there are 
no reports of serious general increases in inventories. A few 
districts do report some build-ups. Minneapolis and Richmond report 
slight general inventory build-ups; Cleveland reports build-ups in 
steel; and Atlanta reports build-ups in forest products. Chicago, on 
the other hand, reports that inventories of certain manufactured 
products are below comfortable working levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction, particularly homebuilding, was weak in most districts. 
Home construction and sales were depressed almost everywhere. 
Atlanta, for example, reports that housing construction has been 
"reduced to a trickle" by high interest rates. St. Louis reports 
that single-family housing permits in the St. Louis area were down 
about 50 percent from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      In some areas, weak homebuilding activity was partially offset by 
strong commercial and industrial building. Dallas, Richmond, and 
Atlanta report vigorous activity in nonresidential building.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop production has been very good in most districts. Virtually all 
districts indicate that crops and harvests have been robust. 
Richmond expects gains over last year in peanuts, cotton, soybeans, 
and corn. St. Louis expects above average output in corn, soybeans, 
milo, and rice. Kansas City looks for record production in corn and 
near-record production in soybeans. Minneapolis anticipates a 20 
percent increase from last year's corn crop, which was harmed by 
drought.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm prices have generally declined. Minneapolis reports that cash 
grain and livestock prices since July have remained the same or 
declined. San Francisco reports that crop prices in its district 
have been depressed by the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on crop 
exports and by fears of the Mediterranean fruit fly infestation. The 
one exception to the soft farm prices is tobacco prices, which 
Richmond reports up 15 percent over last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      High interest rates and weak economic conditions appear to have 
slowed demand in most districts for most types of loans. Weak 
consumer or mortgage loan demand is reported by half the districts: 
Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San 
Francisco. Richmond and St. Louis report that business loan demand 
is easing. However, energy-related loan demand is reported as strong 
by Kansas City, Dallas, and Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      The quality of loan portfolios also has declined at financial 
institutions in some districts. Farmers in the Kansas City district 
are continuing to have trouble servicing their debt, and Dallas 
reports that its banks expect more carry-over loans this year 
because of low prices for grains and cotton. San Francisco reports 
that much of the business loan demand in its district is 
attributable to cash flow problems, and Boston reports that problem 
loans are showing up among home developers and home furnishing 
firms.
