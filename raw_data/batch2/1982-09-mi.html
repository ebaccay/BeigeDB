      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 29, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy has remained depressed. The construction 
industry continued in the doldrums, with the only signs of revival 
appearing in nonbuilding construction (work on highways, bridges, 
sewer and water facilities, and energy projects). The weak 
manufacturing, mining, and lumbering industries reported in the last 
Redbook did not improve in August or early September. Consumer 
spending remained weak. Farmers were still troubled by falling crop 
prices, and an early frost could substantially reduce their crop 
yields. As a result of these continued weaknesses in the real 
sectors, bank lending in the district remained sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District construction activity remained depressed. In the second 
quarter, for example, construction employment, which accounts for 
approximately 5 percent of district nonagricultural employment, was 
down 3 percent from a year earlier and 22 percent from the second 
quarter of 1979, construction's last good year. Nonbuilding 
construction has started to revive, but its impact has not been 
sufficient to offset the decline in the other sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonresidential Building
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weak commercial and industrial building has 
been holding down nonresidential building. Commercial and industrial 
building accounts for about 60 percent of the district's 
nonresidential building. According to F. W. Dodge, during the first 
seven months of this year, the dollar value of district 
nonresidential contract awards was down 8 percent from a year 
earlier and 13 percent from the first seven months of 1979. 
Conversations with builders, industrial developers and realtors from 
throughout the district confirm the shrinkage in contract awards. 
Most of them describe commercial and industrial building as slow. 
For example, the marketing director of a large Minneapolis builder 
says that his firm's business this year is down about 50 percent 
from a year ago. Commercial and industrial building activity is 
still considered good, however, in Billings, Montana, and in St. 
Cloud and Rochester, Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      An immediate pickup in commercial and industrial building is not 
likely because excess space exists and interest rates are still too 
high. Our contacts think that many businesses do need additional 
space and that now is a good time to obtain it; new commercial and 
industrial building prices are presently very attractive. But 
interest rates, they believe, are still too high for businesses to 
take advantage of favorable construction prices. Two executives with 
large Minneapolis builders indicate that long-term interest rates 
would have to drop another two percentage points and stay down for 
several months for any significant pickup in commercial and 
industrial building to occur. Also, for certain types of commercial 
and industrial building, excess space is a problem. The current 
vacancy rate for office buildings in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
suburbs, for example, is 15 percent, more than twice the 6 to 7 
percent rate that realtors consider normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Building
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential building has also been very weak, 
and recent home sales suggest no immediate improvement. The number 
of district housing units authorized by building permits during the 
first six months of this year was 23 percent below the number 
authorized a year earlier and 56 percent below the number authorized 
in the first half of 1979. Homebuilding is not likely to pick up 
soon, because consumers have simply not been buying homes. According 
to the Minneapolis Board of Realtors, August home sales in 
Minneapolis and its suburbs were down 28 percent from a year ago. 
Although no immediate rebound is likely, homebuilding could pick up 
in several months. Our Bank directors and district realtors indicate 
that the recent interest rate declines have substantially increased 
shopping, if not buying.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonbuilding
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In contrast to residential and nonresidential 
construction, nonbuilding construction, although still depressed, 
has shown signs of reviving. During the first eight months of this 
year, contracts for highways, bridges, and sewer and water 
facilities in Minnesota and the Dakotas were still 21 percent below 
their level in the first eight months of 1979, but they were 11 
percent above their level in those months last year. This component 
got an additional boost when contracts were let earlier this year 
for a $1.2 billion coal gasification plant in North Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The weak manufacturing, mining, and lumbering industries reported in 
our last Redbook have yet to show any evidence of recovery. The 
slowdown in manufacturing orders and production appears to have 
continued, and district firms have still been curtailing operations 
and laying off workers. For example, the district's only auto 
assembly plant closed for a week in mid-September, and a large 
Wisconsin manufacturer of heating and cooling equipment recently 
laid off 250 workers. Also, lumber production remained depressed in 
August and early September, and although some iron mines have 
resumed production, others have extended previously announced 
shutdowns.
     </p>
     <p>
      The district was fortunate that the recent rail strike disrupted 
very little industrial activity. Minneapolis-St. Paul business 
executives have actually been more upset by the prospect of lost 
revenues due to the NFL players' strike. In Minneapolis, this strike 
could prevent a planned reduction in a hotel and liquor tax which 
was imposed to pay for our new $55 million domed stadium.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumers' reluctance to spend has slowed the recovery of auto and 
other retail sales. Major Minneapolis-St. Paul retailers and our 
Bank directors report that back-to-school sales were disappointing. 
Furthermore, the recent declines in interest rates and increases in 
stock prices have not relieved the previously reported sluggishness 
in furniture and automobile sales. One major Twin Cities retailer 
calls August furniture sales "lousy." And a regional sales manager 
for a large domestic automobile manufacturer indicates that recent 
developments have not spurred car sales. In fact, his firm's sales 
in Minnesota and the Dakotas declined more than seasonally between 
July and September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Declining crop prices have continued to trouble district farmers. An 
announcement in August by the USDA, that corn and soybean harvests 
would be larger than expected, pushed down already weak crop prices. 
Between July and September, cash prices for soybeans, corn, and 
wheat in Minneapolis declined 12, 8, and 5 percent, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Livestock prices have exhibited a mixed pattern. Lower crop prices 
increased the attractiveness of feeding livestock, which has helped 
to keep feeder cattle prices at their midsummer levels. Also, hog 
prices have remained at the high level reached this summer. 
Increased slaughter cattle supplies, however, have pushed the prices 
of these livestock down; and in mid-September in South St. Paul, 
they reached their lowest level in 18 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to price problems, district corn and soybean farmers 
also have major concerns about the weather. Due to wet weather 
delaying spring planting, district crops are maturing later than 
usual. Normally, for example, about 50 percent of Minnesota's corn 
crop is mature by mid-September. This year only 23 percent is ready 
for harvest. A frost in the next few weeks (a distinct possibility) 
could substantially reduce yields. Although reduced yields in the 
district would ease the storage problem discussed in our last 
Redbook, they would not significantly affect prices because the 
district's share of total U.S. production of corn and soybeans is 
small. Thus, until crops are harvested, district farmers are faced 
with the possibility of a bleak scenario: low crop prices, which are 
virtually certain, and poor crop yields which will depend on the 
vagaries of the weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Bank Lending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As reported in our last Redbook, these weaknesses in the district 
economy continued to be reflected in sluggish bank lending. In mid-September, lending at district member banks did not increase from 
its weak level of early August.
