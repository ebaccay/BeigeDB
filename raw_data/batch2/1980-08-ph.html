      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 5, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District in July point to a slowdown in 
business activity. Manufacturers in the District say industrial 
activity has taken another large drop this month, and retailers 
report sales to be even with a year ago. As for the future, 
manufacturers anticipate an upward swing six months from now, but 
retail merchants expect sales to remain flat through year-end. In 
the financial sector, C&amp;I; loan volume is up, but remains below plan. 
Forecasts indicate little change through year-end as the recession 
bottoms out.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers responding to the July Business Outlook Survey report 
another significant drop in area industrial activity. July seasonal 
factors have combined with the continuing downturn to produce the 
largest one-month drop in general business activity since December 
1974. Both new orders and shipments have taken a sharp dip and 
producers' backlogs continue to shrink. Inventory trimming has 
resumed, after a temporary halt last month, and the employment 
situation has worsened somewhat. Both payrolls and the average 
workweek have declined significantly.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, survey participants expect an upward swing in 
general business activity six months from now. New orders and 
shipments are expected to increase and manufacturers are planning to 
add to inventories although only marginally. The brightened outlook 
may be good news for labor as respondents expect to maintain the 
current level of factory employment and lengthen the average 
workweek.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices are up again in July in the industrial sector. Input costs 
are higher for about 40 percent of the survey participants and 
approximately 30 percent report charging higher prices for their 
finished goods. As for the future, nearly 80 percent of the 
respondents expect to be paying more for raw materials and 70 
percent plan price hikes for their products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area retailers report no change in sales in July as compared to the 
sales levels of July 1979. Local merchants had anticipated this 
slowdown though, and planned conservatively, so inventory-sales 
ratios are "in line." Sales of soft goods, particularly men's and 
women's apparel, are strong while big ticket items are still very 
sluggish. An exception to this, however, is air conditioners which, 
owing to the recent heat wave, are in high demand. Suburban stores 
are doing a little better than the center city stores with sales up 
slightly over last year, owing to longer operating hours and a 
differing market. Credit sales are down slightly but area retailers 
expect a turn-around of credit sales as the credit situation is 
resolved and stabilizes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers continue to plan cautiously as sales are expected to 
remain flat through year-end, despite December Christmas buying. 
Local merchants plan no changes in inventories. A steady, no-growth 
schedule will be followed as retailers hope to keep their inventory-
sales ratios healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers report mixed activity in July. Reports of C&amp;I; loan 
volume range from 3 to 11 percent over year ago figures, but are 
generally below plan. Consumer loans, on the other hand are down, 
and are expected to decline even further. Looking ahead to the next 
six months, most contacts are forecasting little change between now 
and year-end as the recession bottoms out.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks in the Third District are currently quoting a prime rate of 11 
percent. Projections of the prime indicate a continued drop, leaving 
the rate 100 to 200 basis points below its current level by year-
end. Deposits are up moderately at commercial banks as corporate 
customers increase their deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Summer business at Pennsylvania and New Jersey vacation spots is 
reported to be very strong this year as compared to 1979, according 
to spokesmen from the New Jersey shore, Pocono Mountain resorts, and 
area theme parks. Excellent fishing and high gas prices have kept 
vacationers close to home this year, benefiting the local resort 
areas. Tourist volume at the New Jersey shore is up 20 to 25 percent 
over 1979, with occupancy running 90+ percent. Pocono Mountain 
tourist trade is reported to be between 30 and 50 percent higher 
than last year and executives at the area's major amusement parks 
report that their business is up also, about 9 percent over last 
year. Despite the increase in the number of vacationers, however, 
less money than expected is being spent at most resorts, owing to 
the current recession and the drain to the Atlantic City casinos. 
The total effect of the casinos is unclear though. Many food and 
service dollars that might be spent widely over South Jersey are 
going to Atlantic City instead. However, Atlantic City cannot offer 
adequate accommodations for all its customers, and the spillover is 
often absorbed by the surrounding shore spots, giving their business 
a boost. A spokesmen from the Pocono Mountain Vacation Bureau 
reports a loss of their market to Atlantic City, as well, mainly 
senior citizens, but the gap is filled by more families and single 
people who are still keeping their business strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the rest of the season, officials at the summer vacation 
resorts are optimistic and expect to continue to increase their 
volume as they head into the peak of the summer season. Advance 
reservations in the shore area are booked as far ahead as late 
September to mid-October and the convention trade in Atlantic City 
looks good. Given continued good weather, entertainment park 
operators are striving to maintain the strong and steady trade they 
are presently experiencing.
