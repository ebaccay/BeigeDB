     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 11, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity across the Second District is somewhat mixed 
according to directors and other business leaders contacted 
recently. While the consumer sector appears to be relatively strong, 
inventory levels remain on the high side, and the outlook for 
capital spending is mixed with little indication of a significant 
step-up of planned plant and equipment outlays. Concerns over the 
prospective rate of recovery of the District's western region due to 
the large cutbacks by the steel industry appear to have been 
intensified by sizable harvest losses caused by adverse weather. On 
the financial front, the sluggishness in business loan demand 
persists.
      <p>
       Retail sales increased moderately in September in the wake of an 
  exceptionally strong August gain. Several department store 
  executives expressed satisfaction with the sales activity in the New 
  York and New Jersey branches. Among product lines, both household 
  furnishings and women's apparel appear to have maintained strength, 
  although in the latter instance, some resistance to this season's 
  higher prices was noted by several merchants. The controller of a 
  major chain credited Sunday store openings with helping to improve 
  sales activity in New York. He noted that since Sunday openings were 
  legalized a year ago, these sales have accounted for an increasing 
  proportion of total sales. In general, merchants as well as 
  executives of other consumer-related businesses expected favorable 
  sales developments in coming months. Based on strong inflow of 
  orders, the chairman of a national manufacturer of photo equipment 
  reported that the consumer sales outlook appeared good. Brightening 
  sales prospects were also suggested by telephone and newspaper 
  executives who reported strong pickups in retail advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
       Area auto dealers reported good sales in September. A rebound in the 
  used car market led the advance, apparently as fears over 
  prospective energy legislation dissipated. New car sales were 
  characterized as "strong," although several respondents expressed 
  concern over the effect the higher prices on new models will have on 
  sales in coming months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventories remained on the high side. In the retail sector, most 
  executives professed little concern over high levels of stocks, 
  judging them not to be unreasonably out of line with sales prospects 
  for the fall and Christmas seasons. Outside of retailing, 
  respondents were generally less sanguine in assessing their 
  inventory positions. A textiles executive expressed concern that 
  excessive inventories were accumulating in his industry. Several 
  respondents in the chemical and petrochemical industries reported 
  higher-than-desired stocks. The treasurer of a major nonferrous 
  metals company reported a similar backing up of inventories, 
  although at least part of the stockpiling had been in anticipation 
  of aluminum price increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital spending plans for 1978 remain mixed. While responses varied 
  among industries and firms, several directors foresaw expenditures 
  for next year to be on a level approximately equal to that in 1977. 
  At one extreme, plant and equipment spending by the steel industry 
  is being curtailed sharply. Capital spending by farmers in western 
  New York State is also likely to be reduced because of the heavy 
  crop losses they suffered due to the past month's unusually heavy 
  rainfall. Several machine tool manufacturers related that as a 
  consequence of weakness in new orders and bookings, they will limit 
  their new capital investment. The president of one large chemical 
  company reported that due to overcapacity his firm's spending would 
  be shifted to maintenance and conservation rather than expansion, 
  while the chairman of another chemical company felt the instability 
  in the economy was undermining the growth of capital spending. 
  Several other business leaders across New York State indicated that 
  they had no plans to expand production facilities during the coming 
  year. In addition to uncertainty over the outlook for demand, a 
  leading apparel executive also cited the high cost of raising funds 
  as a reason for lagging capital investment in his industry. At the 
  other extreme, one major nonferrous metal fabrication firm has 
  greatly increased its capital outlays in upstate New York due in 
  part to substantial improvement in its cash position. The chairman 
  of a major petroleum company also expected his industry to continue 
  its relatively high rate of capital spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       With few exceptions, business loan demand at Second District Banks 
  has remained sluggish. Moreover, the leading bankers contacted did 
  not expect any substantial pickup in the near term because of the 
  strong liquidity position of potential borrowers. Several financial 
  analysts attributed at least some of the weakness in loan demand at 
  commercial banks to increased competition of commercial finance 
  companies in servicing the credit needs of small- and medium-sized 
  businesses. In other banking developments, upstate directors noted 
  that individual savings show steady growth and that installment 
  lending continues at a high level. And the president of a leading 
  New Jersey bank reported that mortgage loan demand has risen sharply 
  in his area.
