      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Activity in the Seventh District apparently continued to rise in the 
  summer, allowing for plant-wide vacations, and other seasonal 
  developments. Employment and retail sales remain vigorous. 
  Inventories are generally in good balance, and procurement problems 
  are minimal for most businesses. Prospects remain favorable for 
  overall growth in capital spending. Although shortages are 
  infrequent, important sectors are operating at virtual capacity, and 
  there is little overall slack in the economy. Housing appears to 
  have been much less affected by tight credit than had been feared. 
  Crops are developing at an excellent rate. Farmland values increased 
  substantially in the second quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        A frequently expressed view holds that a recession will begin late 
  in 1978 or early in 1979. Little or no evidence of current weakness 
  is offered to support this position. In fact, a number of sectors 
  are doing better than had been expected a few months ago, including 
  housing, steel, paperboard, retail trade, transportation, and 
  agriculture.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumers are using credit liberally to buy goods and services. 
  Retailers who follow developments very closely find no evidence that 
  delinquencies have increased. Airline travel continues at a "phenomenal" pace with July 18 percent above year ago. Credit card 
  travel is up 35 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except for special castings and certain building materials, there 
  are few serious procurement problems. Nevertheless, there is not 
  much slack in the general economy. Competent workers are hard to 
  find, and job hopping is on the rise. The railroads, truckers, and 
  airlines are operating at or near capacity. Order backlogs for 
  transportation equipment of virtually all types are up sharply. 
  Other sectors operating at virtual capacity include machine tools, 
  construction equipment, paperboard, aluminum, oil refining, cement, 
  gypsum, and, in the case of one major producer, steel. The failure 
  of basic industries to expand, or even to maintain capacity in 
  recent years, may preclude faster growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        A freight car producer booked a record volume of new orders in the 
  second quarter. Demand for heavy trucks and trailers has been at or 
  near record levels, partly because of diversions of traffic from 
  rail. At one plant producing heavy trucks, 1,000 workers continued 
  to work during the plant-wide vacation to finish units in need of 
  special work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports that steel orders had slipped in early July proved to be 
  unfounded, except for oil country goods where inventories had been 
  boosted by a 50 percent rise in shipments in the first half. Demand 
  is broadly based. One analyst reports steel demand this summer to be 
  the strongest since l974.
       </p>
       <p>
        Forecasts of 1978 sales of cars and trucks have been raised 
  recently. Sales of cars and light trucks are expected to be about as 
  large next year. Heavy truck sales, however, are expected to decline 
  from current "artificially" high levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Large S and Ls have been using T-CDs effectively to stanch the 
  outflow of funds. Mortgage rates have leveled off in the 9.75 to 10 
  percent range. Transactions in existing houses have held up well. 
  There is no significant overhang of unsold new housing units, as in 
  l973-74. In fact, many builders are behind on completions because of 
  shortages of materials, and (more frequently mentioned now) skilled 
  labor. Residential permits for the Chicago area were above year ago 
  in June, after pronounced weakness in earlier months.
       </p>
       <p>
        The City of Chicago's sale of tax-exempt bonds for relending on 
  properties in the city has been hailed as a useful step to arrest 
  urban decay. However, less than $100 million has been raised, and 
  mortgage volume in the city exceeds $1 billion annually. Mortgage 
  funds offered at 8 percent were quickly absorbed by a swarm of 
  applicants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prospects for commercial and industrial buildings are favorable into 
  1979. Orders for fabricated structural steel, construction 
  contracts, and announced plans support this view. Thirteen large 
  office buildings and four expansions are underway, or definitely 
  planned, for Chicago's downtown area. These projects would add 12 
  million square feet of space, or 20 percent, to the inventory. 
  Vacancies are very low in high-grade structures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite a late start, corn and soybean crops are developing nicely 
  throughout the district. If estimates of large yields prove correct, 
  storage facilities will be inadequate because much of the 1977 crop 
  is still on hand. With higher prices for crops and livestock, the 
  prosperous farm situation is in sharp contrast to the conditions 
  that brought on the "farmers' strike" last winter. Farm equipment 
  sales have picked up dramatically, and production schedules have 
  been raised. Loan repayment problems at country banks have improved 
  further, especially in Iowa. (Delinquencies on equipment loans by 
  captive finance companies had not increased significantly at any 
  time.) Our survey of country bankers shows average farmland values 
  rising 4 percent in the second quarter to a level 8 percent above 
  year ago. The rise in farmland values is especially marked in 
  Wisconsin where purchases for nonfarm purposes are relatively more 
  important.
       </p>
       <p>
        Virtually all manufacturers took scheduled plant-wide vacations in 
  July and August, despite rising backlogs in some cases. Plant 
  shutdowns are so widespread as to hamper analysis of underlying 
  trends. Managers frequently take vacations at the same time as the 
  plant work force.
