      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The sharp rebound in economic activity in the Fourth District 
appears to have slowed in recent weeks. Auto retailers report 
continued strong gains, but sales of other consumer goods slowed 
from the rapid March pace. Withdrawal of the tax rebate has resulted 
in some scaling down of consumer spending projections for the 
balance of 1977, but retailers are still cautiously optimistic over 
sales. Primary metals producers indicate the February-March surge in 
orders has tended to flatten. Recovery in capital goods appears to 
be broadening. The Administration's energy proposals are unlikely to 
have much affect on capital spending plans for 1977. Energy 
intensive consumers, as well as energy producers, generally feel the 
Administration's energy proposals have added to the list of 
uncertainties facing private decision-makers. Despite a recent drop 
in consumer confidence reported in the Sindlinger survey, auto 
dealers uniformly describe last month's new car sales as being as 
strong as in March. Cancellation of the tax rebate and announcement 
of the energy program had no effect on new car sales according to 
three dealers. One dealer noted an increase in small-car sales 
following announcement of the President's energy program, another 
dealer noted a tendency by buyers to trade down from standard- to 
intermediate-size cars, but not to compact or subcompact cars as 
they did following the oil embargo. Dealers also felt the standard-size cars continued to sell well because most of these cars would 
qualify for a rebate; the proposed tax on less energy-efficient 
luxury models would not be large enough to deter high-income buyers.
      <p>
       Retailers report mixed consumer goods sales for April. An economist 
  with a large national department store chain headquartered in the 
  District tended to dismiss the recent drop in consumer confidence as 
  having little predictive value. However, he lowered estimates of GAF 
  sales in 1977 by 1 1/2 percentage points because of cancellation of 
  the rebate, the bulk of which was expected to have been used for 
  food and CAF merchandise. He expects strengthened real sales of 
  furniture and appliances this fall. Another official with a large 
  department store chain described sales as good, adding that he had 
  not detected signs of consumer reaction to the rebate cancellation. 
  Nor does he see indications that consumers are less confident or 
  more hesitant in their buying. He noted that consumers responded 
  favorably to the President's energy message through increased 
  purchases of storm doors, insulating materials, and other types of 
  energy-related merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officials of two national food chains headquartered in the District 
  reported softness in food sales during April. Sales for groceries, 
  meats, and bakery products, have not improved despite several 
  promotional programs. They did not believe slower sales were related 
  to cancellation of the rebate, nor have they adjusted expectations 
  of 1977 sales downward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Primary metals producers report orders have tended to flatten, 
  following a sharp rebound since February. In part, this is 
  associated with a full-order book through June for both flat-rolled 
  steel and aluminum products. The steel industry is expected to 
  operate at about 85 percent capacity this quarter, compared with the 
  low 70's last quarter. Operating rates in the aluminum industry may 
  slip to the mid 80's this quarter because of cutbacks in power in 
  the West. Steel sources indicate that some price hedging and 
  inventory rebuilding account for this quarter's strengthening in 
  orders and production.
      </p>
      <p>
       More capital goods producers are experiencing recovery. Printing and 
  communication equipment orders continue to accelerate and one large 
  producer noted orders were nearly 50 percent above his firm's 
  current shipping rate. A parts supplier for heavy-duty trucks and 
  off-highway equipment reports that orders have expanded strongly 
  since February. Machine tool orders apparently have strengthened 
  after leveling out earlier in the year. Sales of excavators and 
  other construction machinery are increasing. On the other hand, 
  orders from utilities, especially for generators and turbines, 
  remain weak; demand is also slack for intermediate-size trucks, farm 
  tractors, and oil field equipment for secondary recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumers and producers of energy commented uniformly that the 
  Administration's energy program is unlikely to spur capital spending 
  plans for 1977, but some felt that it could delay spending. 
  Respondents were reluctant to consider effects on spending plans for 
  1978 and future years because of inadequate information and 
  widespread belief that the program stands little chance of 
  Congressional approval in its present form. At a meeting of 18 chief 
  financial officers from Pittsburgh-based firms held by this Bank on 
  May 6, several officials contended that the Administration's program 
  adds another uncertainty to investment decisions. Threat of controls 
  over intrastate gas prices, uncertainty over whether EPA standards 
  on use of coal will be relaxed, and lack of incentive to stimulate 
  energy supplies were among major aspects of uncertainty cited by 
  these officials. Short-run bottlenecks in electric power and other 
  energy sources will likely surface over the next few years because 
  of uncertainties and lack of investment incentives that have held 
  back spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy intensive users, especially in primary metals, forgings and 
  chemicals stressed that adoption of conservation practices since 
  OPEC have gradually reduced their consumption of energy. Some steel 
  producers commented that for the last four years they have been 
  working toward improving supplies and reducing consumption of energy 
  by building coal reserves, by installing new coke ovens which 
  produce greater amounts of coke-oven gas, by drilling for natural 
  gas, and by building storage facilities for oil and propane. In view 
  of limited cash flow and increased debt, some producers see 
  insufficient incentive in present proposals to accelerate plant and 
  equipment expenditures. An official with a major aluminum producer 
  said his firm can convert some plants from natural gas to coal, but 
  it may not be economically feasible because of pollution control 
  requirements. He acknowledged the need for both conversion and 
  replacement of facilities, but said this is expensive relative to 
  the price of aluminum products. He also indicated his firm has 
  experimental plans to use lignite as a source of power. An economist 
  with a major plastics producer, who stated his firm also has adopted 
  energy conservation measures, fears that the proposed price control 
  on intrastate gas will continue to limit natural gas supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, several energy producers in the District report they see 
  little in Administration proposals that will spur investment in the 
  near-term. Officials with two oil producers in the District and one 
  small natural gas producer commented that while the program's 
  emphasis on conservation is necessary and desirable, it lacks 
  incentives to expand supplies and introduces more, rather than 
  fewer, controls and regulations. They, too, indicated their firms 
  have adopted measures to improve fuel consumption. One official 
  cited improvements in petrochemical and refining facilities since 
  1973, noting that the tax credit will not hurt acceleration of that 
  trend. He questioned, however, the amount of additional savings that 
  can be realized. Two natural gas producers said that the roll-back 
  in natural gas prices and proposed regulation of intrastate prices 
  adds new uncertainties to investment decisions. One commented, 
  however, that even if wellhead prices of natural gas were set at 
  $1.85 per thousand cubic feet, his company would still increase the 
  number of new wells to be drilled this year to 70 (compared with 60 
  last year), assuming drilling and exploration costs do not increase 
  any faster than currently anticipated. An oil producer feared that 
  if conservation efforts failed to curb consumption, mandatory 
  controls and additional regulation would be instituted. The shift to 
  coal is too sudden. It is unlikely according to this official, that 
  his firm's capital budget for 1977 will be changed because of 
  present energy proposals. According to estimates derived from its 
  energy model, the oil producer estimates that real investment in 
  1978 would be about $1.5 billion less than expected without the 
  energy program and $2.7 billion less in 1979, that real GNP would 
  grow by 1 percentage point less in 1980, and that the rate of 
  inflation in 1980 would be 1 percentage point higher than estimates 
  without the energy program.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal of 1.1 billion tons of coal can be met by 1985, according 
  to an official with one of the nation's largest mines headquartered 
  in the District. He pointed out that this year the industry will 
  produce about 675 million tons of coal with capacity for about 775 
  million tons, and that output has been rising steadily since the oil 
  embargo. While acknowledging short-run shortages in freight cars, he 
  expects this problem will be overcome as demand increases. He also 
  noted a growing effort in research and development to improve coal 
  technology, and that one large company has already found a way to 
  remove sulphur from coal at about one-half the cost of present 
  scrubbers.
