      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The District economy has bloomed with the warmer weather. Florida 
  tourism was extremely good through the spring holidays. Finance 
  companies have reopened in Tennessee. Consumers spent freely in 
  March, but retailers are reserving judgment on spring sales for the 
  time being; auto sales have continued to improve. There's no letup 
  in sight for oil and gas exploration. Housing reports have 
  frequently mentioned extensive home improvement activity. The 
  outlook for nonresidential construction has brightened, but 
  uncertainties about energy supplies and prices temper optimism. 
  Higher prices for farm products have boosted farm incomes. 
  Businessmen are universally concerned about inflation.
       </p>
       <p>
        All parts of Florida enjoyed an excellent holiday tourist business, 
  with hotel and motel occupancy rates near or at 100 percent. Tampa 
  noted the best season since 1973; visitors to northwest Florida set 
  a record; Eastern Airlines' passenger arrivals and departures at 
  Melbourne Regional Airport surpassed previous highs by a sizable 
  margin. Disney World closed its gates early on several days when 
  attendance reached capacity. In southeast Florida, car rentals, 
  restaurant business, and race track attendance passed Easter 1977 
  levels by nearly 20 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the removal of Tennessee's constitutional usury ceiling took 
  effect on April 1, finance companies reopened to face a flood of 
  credit applications. They're now loaning at 18-27 percent. The 
  state's banks seemed relieved to get out of the small loan business, 
  and several set minimums of $1,000. It's generally expected that the 
  banks will return to pre-August consumer lending practices, although 
  some hope to maintain the stricter standards for small borrowers 
  that developed in the seven-month credit slowdown. Many lenders 
  want to resume charging interest rates in excess of 10 percent on 
  loans made prior to the court ruling that declared them 
  unconstitutional; the State Securities Director has said no, but the 
  State Department of Banking will rule on the issue shortly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales have apparently been fairly brisk in most areas. But 
  since the early Easter stimulated March sales, many retailers are 
  waiting for April sales figures before they judge the strength of 
  spring spending. Car sales have revived quickly in the past few 
  weeks; modest to moderate gains from the strong year-earlier pace 
  are indicated. A few dealers, mainly in Florida, have complained 
  that low stocks have restrained sales all through the first quarter, 
  but current District-wide inventories appear to be at normal levels. 
  Some expect a shortage of large models by early summer; GM dealers 
  hope that their "big season" (May and June) will help make up for 
  the styling resistance they've encountered thus far in the model 
  year. Used car markets remain active; the reopening of finance 
  companies in Tennessee has spurred these sales to a pitch that one 
  director characterized as "wild." Sales of trucks, both small and 
  large, are heavy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The onshore drilling boom continues in Louisiana. Rig activity in 
  the first quarter was the heaviest since 1957; completions and 
  workovers were actually stronger than drilling. Only the rig supply 
  is likely to limit activity this year. Offshore in the Gulf, 
  drilling has been intense but probably won't reach boom proportions 
  for a year or so, depending on wellhead prices of natural gas. Pipe-
  laying and construction are surprisingly active. The turnout for the 
  recent sale of Atlantic Coast leases was small, as expected; $151 
  million was bid for 57 of the 224 sites offered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Home builders remain optimistic that 1978 construction will surpass 
  the 1977 pace. The outlook for single-family homes is good, but 
  apartments and condominiums are expected to be the growth sectors in 
  metropolitan areas. Climbing prices have prompted some builders to 
  begin omitting frills on new homes in the Miami area. Several 
  directors from throughout the District commented on the strength of 
  repairs, remodeling, and additions to existing homes. Funds for home 
  improvement loans are plentiful and being pushed by banks. Sales of 
  garden supplies, nursery plants, "do-it-yourself" items, and 
  furniture have been reported as heavy, too.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial and industrial construction is expected to take up any 
  slack that may occur in housing in late 1978. In several major 
  cities, office vacancy rates have declined to the point where real 
  estate analysts foresee a revival of building in the near term. In 
  some areas, particularly Alabama, the prospect for utilities 
  construction is rather dim, as the investment required for new 
  facilities is becoming prohibitively huge. The inadequacy of present 
  capacity for large industrial users has already deterred prospective 
  plant relocations in the state. However, the construction of a giant 
  $135-million terminal to receive imported liquefied natural gas off 
  the coast of Georgia will help ensure District supplies of that 
  fuel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Builders continue to experience shortages of construction materialsâ€”cement, insulation, fabrics, sheetrock, and bricks. Deliveries 
  have been extended for pipes, valves, and construction equipment. 
  The only oversupply problem of late has been farm machinery.
       </p>
       <p>
        A shortage of rainfall has delayed plantings in many areas of the 
  District and provoked forest fires in the timberlands of 
  Mississippi. Beef and soybean prices have shown particular strength. 
  Higher soymeal and corn prices have put upward pressure on feed 
  costs, but fertilizer prices have been falling. Cotton prices turned 
  down in late March when the early responses to new land-diversion 
  provisions indicated that they would be ineffectual in reducing 
  acreage. Florida grapefruit growers recently approved a new tax to 
  raise advertising funds in hopes of shoring up slow demand. In 
  contrast to the decline reported a month ago, orange juice demand 
  appears now to be near normal levels, though prices continue at a 
  record high. South Florida vegetable growers have expressed concern 
  over dumping of Mexican produce.
       </p>
       <p>
        Georgia-Pacific projects an 8 to 10-percent increase in plywood and 
  lumber prices in 1978 without the erratic movements of last year. A 
  Tennessee director remarked that paper prices are rising so rapidly 
  that mills won't quote prices until orders are received. She blames 
  limited supplies and an advance in demand generated by an uptrend in 
  advertising. Consumers are paying higher spring electric bills, as 
  utilities pass on the costs incurred in providing normal services 
  during the coal strike. Inflation is far and away the greatest worry 
  of the District's business leaders.
