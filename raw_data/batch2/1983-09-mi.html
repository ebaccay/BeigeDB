      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 20, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of a dip in real estate and related activities, 
the economic recovery continues despite higher interest rates. 
Consumer spending for general merchandise and autos has not declined 
much from the torrid pace reported in our last report. Tourism has 
finished the summer on a good note. Some bright spots continue to 
turn up in manufacturing. The outlook for district crops has 
improved, due to favorable changes in local weather, the federal 
Payment-In-Kind (PIK) program, and higher prices. However, higher 
corn prices have hurt livestock profits. Financial activity appears 
normal. The weakest spot in our economy continues to be raw material 
extraction and processing. Due to the rise in interest rates, 
though, real estate and related activities have begun to weaken 
somewhat as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales of general merchandise apparently have continued at a 
healthy rate. One large Twin Cities retailer reports an "excellent" 
August, posting a sales increase of mere than 20 percent. Sales of 
home and office furnishings were strong for that retailer. The back-
to-school promotion went well for another large local retailer. The 
fall outlook is good for a diversified retailer, with big-ticket 
items buoying sales that were somewhat slowed by the hot August 
weather. Higher interest rates notwithstanding, retail credit sales 
are showing substantial strength over comparable periods a year ago. 
Southern Minnesota and North Dakota retailers have reported good 
sales to our Bank's directors, although some retailers in South 
Dakota and parts of Wisconsin have reported flat or lagging sales, 
due to local conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Van and recreational sales led the way in producing healthy 
automotive sales figures. District managers for domestic auto 
producers report good increases in both truck and passenger car 
sales over last July and August. Vehicle inventories are lean. This 
good news was corroborated by our Bank's directors, who reported 
good auto sales in southern Minnesota, in parts of Wisconsin and the 
Dakotas, and even in economically troubled northern Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism continued to show the strength evident in our last report. 
One senior tourism official in Minnesota says that August was 
excellent. He feels that the outlook for fall is good also. The 
economically depressed Upper Peninsula of Michigan had a good 
summer, with Mackinac Bridge traffic higher than last summer. 
Inquiries about the "fall color season" are also up. Similar 
sentiments are reported in the 26-county Indianhead region of 
Wisconsin, which expects to finish the season with tourism up 10 to 
12 percent over last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is generally good throughout the district. A 
recently released survey of our largest manufacturers shows that 
twelve of them posted a second-quarter increase in earnings, while 
only five suffered a decline. Two district paper companies are very 
busy. One of them just hired 50 more workers, and the other is 
contemplating an expansion. Two large computer industry 
manufacturers recently announced lucrative new contracts. An 
aluminum pot line was added to a plant in Montana, the first such 
expansion at that plant in several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent increases in corn and soybean prices are combining with the 
federal PIK program and better weather to spur farm income in this 
district. The Minnesota farm price index rose 8 percent, reaching 
its highest level in two years. Corn and soybean production is 
looking pretty good in Minnesota, where favorable weather is 
expected to produce yields well above the national average. However, 
these crops are not doing as well in southeastern and east central 
South Dakota, where bad weather and woolly worms are taking their 
toll. Wheat production is generally good in South Dakota and 
Montana, and wheat prices are running from 10 to 20 cents higher 
than last year, Livestock profitability is being gutted by high corn 
prices, though, and some wheat is being substituted for corn in 
cattle feed. Also, a recently implemented federal dairy production 
assessment is hurting dairy farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bank lending and deposits both increased last month. 
Deposits and loans in Twin Cities banks grew by 3.5 percent and 5.2 
percent, respectively. Comparable country bank growth figures are 
smaller. One bank director thinks that there may be some slack in 
country bank lending, due to recent interest rate increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Raw Material Extraction and Processing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      These industries are still lagging behind economic recovery, 
primarily because of structural problems. One director reports that 
delivered iron ore pellets from Brazil, for example, are cheaper 
than pellets from district plants. Two more large taconite plants in 
northern Minnesota announced closings this month. At around 15 
percent, the unemployment rate in the Duluth-Superior area of 
northeastern Minnesota is the highest among all metropolitan areas 
in the five state Upper Midwest. Oil drilling is still down in North 
Dakota and Montana. In fact, the Williston Basin now has only about 
40 active rigs; it had about 60 last spring. Demand for lumber was 
also down somewhat. Recent price declines for wood products 
illustrate this weakness. One sawmill operator thinks that demand 
would be stronger if interest rates fell, and stimulated more 
construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent interest rate increases have begun to slow real estate 
activity. Single-family home sales have fallen off in the Twin 
Cities. The condominium market also slipped. Builders, realtors and 
mortgage lenders all attributed this to recent increases in interest 
rates. Some scattered bright spots in residential construction are 
noted, though, with Billings, Montana, Sioux Falls, South Dakota and 
Rochester, Minnesota not being much affected by higher interest 
rates yet. While commercial construction has also been slack, one 
Twin Cities contractor notes that overcapacity may still be 
contributing to this.
