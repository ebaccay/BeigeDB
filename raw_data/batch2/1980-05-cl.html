      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 14, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in the Fourth District generally agree that the economy 
is in the early phases of a deep recession, but opinions vary on the 
depth of the recession and the extent of the recovery. Perhaps the 
most optimistic comments came from the machine tool officials who 
still report better-than-expected strength in new orders. However, 
the business sector as a whole is apprehensive amid signs that the 
slump in automobiles and auto-related products is spreading to other 
consumer goods. District banks have experienced declines in consumer 
loans, mostly concentrated in auto loans, and a dramatic decline in 
the growth of C&amp;I loans as a result of high interest rates and 
credit restraints. Housing continues to slump despite declining 
mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic outlook continues to deteriorate, with rising prospects 
for a worse than "average" recession. An auto industry economist 
states that April figures will show that the recession is no longer 
concentrated in autos and housing. A durable-goods producer is 
concerned that the sharp decline in April may be a harbinger of a 
recession rivaling 1973-1975. He, along with several other 
economists, expects the second quarter decline in economic activity 
to be about the worst of the recession. However, the decline is so 
sharp and so sudden that several respondents now see a recovery to 
be sluggish. An economist for the steel industry states that firms 
have not had time to adjust to the collapse in orders, so that no 
firm or industry will be in a position to lead a recovery. A bank 
economist notes that even the decline in interest rates is unlikely 
to provide much stimulus because the decline has been so sharp that 
it has raised expectations of further declines in the near term. A 
few economists, however, expect a sharp rebound in response to the 
rapid decline in interest rates, a tax cut, and completion of 
inventory liquidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The machine tool industry has not exhibited any major softening in 
orders in recent weeks, according to several industry spokesmen. 
Orders in nominal terms have held up better-than-expected. Effects 
of the recession on the industry will be delayed until the profit 
squeeze among customers is intensified and evidence of the severity 
of the recession is apparent. A capital-goods producer reports that 
capital spending plans have not yet been canceled. However, a major 
auto producer recently announced plans to cut back capital spending 
over the next few years, except for retooling, and a steel producer 
is petitioning the EPA to allow stretching of compliance deadlines 
until cash-flow improves. Nevertheless, an economist for a machine 
tool builder states that a decline in machine tool orders (in 
nominal or real terms) is unlikely to be as serious as in 1974-1975 
because of continued need for retooling in the automotive industry, 
strength in the aerospace industry, a buildup in defense spending 
and a tendency for some companies to look beyond the current 
recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some retailers are uncertain over where the trough in consumer 
spending is, and see little happening to build consumer confidence 
in the near-term. Among nondurable goods, consumers are reacting to 
high prices by reducing usage and shifting to generic names, 
according to a producer of household products. Several retailers 
note a majority of consumer purchases since February has 
concentrated on sale items. A spokesman for a major food chain 
reports that consumers are shifting to fresh rather than prepared 
foods, although frozen food discount stores are thriving. The 
decline in retail business is not expected to result in layoffs, but 
will lead to a reduction of hours worked, according to an area 
retailer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobiles and auto-related products continue to be the hardest hit 
consumer goods. Spring car sales, according to an industry 
economist, are dismal. One official blamed high interest rates, 
credit restraints, and shift in consumer preference to 4 cylinder 
cars for the drop in domestic new car sales. Some improvement is 
expected by fall because of new small cars by Ford and Chrysler. If 
interest rates drop further and credit restraints are lifted, auto 
dealers are not expected to carry large inventories and are unlikely 
to discount as heavily as in recent weeks. Several auto dealers 
report that the slump in sales also includes used cars, which is 
unusual for recessions. Tire shipments, which are 30% below year-ago 
levels, reflect the slump in auto sales, although an industry 
economist states that inventories are at a two-month level, compared 
to a nearly three-month supply in 1974-1975. Gasoline sales are off 
as much as 10% from year-ago levels as a result of a shift to more 
fuel-efficient cars and higher prices, according to a petroleum 
economist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Weakness in consumer spending has led to sharp production cutbacks 
among consumer-goods manufacturers and their suppliers. A major 
producer of household appliances reports that a weak replacement 
market, coupled with the housing slump, has contributed to a 
widespread decline in consumer durable goods orders. Order books for 
steel, according to an industry economist, have collapsed, with 
order entries now 50% below month-ago levels and cancellations well 
above normal. Except for oil field drilling equipment, the decline 
in orders is pervasive and would sustain only 50% of existing steel 
capacity. Although still relatively strong, orders in the aluminum 
industry also dropped substantially in the last two weeks of April, 
according to an industry economist.
     </p>
     <p>
      District bankers report little problem staying within credit 
restraint guidelines. High interest rates have finally discouraged 
C&amp;I; loans, according to a bank economist. Several bankers report 
that funds are available and an area manufacturer reports that some 
banks are initiating offers of expanding credit lines. An economist 
in the capital goods industry notes that declining interest rates 
have resulted in replacement of old debt, but not much new 
borrowing. Several auto dealers report an inability to sell 
commercial paper to banks because of bank restrictions on the growth 
of credit. A bank economist reports that credit card purchases have 
also declined and bank credit card cash advances are off 5% from a 
January peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lending rates by S&amp;Ls dropped sharply in recent weeks. 
Several S&amp;Ls report lowering mortgage notes from a 16-17% range to a 
14-15% range, with some to 13%, because of weakening demand and 
declining marginal cost of funds. However, some officials feel that 
a 12-13% range may be insufficient to stimulate housing demand. The 
severe slump in new housing sales continued through April and a 
major regional builder of new houses reports net sales are 25% of 
year-ago levels and cancellations have been heavy.
