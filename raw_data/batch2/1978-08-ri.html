      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <div>
        With a few exceptions, business activity in the fifth district 
  remained firm in July with most indicators continuing to show 
  moderate to strong expansionary tendencies. In the manufacturing 
  sector, responses to our survey suggest continued output growth as 
  employment, weekly hours, and shipments rose moderately. On the 
  other hand, new orders and backlogs of orders were essentially flat 
  for the second consecutive month. Retail sales were broadly higher 
  in July although relative sales of big ticket items held steady. 
  Bank credit growth in the fifth district continues strong, due 
  primarily to household demand for installment loans. Real estate 
  lending at banks and thrifts is also a continuing source of 
  strength. Business lending, although somewhat moderate in recent 
  weeks, is nonetheless healthy.
       </div>
       <p>
        Manufacturers surveyed this month report little or no overall change 
  in the volume of new orders or in backlogs of orders. Nonetheless, 
  shipments continued to expand moderately and employment and weekly 
  hours rose somewhat. Inventories of materials and finished goods 
  were also up over the month. However, current stocks more closely 
  approximate desired levels than at any time in recent months. 
  Regarding the price situation, more than half of the manufacturers 
  surveyed report paying higher prices in July and over 40 percent 
  received higher prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among retailers surveyed sales were generally up over the past month 
  while relative sales of big ticket items held steady. A majority of 
  respondents experienced rising inventories in July, but most 
  continue to view current levels as about right. Employment was 
  unchanged from a month earlier. Prices, including employee 
  compensations, were broadly higher over the most recent survey 
  period. Richmond directors perceive continued strength in household 
  credit demand and feel that expectations of higher prices are 
  fueling current consumption, particularly of durable goods.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expectations remain negative in the manufacturing sector as nearly 
  half of our respondents anticipate a worsening in the level of 
  business activity, nationally and locally, over the next six months. 
  Expectations are neutral, however, for level of production in the 
  individual firms. Retailers in our survey have lowered their 
  expectations considerably of the past month, and now foresee little 
  change in activity over the next six months. Our directors are not 
  at all optimistic with regard to the outlook for prices. Most expect 
  little or no improvement in the inflation area during the second 
  half of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although deposit flows are holding up well, banks and thrifts 
  generally feel that their liquidity positions have tightened 
  somewhat. The strong activity in consumer lending has come as a 
  surprise to most banks, as expectations about loan volume in July 
  have generally been exceeded. As a result, many lenders now expect 
  consumer lending activity to remain strong in coming weeks. Strength 
  in new car sales is the major factor explaining consumer installment 
  loan demand, and anticipatory buying to avoid higher future prices 
  is cited as an important motive behind the strong sales. Some banks 
  have recently raised the interest rates on auto loans, but these 
  increases have not affected demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        While lending to business has moderated in recent weeks, commercial 
  and industrial loan demand remains strong. Moreover, some banks 
  report large amounts of new bookings in process. Borrowing seems 
  widely dispersed among type of borrower. Our contacts report only 
  isolated cases of short-term-borrowing to finance unwanted 
  inventory. One such case, however, is in the textile industry, where 
  the demand for denim fabrics is proving to be much less than 
  expected. Noteworthy is the fact that area banks rate the credit 
  worthiness of their business customers as being quite good; this 
  view is also supported by our banker directors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for mortgage loans appears to have been strong in July, and 
  fifth district thrift institutions described their liquidity 
  positions as being comfortably tight to tight. Thrifts in Maryland 
  appear to be particularly pressed for funds, and many have raised 
  their conventional loan rate to 10 percent (the state usury ceiling) 
  with a one-third down payment required.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our farm credit survey for the second quarter of 1978 revealed that 
  district bankers have experienced further improvement in loan 
  repayment rates and a significant decline in the number of requests 
  for renewals and extensions since the first quarter. Indications 
  are, however, that a growing proportion of banks serving district 
  agriculture are currently faced with liquidity pressures. While 
  farmers' demand for short- and intermediate-term credit from 
  commercial banks was weaker, on balance, demand for consumer and 
  business loans continued strong and bank supplies of loanable funds 
  were much less than usual. Loan-to-deposit ratios of reporting 
  banks, in fact, were at the highest level in almost three years. 
  Bankers forced to refuse or reduce a farm loan because of a shortage 
  of funds rose relative to the total, while the share actively 
  seeking new farm loan accounts dropped further. Bank interest rates 
  on farm loans rose significantly, as might be expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        While total planted acreage of principal district crops this year is 
  down about 1 percent from a year ago, major cuts were made in the 
  acreages devoted to cotton, corn, and wheat, offsetting the large 
  increase in soybean plantings. Even though most crops got off to a 
  late start because of the cool, wet spring, they have responded well 
  to the generally better growing conditions than those prevalent last 
  year. Gains in yields per acre are currently indicated for flue-cured tobacco and for all feed and food grains.
