      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 21, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Even the Sixth District felt some ill effects of recent severe 
  weather. Low temperatures added to the strain on already 
  questionable supplies of coal. Construction activity was interrupted 
  and retail sales were slowed in some areas, but strength in 
  unaffected areas and earlier last month gave the District a 
  satisfactory January record in both respects. Damage to winter crops 
  was minimal. Thrift institutions have taken steps to compensate for 
  smaller deposit inflows and generally feel capable of meeting 
  continued heavy demand for home loans. But recent mortgage rate 
  increases have been met with a flurry rather than a flight of home 
  buyers. Foreign capital has become increasingly significant in the 
  District's commercial and industrial development and more frequently 
  discussed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Savings and loan associations, faced with mild to moderate 
  reductions in savings inflows and the smallest paydowns in many 
  years, generally believe they will be able to meet expected strong 
  demand for home mortgages. Campaigns to promote savings are under 
  way; more associations are offering ceiling rates on certificates, 
  advertising, and giving premiums. The Atlanta Home Loan Bank 
  president feels that the good earnings and liquidity positions of 
  southeastern associations will allow them to pay higher rates and 
  still meet housing demands; however, mortgage rate hikes have been 
  common in the past six weeks. The going conventional rates are 9 
  percent f or 80 percent loans and 9 1/4 to 9 1/2 percent with 10 
  percent down payments, up from 8 1/2-8 3/4 percent a month earlier; 
  closing costs have moved up about half a point as well. The 
  currently prevailing rates in Florida are slightly lower, but some 
  cities report top-of-range rates and a number of associations have 
  announced increases to take effect on March 1.
       </p>
       <p>
        Announcements of coming increases in mortgage interest rates have 
  brought home buyers out of the woodwork, according to a director 
  from South Florida. Yet in Atlanta, where higher rates are already 
  in effect, buyers are coming out in force to head off possible 
  further hikes. Indeed, the only sign of slackening of surging 
  housing demand has been a leveling of single-family home 
  construction in a few areas of Florida where lots have grown scarce 
  and some recent building has been speculative. There, and in other 
  parts of that state, condominium starts and sales have been quite 
  brisk, stimulated by negligible apartment vacancy rates and high 
  rents. Poor weather nationwide has induced a spurt in preretirement 
  home buying and in requests for rental housing in southeast Florida.
       </p>
       <p>
        With no end to the United Mine Workers' strike in sight, coal 
  supplies have become strained in some areas. Mining operations have 
  virtually halted in Alabama, where 12,000 miners are off the job, 
  although only 70 percent are union members. Severe weather has 
  hindered nonunion production in northeast Tennessee, putting further 
  pressure on prices that are already $l0-$l5 per ton above usual. 
  Electric utilities and major industrial users, most of whom are 
  relatively comfortable with 30-60 day supplies, fear that delivery 
  start-up will not be timely unless settlement and ratification come 
  quickly. Although the TVA has systemwide supplies of about two 
  months, reserves at five of its twelve coal-burning plants are down 
  to three weeks or less; power supplies have been curtailed in at
  least one rural area of Tennessee. Deliveries to TVA are running 
  about 20 percent of normal; a spokesman says that shifting of coal 
  between plants is not practical. U. S. Steel in Birmingham has 
  undertaken conservation efforts; a coal "loan" from the Redstone 
  Arsenal was required to keep Huntsville area schools open. On the 
  other hand, Mississippi Power carries a 150-day supply, and one TVA 
  plant is flush with reserves adequate for 250 operating days. A 
  director in the coal industry expects that negotiated wage increases 
  and higher severance taxes and related costs will add at least 25 
  percent to the price of coal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Icy roads and extreme cold put a damper on consumer spending in the 
  northern portions of the District; consequently, month-end retail 
  stocks weren't as light as expected. However, a fairly strong sales 
  pace continued in areas that were least affected by the cold, and 
  heavy early January buying kept monthly sales estimates even with 
  January 1976 or better in the worst afflicted locations. Auto sales 
  were generally slow but picking up in late January.
       </p>
       <p>
        Damage to citrus crops from two freezes was mainly limited to 
  specialty fruits and should have little or no impact on the 
  availability of orange concentrate. Fresh orange shipments are 
  running about one million boxes behind last year this season. The 
  late start and projected high returns for processed fruit have been 
  restraints, but the primary reason has been sky-high prices: FOB 
  prices have risen 60 percent over the year, and on-tree prices have 
  quadrupled. Cotton prices continued the uptrend which began in early 
  December, despite the release of reports of heavier-than-expected 
  1977 production and planting intentions for 1978 and of declines in 
  mill consumption and advance sales for export. A director attributes 
  the price strength to the depressed exchange value of the dollar. He 
  also expects near-record marketings (and thus some price weakness) 
  of fed cattle in the next three months. In Louisiana, the trickle of 
  sugar mill closings continues and threatens to grow; producers say 
  they want out of raw sugar. Processing operations, however, are 
  expanding. As regards the farm strike, some 200 Georgia farmers have 
  promised to withhold 50 percent of their land from production this 
  year; they claim that their counterparts have promised to set aside 
  at least 25 million acres nationwide.
       </p>
       <p>
        Foreign investment, actual and suspected, has become a hot topic of 
  discussion among southeastern businessmen. A regional real estate 
  firm headquartered in Atlanta described foreign investment in 
  income-producing properties as heavy and primarily from European 
  interests. A director notes that foreign investors bought two-thirds 
  of the shopping centers, one-third of the office buildings, and one-
  fifth of the large apartment buildings sold in Florida's Dade and 
  Broward Counties last year. There are 55 foreign-owned projects 
  currently under construction or planned in that state, compared to 4 
  at this time last year. The list includes Siemens-Allis Chalmers' 
  huge electric generator plant recently announced for the Bradenton 
  area. Miami banks have been hard pressed to put to work their recent
  strong inflows of South American capital. However, business analysts 
  in Georgia indicate that foreign investment in farmland has been 
  insubstantial, despite rumors to the contrary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inventory accumulation appears to be accelerating modestly after 
  slowing through year-end. A Georgia survey of purchasing agents 
  indicates that stocks, both current and expected in the near term, 
  are rising, particularly of finished goods. Deliveries are slowing, 
  lead times lengthening. Goods in short supply in the District 
  include a number of building materials, paper for web offset 
  presses, and oil-drilling rigs.
