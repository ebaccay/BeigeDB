     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 13, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The general business outlook in the Seventh District appears 
favorable through 1977 and into 1978. Widespread confidence that 
activity will continue to expand, however, is tempered by an unusual 
degree of caution in making commitments to invest in inventories or 
substantial capital spending projects beyond obvious requirements. 
Consumer spending continues vigorous, especially for durables. The 
housing market has lost some of the "frenzy" of last spring but 
retains great momentum. Crops are growing well in virtually all 
areas of the district.
      <p>
       Few basic products, either raw materials or components, are in short 
  supply, but there are complaints of limited availability of rail and 
  highway transportation. A major producer of building materials, for 
  example, says both freight cars and trailers have been short and 
  some units furnished have not been usable. An analyst of the 
  trucking industry has argued for several months that a capacity 
  crush was developing in highway transport and that orders for new 
  trucks and trailers, while up sharply from last year, were not 
  rising at an adequate pace. A major Western railroad has been 
  pleased with the pickup in important classes of traffic this year. 
  This line recently ordered 124 new locomotives, compared to none in 
  1976. Track maintenance work has been increased substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing managers in Chicago and Milwaukee reported continued 
  gains in output, employment, new orders, and order backlogs for 
  June. Prices paid continue upward at about the rate of recent 
  months. Inventories are increasing only moderately. Most companies 
  expect the expansion to continue well into 1978. Inflation is the 
  number one concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       The improvement in demand for capital equipment is still underway, 
  but the heavier types of equipment are still lagging. On the whole, 
  the picture is somewhat disappointing with the expansion at a 
  relatively advanced stage. A number of large capital goods producers 
  are taking longer vacation shutdowns this July, up from two to three 
  weeks, as required by union contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer spending still buttresses the expansion, with emphasis on 
  durable goods. Credit is being used freely with fewer collection 
  problems. Larger purchases of durables, including most types of 
  appliances, have helped the performance of large chains specializing 
  in these goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Production schedules for cars and trucks have been increased, at 
  least for the most popular models, as a result of strong sales. 
  Sales of recreational vehicles are reported to have rebounded 
  vigorously after a slump that followed the President's energy 
  messages in April.
      </p>
      <p>
       Office space occupancy in the Chicago area has returned to 1972 
  levels. Construction of three sizable (not "giant") office buildings 
  is now definitely slated for the Loop, and other sites are under 
  active consideration. Some analysts expect an office "space crunch" in two to three years. On the other hand, few new shopping centers 
  are underway or planned. Moreover, rents must rise substantially 
  further to justify large new apartment buildings. Even so, plans for 
  such buildings are again under active consideration. A large supply 
  of vacant industrial buildings exists in Chicago and other large 
  district centers. Most new industrial buildings are either 
  specialized types or are expansions of existing properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The frenzied demand for single-family homes appears to have 
  moderated somewhat. The picture is somewhat clouded because of 
  seasonal trends. Also, some builders have stopped taking orders for 
  this year or have pushed out delivery dates from the usual four to 
  five months to seven to 12 months. Finally, buyers have begun to 
  show resistance to rapid price increases. Apartment building has 
  picked up, but with more buildings of only four to 12 units. Several 
  large apartment units are being converted to condominiums, with 
  rapid sellouts if prices are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some S&amp;Ls have stopped accepting mortgage loan applications except 
  from customers. But "customer" is defined broadly to include 
  referrals from builders or brokers with whom the lender has a 
"relationship." The typical rate on 80 percent 25-year loans is 
  still 8.75 percent. No severe credit stringency is expected. 
  Capacity to process loans is taxed, however. Savings inflows have 
  held up well, and loan repayments are very large. Large S&amp;Ls are 
  more interested in obtaining funds from sales of large CDs. 
  Substantial funds could be borrowed from the FHLBs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent declines in prices of major crops, paced by soybeans, have 
  disturbed some bankers with substantial portfolios of loans to 
  farmers. Growing conditions are favorable, much better than had been 
  expected earlier in the year. Higher livestock prices, partly 
  reflecting reduced estimates of pork supplies in the second half, 
  have eased concerns of bankers emphasizing livestock loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most banks see little change in the generally sluggish demand for 
  loans from large businesses. Many large firms have ample internal 
  cash flows. Some have sizable holdings of Treasuries that could be 
  liquidated. Sales of securities, including private placements, have 
  reduced needs for bank loans. Medium- and smaller-sized firms have 
  been using bank lines all through the expansion. Some banks have 
  been seeking out smaller companies more aggressively. There is a 
  trend toward reducing, even eliminating, compensating balances.
