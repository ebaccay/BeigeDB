      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District was again mixed in late May 
and early June. Department store sales continued to be strong, with 
most chains reporting sales moderately above plan. There has been a 
partial recovery from the post-rebate automobile sales slump, but 
lower-priced models remain particularly weak. Manufacturing activity 
was varied with strength in steel production, for example, but with 
further weakness in machine tool orders. Business economists still 
look for little real GNP growth for the next two quarters. On the 
financial side, the proportion of short-term commercial loans issued 
on a variable-rate basis is increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unexpected strength of department store sales generally 
continued into June. Sales gains extended to most product lines and 
to stores throughout the District. Apparel sales were especially 
strong. As in the past several months, there was a great deal of 
promotional activity. The outlook for the near term is optimistic, 
especially when a tax cut is taken into account. Although one 
respondent worried that the current strength might be coming at the 
expense of sales later in the year, some chains are adjusting their 
plans and inventories upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales showed modest improvement over the post-rebate 
slump, but are still running well below 1980 levels. High loan rates 
and recent price rises were most commonly cited for the sluggish 
performance. A dealer of less-expensive domestic cars reported the 
worst June for new cars in his history. A foreign car dealer 
reported that lower-priced lines are not selling at all, although 
the demand for higher-priced models remains strong. The brisk pace 
of used car sales was taken by one industry specialist as a 
harbinger of future strength of new car sales. Inventories generally 
are being kept as low as possible because of high interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Sector
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained mixed in recent weeks. Upstate, 
steel production rose sharply to the highest level since September 
1979, but a major paper products firm reported weakness across all 
product lines. The respondents in the capital goods sector indicated 
an overall deterioration of demand, requiring a decrease in 
production as backlogs have begun to fall. None of the firms which 
were surveyed reported any curtailment of their ongoing capital 
spending programs. However, high interest rates were said to be 
discouraging some new projects at this time. There was little 
evidence that price pressures were abating. Firms look forward to 
possible tax cuts, but as yet they have not acted on their 
expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Economic Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite the unexpectedly large first quarter real GNP growth 
announced since the last survey, the consensus of business 
economists continues to be for little real growth for the next 
quarter or two. Some respondents look for improvement if and when 
tax cuts are enacted, but even the most optimistic do not foresee 
any signs of recovery until late in the year. Forecasts for specific 
industries vary. A major conglomerate is projecting strength in 
plastics, chemicals, and energy products, while a large oil producer 
expects national demand for oil to continue to be weak. There have 
been some signs that inflation is abating. One analyst suggested 
that the growth in consumer spending may cool if the inflationary 
"buy-in-advance" psychology abates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Floating rate pricing schemes have become standard offering at large 
commercial banks. According to senior loan officers at major Second 
District banks, most short-term commercial loans are being issued on 
variable-rate basis. Floating rate loans are generally made at the 
prime rate or at a mark-up over that rate. When the prime rate is 
changed, the rates on these loans are automatically changed. The 
loans are pre-payable without penalty and usually have maturities of 
60, 90, or 180 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Comments this month are from Henry Kaufman (Salomon Brothers), 
Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty Trust), and Robert Stone (Irving 
Trust). Their views are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Kaufman: The sluggish economic pace will continue through the summer 
months but will he followed by a sharp snapback in the fourth 
quarter. While the rate of inflation has slowed, it should be noted 
there are transitory aspects to this improvement, including the 
cyclical improvement in productivity, a good agricultural crop this 
year, and the tight inventory posture of business. In the financial 
sector business corporations are again missing the ability to fund 
an adequate volume of short-term indebtedness. They will be pressed 
with greater urgency to enter the long-term market in the next 
twelve months at interest rate levels that were unacceptable just a 
year ago. The most vulnerable sector of the fixed-income bond market 
during the year ahead is likely to be the municipal market. A series 
of developments are highly unfavorable to this market. These include 
tax reductions, the potential issuance of partially tax exempt 
certificates of deposit, the reduction of grants and aid by the 
Federal Government to state and local governments, the very limited 
buying of tax-exempts by commercial banks, and the advent of spread 
banking.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: Inflationary expectations have dropped. The Fed should 
therefore tolerate lower levels of interest rates. However, rates 
should not be allowed to drop so rapidly and so far that the policy 
would have to be reversed later in the year. It is important that 
this be the last peak in rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stone: While the economy will experience little or no real growth in 
the second quarter, the prospect, in our view, is for a resumption 
of moderate (4 percent or so) growth in the second half. We also 
anticipate further reductions in inflation rates and in inflationary 
expectations. Against this background, and in view of the recent 
behavior of the monetary aggregates, it is my opinion that the time 
has come for the Fed to relax slightly the grip in which it is 
holding the banks at the discount window. Thus I suggest provision 
of nonborrowed reserves such that borrowings for the next three to 
four weeks center around 1.5 billion or thereabouts followed, after 
that interval, by another slight relaxation to the 1.2 billion area 
should aggregates then be behaving in a satisfactory way.
     </p>
     <p>
      This course would reduce the chances of a material undershoot of M1B 
over the next couple of months and, by the moderate nature of the 
relaxation, would minimize the chances of laying the background for 
substantial overshoot later.
