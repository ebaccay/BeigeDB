      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy has slipped deeper into recession since 
the last report. Consumer spending has remained at the slow post-Christmas holiday level reached in January and is running below the 
year-ago level in real terms. In the manufacturing and mining 
industries, further cutbacks and layoffs are occurring in a number 
of industries, although the pace of the overall decline appears to 
be decelerating. Homebuilding activity has dropped recently, in 
contrast to the national pattern, and nonresidential construction 
also is slowing. Agricultural commodity prices have risen slightly 
during the past month but remain well below the level of a year ago. 
Respondents expect little or no improvement in net farm income in 
1982, following 1981's decline. Bank credit at Twelfth District 
banks rose sharply in February, but as a result of weakness rather 
than strength in the regional economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents report little change in retail sales from the slow post-Christmas holiday pace reached in January. Spending remains weak, 
running below the level of a year ago in real terms. Consumers 
continue to exhibit cautious spending behavior, staying away from 
costly durable goods such as furniture and appliances and confining 
their purchases to apparel and other necessities. Large department 
stores are doing better than smaller retail outlets which are 
reported to be going out of business in increasing number, 
especially in rural communities. While most retail outlets are no 
longer liquidating excess inventory, they are reported to be holding 
stocks at "bare-bone" levels, buying much less spring and summer 
merchandise than a year ago. This conservative inventory pattern 
reflects not only high interest rates but their belief that consumer 
spending probably will remain sluggish for the next few months. 
Automobile sales did pick up somewhat in February, in response to 
the domestic car rebate program, but still remained depressed 
relative to a year ago. Moreover, respondents are concerned that 
these purchases are being "borrowed" from subsequent periods and 
that auto sales will drop sharply when the rebates are eliminated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining and Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents report further cutbacks in production and employment, 
but at a decelerating rate. Employment in the lumber and mining 
industries has stabilized at a very depressed level, with these 
industries operating at about 60 percent of capacity or less. But 
layoffs continue in the construction, commercial aircraft, aluminum 
and automobile industries. For example, the Boeing Company in 
Seattle recently announced plans to layoff as many as 5,000 workers 
this year because of slow demand for commercial aircraft by foreign 
and domestic airlines. General Motors Corporation recently closed 
its assembly plant at Fremont, California, and will shut down its 
plant at South Gate, California on April 1. These closures will 
layoff 2,500 and 500 workers at those respective locations and will 
have ripple effects on other industries. While rising defense 
spending is having some positive impact on regional employment, most 
of the stimulus is expected in 1983-84 when programs such as the B-l 
bomber move into the production phase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Twelfth District has failed to experience the pickup in either 
new home sales or homebuilding reported elsewhere. On the contrary, 
sales of new homes remain so depressed that builders are still 
trying to dispose of unsold inventory. As a result, homebuilding 
activity has dropped to a new post-World War II low. Buyers are 
purchasing only when essential and only when extraordinary financing 
is provided by sellers. The slump in sales is eroding selling prices 
for both new and older single-family homes and condominiums, causing 
prices to drop below year-ago levels in real terms. Moreover, 
realized prices are lower than selling prices because of seller-financed transactions at below market interest rates. Distress among builders, brokers and property owners is especially great in areas 
of higher than average unemployment. Nonresidential construction 
activity also has been dropping recently as business firms have 
scaled back capital spending programs. Even the boom in office 
building construction has subsided as a glut of space has begun to 
appear in metropolitan areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District farmers and ranchers experienced a decline in both 
gross and net farm income in 1981 as bumper crops combined with 
lagging demand to reduce commodity prices. Prices for a large number 
of commodities have risen recently but remain well below the level 
of a year ago. Thus, unless farmers produce significantly less in 
1982 than in 1981, little or no improvement in farm income is likely 
this year. So far, agricultural sources are pessimistic that farmers 
will carry out that production cutback. Although the Department of 
Agriculture has reinstated several set-aside programs to reduce 
planted acreage, Twelfth District farmers generally are not expected 
to take advantage of those programs. Meanwhile, farmers and ranchers 
already are heavily in debt and finding it increasingly difficult to 
meet loan payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank credit at Twelfth District banks rose sharply in February as a 
result of a strong increase in business loans. However, as in recent 
months, the increase appeared to stem from the economy's weakness 
rather than from strength. Businesses are borrowing to finance 
involuntary inventory accumulation and to meet short-term working 
capital needs. Bankers also report an across-the-board deterioration 
in the financial condition of many prospective business borrowers. 
In other areas, real estate loans continued to expand at a sluggish 
pace. Demand for new mortgage loans continued to be weak, with a 
slowdown in liquidation of old loans helping to account for the 
increase. Consumer loans dropped for the second consecutive month. 
Loans for automobiles and consumer durables were especially weak as 
rising unemployment caused further weakness in household borrowing. 
Bankers also report an upward drift in consumer loan delinquency 
rates and personal bankruptcies.
