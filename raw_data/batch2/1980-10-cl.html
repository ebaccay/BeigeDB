      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       Summary
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Recent improvements in Fourth District business activity 
are expected to be dampened by rising interest rates, according to 
this month's respondents. Despite real improvements, several 
business economists express doubts that third quarter figures have 
yet to reflect the extent of inventory liquidation. Steel orders, 
however, continue to receive an impetus from inventory re-stocking. 
Capital spending is continuing on a gradual downward trend, but 
backlogs appear to be strong enough to sustain shipments until a 
recovery begins in mid-1981. Retailers and automobile dealers report 
some rebound in sales from the abnormally low levels brought on by 
the March credit restraint program. Bankers report that business 
loans have benefited from inventory investment, but consumer loans 
continue to be weak. Mortgage lending has virtually halted as a 
result of interest rates that are at or above 13%.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While most respondents now acknowledge that real GNP may be 
slightly positive in the third quarter of 1980, they have not 
changed their earlier forecast of a slow recovery over the next 
three quarters. Because this decline was associated with a severe 
cutback in consumer spending rather than inventories, the recovery 
will be sluggish. Several economists concur that the consumer's 
balance sheet is not strong enough to support a strong resurgence in 
either consumer spending or overall economic activity. They expect 
little improvement in consumer spending once the catch-up from 
credit controls is completed. Rising interest rates are expected to 
weaken a recovery, but most respondents place a low probability on a 
double-dip recession. A most likely scenario is for real GNP to 
alternate between small positive and negative changes through the 
second quarter of 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several business economists, while encouraged by the 
turnaround in production and employment, remain cautious with 
respect to the outlook because of inventories. Although inventories 
were generally in better shape going into the recession than in past 
pre-recession periods, a steel economist believes that there has 
been substantial liquidation of inventories in manufacturing in 
addition to steel. Several economists state that either third 
quarter inventory data will show liquidation, or the fourth quarter 
GNP. GNP forecasts will have to be adjusted downward to allow for a 
liquidation phase in the inventory cycle.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Significant improvements in steel orders, following heavy 
inventory liquidation especially by service centers and declining 
import commitments, are reported by industry economists. New orders 
in September rose consistent with almost an 80 percent operating 
rate, but actual fourth quarter operating rates will probably be 
closer to 70 percent. Steel economists report some pickup from the 
auto industry, but auto production schedules so far have remained 
conservative.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Because of a seventeen month backlog in metal cutting 
tool orders, machine tool expenditures in real terms have increased, 
while new orders have continued to decline. However, machine tool 
producers state that order cancellations are becoming a bigger 
problem, although not yet comparable to past recessions. September 
orders may have picked up slightly because of very low August levels 
and a response to the annual machine tool show. Although a capital-
goods producer expects a recovery in capital spending to begin in 
the first quarter of 1981 at the earliest, several expect the 
recovery to be centered among small OEM suppliers. Auto suppliers 
especially have been hurt by weakness in the auto industry and have 
curtailed purchases of machine tools and parts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the recent improvement in consumer 
spending is associated with a rebound from the second quarter credit 
controls. A durable goods producer believes that if it were not for 
the severe cutback in consumer spending in the second quarter, 
consumer spending would still be declining. An economist for a major 
retail chain states that unseasonably warm weather in September 
caused consumers to postpone fall and winter apparel purchases. 
Sales in the first week of October soared, suggesting that the 
September slump was partly a weather phenomenon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in the first week of October have been the best in months 
for area dealers. Ohio dealers have benefited substantially from a 
state sales tax reduction from 4 percent to 2 percent since mid-
September. (K cars did not qualify for the tax reduction). Several 
dealers are encouraged by favorable initial response to 1981 models, 
but they believe that improved sales represent buying ahead and that 
November and December sales may weaken as a result. Several dealers 
are concerned about consumer response to the higher prices of 1981 
models. Interest rates on auto loans, which in some areas has moved 
up to 16 percent, have not yet hindered auto sales partly because 
company financing is available at below market rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rising interest rates have not had a significant effect on 
business or consumer lending over the past month. Business loans 
continue to be relatively flat, according to several bank 
economists, with most of the demand coming from inventory financing 
for companies with large declines in profits. Loans to medium-sized 
businesses continue to be on a plateau. Although consumer lending 
rates have moved upward in recent weeks, a bottoming out pattern of 
consumer loans does not appear to have been altered. Credit card 
usage rebounded significantly in August from July levels, according 
to both bankers and retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mortgage Lending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Increasing mortgage rates have again resulted in a 
substantial decline in mortgage lending, according to District S&amp;Ls. 
Current rates charged by S&amp;Ls range from 121/2 percent to 13 percent 
for an 80% loan, while banks generally are already above 13 percent. 
An S&amp;L official believes that the volatility of mortgage rates over 
the past year has been more important than the level in reducing 
demand. Buyers are still very inflation conscious and perceive real 
estate as the best inflation hedge. Currently, most of the lending 
activity is at the lower end of the price range of houses. An 
economist with a regional FHLB in this District expresses concern 
that the second half profit outlook for S&amp;Ls may be worse than the 
first half. Unless rates fall drastically, many S&amp;Ls in the District 
will suffer net losses. So far liquidity is adequate to meet 
commitments without relying on advances. Several S&amp;L officials doubt 
that interest rates will fall back to 12 percent before spring.
