      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 29, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District are mixed but point to continued 
weakness in the local economy overall. Conditions in the 
manufacturing sector still show no conclusive signs of a turnaround, 
and retail sales are sluggish at best. In the banking sector, loan 
demand has risen and a drop in interest rates is reported. The home 
building industry, despite a drop in mortgage rates, remains in very 
poor shape.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for some recovery in the next six months is generally 
optimistic, but cautious, across all industries. Both manufacturers 
and retailers are certain that improvement will occur, but are 
planning on it being slow and late starting. Bankers expect a 
hesitant recovery, as well, with further distress borrowing pushing 
up loan volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing market in the Third District remains mired in the slump 
that has plagued it for well over a year now, according to area real 
estate brokers. Industry contacts report some recent improvement in 
market conditions, highlighted by a dip in mortgage rates to the 14 
to 15.25 percent range. Buyers, however, apparently still view rates 
as too high to buy. Traffic through new and older homes is up a 
little, but sales are still below year-ago levels by as much as 50 
percent. In addition, nearly all current sales are of previously 
owned homes. As a result, housing starts are at a virtual stand 
still as builders react to stalled sales and declining new home 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents to the September Business Outlook Survey report that 
business conditions in the local manufacturing sector are unchanged 
from August. Third District industry continues to exhibit the 
lingering weakness that has been evident for the last seven months. 
While reports of improvement in manufacturing conditions have been 
on the rise recently, there are still no firm indications that the 
industrial sector has begun to really recover. New orders and 
shipments show modest growth, their first gains since June, but 
shipments have again outpaced new orders and forced producers' 
backlogs down further. Cutbacks in both working hours and the 
factory work force are reported again this month, and widespread 
reports of stock level reductions indicate that liquidation of 
manufacturing inventories has not yet showed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Survey participants are still highly optimistic that a recovery will 
occur within six months, but appear to be maintaining a cautious 
stance while awaiting further signs of strength. Nearly 80 percent 
of the businessmen polled are looking for improved conditions over 
the next six months. New orders are expected to take off, and, with 
shipments projected to show slightly less growth, growing backlogs 
and longer delivery times are foreseen. Producers say the 
anticipated spurt in activity between now and March will push 
payrolls and working hours upward and bring inventories into check. 
But, reflecting continued caution, there is little stock building 
planned, and capital spending increases will be kept to a minimum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices are holding steady again in September, having 
shown little inflationary movement at all since April. Flat input 
and finished good prices are reported at well over 80 percent of 
responding firms this month. As for the next six months, the 
projected turnaround in manufacturing activity is expected to 
rejuvenate inflation but manufacturers foresee only moderate 
increases in both the cost of raw materials and the prices they 
charge for their own products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Department store sales, which appear to have stabilized somewhat 
since the last Redbook, are mixed. The uncertainty about jobs and 
income that has kept consumers away from retail outlets all summer 
continues to put a damper on spending. Retail sales volume is now 
running from about one percent below to slightly above that of a 
year ago, but well below the expectations of merchants. Retailers 
had been looking for a "back to school" surge in September to pump 
up sales. Current reports, however, have these soft goods moving 
sluggishly and most other lines showing even less life.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, weak sales volume is expected to linger on until a 
projected holiday surge in December. End-of year forecasts are in 
the 1 to 4 percent range. A Director of this bank, however, notes 
that small gains over last year's fourth-quarter sales will not be a 
strong positive signal, as last year's sales were less than robust. 
Nevertheless, contacts are "guardedly optimistic" that a weak 
recovery will finally take hold in three to four months, and that 
sales will climb by two to five percent above year-earlier levels by 
early spring. Merchants remain cautious about inventories, currently 
lean and generally below last year's levels, and plan to maintain 
the present tightness for at least the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers report improved loan activity in September. 
Commercial lending inched upward this month, pushed along at least 
partly by increased distress borrowing that outweighed the recent 
shift toward long-term debt. According to banking contacts, the 
volume of business loans is ahead of year-ago figures by as much as 
11 percent, slightly better than lenders had anticipated. Retail 
loans, held down by design for most of this year, have increased 
recently in response to lower interest rates, but are still well 
below last September's levels. As for the future, indications that 
recovery will be weak have changed bankers' outlooks for Third 
District lending activity. More distress borrowing is now expected 
to keep C&amp;I loan volume on the rise in the near future, and growth 
in consumer loans is also projected to continue as long as interest 
rates don't begin to rise again.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers have lowered their prime rate to 13.50 percent during 
September and foresee it dropping further if the recovery continues 
to sputter. Lenders are now predicting that the prime may go down to 
12 percent before leveling off. The expected timing of the trough in 
interest rates has been pushed back into early 1983 when the 
projected recovery is forecast to be underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows in the Third District show a few signs of minor 
slippage. Time deposits are not as strong as in recent months, but 
are still 10 to 12 percent higher than a year ago. Demand deposits 
are reported to be mixed, with some bankers reporting a loss of 
deposit dollars to various interest bearing assets, including the 
new 7-31 day time deposit.
