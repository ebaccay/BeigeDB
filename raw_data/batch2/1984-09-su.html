      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic expansion appears to be moderating to a slower but 
still quite brisk pace. Manufacturing remains strong despite 
weaknesses in certain sectors that have been adversely affected by 
the increased strength of the U.S. dollar. Defense and energy are 
the chief sources of current expansion. Retail spending remains 
generally strong, but several Districts are experiencing a slower 
growth rate. Auto sales continue to advance in most areas; where 
some deceleration has occurred, the reason is lack of inventory 
rather than dampened demand. Consumer spending for domestic travel, 
however, has been disappointing in some areas because of the high 
exchange rate of the dollar as well as rainy weather. Residential 
construction is slowing in most Districts, but nonresidential 
building is proceeding at such a heady pace in certain areas that 
concerns about overbuilding are mounting. Lending remains strong 
primarily because of expanded consumer borrowing. Farm conditions 
are mixed: several Districts anticipate higher yields and revenues, 
but poor weather reduced supplies in some states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity generally remains strong, but most regions 
report slower growth in orders and employment. Inventory levels are 
satisfactory, for the most part, although some steel customers are 
cutting inventories in anticipation of an auto strike. Price 
increases have been modest, at worst, and some Districts report flat 
or declining supply prices. There is no evidence of materials 
shortages. Capital goods spending has been strong, but Boston 
reports that plans for 1985 show no increase over current levels. 
Defense orders are a source of manufacturing strength for St. Louis, 
New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta. Energy demand is sustaining 
industry's momentum in the Dallas, Minneapolis, Richmond, and 
Atlanta Districts. Demand for coal as well as pulp and paper is 
contributing to the strength of manufacturing reported by Richmond, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Auto and related production is 
another source of continuing growth, especially in New York, 
Richmond, and St. Louis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Weakness is concentrated in industries sensitive to import 
competition, but this effect appears widespread geographically more 
than half the Districts mention it. Industries affected include 
aluminum, steel, copper, machine tools, shoes, textile, apparel, and 
lumber. Setbacks in the lumber industry are also attributable to 
slower residential construction, which is precipitating layoffs by 
furniture producers and building material suppliers as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales, spurred by back-to-school spending, generally 
strengthened in late summer. However, Cleveland, Minneapolis, 
Dallas, and San Francisco report a slower rate of growth. The 
relative strength of spending on hard goods and soft goods varies. 
Boston and Richmond report that hard goods are increasing their 
share, but Dallas and San Francisco note a softening of spending on 
consumer durables. Auto demand remains strong in most parts of the 
country and would be higher if more of the popular models were 
available. In contrast to the shortage of new cars, inventories of 
other retail goods generally are reported to be satisfactory. 
Inventory-to-sales ratios in the Philadelphia District are 
intentionally high because of anticipated strong demand through the 
fall. Price competition and promotions appear to be helping 
retailers attract buyers and move goods. Many buyers are using 
available credit lines but seem to be paying their bills without 
difficulty. Looking ahead, retailers, as usual, are optimistic, 
although auto dealers fear the consequences of the threatened 
strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      Summer tourist expenditures are below expectations in most areas. 
The effect is greatest on attractions; business and convention 
travel is helping to boost the lodgings and air transportation 
sectors of the industry. However, St. Louis and Philadelphia report 
that late summer visitations at certain resort areas were up 
substantially. Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis 
attribute the lackluster performance of vacation goers on rainy 
weather and the strong value of the U.S. dollar, which discourages 
Canadian tourists from visiting border resort areas and encourages 
increased travel abroad by Americans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential sector continues to slow in most Districts despite 
generally declining mortgage rates. Atlanta, New York, Cleveland, 
and Richmond are experiencing continued or renewed strength, but 
most other Districts report substantial slowing in residential 
construction and sales, particularly of single-family houses. The 
August issuance of mortgage revenue bonds in Ohio stimulated an 
otherwise sluggish residential sector there. High-income home 
buyers, many of whom are making purchases with cash, account for New 
York's strong showing. Apartment vacancy rates are increasing, and 
some regions express concern about overbuilding in the multifamily 
sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction is characterized as surging in Atlanta, 
Minneapolis, Richmond, San Francisco, and St. Louis. Concern over 
high and rising office vacancy rates is widespread and mounting, 
especially in Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, 
commercial vacancy rates in Minneapolis have been declining, and New 
York reports low office vacancy rates in Manhattan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand remains firm in most Districts. Consumer lending is the 
leading component of current growth. At least half the Banks report 
increased consumer borrowing, and New York and Chicago note that 
delinquency rates are quite low, given the increase in consumer 
credit. Many Districts report an increased pace of real estate 
lending, especially for nonresidential projects, although 
Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Dallas report a slowdown in such 
lending. The rate of business loan growth varies between regions. 
Deposit growth is advancing in Atlanta and Kansas City, but Dallas, 
Philadelphia, and Cleveland describe the pace as flat or declining, 
and deposit growth has slowed in Minneapolis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for agriculture is mixed. Notwithstanding a drought in 
June and potential crop damage from Hurricane Diana, the Southeast 
is experiencing favorable growing conditions, and farmers may enjoy 
near-record yields. St. Louis and Minneapolis also anticipate good 
yields except in areas most affected by poor weather. The 
Philadelphia District had adequate rain, and farm income there 
should be improved, especially for growers of corn, potatoes, 
soybeans, and blackberries. Several Banks also note the positive 
effect of increased Soviet purchases. However, droughts in portions 
of the Dallas and Kansas City areas should depress yields. San 
Francisco describes price conditions for fruit and vegetable farmers 
as "dismal." In addition, the farm sector, especially in Minneapolis 
and Kansas City, continues to face financial difficulties 
exacerbated by low prices for many commodities, falling land values, 
and the high cost of servicing existing debt. Farm equipment sales 
are below expectations, and Chicago notes manufacturers are cutting 
back even more.
