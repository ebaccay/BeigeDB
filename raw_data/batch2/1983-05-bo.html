      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 18, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The First District is in the early stages of a recovery. Retailers 
are enjoying stronger sales than expected and are developing fairly 
optimistic plans for the future. Most manufacturers have also seen 
an upturn in orders, although, in contrast to the retailers, several 
think the recovery is weaker than normal. Interest in capital 
spending is apparently quite high but firms are unwilling to make 
commitments until the recovery is more clearly established.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the First District continue to outpace expectations. 
The strength appears to be general; no specific product lines were 
reported to be especially strong or weak. Sunday retail openings in 
Massachusetts have had a small positive effect on total sales in. 
the state, but the other New England states are also doing well. 
Price increases have slowed considerably from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      The range of sales increases reported for recent months compared to 
a year earlier was from a "very successful" 11 percent to an 
"excellent" 15 percent. Two merchants mentioned that these results 
compare even more favorably to recent years than the nominal figures 
indicate, because inflation accounts for a much smaller share of the 
growth than has been typical recently. A pet store chain, more 
cyclically sensitive than many retail operations, said this pickup 
was stronger than usual after a recession, but the slowdown had also 
been more severe.
     </p>
     <p>
      Plans are fairly optimistic over the long run. The pet store chain 
said they thought sales growth would slow somewhat over the next six 
months, but then would pick up again. They and another contacted 
firm have new stores in the planning stages and expressed confidence 
in New England's continuing growth potential.
     </p>
     <p>
      Comparisons with other regions were mixed. A discount chain with 13 
percent sales growth in New England in April contrasted that result 
with 4 percent for the chain nationwide. A department store chain 
with affiliated chains in other regions said they no longer stood 
alone at the head of the pack—other regions were beginning to 
catch up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the manufacturers contacted have seen an upturn in orders 
over the past several months; the products of firms reporting 
increases include inks, adhesives, specialty steel, bearings, 
castings, hardware, specialized industrial machinery and process 
controls. The increase in demand is said to be broadly based with no 
one industry or group of industries responsible for the improvement. 
Exceptions to the reports of increased activity come from two firms 
in the machine tool industry; orders are no longer declining but 
they have not risen from the very depressed levels of year-end. 
Opinions differed on how this recovery compares with past 
recoveries. A large manufacturer of fabricated metal products and 
machinery described the upturn as "typical:" orders for construction 
related products picked up first, automotive products followed, 
light machinery is beginning to show encouraging signs, and heavy 
machinery remains depressed. Several manufacturers said the recovery 
has been weaker than normal; three, producing castings, bearings and 
control equipment, said demand has picked up a little sooner than 
they expected. A number noted that inquiries about capital purchases 
have risen sharply but customers are not following through with 
commitments. This development was interpreted to mean that customers 
are planning capital programs but are waiting to see if the recovery 
will be sustained. One firm said that when customers do place orders 
they want delivery in an unusually short time period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several manufacturers are starting to increase employment. One, the 
castings manufacturer, has recalled all those previously laid off 
and is planning to expand. No one plans substantial layoffs, 
although two or three expect their workforces to fall through 
attrition.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, the firms contacted have not seen any increases in the 
prices of materials and components. However, one reported that the 
prices of nickel, cobalt and molybdenum are rising. These metals 
were selling at prices below the cost of production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England housing construction has improved markedly in recent 
months. Between December 1982 and March 1983 seasonally adjusted 
housing permits in the region jumped 89 percent. Despite the sharp 
increase, a building goods supply house reported no shortage of 
supplies in any major category—roofing, insulation, and lumber. 
Lumber prices in the first quarter of 1983 were about 5 to 6 percent 
above year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial office building activity continues at a vigorous rate in 
the major cities of the First District. Most of the projects will 
become available for occupancy over the next year and a half. Very 
few definite plans have been made for the period after 1985 but real 
estate brokers report that interest in further building remains 
high. Vacancy rates have increased, but are considered manageable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Houthakker, Eckstein, Samuelson, and Solow were available 
for comment this month. Their comments focused on the economic 
outlook, monetary policy, and the federal deficit.
     </p>
     <p>
      All agreed that the recovery is weak and fragile. Eckstein is 
confident that consumer spending will pick up shortly, assuring that 
the recovery will not dissipate later in the year. He is concerned, 
however, that high "real interest rates are limiting expansion of 
housing, auto sales, and capital spending. None were concerned about 
a near-term resurgence of inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nevertheless, Houthakker cautioned against a shift toward ease in 
monetary policy. He feels that technical factors are still 
distorting growth in the monetary aggregates, depriving the Fed of 
the information needed to determine whether such a shift would be 
appropriate. He would like to see more attention paid to a credit 
target. When it was pointed out to him that business loan demand has 
been weak, he still counseled against easier money on the grounds 
that it would take pressure off of Congress to deal with the deficit 
problem. He feels that by maintaining its current stance the Fed 
props up interest rates, which in turn provides Congress with an 
incentive to cut deficits. He is concerned about deficits several 
years out, not those projected for the short run.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein feels that monetary policy is pretty much on track, 
although ideally he would like to see short-term interest rates fall 
another 100 basis points. Over the next several quarters he thinks 
the Fed should try to stabilize short-term "real" interest rates at 
between 3 and 5 percent in order to promote steady, moderate growth. 
He warned against the "excesses fueled by cheap credit of previous 
postwar expansions." Like Houthakker he fears that huge deficits in 
1985 and beyond could cause interest rates to rise, choking off the 
recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson also believes that the Fed is supplying just about the 
right amount of stimulus to the economy, although he wishes that the 
near-term prospects for economic growth were better. Over 1983, he 
would like to see fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter growth of between 
5 and 6 percent instead of the 4 to 5 percent currently predicted. 
To this end he cautions the Fed not to adopt a tighter stance, which 
he believes monetarist doctrine would demand at this time. In his 
opinion inflation will not be a problem in 1983 or 1984 because of 
the oil glut; dissonance in OPEC; plentiful crops, meat, and fiber; 
weakness in markets for primary metals; and decelerating unit labor 
costs. He believes that the growth rates of the monetary aggregates 
will regain their target ranges without a change in course of 
monetary policy. He urges the Fed not to try to lower the inflation 
rate by another 1 to 2 percent at all costs, because the sacrifices 
we have made over the last few years in lost profits, investment, 
and employment have been too great.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solow also thinks that the rate of economic growth over the year 
should be higher. He thinks that the Fed should insure the recovery 
by easing its current stance. He doubts that a shift toward ease 
would fuel inflation down the road. He is not worried about the 
deficit in the short run and would accept measures to reduce it in 
1983 and 1984 only if monetary policy were much more lenient. He 
concedes that three to five years from now deficits could be a 
problem.
