        Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity is 
  mixed again in October. In the industrial sector, manufacturers have 
  reported a fourth consecutive month of production cutbacks. At the 
  same time, local retailers say sales are sluggish. Looking ahead, 
  representatives of both sectors see softness in business conditions 
  continuing throughout the year and on into 1980. Both production and 
  retail sales are expected to hold their current levels through 
  April. Bankers are a little more optimistic, however. Loan demand, 
  which is currently soaring, is expected by many to remain strong as 
  the nation slips into a recession and businesses turn to banks to 
  meet their working capital requirements. The prime rate is currently 
  13 1/2 percent in the Third District.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers responding to the October Business Outlook Survey 
  report another major dropoff in local industrial activity. This is 
  the fourth consecutive month in which business has significantly 
  slowed for manufacturers. In terms of specific indicators, shipments 
  are unchanged from September levels while new orders are off 
  substantially. Thus, manufacturers' backlogs continue to shrink as 
  they have done since June. The slowdown in production has led over 
  40 percent of the manufacturers surveyed in October to make further 
  cuts in inventories. Local labor has yet to really feel the pinch 
  though. Although the workweek has been trimmed at many area firms, 
  payrolls have not as yet been cut as a result of the slippage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking ahead to the next two quarters, survey respondents foresee 
  further slowing in the industrial sector but expect recovery by 
  April. By that time, manufacturers expect overall business activity 
  to be about the same as it is now. New orders should be higher in 
  six months than they are now, but shipments will remain steady, 
  causing a build-up of unfilled orders. Plans to increase capital 
  spending are also reported. No inventory rebuilding is forecast, 
  however. In fact, further paring of stocks is anticipated. Local 
  labor is expected, by April, to have felt some of the effects of the 
  slowdown, too. Payrolls are forecast to be fractionally smaller by 
  then, and the workweek will likely be shorter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inflation appears to have picked up in October in the local 
  industrial sector. The cost of raw materials is up from September at 
  over three-fourths of the firms surveyed this month, and the prices 
  of finished goods are higher at over half. By April, 9 out of 10 
  respondents expect to be paying more for inputs, and 3 out of 4 plan 
  to be charging more for the goods they produce.
       </p>
       <p>
        Area bankers say business remains brisk in October. Consumer loans 
  have not taken the dip many expected to see by now, and commercial 
  loans are up from 7 to 25 percent over October '78 levels. It's 
  difficult to say how much of the strength in business loan volume 
  comes from a basically strong market though, as the banks reporting 
  the biggest gains have been following aggressive pricing policies 
  recently. This activity may be taken as an indication that no signs 
  of a credit crunch have been observed as yet. However, it is the 
  general opinion of the bankers contacted that the loan market will 
  begin to tighten up within two months.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the longer term, bankers contacted had differing views on where 
  loan demand will be going over the next six months. Projections of 
  business loan volume for early spring range from 8 to 9 percent 
  below year-earlier levels to 18 percent above those levels. In favor 
  of continued strength in demand are higher input costs that 
  businesses will face as a result of continued inflation, the need to 
  finance involuntary inventory accumulation, and slower turnover of 
  receivables over the next two quarters. Moreover, interest rates 
  will probably remain too high in the coming months for firms to want 
  to refinance current obligations at fixed rates through nonbank 
  sources. Thus, they will probably continue to go to their banks for 
  money.
       </p>
       <p>
        The prime rate at all of the banks contacted is currently 13 1/2 
  percent. Consistent with a wide range of loan demand forecasts, a 
  broad range of interest rate forecasts is also reported. At one end 
  of the spectrum, some bankers foresee the prime being bumped another 
  25 to 50 basis points in the near future, and then dropping to about 
  12 percent by April. Other forecasts, however, predict no reduction 
  in the prime, but do see less frequent hikes. The prime rate may, 
  according to those forecasts, hover around 14 percent six months 
  from now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Area retailers report some nominal growth in sales in October, but, 
  after adjusting for inflation (by the LIFO price index) sales volume 
  is just about even with year-ago levels or a little off. Current 
  dollar sales are reported to range from 3 to 5 percent over October 
  '78 sales. Merchants cite a general slowing of the economy as the 
  cause of recent sluggishness, and point to slower collection rates 
  on installment debt at their stores as evidence supporting this 
  assertion. Retail inventories remain in good shape despite several 
  months of soft sales, as merchants keep a sharp eye on their stock 
  levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        As for the future, local retailers remain cautious overall. They 
  generally believe that the U.S. is in for a recession that may last 
  a bit longer than many forecasters have been predicting, and are 
  planning accordingly. Nominal sales next spring are expected to be 2 
  to 3 percent over year-earlier figures-probably flat in real terms. 
  Retailers contacted plan to keep inventories trim in the coming 
  months.
