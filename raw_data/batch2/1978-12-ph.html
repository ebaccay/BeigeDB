      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 13, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Indications from the Third District are that local economic activity 
  is mixed in December. Manufacturers say business conditions have 
  worsened since last month and have consequently held the line on 
  hiring. Looking ahead to the first half of 1979, executives in the 
  industrial sector see business slipping a little further. In the 
  retail sector, merchants report sluggish sales currently and look 
  for more of the same over the next two quarters. Unplanned inventory 
  accumulation is being experienced in some stores, mostly at the 
  larger, national chains. Area bankers report strong loan demand so 
  far in December, and look for continued growth next year. Bankers 
  are in disagreement about the future course of interest rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers responding to this month's Business Outlook Survey say 
  business conditions have deteriorated since November. Only 10 
  percent of the respondents note a pickup in activity at their firms 
  over the last month, while 28 percent report a decline. This yields 
  a "net change" of minus 18 percentage points—the first major decline 
  in business activity at firms in the Survey since March 1975. 
  Supporting the claims of a drop-off in business, respondents report 
  both new orders and shipments to be down in December. Inventories 
  are stable after a dip last month. On the employment front, the size 
  of factory work forces has remained more or less unchanged, while 
  the workweek has been trimmed slightly.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the longer term, manufacturers are generally bearish about 
  future economic conditions. They look for a further slowing of 
  business activity between now and June, with no change in the level 
  of new orders and only a fractional increase in shipments. 
  Consistent with this outlook for production is the forecast of no 
  growth in the size of factory payrolls over the next two quarters 
  along with further cuts in the length of the workweek.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Director of this Bank, whose business is in the manufacturing 
  sector, agrees that the outlook for 1979 is "shaky." In fact, his 
  company is budgeting for a recession next year. He sees a downturn 
  as a virtual certainty and says the only questions are when it will 
  come and how deep it will be.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inflation in the industrial sector continues in December. Over 60 
  percent of the manufacturers polled this month report higher prices 
  for inputs, while about 30 percent are charging more for their 
  finished products. As for the future, the executives surveyed look 
  for price hikes to become more widespread over the next six months. 
  Eighty-six percent of the respondents expect their costs to go up in 
  the first half of 1979, and about 65 percent plan to raise the 
  prices of the goods they sell in that period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sales at area department stores are extremely slow so far in 
  December, but retailers are looking for a big surge to come seven to 
  ten days before Christmas. Reports of current dollar sales range 
  from only 3 percent above to 2 percent below December '77 levels, 
  which means that all merchants contacted have experienced a drop in 
  constant dollar sales. Current sales volume is generally below 
  projected figures for this period, even though those projections 
  were "extremely modest."
       </p>
       <p>
        Local merchants mention several reasons for sluggish sales this 
  month, including unseasonably warm weather which has not put 
  shoppers in the "holiday buying mood" and the possibility that 
  general uncertainty about the course of the economy over the next 
  few months is causing consumers to hold on to dollars they might 
  otherwise spend. Another reason for the poor sales performance might 
  be that this year's sales are being compared to record levels in 
  December '77, making it difficult to show much improvement. However, 
  a Director of this Bank whose business is retailing sees the current 
  sales slowdown as part of a longer-term trend that started in 
  October. He expects consumers will continue to reduce spending and 
  lead the economy into recession next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite slower than expected sales, inventories at department stores 
  based in this area are reported to be in good shape. Contacts in the 
  retail sector indicate that this is not the case in the national 
  chains where stocks are beginning to accumulate at an unplanned 
  pace. Merchants at the smaller, local chains say they have been 
  insulated from unplanned inventory accumulation because they have 
  more flexibility in buying their merchandise than do managers in the 
  larger chains, who often make inventory commitments many months in 
  advance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking ahead to the next six months, most retailers contacted 
  foresee little improvement in business, with the exception of the 
  period immediately prior to Christmas. Forecasts of sales between 
  now and June range from "flat" to 4 percent ahead of year-earlier 
  levels. Some plans to cut inventories early in 1979 are reported.
       </p>
       <p>
        Area bankers say that the demand for both consumer and business 
  loans is generally strong this month. Reports of current C&amp;I loan 
  volume compared to December '77 levels range from "about even" to 8 
  1/2 percent ahead. This is generally as expected or a little ahead 
  of plan for this period. As for the future, contacts in the banking 
  sector foresee moderate to strong growth in loan demand over the 
  next six months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Future interest rates are a matter of some speculation and 
  disagreement among local bankers. Expectations concerning the timing 
  of a peak in rates, as well as their actual levels, vary widely. Six 
  month projections of the prime rate, currently 11 1/2 percent at all 
  of the banks contacted, range from a climb to 12 percent by early 
  1979 and then a plateau through June, to a continued rise over the 
  next two quarters with a prime rate of 13 percent occurring in early 
  summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        High interest rates continue to cause some disintermediation at area 
  banks, but the problem is apparently not serious. At least part of 
  the outflow of funds from consumer-type time and savings deposits is 
  being offset by new purchases of 6-month money market certificates. 
  The certificates are being aggressively promoted currently. 
  Moreover, a large portion of the certificates first issued in June 
  and now coming due are reportedly being rolled over, thereby 
  supplying the banks with a continuing source of funds.
