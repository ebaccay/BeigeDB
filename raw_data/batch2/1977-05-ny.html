      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District continues to improve 
moderately according to directors, businessmen and economists 
recently contacted. The quickening pace of the national economy was 
largely expected by respondents and thus necessitated few revisions 
in the economic outlook. Several contacts anticipate that inventory 
positions in various industries will be moderately built up in the 
months ahead. The outlook for capital spending remains mixed. At 
least at this point, it appears that the Administration's energy 
proposals, while adding to planning uncertainties, are unlikely to 
have a substantive, near-term impact on capital spending. On the 
price scene, there was widespread concern that the rate of inflation 
was intensifying.
      <p>
       Department store sales in the New York metropolitan area appear to 
  have increased at a moderate pace, though apparently less rapidly 
  than in the nation as a whole. Respondents pointed to some evidence 
  that New York City stores have been registering greater gains than 
  their suburban counterparts, thereby reversing a long-term trend. 
  The prospects for department store sales during the second quarter 
  are generally considered good. Merchants are even more sanguine over 
  widening profit margins because of cautious tailoring of inventories 
  to sales. Thus, they do not expect the substantial and widespread 
  price markdowns created a year ago by burdensome inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       District auto dealers have also become more optimistic in recent 
  weeks. While the president of a trade association said that sales in 
  the New York metropolitan area were slow, he attributed this to 
  adverse publicity of one manufacturer interchanging engines and 
  considered that the effect would be short-lived. The brightening 
  sales prospects were also shared by an official of a New Jersey 
  trade association. Reporting that sales had recently improved, he 
  looks for fairly good sales for the remainder of the year. The 
  President's energy proposals were not expected to adversely affect 
  auto sales. One respondent stated that most new cars were already 
  meeting the proposed miles-per-gallon standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to the nation as a whole, several District economists 
  anticipate that inventory investment will strengthen in the months 
  ahead. By and large, inventories appear to be at desired levels 
  locally. However, an economist at one large chemical manufacturer 
  expects inventory rebuilding due to a recent pickup in sales. The 
  vice president of a capital goods firm reported that production is 
  being stepped up because of rising shipments and low inventories. A 
  spokesman for a steel manufacturer in western New York said he 
  expects his firm to be reducing inventories to meet liquidity needs 
  but anticipates that steel customers will continue building 
  inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook for plant and equipment expenditures remains mixed. The 
  president of a major metals producer noted little likelihood of a 
  pickup in capital spending, especially in basic industries. On the 
  other hand, a capital goods executive stated that its orders and 
  shipments had just reached a record high. The president of a major 
  New York City bank reported mixed signals from his customers. Some 
  firms appear to be holding back on capital spending, while others, 
  most notably automobiles, are going ahead with increased outlays.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to the President's proposed energy program, most 
  respondents felt that there were so many uncertainties to be 
  resolved that its impact on capital expenditures could not be 
  determined at this time. Utility executives indicated that their 
  spending plans would be unaffected in the near term. All planned 
  projects are in keeping with the President's goalsâ€”involving 
  either the installation of nuclear plants or the conversion of 
  existing facilities to coal. Some of the utilities foresee possible 
  additional expenditures if they are forced by the final legislation 
  to convert their remaining oil-burning facilities to some other 
  fuel. The chief economist of a petroleum firm stated that domestic 
  profit margins were generally not high enough to warrant new 
  investment due to governmental regulations. Most respondents viewed 
  the Carter energy program as incomplete, failing to provide 
  incentives for increasing the supply of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuing inflation remains a dominant concern of respondents. 
  Although none foresaw any immediate danger of a return to double-digit rates, apprehensions were expressed by a larger number of 
  contacts. Most felt that some upward pressure on prices would result 
  if the energy proposals were enacted but not a substantial amount. 
  Cost factors were cited by an industry spokesman as the reason for a 
  probable near-term rise in steel prices and an economist with a food 
  company anticipates further increases in food prices this year. 
  However, a spokesman from the metals industry expects no substantial 
  rise in metals prices soon, stating that market factors prevented 
  his firm from fully passing on increased costs.
