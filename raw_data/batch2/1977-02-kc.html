      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>

      <strong>
       February 9, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District purchasing managers report that materials 
  availability is good, price increases have been relatively modest 
  recently, and inventories are generally at desired levels. Steel and 
  polyethylene are the two areas cited as especially soft. The weather 
  has not as yet created any serious supply problems. Although food 
  prices may rise somewhat due to weather-damaged fruits and 
  vegetables, ample supplies of red meat should continue to dampen the 
  total increase in consumer food costs for at least the first half of 
  1977. Agricultural loan demand has been weaker than usual, but some 
  bankers expect this to change as spring approaches. On the other 
  hand, real estate, commercial, and industrial loans have been above 
  their seasonal norm in some District states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District purchasing managers indicate that conditions are 
  little changed from those reported in December. Across a wide range 
  of industries, materials availability is good to excellent and is 
  expected to remain so through 1977. Prices are generally behaving as 
  last year and inventories are being closely controlled. Weakness in 
  both sales and prices is noted, however, by steel warehousers and 
  fabricators. One respondent observed, "The mills are crying for 
  business and so are we. Deals are being made daily." Price weakness 
  is also cited in the market for polyethylene and certain chemicals. 
  Some managers are concerned that the weather might create temporary 
  problems with their East Coast suppliers. For example, the Ford 
  assembly plant in Kansas City was forced to close temporarily, but 
  widespread general problems have not yet developed. While most 
  respondents report their inventories as "where they should be," 
"intentionally lean," and "in good shape," a few have increased 
  levels above last year in anticipation of higher demand. Overall, 
  the mood of surveyed purchasing managers appears to be one of 
  cautious optimism.
     </p>
     <p>
      Though prices received by farmers increased 1.5 per cent during the 
  month ending January 15, they remain 2 per cent below year-ago 
  levels, while the index of prices paid by farmers is 4 per cent 
  above year-ago levels. Farmers received higher prices for 
  vegetables, feed grains and hay, meat animals, and oil-bearing 
  crops. However, the index of meat animal prices remains 9 per cent 
  below year-earlier levels, despite modest improvement in the month 
  ending January 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ample supplies of red meat should continue to dampen any increases 
  in consumer food costs that might arise from the weather-damaged 
  fruit and vegetable crops, at least during the first half of 1977. 
  Although numbers of cattle on feed January 1 were 3 per cent less 
  than a year earlier, they were 24 per cent higher than 2 years ago. 
  Feedlot placements during the fourth quarter of 1976 were up 5 per 
  cent over a year ago and 34 per cent above 2 years ago. Distress 
  sales of cows and calves between now and April 1, due to drought and 
  winter feed shortages, will further add to the beef supply. However, 
  large beef supplies during the first half of 1977 will likely be 
  followed by shorter supplies and higher prices during the last half 
  of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pork producers have increased their farrowing plans for December 
  1976-May 1977 by 5 per cent over year-ago levels. Combined with a 
  June-November 1976 pig crop that was 18 per cent larger than a year 
  earlier, pork is expected to remain in good supply through most of 
  1977. Consequently, hog prices will likely decline from present 
  levels and remain below 1976 levels for most of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total loan demand during January at Tenth District banks was 
  seasonally stronger than usual due to larger than normal increases 
  in real estate, commercial, and industrial loans in Nebraska and 
  Colorado. Respondents from the remainder of the District reported 
  either flat or declining loan demand. In contrast to strength in 
  these categories, agricultural loan demand was weaker than usual.
     </p>
     <p>
      The demand for real estate loans appears to be mostly for 
  construction on commercial property. Respondents almost uniformly 
  indicated no residential loan demand, although one banker in New 
  Mexico felt that this category would pick up later in the year. In 
  the commercial and industrial category, respondents in Colorado 
  indicated that loans were being extended to ski resorts which at 
  this time of the year would normally be repaying prior loans. These 
  same respondents also indicated strong loan demand by companies 
  engaged in coal mining and oil drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to most respondents, agricultural loan demand was weaker 
  than usual because of the effect of the adverse weather on cattle 
  feeders. A few bankers, however, indicated there were cattle loans 
  that soon would have to be extended. Some respondents also felt that 
  agricultural loans would increase in the spring, especially if some 
  replanting needs to be done this spring because of damage to the 
  winter wheat crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      Investments in the Tenth District have also increased substantially 
  more than usual, with a good deal of the increase being in the 1- to 
  5-year maturity category. Most respondents indicated that their own 
  banks were investing in relatively shorter term maturities because 
  they were anticipating that interest rates would increase shortly.
