      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 5, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although there are presently cross currents at work, the primary 
thrust of the District economy seems to be forward. Employment 
appears to be making substantial gains despite seasonal weakness in 
some sectors. Retail sales have been holding their own and most 
observers are encouraged by the early indicators of holiday buying 
strength. Construction activity is essentially unchanged, remaining 
strong in the metropolitan areas, somewhat less robust elsewhere. 
Countering all of these positive factors, is what appears to be a 
sharp contraction in the textiles and apparel industries. Several 
major layoffs and plant closings around the District have been 
announced recently, and industry employment has fallen 
substantially. This contraction is generally attributed to rapidly 
increasing imports of competing products. Business loan demand seems 
stable and relatively strong, although there are variations from 
area to area. In agriculture, an excellent growing season in much of 
the District, good prices, end a strong livestock sector should make 
for significantly improved cash receipts in 1984 and some relief on 
the agricultural credit front.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The manufacturing sector must almost be treated as two, since the 
behavior of textiles and apparel differs sharply from most other 
sectors. On balance, the District's manufacturing industries are 
continuing to expand output and employment, and the gains appear 
significant in some industries, such as machinery and electrical 
equipment, where year over year gains in employment remain the rule. 
Building materials and furniture production and employment have 
apparently stabilized after several months of ups and downs. 
Textiles and apparel, on the other hand, after a year of little 
change, began cutting back employment and output, severely in some 
cases. As noted, the import situation is a major factor. Nationally, 
1983's record for textile and apparel imports had been broken by the 
end of September.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories at the manufacturing level are essentially stable and 
there is little noticeable dissatisfaction with present levels. 
Current plant and equipment capacity also remains basically at 
desired levels, and there is little inclination on the part of most 
manufacturers to alter existing expansion plans. Prices in the 
manufacturing sector continue stable, with no significant upward 
pressure apparent in any sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal production in the District, as in the nation, fell rather 
substantially after the BCOA-UMW negotiations were completed. 
Nonetheless, production, year to date, remains well ahead of last 
year, and record output is still within reach.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another segment of the District bringing in an outstanding year is 
the ports. Although much of the traffic is in imports, activity, 
particularly at the District's larger ports, has been very strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in the District has been quite strong for some 
time, and indications are that it remains so. Earlier, there was 
some trepidation among retailers, but recent developments have 
apparently relieved it. Early indications are that the holiday 
buying season got off to a good start. Most observers think that 
sales will be up from a year ago, and thus, quite healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even before the seasonal kick-off, durable goods sales which sagged 
in late summer, had rebounded and were making gains relative to 
other product lines. Although retailers had expressed some concern 
over inventory levels, their fears on that front seem to have been 
quieted as well. Part of the improvement in retailers attitudes 
arose from their perception that sales were doing well despite 
unfavorable weather conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, the construction industry In the District is staying 
busy. Variation persists, particularly between the larger cities and 
smaller towns and rural areas. There are presently indications, 
however, that industrial projects are lending support to a number of 
localities outside the urban areas. Within the metropolitan areas 
commercial and residential construction are still doing well, apart 
from seasonal factors. There are indications, however, that in some 
of these areas multifamily residential markets have or are about to 
weaken while excess supplies are worked off.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural sector of the Fifth District should experience or 
economic rebound in the current year. An excellent growing season 
throughout most of the District, good prices, and a strong livestock 
sector should provide $8.15-$8.20 billion in cash receipts for 
1984 about 10-12 percent  above the drought reduced 1983 level, 
but only about equal the 1982 mark. The cost of production should 
exhibit only modest increases over the same period, leaving the net 
income of farmers substantially improved over the 1983 position.
     </p>
     <p>
      The improved income position of District farmers is expected to show 
up in the District agricultural credit picture. The quarterly survey 
of agricultural credit conditions indicates that agricultural loan 
repayment rates are improving at District banks. In addition, short 
and intermediate loan demand is strengthening although the demand 
for long term loans remains weak. District farmland prices are 
stabilizing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook around the District has improved somewhat in recent 
weeks, although most respondents see activity as essentially flat in 
coming months. Apart from the textile and apparel sectors, the 
improvement in outlook seems to have arisen as activity continued at 
levels previously considered unsustainable. The trade deficit 
remains a major concern, particularly among the textile, apparel, 
and furniture manufacturers. Their attitudes are clearly less 
buoyant than those in other sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers and retailers are confident, particularly since recent 
sales activity has improved. There remains little concern with the 
prospect for inflation.
