      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 10, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        This month's District reports indicated that the economy did not 
  show any distinct signs of slipping further. The business situation 
  actually strengthened a bit in some districts, although it did 
  little more than hold steady in most areas of the country. 
  Department store sales remain lackluster, but automobile sales have 
  rebounded somewhat from their recent lows. Automobile and steel 
  production continues to be sluggish, but strength in other 
  industries such as aerospace and capital goods has buoyed the 
  economies of many districts. Inventories remain generally in line 
  with anticipated sales. Total construction activity remains strong 
  with increases in non-residential building offsetting declines in 
  residential. Farm income is expected to rise with the recent bumper 
  harvest. Although inflation continues unabated, some letup is 
  expected before the end of the year. Demand for business loans 
  continues at a high level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Department store sales remain mixed across the country. Boston and 
  Kansas City have recently experienced some modest improvement, and 
  New York reports fairly robust gains. In many districts, the 
  increases in retail sales have outpaced inflation. However, 
  retailers are anxious about the future, and in Cleveland where sales 
  growth has slowed there is concern over falling profit margins and 
  rising loan delinquencies and bad debt losses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Automobile sales have recently picked up, and appear to be quite 
  strong in New York. In several districts, it is feared, though, that 
  the recent spurt in sales was the result of the extensive price 
  incentives and that sales will weaken once these incentives are 
  ended. Other vehicle sales remain weak, particularly for the larger 
  cars, recreational and four-wheel drive vehicles, and light trucks. 
  Meanwhile, Chicago reports that auto assemblies in October are 
  scheduled to be 12 percent lower than last year and truck assemblies 
  33 percent lower, thus continuing the pattern of the third quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        In certain parts of the country, tourism has rebounded from the 
  nadir reached during the gasoline shortages. Recent increases in 
  northern New England may even be sufficient to offset earlier 
  losses. In Atlanta, tourism is now about equal to last year, and the 
  recent groundbreaking in Florida for Disney's Experimental Prototype 
  Community of Tomorrow bodes well for the future there. In contrast, 
  tourism remains depressed in San Francisco.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other business activity appears to be holding up fairly well. 
  Automobile production and steel orders have stabilized at lower 
  levels. Strength in aerospace, electronics, and small appliances has 
  led to input shortages in Kansas City. Conditions in Boston have 
  improved, partly as a result of increased export sales. San 
  Francisco reports continued strength, but industrial output slipped 
  again in Philadelphia. In Richmond, although employment fell, it did 
  so at a slower rate than in the two previous months.
       </p>
       <p>
        In general, the capital goods industry remains strong despite a 
  slowdown in orders. Order backlogs are still high, and St. Louis 
  reports that in some companies they have continued to increase. 
  Capital spending plans continue undiminished, although investment 
  activity is not uniform across sectors. Boston reports capital 
  spending by industries producing consumer appliances and electrical 
  equipment for the home is already weak, but that spending by the 
  chemical, rubber, and non-automotive transportation industries is at 
  record levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inflation continues rampant, but the rate of increase varies by 
  industry and section of the country. For example, robust building 
  activity in Dallas has contributed to the rapid price increases of 
  building materials there. In contrast, the decline in the demand and 
  hence the price of steel scrap has helped to lower steel prices. 
  Overall, there seems to be the feeling that price increases for the 
  rest of the year will be less dramatic than they have been. However, 
  continued inflation combined with the recent GM-UAW settlement has 
  raised some concern over the future level of wage demands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inventories are still reported to be on the lean side, as firms 
  continue to be extremely cautious. Those few cases in which retail 
  inventories are reported to be somewhat high are not expected to 
  result in any large or sudden corrections. In fact, the moderate 
  build-up previously experienced in St. Louis has already been worked 
  off. Even the large auto inventories have been greatly reduced. 
  Business inventories range from "adequate" in Chicago to a level 
  somewhat-above-desired for materials in Richmond. Still, in Richmond 
  and other districts, inventories of finished goods seem, if 
  anything, to be a little on the low side.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent declines in residential construction seem to have been 
  largely offset by increases in non-residential construction. In St. 
  Louis, for example, housing permits are down but total construction 
  employment is at or above last year's level. In some districts such 
  as Chicago and Atlanta, speculative housing starts have been 
  dampened by the very high financing costs. Many banks and financial 
  intermediaries are also becoming much more restrictive in issuing 
  mortgages. In Dallas, although the burst in non-residential 
  construction has been welcomed, it has raised concern of a future 
  oversupply of commercial space.
       </p>
       <p>
        In many areas of the country, farm income is higher than 
  anticipated. Bumper crops, however, have created storage and 
  transportation problems; the recent settling of the grain haulers' 
  strike should, according to Minneapolis, provide some relief. 
  Production is down in Southern California, but price increases have 
  more than compensated for the smaller volume. In contrast, Atlanta 
  reported some farm areas were severely hurt by hurricane Frederic. 
  Losses are also being experienced by those farmers raising hogs and 
  broilers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In most districts, business loan demand remains strong. Cleveland 
  considers this a bad sign, fearing that the borrowing reflects a 
  deterioration in the financial condition of industry. Many of the 
  loans in New York are not for expansion but are for added inventory 
  and acquisitions. Although the higher interest rates have not yet 
  choked off overall demand, Minneapolis is concerned that small 
  businesses are now being hurt. Consumer loans have weakened, but, in 
  Philadelphia, they have not weakened as much as expected.
