      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 10, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Indications from the Third District in August are that business 
activity, though still spotty, continues to improve. Local 
manufacturing has posted major gains again, and retail sales have 
been excellent. Loan activity at area banks, however, has turned 
mixed, and mortgage rates have risen since June, causing a slowdown 
in real estate sales activity.  Resort businessmen report booming 
activity at most area vacation spots, but agriculture officials say 
regional crop yields are down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Third District businessmen are looking for further improvement 
over the next six months. Industrial expansion is expected to remain 
at healthy levels into 1984, department store operators say sales 
should maintain their robust upswing, and banking contacts project 
increases in both commercial and retail lending by February.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District agriculture officials indicate that poor weather 
conditions have reduced many area crop yields, some to unprofitable 
levels. This has been a disastrous year for grain in New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania because the cold, wet spring delayed planting and hot 
and dry weather now is hampering growth. Grain production levels are 
estimated at only 71 percent to 83 percent of 1982 yields, and 
prices are not expected to rise enough to offset these losses in 
volume. Pennsylvania alfalfa hay growers plan four or five cuttings 
this year, but the yield on the third cutting, underway now, is well 
below a normal year's, due to low rainfall in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area vegetable farmers say the hot temperatures have also been harsh 
on their crops. The tomato crop will be about 91 percent of last 
year's production, and potatoes, soybeans, and peppers are all 
running below 1982 levels. Vegetable prices are strong, though, and 
growers are projecting a pretty good year profit-wise. Many of the 
summer's fruit crops, especially apples and blueberries, have also 
been sub-par.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some crops are doing well this year despite the weather. Peach 
growers are expecting a bumper crop, with yields as high as 38 
percent over last year's levels. The Delaware corn crop, although a 
little bit late, also looks good. Delaware poultry farmers are also 
turning a sound profit for the first time in quite awhile.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate And Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the Third District housing market has dropped off 
somewhat since June, but sales are still 30 percent to 100 percent 
higher than a year ago. Mortgage rates have risen as much as 100 
basis points in the last six weeks and that, contacts say, has been 
enough to dampen demand slightly. With the recent rise in the FHA 
mortgage rate expected to push conventional rates even higher, 
realtors' outlook for housing demand are not as good as in recent 
months. Also, new construction has been heavy, and the inventory of 
unsold new units, which is about as high as that of a year ago, now 
presents a serious problem to builders if demand deteriorates much 
more.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturing has continued its rapid expansion 
through July, according to the most recent Business Outlook Survey. 
Survey results indicate that, after adjusting for seasonal 
pressures, the overall growth from June to July is the most 
substantial observed so far this year. New orders and shipments are 
up over June levels, and, for the first time in two years, inventory 
liquidation has slowed to marginal levels. Manufacturers, however, 
report only slight expansion of either employee ranks or the average 
workweek.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, the recovery in the industrial sector is expected to 
forge ahead over the next six months. Three-quarters of the 
manufacturers participating in the survey foresee better overall 
conditions by early next year; none predict any deterioration in 
activity over that time. New orders are projected to continue to 
outrun shipments, resulting in higher levels of unfilled orders, and 
manufacturing inventories are expected to grow. Survey respondents 
also say they will increase their capital spending by early 1984 and 
are likely to hire more employees and lengthen working hours as 
well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices have risen again. Reports of price hikes are 
slightly more prevalent than in June, as 30 percent of the 
respondents indicate that input costs are higher this month, and 
just under 20 percent say they have raised their own prices. 
Projections of further price inflation by next year are widespread.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales at Third District department stores are progressing smartly in 
August, according to local store operators. Dollar volume is as good 
as, if not better than, merchants had anticipated, notching solid 
gains of between 8 percent and 12 percent on a year-over-year basis. 
Retailers believe that consumer balance sheets have been in good 
order lately and that shoppers are spending the money received as a 
result of the July tax cut. Wealth gains from the stock market have 
also had an influence on sales activity. Virtually all lines, 
including durables, have been moving quickly this month, with men's 
and children's clothing doing especially well.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the best part of the sales year yet to come, area retailers are 
highly optimistic about the future. Merchants are projecting a 
banner holiday season and a solid start in 1984, but they say that 
gains on a year-over-year basis are likely to slip from this month's 
highs because sales in early 1983 were fairly strong. Store 
operators are planning conservatively, though, and they have brought 
inventories back in line with year-ago levels. Stocks will be kept 
lean, but not so tight that merchants risk losing sales if activity 
exceeds their projections.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan activity at major banks in the Third District is mixed in 
August. Local bankers report that commercial lending has been 
declining slightly over the last six weeks, somewhat out of tune 
with lenders' projections. C&amp;I loans, which contacts say currently 
range from 15 percent below to 14 percent above last August's 
figures, are exhibiting the "summer doldrums" at many banks and that 
seasonal softness has caused further deterioration of already weak 
business loan demand. Consumer loan activity, on the other hand, has 
risen again this month, and volume remains ahead of a year ago. 
Expanding credit demands and aggressive marketing by lenders have 
given retail lending a strong boost despite some recent softening in 
mortgage and automobile lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the next six months, area bankers are forecasting modest gains 
in lending activity. Commercial loan demand is expected to firm up 
slowly as businesses begin to rebuild inventories and to expand 
capital expenditures. Consumer lending is also likely to show 
further improvement, but bankers expect that further weakening in 
the housing sector will continue to limit retail loan growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most local bankers agree that we have now seen the trough of an 
interest rate cycle. Financial contacts foresee rates trending 
upward as commercial loan demand picks up and financing of the 
federal deficit expands. The rise, however, is likely to be slow and 
irregular with the prime, currently holding steady at 10.5 percent, 
creeping up about 100 basis points by the middle of the first 
quarter of 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit flows in the Third District continue to weaken this month. 
Demand deposits have declined again, and are now only about 3 
percent ahead of a year ago. That change is partly seasonal. 
However. Time deposits, on the strength of the MMDA, are still far 
ahead on a year-over-year basis. Several contacts have noticed a 
drop-off in other time deposits, chiefly in 26-week and 30-month 
certificates, apparently reflecting depositors' anticipation of 
higher interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourist Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Officials at vacation spots in the Third District report a 
substantial resurgence of tourist activity this summer. Tourist 
traffic and spending is ahead of last year's volume at most major 
resorts in the tri-state area. Business at seashore resorts in 
Delaware and southern New Jersey has been booming so far this 
season. Contacts there attribute the strength to perfect beach 
weather, an improved consumer outlook on the economy, and excellent 
fishing. Attendance at area amusement parks has also been very heavy 
because of the weather. Pennsylvania's mountain vacation spots are 
the exception to the good news, though. Rain and bad weather washed 
out several important early season weekends, and tourist traffic is 
just beginning to gain on year-earlier levels. Pocono spokesmen say 
the current pace of activity is good, but heavy competition from 
Atlantic City and lingering unemployment in the nearby steel regions 
of Pennsylvania have kept tourist business below expectations thus 
far.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for the balance of the season, however, is equally 
bright across the district. Advance reservations have nearly filled 
available lodgings at the seashore for the rest of the summer, and 
incoming inquiries are 20 percent to 30 percent ahead of last 
season's pace in the Poconos. If the weather holds out, tourist 
business is expected to approach record levels by season's-end.
