      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Confidence that the expansion will continue appears to have 
  strengthened in the Seventh District in the past month. Most 
  observers believe that the recent slowdown is about to give way to 
  renewed growth. Fears of price and wage controls are causing some 
  companies to post price increases earlier than had been anticipated. 
  Large retailers are very pleased with recent levels of sales. Output 
  is expected to be significantly higher in virtually all industries 
  in 1977. Abnormally cold weather has sharply boosted sales of 
  natural gas. The outlook for capital goods is somewhat brighter. 
  Apartment construction is expected to rise substantially next year. 
  The financial picture in the district is generally excellent, but 
  farm credit conditions have deteriorated in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most business and financial executives and analysts accept the 
  standard forecast that both real GNP and the price level will 
  average about 5 percent higher in 1977. Most expect some 
  acceleration as the year proceeds. Moreover, most believe that their 
  own businesses will show gains approximating those foreseen for the 
  general economy. There is a sharp divergence of opinion on the need 
  for tax reduction. All agree that a tax cut would be stimulatory, 
  but many believe that activity will improve without such stimulus. 
  Confidence is judged to be of crucial importance, particularly for 
  capital spending. Most business executives do not believe that an 
  increase in the investment tax credit from 10 to 15 percent would 
  have a significant impact on demand for capital goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Supplies of all goods and services appear ample at the present time. 
  However, gypsum board and lumber will be in tight supply if housing 
  starts reached the 1.8 million level, which is commonly accepted as 
  a reasonable guess for 1977. Late in 1977, shortages of gray iron 
  castings, forgings, raw steel, and certain chemicals are possible 
  and even predicted by some analysts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although prices of various materials—e.g., nonferrous metals and 
  paper-board—are soft currently, many producers of components and 
  finished goods are posting increases in prices to "catch up" with 
  rising costs. Partly, this reflects fears of new price controls, 
  despite assurances to the contrary. Some increases in list prices 
  may not hold up in the marketplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite talk of "inventory congestion," we are unable to find 
  significant examples of excessive inventories. Small cars are a 
  notable exception. Production was adjusted rapidly by steel, 
  appliance, chemical, and paperboard companies when demand lagged 
  expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major retailers report that their total sales showed excellent 
  increases in November and early December. Credit sales have 
  increased relative to the total and collection experience has been 
  good. Consumers are said to be "loosening up." In contrast to 
  experience of the largest merchandisers, some smaller companies 
  report little or no increase in sales from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major airline reports that passenger travel, measured in seat 
  miles, rose significantly in November, seasonally adjusted, 
  following a flat trend from the spring through October. For 1976 as 
  a whole, traffic is expected to be up 10 percent and a 6 percent 
  rise is projected for 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasts of auto sales have been reduced for both 1976 and 1977 by 
  most analysts, but a rise of about 5 percent still is expected for 
  next year. Sales of compacts and subcompacts have been even poorer 
  than expected, while most intermediates have done very well. 
  Saturday and even Sunday overtime is scheduled for components of the 
  most popular models. Sales of RVs have been excellent. Sales of 
  heavy and medium trucks are expected to rise about 25 percent next 
  year, but sales of light trucks may decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for capital equipment continues slow, but some improvement is 
  discernible overall. Sales of most types of heavy construction 
  equipment remain very poor with no signs of a revival. Farm 
  equipment sales are expected to be down 5 to 10 percent next year. 
  On the upside, orders for electric motors, controls, materials 
  handling equipment, overhead cranes, hoists, and some types of 
  mining and construction equipment have strengthened recently. 
  Overall, demand for capital equipment is expected to be 
  significantly higher in 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output of industrial chemicals has been about flat since last spring 
  following a strong upsurge early in the year. For 1976 as a whole, 
  unit output of various major groups of chemicals is expected to be 
  up 10 to 20 percent, and increases of 3 to 10 percent—at least 5 
  percent overall—are forecast for 1977. Although capital 
  expenditure programs of chemical companies have been scaled down, 
  further gains are predicted for 1977. The chemical industry is 
  operating at about 80 percent of "capacity." At the time of the 
  worst shortages in 1973-74 operations were at 87 percent of 
  capacity. Partly because of the reduction in capital spending plans, 
  some analysts predict a return of important shortages in late 1977 
  or in 1978.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thus far, the winter has been the coldest in 80 years or more in 
  most areas of the district. Sales of gas by one utility are up 20 
  percent from last year, but supplies appear to be adequate. 
  Electricity sales are also up with December recording the peak load 
  this year, above the usual summer peak. Gas bills for home heating 
  are expected to be 35 to 40 percent higher this year, because of 
  both higher usage and higher rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction of single-family homes in 1977 is expected to match 
  this year's high level. Increases in apartment construction will 
  provide most of the expected rise in total starts. Rising rents are 
  improving prospects for apartment construction. Home mortgage rates 
  have declined with a major lender announcing a reduction from 8.75-9.00 percent to 8.5 percent. Private mortgage insurance is being 
  used increasingly to reduce risks on loans with relatively low 
  downpayments. There are signs of a revival in industrial 
  construction, but mainly smaller projects to be located in "semi-rural" sites.
     </p>
     <p>
      An exception to the general improvement in the financial situation 
  is related to lower prices for farm commodities and drought-stricken 
  harvests in some areas. Many district bankers report slower farm 
  loan repayments and increased renewals. The greatest incidence of 
  deterioration appears concentrated in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
