      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 10, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is expanding at a slightly 
quicker pace than in July. Department store sales have picked up 
somewhat, and reports of improvement in the manufacturing sector are 
more widespread than they were last month. New orders and shipments 
are up in August, and inventories are stable. Employment and the 
workweek in the industrial sector are unchanged. For the longer 
term, however, both retailers and manufacturers are less optimistic. 
Most retailers anticipate a continuation of their recent trend of 
sluggish sales growth. In addition, plans for increases in capital 
spending are reported by a smaller proportion of sampled 
manufacturers than at any time in the past two years. Bankers 
indicate that the consumer loan market remains active, but that 
business loan demand is still weak. Interest rates are holding 
steady, but a gradual rise is expected.
      <p>
       Directors of this Bank and manufacturing executives in the District 
  had mixed reactions to questions about current business conditions. 
  Manufacturers responding to the latest Business Outlook Survey 
  report that conditions are better than in July. Thirty percent of 
  the executives surveyed say that business has improved this month 
  while 6 percent say it has worsened. This "net improvement" of 24 
  percentage points is up from last month but still well below levels 
  set during the preceding three months. New orders and shipments, 
  which were both unchanged last month, are higher in August, and 
  manufacturers' inventories are stable for the fourth consecutive 
  month. At the same time, employment and the average workweek in the 
  manufacturing sector are unchanged. Factory employment showed only 
  slight improvement last month. Directors' comments suggest wide
  variation in economic conditions among industries. One Director, 
  whose company manufactures chemicals, reports that business is slow 
  and is not expected to improve much in coming months. But another, 
  whose firm depends heavily on the auto industry, says business is 
  better than hoped for, and has planned to increase capital spending 
  over the next five months.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the longer term, manufacturers are less optimistic than they 
  have been in recent months. About half of the survey respondents 
  expect business to improve by February—down from 73 percent 
  indicating such expectations last month, and 67 percent in June. 
  Increases in new orders, shipments and inventories are projected, 
  but at a smaller proportion of the sampled firms than in July. Gains 
  in employment continue to be forecast, but these expectations are 
  also less widespread than in the previous survey. Eighteen percent 
  of those polled anticipated expanding their work forces by February, 
  and 24 percent expect to lengthen working hours. Last month these 
  proportions were 25 and 28 percent respectively. Increases in 
  expenditures on plant and equipment are planned at one quarter of 
  the sampled firms. This is the lowest proportion reporting such 
  plans since September 1975.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices in manufacturing continue to increase, climbing at a somewhat 
  faster pace than in July. Over forty percent of those surveyed 
  report paying more for raw materials, while 30 percent say they are 
  receiving higher prices for the products they sell. Almost 9 out of 
  10 foresee higher prices for inputs by February, and 7 out of 10 
  anticipate receiving higher prices for their finished products.
      </p>
      <p>
       The retail sales picture in the area is improving. Department store 
  executives contacted report that current dollar sales range between 
  6 and 25 percent above August '76 levels. Generally, sales are at or 
  above expected levels. Stores in the downtown Philadelphia area have 
  seen recent improvement in sales, but not of the magnitude 
  experienced by suburban stores. Merchants attribute the pickup in 
  center city business to the recent completion of construction in the 
  central business district, allowing better access to the stores, and 
  to large price reductions by a major competitor trying to reduce 
  stock before moving to a new building. Retailers say that, in 
  general, inventories are slightly higher than year-ago levels, but 
  satisfactory. Most see a mild buildup of inventories over the next 
  six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Merchants generally look for only a modest rise in sales during the 
  remainder of the year. While one expects year-end sales to be about 
  14 percent above December '76 levels, most foresee gains in the 4-8 
  percent range. The merchants contacted do not appear to be concerned 
  over the current economic slowdown. The general consensus is that it 
  is a pause in the expansion, and does not warrant changes in buying 
  plans over the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers in the region report that while consumer loan demand remains 
  strong, demand for business loans continues to be weak. Those 
  contacted say that current levels of C&amp;I loans are between 2 percent 
  above and 2 percent below year-ago levels. While local business 
  borrowing is as anticipated or better, the national market continues 
  to lag behind expectations. The prime rate has been held at 6 3/4 
  percent at all of the banks contacted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers appear to be mildly concerned about deposit outflows as 
  their "wild cards" mature. Some have recently raised CD rates in an 
  effort to retain their share of "wild card" holders. One banker, 
  whose bank was already paying the legal maximum on CDs, notes that 
"about one-third of the wild cards have been rolled over into other 
  types of time deposits at this bank. The other two-thirds have been 
  lost."
      </p>
      <p>
       For the rest of the year, bankers expect little change in business 
  loan demand. Virtually all of those contacted anticipate year-end 
  volume to be no higher than at the end of 1976. Interest rates are 
  expected to move up gradually with a prime by the end of this year 
  in the 7-7 1/4 percent range.
