      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 1, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Already weaker than the nation generally, economic conditions in the 
Seventh District deteriorated rapidly in late March, April, May, and 
June. Jobless claims have mounted rapidly. It now appears that the 
recession, in this region at least, will be much deeper, more 
pervasive, and longer than in 1974-75. Price increases have slowed 
and some discounting is noted in wholesale markets. But underlying 
inflationary pressures remain strong, pushed by rising labor costs. 
Virtually all consumer goods and services have been hard hit, and 
the downturn has spread increasingly to capital goods. The farm 
sector, which held up well in 1974-75, is badly depressed despite 
some recent rise in farm prices. Little or no improvement has 
occurred in housing, but nonresidential building remains strong. 
Credit is now generally available on more favorable terms, but 
borrowers are reluctant to incur debt. Delinquencies have increased. 
Although the picture is very gloomy, there are some signs that 
demand in various markets is leveling off at reduced levels, and 
there are scattered reports of modest improvement in the past 4-6 
weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sectors reporting a leveling off of demand at reduced levels in June 
include paper, chemicals, RVs, mobile homes, and steel. In some 
cases a slight improvement is reported. A large national retailer 
sees some rise in sales in June, seasonally adjusted, although the 
picture is still very dark.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our contacts in various industries operating in national and 
international markets tell us that the Midwest, defined broadly as 
the area north of the Ohio from the Appalachians to the Rockies, is 
much the weakest that they serve. Some have noticed no clear 
recession in the South, Southwest, or West Coast.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major capital expenditure programs underway have not been halted, 
but some have been slowed to cut costs, and managements are using 
more exacting standards when considering new programs. On the 
optimistic side, a company that advises on new plant locations 
informs us that new proposals to be studied are still coming in at a 
fast pace. The nonresidential building picture remains strong. 
Contracts had dropped off sharply in the spring, but new office 
buildings and shopping centers again are being announced for near-
term starts, mainly in the Chicago area. Many of these projects are 
financed in substantial part by European funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing industries that have cut production very sharply now 
include autos, trucks, tires and other components, steel, farm 
equipment, construction equipment, RVs, outboard motors, appliances, 
building materials, oil refining, and petrochemicals. Inventories 
were generally viewed as lean early this year, but the rapid drop in 
sales required substantial adjustments in production schedules on 
short notice. In most cases output has been reduced faster than 
consumption, so a reversal may occur later this year. Many plants 
will be shut for several weeks this summer, confusing normal 
seasonal trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      Electric, gas, and telephone utilities have experienced declines in 
demand to a degree unexpected earlier this year. Rail, truck, and 
airline traffic is down significantly. Layoffs have occurred, and 
equipment has been idled. The airlines will cut operations 
substantially after the peak summer season. Truck lines report 
tonnage down 20-40 percent. Truckers are very concerned about shifts 
in traffic patterns under deregulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers report increased order cancellations, but 
not to the extent of 1974-75 when backlogs contained much more 
water. Cancellations are most significant for heavy trucks and rail 
cars, but some machine tool orders are being canceled. Oil and gas 
well equipment is booming.
     </p>
     <p>
      New jobless claims are running about 200 percent above last year in 
our states. In addition, many plants are on short weeks. White-
collar workers have been affected much more than in earlier 
recessions. Many companies complain about the unwillingness of 
unions "to give an inch" in the face of high unemployment and 
company problems. Strikes have halted construction in Milwaukee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many lenders complain of a rapid rise in bankruptcies, especially 
personal bankruptcies, spurred by the recession, the new law, and 
lawyers anxious for business. Among business bankruptcies, vehicle 
dealers and home builders are most common.
     </p>
     <p>
      Existing home sales have picked up slightly as mortgage rates have 
dropped to 12 percent. Rates on RRMs are still lower. Unsold 
backlogs of finished or semifinished homes and builder bankruptcies 
have kept new starts at the lowest levels since World War II.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite recent increases in livestock and crop prices, the farm 
picture in the district remains dismal. Adjusted for inflation, 
total net farm income for the year will be at one of the lowest 
levels since before World War II. This is reflected clearly in the 
severely depressed market for farm equipment. Because of higher 
prices, livestock farmers will do better in the second half of 1980 
than in the first half when large losses were typical. Crop prices 
have edged up, but not nearly enough to offset higher production 
costs. Early prospects suggest excellent crops again this year, but 
probably not at record levels. Crops in parts of Iowa were destroyed 
by hailstorms in June. Most of this acreage was replanted, but 
yields will suffer. Federal programs will help cushion losses of 
farmers affected by hail.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and deposits at district member agricultural banks have been 
very weak this year. Total loans at three banks were 2 percent lower 
in May than in December. No downturns in loans had occurred in this 
period in the 1970s. Total deposits rose slightly, but less than 
half as much as the average for the 1970s.
