      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Except for housing, the economic activity in the Seventh District 
remains surprisingly vigorous. Sectors affected by heavy snows and 
low temperatures in January and February are recovering rapidly, but 
flooding in Illinois is a new problem. Job markets are strong. 
Consumers are spending freely. Price inflation has accelerated. Most 
capital goods producers report rising order backlogs. Inventories 
remain at moderate levels, but manufacturers are moving to increase 
inventories, especially materials such as steel and nonferrous 
metals. Order lead tines have lengthened further. Actual shortages 
of materials or components are rare, but output is pressing close to 
capacity. Barring some new oil crisis, fuel supplies are expected to 
be adequate but with prices rising substantially more than had been 
expected a few months ago. Housing permits and transactions are down 
substantially, but nonresidential activity is moving at a good pace. 
The farm sector is much healthier financially than a year ago. Soil 
moisture is more than adequate.
        <p>
         In recent months about 80 percent of purchasing managers in the 
district have been paying higher prices with virtually none paying 
lower prices—the worst picture since the fall of 1974. Most 
companies say that they intend to comply with the Administration's 
wage-price guidelines, but lack of compliance will be difficult to 
detect in the case of a firm with widely varied lines. Accountants, 
lawyers, and consulting firms are telling their clients that 
mandatory controls are a virtual certainty, perhaps as early as 
September. Prices are being raised frequently, at least list prices, 
so as to place firms in as favorable and flexible a position as 
possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Business firms in both manufacturing and retailing insist that their 
inventories have been low relative to requirements, uncomfortably so 
in some cases. Forecasts, frequently reiterated in the past 6 to 9 
months, that a recession was imminent may have induced excessive 
caution. It appears now that restraints on inventory investments 
have been relaxed. A careful analyst of the metals markets believes 
that a "scramble for materials" is underway unequaled since mid-
1974. Most companies burning oil had laid in extra reserve supplies 
earlier this winter, as much as 3-month requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Backlogs of orders for a broad spectrum of producer equipment have 
continued to rise. Included are construction equipment, farm 
equipment, heavy trucks and trailers, freight cars and locomotives, 
machine tools, diesel engines and other components, electrical and 
nonelectrical. Some of these producers fear that cancellations could 
be sudden and substantial, but there are no signs yet. A Chicago 
based conglomerate with diversified products for both consumers and 
producers recently reported "no sign of a recession in any of our 
divisions."
        </p>
        <p>
         In February 57 percent of Chicago purchasing managers, a highly 
diversified group, reported slower deliveries, compared with 44 
percent in January and 33 percent a year earlier, and the highest 
proportion since the summer of 1974. The situation is similar for 
Milwaukee where capital equipment predominates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Demand for steel has been surprisingly strong with increases for 
structurals and plates as well as for light products. Order books 
are filling to midyear. One factor is the narrowing of the price 
differential favoring foreign steel. A leading Chicago area steel 
producer has taken the unusual step of asking customers to scale 
down or defer deliveries, but without success. Customer inventories 
are believed to be low, and deliveries are needed to maintain 
output. Steel shipments had been slowed by transport problems in 
January and early February. Other sectors with tight inventory 
situations include virtually all nonferrous metals, building 
materials, and paper. Large and special castings and forgings are 
the main bottlenecks for equipment producers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consumer buying appears to be reviving from the slump induced by 
severe weather. Restaurants and recreation spots were hard hit. 
Total auto and truck sales appear to be matching last year's fast 
pace. Four-year car loans are increasingly common, with no rise in 
delinquencies. The more popular small cars are selling very well, 
reminiscent of early 1974, at full list price or even at premiums. 
Demand for small four-wheel drive trucks far exceeds supply, 
obviously a consumer fad. Producers are taking steps to expand 
capacity substantially. On the other hand, some auto plants have cut 
output to control inventories.
        </p>
        <p>
         A well-informed analyst believes that significant general shortages 
of petroleum products can be avoided this year without rationing. 
This assumes that Iran will ship at the indicated 3 million barrel 
per day rate and that other sources are not cut back. Spot shortages 
of no-lead gas are probable, but could be avoided by easing EPA 
standards on regular gas. Oil companies are not planning to boost 
refining capacity which currently is barely adequate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The jet fuel "shortage" is not of great importance. The problem 
partly reflects unbalanced supplies regionally, and heavy use of 
"arctic diesel" in colder areas. There would have been no problem if 
the airlines had not been adding flights rapidly. The largest 
airline has dropped about 4 percent of its flights but departures 
are still 8 percent above a year ago. Capacity is still up 12 
percent because of larger aircraft. Traffic was up 30 percent in the 
most recent week. Burgeoning free rides for kids are included in 
"revenue" passenger miles.
