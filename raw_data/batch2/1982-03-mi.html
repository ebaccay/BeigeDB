      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Ninth District looked generally the same 
in February and early March as they have for quite a while: several 
indicators hinted at recovery, but most remained weak. This time the 
positive hints came from spending on cars and homes, which picked up 
a little; spending on winter sports, which remained strong; the 
costs of manufacturing, which seemed to have eased; and the prices 
farmers receive for livestock, which increased. The negative 
indicators still dominated the positives, however. Spending on 
general merchandise was still sluggish. Manufacturing orders and 
production declined further. The forestry and mining industries were 
depressed again. And low grain prices did not improve. Reflecting 
the economy's general weakness was the continued weakness in bank 
lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise sales have been depressed in the district since 
last summer, and they did not recover this winter. Three large 
Minneapolis-St. Paul retailers reported that their sales did 
increase between January and February, but this increase was only 
temporary. It merely represented spending which consumers had 
postponed in January because of bad weather. In early March, sales 
slumped again. Because of their long sales slump, these metropolitan 
area retailers said they have been watching their inventories very 
closely, and lately they have been cutting back on their part-time 
help, both the number of workers and the hours they work. Outside 
the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, meanwhile, retail sales 
continued to be very weak, according to this Bank's directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home and auto sales also continued to be very weak this winter, but 
they showed some signs of recovery. The president of the Greater 
Minneapolis-St. Paul Area Board of Retailers said that home sales 
climbed steadily from 125 in the last week of January to 294 in the 
first week of March—they more than doubled in about a month. 
Regional sales managers for domestic auto manufacturers said their 
sales improved between January and February too, partly because of 
rebate programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spending on winter sports in the district has been strong this 
season, and it generally remained so in February and early March. At 
the eastern end of the district, unusually cold weather in January 
and early February disrupted the good business that ski operators 
had enjoyed in November and December. However, according to one 
large Minnesota operator, business picked up again in late February, 
and he expected his March business to be 50 percent better than a 
year ago. At the western end of the district, ski area operators 
enjoyed uninterrupted good business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers were not in such good shape this winter: their orders 
and production continued to decline. As many as 50 percent of the 
manufacturers responding to a University of Minnesota survey said 
their new orders declined in the three months ending in February, 
and nearly that many, 47 percent, said their production declined. 
These were larger percentages than the 37 and 24 percent that had 
reported declines in the previous survey. These surveys confirm the 
declines we have reported in the last few Redbooks as well as Bank 
directors' comments about current weak manufacturing activity in 
their areas. Directors said the general weakness stemmed mostly from 
poor demand for building supplies, consumer durables, and 
automobiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      The University's surveys do reveal two developments which indicate 
that manufacturers' costs may have eased lately and so firms may be 
better able to recover lost orders and production. One is that the 
prices manufacturers pay for raw materials and intermediate goods 
don't seem to have been increasing as fast as they were; the number 
of manufacturers reporting such price increases decreased between 
surveys. The other development is that manufacturers appear to have 
brought their inventories of these inputs (and so the costs of 
holding them) under better control; in the latest survey, only 25 
percent of the respondents said their inventories of purchased goods 
had increased, whereas 37 percent had said that in the previous 
survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the district's mining industries also declined this 
winter, while the forest products industry simply remained 
depressed. Iron mining, which had showed some signs of recovery in 
early January, recently weakened again. Although one large iron 
mining company recalled about 1,800 workers in early March, another 
laid off 2,100 workers for eight weeks. Besides that, energy 
production, which had long been a source of strength for the 
district, weakened recently. Due to the glut in petroleum supplies, 
oil exploration slowed at the western end of the district. A Montana 
director said that in early March 100 oil rigs were idle in eastern 
Montana and western North Dakota. Directors also said that the 
forest products industry at both ends of the district remained very 
depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent changes in the prices of farm products indicate possible 
recovery for about half the district's farmers—those who produce 
livestock—but not for the other half. Between January and early 
March, the prices farmers receive for hogs and cattle at South St. 
Paul rose about 7 percent. One director attributed part of the rise 
to unusually harsh winter weather restricting the flow of livestock 
to market. But the price rise may not be as temporary as that 
explanation would indicate: an economist associated with the 
livestock industry attributed part of the rise to livestock herds 
being smaller than anticipated. Crop farmers haven't had to face 
this ambiguity about their price situation. Cash crop prices at 
Minneapolis were essentially unchanged between January and early 
March, and they were considerably below their year-earlier levels. 
Weak demand seemed to be keeping these prices down, for the largest 
railroad in the district reported that its grain shipments so far 
this year were 20 percent behind those a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank lending continued to reflect the lack of any significant 
recovery in the district economy. Loan demand at banks in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was weak in late 1981, and it 
apparently remained so in early 1982. Loans outstanding at these 
banks did not change much between January and early March. Loan 
demand was also weak at banks outside the Twin Cities area, 
according to Bank directors.
