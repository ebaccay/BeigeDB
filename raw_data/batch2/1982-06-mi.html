      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District's economy entered the month of June in 
essentially the same weak condition that we have reported for the 
last several months. In some areas the situation has actually taken 
a turn for the worse. Recent shutdowns have devastated the 
district's metal mining. Cold and wet weather have delayed field 
work and crop development, thereby furthering the woes of district 
agriculture. Moreover, manufacturing remains depressed and consumers 
are still reluctant to purchase homes and durables. The only bright 
spots in our gloomy economic assessment are improved prices for some 
kinds of livestock and stronger vehicle sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Metal Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District iron production has been sharply curtailed in recent months 
because of weak demand for steel, and district copper output has 
been cut back severely as a result of sagging copper prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most district iron mining companies announced shutdowns this spring 
or lengthened previously-announced shutdowns. In northeastern 
Minnesota, seven out of eight companies have or will be shutting 
down operations. Announced closures range from two weeks to 5 1/2 
months and may, of course, be extended. In the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan, all four iron mines have temporarily or indefinitely 
stopped production. According to a Department of Interior official, 
if the mines, which produce 90 percent of the nation's iron are, 
adhere to announced schedules, 1982 production will decline 25 
percent from 1981 levels and will be down 35 percent from 1979 
levels when production hit its peak. District copper mines have also 
shortened production hours. The Upper Peninsula's one large copper 
mine went from a four- to a three-day work week in early June, and 
is planning a six-week closure beginning around July 1. In 
Anaconda/Butte, Montana, where copper production has been declining 
since 1974, the state's largest copper mine was permanently closed 
earlier this year. There are rumors that the remaining mine will be 
closed if prices continue to weaken. According to company and 
Department of Interior officials, if the firms, which mine 7 percent 
of the nation's copper, adhere to their announced shutdowns, 
district copper production in 1982 could decline by as much as one-
third from 1981 levels, and 142 percent from 1979, the industry's 
last good year.
     </p>
     <p>
      These cutbacks in district metal production have caused serious 
local unemployment problems. District metal mining employment was 
17,500 in March, down 18 percent from a year ago and 214 percent 
from the peak attained in 1979. Moreover, given recent shutdowns, 
unemployment in these industries is undoubtedly higher than 
indicated by the March data. Overall unemployment rates in the Upper 
Peninsula, northeastern Minnesota, and Anaconda/Butte this spring 
were 19 percent, 114 percent, and 11 percent, respectively. 
According to labor market analysts, many unemployed miners have 
almost exhausted their benefits, and Minnesota state leaders are 
considering a special program for laid-off workers in the 
northeastern part of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's energy mining sector has also felt some adverse 
impact from the nation's soft economy, but it has been relatively 
mild compared to metal mining.
     </p>
     <p>
      In recent years, gas and oil drilling has been one of the fastest 
growing segments of the district's economy. Exploration and 
production employment in Montana and North Dakota increased from 
6,900 in 1979 to a current level of 16,900, and these two states 
currently account for 2 percent of all U.S. crude petroleum 
production. In 1982, however, exploration activity is expected to be 
down from a year ago, in part due to the past decline in crude oil 
prices. In May, for example, there were only 85 active rigs in these 
states as compared to 198 a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, this slowdown may only be temporary. At least, that is the 
view of an official for a Minneapolis company doing oil exploration 
in Montana and North Dakota. He expects activity to pick up, 
particularly if recent increases in petroleum prices continue. 
Moreover, because of the considerable lead time between exploration 
and actual production, the slowdown in exploration has not had a 
marked effect on oil and gas production.
     </p>
     <p>
      District coal production, which employs 3,500 workers in Montana and 
North Dakota and accounts for 9 percent of the nation's output, has 
also been reduced somewhat. An analyst for a St. Paul-based railroad 
that hauls western coal indicated that the recession has slowed the 
growth in coal usage. Even so, he predicts that total 1982 western 
coal tonnage will still show an increase over 1981 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing remains weak. Forty-nine percent of the manufacturers 
responding to a University of Minnesota survey said their new orders 
declined in the three months ending in May, and nearly as many (44 
percent) said production declined also. The forest products industry 
continued depressed. A Montana director, for example, stated that 
Montana sawmills are currently operating at 60 percent of capacity 
or less, and paper mills at about 75 percent of capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural conditions remain gloomy. Grain prices have 
not improved and remain well below prices of a year ago. 
Furthermore, due to wet and cold weather in May, field work and crop 
development in the district have been delayed. These delays are 
expected to reduce yields somewhat, even though the weather improved 
significantly in June. One encouraging development has been the 
strengthening in some livestock prices. Between April and May cash 
prices at South St. Paul for slaughter steers and hogs rose 7.3 
percent and 13.5 percent, respectively. Feeder cattle prices, 
however, were essentially unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A strike against a trunk airline carrier took place in May and June; 
however, it did not constitute a major disruption of air service. On 
May 21, 3,600 members of the International Association of Machinists 
struck Northwest Airlines over wages and work rules. On June 8, the 
striking workers overwhelmingly rejected a company offer and a 
prolonged strike seemed likely. However, a tentative agreement was 
reached on June 14 and ratified by over 90 percent of the union 
members on June 16. Although the strike did not appear to 
significantly disrupt area air transportation, Northwest Airlines 
did lay off about 1,700 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending has shown very limited signs of recovery. Large 
Minneapolis/St. Paul retailers and bank directors continue to 
characterize general merchandise sales as "soft," particularly for 
consumer durables. Directors also indicate that home sales remain 
depressed. However, retail sales have improved somewhat from April's 
weather-depressed levels. In addition, motor vehicle sales are 
showing signs of life. In early April, regional sales managers 
reported improved domestic motor vehicle sales, primarily of light 
trucks; and in early June, one of these managers reported further 
strengthening. His view is that we are well past the bottom for 
motor vehicle sales in this area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reflecting the softness in the district economy, directors continue 
to report weak loan demand and deteriorating loan quality at 
district banks.
