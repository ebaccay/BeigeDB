      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 18, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The previously reported upswing in Ninth District consumer spending 
and agriculture has continued, but the recovery in industrial 
activity has slackened. General merchandise and home sales were 
still improving in April and early May, and auto sales have begun to 
expand again. In addition, as expected, the Payment-In-Kind Program 
appears to have started to provide some relief for district farmers. 
The recovery in manufacturing, however, appears to have softened 
this spring after a spurt in early 1983. Rail and truck shipments 
showed only modest increases, confirming this slackening in 
industrial activity, and increases in airline passenger travel were 
also weak. Finally, lending remains sluggish at Ninth District 
banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District consumers continue to spearhead the recovery. The 
improvement in Minneapolis/St. Paul department-discount store sales, 
which began last fall, continued in April and early May, according 
to two major Twin Cities retailers. They say that clothing and 
electronics have been the best selling items. Bank directors report 
that outside Minneapolis/St. Paul, general merchandise sales have 
also continued to improve since last fall, particularly at large 
shopping centers.
     </p>
     <p>
      District home sales have continued to improve as well and have 
sparked an increase in homebuilding. A South Dakota director 
indicates that home sales in Sioux Falls doubled between January and 
April, and other directors report increased home sales in their 
communities. Rising home sales, in turn, have led to a pickup in 
homebuilding. The executive secretary of the Minneapolis Association 
of Homebuilders, for example, reports a marked increase in 
homebuilding this spring. District residential building permits in 
March were up 18 percent from a year ago. Many of the homes being 
built, however, are the low-priced or starter homes (costing less 
than $80,000).
     </p>
     <p>
      District auto sales rebounded in April, after pausing in the first 
quarter. A regional sales manager for one of the nation's largest 
auto manufacturers states that his firm's sales in April increased 
20 percent from a year ago after decreasing 8 percent in early 1983. 
Another sales manager reports a noticeable pickup in medium-sized 
car sales. The directors' generally positive remarks about April 
auto sales in their communities confirm these upbeat sales reports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agricultural Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The faint signs of recovery in agriculture, which were reported 
previously, have intensified. The upswing in corn and wheat prices, 
which began in January with the announcement of the Payment-In-Kind 
(PIK) Program, continued in April. The Minneapolis cash corn price, 
for example, rose 8 percent, from $2.87 to $3.09 per bushel, between 
March and April; it has increased 33 percent since January. The 
Minneapolis cash wheat price rose 7 percent, from $4.0l to $4.3l per 
bushel, between March and April and has increased 13 percent since 
January. These increases, according to bank directors, have boosted 
farmers' confidence, which has resulted in some increase in farm 
spending. In North Dakota, for example, some implement dealers have 
reported increasing implement sales, while in western Wisconsin, 
prices have risen at farm auctions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although district agriculture appears to have started to recover, 
corn planting is behind schedule. Due to excess moisture in 
Minnesota, only 14 percent of this year's corn acreage had been 
planted by May 10; normally, 33 percent has been planted by this 
time. Because of PIK, however, farmers will plant only about two-thirds of their normal corn acreage. Therefore, they are less 
worried than usual about catching up once the fields dry out or 
about a late crop that might reduce yields. In contrast to corn, 
district spring wheat planting is on schedule.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Industrial Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In contrast to the further strengthening in consumer spending and 
agriculture, the advance in manufacturing, which began last fall, 
appears to have slackened in April and early May. Paper and building 
inputs are the only areas where directors report a continued pickup. 
One director, for example, reports that paper and wafer board plants 
in Minnesota have recently been running at capacity. Prices for 
these commodities have risen modestly as well, reflecting some 
strengthening in demand. In addition, in southern Minnesota, a 
manufacturer of heavy construction equipment recently recalled 
three-fourths of its previously laid-off workers. But even in these 
areas, some signs of softening have emerged. A Montana director, 
associated with a national forest products company, reports some 
letup in lumber sales in April. A large Minneapolis manufacturer of 
residential temperature controls recently laid off 100 of its 4,000 
local employees because recent sales haven't been up to 
expectations. In both instances, this softening was attributed to 
worries about excess inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recent softening in district manufacturing is reflected in 
transportation activity. This industry, which employs around 90,000 
people in the district and accounts for 5 percent of district 
personal income, is a good coincidental indicator because it moves 
the goods produced by the district's major industries. An economist 
with a large district railroad says that this movement has recently 
been lackluster and that he believes the region is experiencing a 
"spit and sputter" recovery. His firm's rail shipments rose sharply 
in January, then sagged in February, March and early April, before 
picking up a bit in late April. Shipments of lumber products and 
other manufactured goods have not been as good as expected. He 
attributes this to business concerns about excess inventories and 
believes businesses are ordering smaller amounts and relying more on 
trucks than usual.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trucking firms, however, have yet to see a major pickup in their 
business. The total truck tonnage shipped by general freight 
carriers from Minneapolis/St. Paul businesses has only increased 
modestly since early January. A trucking executive with a large 
general freight carrier, like the railroad economist, believes 
concerns about inventories are curbing shipments and says that 
building input shipments have been increasing faster than other 
shipments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like the transportation of goods, the transportation of people has 
increased only modestly. The number of people arriving and departing 
from the Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport in the first 
quarter was up 1.1 percent from a year ago. But it was still down 
10.7 percent from the high reached in 1980.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending continues to be soft at Ninth District banks. Sixty percent 
of the respondents to our Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey in 
early April, for example, indicated that their loan to deposit 
ratios were lower than desired. Directors' comments about weak loan 
demand in their communities confirm this survey.
