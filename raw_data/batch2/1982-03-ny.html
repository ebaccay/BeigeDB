      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District remained sluggish during 
February and early March. Among retailers, sales activity was 
uneven. Residential construction continued to be depressed, but 
nonresidential activity was still thriving. Conditions in the 
manufacturing sector were generally lackluster. Reports from upstate 
New York indicate that a number of small companies have abandoned 
their expansion plans while some machine tool companies have been 
hit by cancellations in backlogged orders. High technology firms, 
however, were the exception to the prevailing weakness in 
manufacturing, proving relatively resistant to the national 
downturn. Overall, labor market conditions were comparatively 
strong. New York State's unemployment rate has been less than the 
nation's and its unemployment insurance claims have been below those
of a year ago. Looking ahead, respondents saw neither a turnaround 
nor a further decline in the nation's economy as imminent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity in the Second District was uneven during February 
and the first half of March. Sales at both department stores and 
discount chains ranged from below plan to at or above plan. In 
upstate New York, there have been some store closings and earlier 
weather-related losses have not been recouped. Inventory levels were 
comfortable at most stores. Most of the merchants, even those who 
have had below-plan sales in recent months, tended to be cautiously 
optimistic in their outlook for spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions varied widely in the construction sector. Activity in the 
residential market continued to be minimal, as high financing costs 
and economic uncertainty discouraged potential buyers. Creative 
financing has done little to stimulate sales. Homebuilders noted 
that demand for high density housing remains strong, though zoning 
obstacles are preventing such construction in many areas. The 
building of high-priced homes by prior contract accounted for 
virtually all activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, the nonresidential construction boom has not abated and 
is expected to continue into 1983. In Manhattan, a shortage of 
office space has pushed vacancy rates to record lows, although 
office rental prices are now rising much more slowly than a few 
months ago. In suburban areas, earlier industrial and corporate 
growth has fueled a similar expansion in office space. Hotel and 
motel construction in the District was also strong, although, in 
Manhattan, this construction has been tapering off.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The consensus of business leaders and government officials around 
the region was that New York State was weathering the recession 
quite well. All those contacted expressed surprise at how well the 
regional economy has held up, and mentioned the diversification in 
the state economy into high technology industries as one of the 
primary contributing factors. Despite some pockets of extreme 
joblessness, the unemployment rate was less that the nation's and 
unemployment insurance claims were below those of a year ago. 
According to a state labor official, much of the increase in 
unemployment which has occurred is the result of the difficulties 
which new entrants and reentrants to the labor force have had 
finding jobs rather than from what is commonly expected during a 
recessionâ€”increased separations of experienced workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nevertheless, some industries have been deeply affected by the 
recession. As in the nation, layoffs and reduced hours are 
widespread among steel, automobile, automobile supply, and machine 
tool firms. As an example of the problems facing the machine tool 
industry, one upstate company was hit by a large number of 
cancellations of backlogged orders. In addition, a number of smaller 
firms were reported to have abandoned their spring expansion plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the future, local business leaders and government officials 
saw no imminent signs of an economic turnaround but neither did they 
think that conditions were going to get much worse. Respondents were 
uncertain about the direction of interest rates, the impact of 
personal income tax cuts, and the effects of safe-harbor leasing 
provisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Henry Kaufman (Solomon Bros.), 
Donald Maude (Merrill Lynch) and Robert Stone (Irving Trust): Their 
views of course are personal, not institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Kaufman: The economy will begin to experience real economic growth 
sometime this spring but the recovery will be of sub-cyclical 
proportion. The financial backdrop will not support a strong and 
sustained business recovery. Business liquidity continues to 
deteriorate; profits will remain under extreme pressure, while no 
balance sheet restructuring has materialized during this recession. 
Many additional downgradings of business credit ratings are likely 
to be announced in the forthcoming months. Interest rates will 
continue to be highly volatile. The long-term bond markets in 
particular will be challenged by a lack of liquidity in business, 
the huge Treasury cash needs, and a firm monetary policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maude: Most likely developments over the spring and early summer 
months should place renewed severe upward pressure on interest rates 
with long-term yields retesting their 1981 highs in a financial 
crisis type environment. These developments should manifest 
themselves in the form of a highly anemic economic recovery, some 
modest pick-up in private credit demands, a cash flow squeeze in the 
nonfinancial corporate sector, continued strains on financial 
intermediaries, credit quality concerns and a reluctance on the part 
of investors to make long-term fixed income commitments. The 
underlying causes of these difficulties should be an April and July 
surge in money growth, a resulting monetary tightening, huge actual 
Treasury financing (especially during the third quarter) and 
continued apprehension over the out-year budgetary deficits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stone: It is our view that the economy has probably touched bottom 
and that a few months of relatively slow growth lies ahead. While 
lower interest rates are urgently needed, it would be a mistake for 
the System to take overt action to reduce them until MI has remained 
within the target range for several weeks. Accordingly, it seems to 
me that in the period ahead the Fed should continue to provide non-
borrowed reserves such that "basic borrowings" (borrowings net of 
seasonal and extended credit) come out in the general range of $800 
to $1200 million.
