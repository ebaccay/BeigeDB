      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The coal strike and unseasonably cold weather have continued to 
  hamper production, sales, income, and distribution in the Fourth 
  District. Indirect effects of the coal strike on employment have 
  been minimal. Economists who attended this Bank's recent meeting on 
  the economic outlook still expect growth in output at about a 3.8 
  percent annual rate and a 6 percent rate of inflation from the 
  fourth quarter 1977 to the fourth quarter 1978. Retailers have 
  experienced spotty sales for the past several weeks but remain 
  relatively optimistic that sales will pick up from recent low 
  levels. Savings and loan associations have not cut back commitments 
  or loans despite continued softening in deposit flows.
       </p>
       <p>
        Electric power shortages have affected employment in the District 
  minimally and far less than indicated in widely publicized 
  estimates. Some manufacturers, as in the case of steel, have had to 
  stretch out production to protect energy supplies. More typically, 
  they have cut back on hours, lighting, and heating. In some cases, 
  they are diverting production to other plants not affected by the 
  power shortage. Moreover, many manufacturers have resorted to 
  alternate power sources, especially their own power generators. 
  Estimates indicate that industrial layoffs have affected perhaps 
  3,5000 to 5,000 of the 1,650,000 manufacturing workers in the 
  District. Utilities in Ohio still have coal stocks that range from 
  35 to 55 days' supply, not much less than a month ago, and the only 
  utility that has a mandatory curtailment is the smallest one in the 
  state that serves portions of southern Ohio. Utilities in the 
  Pittsburgh area have the lowest coal supplies and are operating with 
  mandatory curtailment, ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent. Other 
  utilities are reluctant to estimate when mandatory controls might be 
  imposed, given the highly fluid supply situation and. flexibilities 
  of large industrial users. Manufacturers generally claim they can 
  continue to operate without major layoffs even if 25 percent power 
  cutbacks are mandated, and some assert they can adjust to as much as 
  a 50 percent cutback because of backup power and conservation 
  measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Economists who attended this Bank's quarterly meeting on the 
  District's economy earlier this month were unconcerned about the 
  long-range effects of the weather and coal strike. The median 
  forecast of 29 economists shows continued expansion throughout the 
  year, with a 4.3 percent annual rate of gain in real GNP during the 
  first half of 1978, followed by a 3.4 percent rate in the second 
  half. Although the economists do not expect a credit crunch in 1978 
  despite increased demand, some viewed the probability of a crunch 
  and recession in 1979 as very high. Several also expect continued 
  upward pressure on interest rates in 1978, with the Federal funds 
  rate rising to 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1978.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers still anticipate some spring rebound that would boost 
  sales from weakened first-quarter levels, although expected gains 
  are not likely to be as strong as in the final quarter of last year. 
  Strengthening from lows in January has been spotty partly because of 
  frigid weather in February. Some retailers also point out that a 
  letup in sales was expected after last quarter's surge in sales. 
  Inventories have been raised to unacceptable levels because of 
  unexpectedly slow apparel sales, according to an economist with a 
  major department store chain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eight automotive producers and suppliers forecast that domestic new 
  car sales in 1978 would range from 8.3 million to 9.0 million units, 
  with imports amounting to 1.7-1.9 million. Another economist placed 
  total new car sales this year at 10.9 million units. He acknowledges 
  that sales have been running somewhat below that projection because 
  of bad weather, the coal strike, and low public response to GMC 
  styling of intermediate cars. Still, he is reluctant to revise his 
  expectations downward at this time. For the longer term, he 
  expressed concern that imports from Japan may seriously threaten 
  domestic producers and sees little prospect for relief from a high 
  level of auto imports from Japan over the next few years. According 
  to his estimates, Japan has a large capacity to build cars 
  especially for the export market and has a sizable cost advantage 
  estimated at $650 per car over United States auto producers. This 
  year, for example, Japanese motor vehicle production is expected to 
  be stepped up to about 9.3 million, an increase of 800,000 from 
  1977. Virtually all this increase can be exported.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bad weather depressed housing activity in the District again in 
  February, but demand for mortgage money continues to be strong. 
  Although savings and loan associations are increasingly concerned 
  over further slowing in deposits last month, they are not cutting 
  back on commitments. Liquidity continues to shrink, and a few 
  associations indicate that they are virtually at the ceiling of 
  reserve requirements. They will be required to step up their 
  borrowing and to increase their use of the secondary mortgage market 
  to support mortgage loan activity. Some lenders are less 
  apprehensive about commitments and lending prospects because they 
  hold a higher volume of certificates than they did in 1973. An 
  economist with a Federal Home Loan Bank in this District believes 
  that certificates are providing some protection against rising 
  interest rates. His estimates show that, if savings and loan 
  associations had the same deposit mix as prevailed at the beginning 
  of 1973, the slowdown in savings deposits would be at least $3.5 
  billion larger than otherwise. He expects 1.8-1.9 million new 
  housing starts this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several District officials and economists consider inflation of 
  greater concern than the power shortage. Despite some potential 
  benefit to domestic steel producers, reference pricing of steel will 
  raise prices, according to some producers of steel fasteners and 
  metal products. Higher priced steel would cause users to raise 
  prices for finished products, which already are at a competitive 
  price disadvantage with foreign supplies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coal prices are expected to rise sharply this year. An economist 
  with a large coal producer estimates that a 37 percent contract 
  settlement for the coal industry would raise the price of utility 
  and industrial steam coal about 9.4 percent in 1978 and another 4.6 
  percent next year. In addition, environmental regulations will boost 
  coal cost by $2 per ton. On the other hand, prices of crude oil, 
  according to an oil economist, can be expected to increase less than 
  the assumed 6 percent underlying rate of inflation this year because 
  of ample capacity and slow growth of demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel economists are still relatively optimistic that production and 
  shipments of steel products will be about 10 percent stronger than 
  last year. Because production at some mills is being stretched out 
  to protect coke supplies, orders for this quarter are running ahead 
  of production and shipments. While uncertain about the effects of 
  reference pricing of steel, economists expect steel imports to fall 
  from 19 million tons last year to about 14-18 million tons this 
  year. One economist, who sees signs of accelerating orders from 
  capital producers, believes the industry may be operating close to 
  capacity by the year-end.
