      <strong>
       November 12, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Reserve Banks this month indicate, on 
balance, some improvement in economic activity. Manufacturing 
bounced back in several areas as have retail sales and to a lesser 
extent capital investment, but conditions in the agricultural sector 
are mixed as the effects of the summer drought continue to be felt. 
Any optimism, however, is tempered by concern over the recent run-up 
in interest rates. Accordingly, many respondents are looking either 
for a pause in the present upturn or for a very sluggish recovery. 
Despite the weak outlook for the economy, inflation is expected to 
continue at high rates. While the demand for business loans varies 
among Districts, the decline in home mortgage activity appears 
rather pervasive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Conditions and Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The extent of the recent 
strengthening in production and sales activity varies from District 
to District. An upturn in manufacturing is reported in Boston and 
Atlanta but in Minneapolis, after three months of improvement, 
production is down. Economic conditions in Cleveland, Chicago and 
St. Louis were spurred by an increase in steel production, but this 
heightened demand is viewed as temporary-mainly the result of 
inventory replacement. Retail spending is generally stronger with 
the exception of San Francisco, where sales remain below last year's 
level. In New York and Chicago, the market for domestic automobiles 
is lackluster. While the majority of industrial respondents in a 
Philadelphia survey look forward to a pickup in business activity 
during the next six months, there is widespread concern among 
respondents that the recent surge in interest rates will hurt the 
economic recovery. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San 
Francisco all cite some deterioration in local housing markets which 
they attribute to rising mortgage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents in Kansas City report some slowing in the 
rate of increase in input prices, but this is expected to be 
shortlived. Sharply higher prices for both raw materials and 
finished goods are also anticipated in Philadelphia and Cleveland, 
and wage rates continue to accelerate in Chicago. Dallas also notes 
a further run-up in labor costs, particularly in energy-related 
industries, but lumber prices there are well below the leve1s of a 
year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business loan demand remains sluggish in 
Boston and New York. In Dallas, however, commercial and industrial 
lending has been buoyed by heavy demand from energy-related 
industries. While declining mortgage activity is linked to sharply 
higher mortgage rates by Atlanta and Minneapolis, continuing 
economic uncertainty and falling real incomes are considered more 
significant factors by Cleveland respondents. A falloff in loan 
applications is reported by Philadelphia, and some San Francisco 
S&amp;Ls have completely dropped out of the mortgage market. Chicago 
and Atlanta note a growing trend towards renegotiable and variable 
rate mortgages. Mortgage demand remains high in Dallas, but few 
commitments are being made as loan defaults and FHA-VA foreclosures 
increase. Strong savings inflows are reported by Kansas City S&amp;Ls, 
while at San Francisco banks, large outflows have taken place.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, 
Atlanta and Dallas all indicate retail sales gains spurred by heavy 
marketing and promotional activity. Advances are led by moderate to 
expensive apparel items and other soft goods, but low priced soft 
goods and consumer durables still lag. Only a very modest 
improvement in sales is noted in reports from Cleveland, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis and Kansas City. In San Francisco, retail sales remain 
at recession levels. In Boston, however, stronger sales, even in 
constant dollars, are reported for the first time in months. Despite 
the short holiday selling period due to the late Thanksgiving 
holiday, merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Dallas are 
looking forward to a strong Christmas season. Automobile sales are 
being bolstered by the introduction of 1981 models in Kansas City 
and San Francisco. In Cleveland, only small cars are selling well. 
In New York, foreign car sales are brisk, but the demand for 
domestic models, remains weak. With sales still sluggish, another 
wave of dealer closings in the New York area is anticipated. 
Automobile sales are described as disappointing in Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing market conditions continue to 
deteriorate as rising mortgage rates further discourage demand. A 
decline in home sales is reported by Chicago, St. Louis and 
Minneapolis and housing starts are falling in Cleveland, Kansas City 
and Dallas. While new home prices are up slightly in Kansas City, 
prices are reported stable in Philadelphia and softening a bit for 
higher priced homes in Dallas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Fixed Investment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for capital spending is 
mixed. Atlanta notes strong investment in many parts of its District 
as a result of both state and local tax incentive programs, but 
Boston reports a downturn in orders for heavy metalworking equipment 
and machinery for paper and pulp production. In New York, machine 
tool orders are stronger although industry spokesmen do not expect 
full recovery until late 1981. Construction of manufacturing 
facilities is up in parts of New England, particularly among 
defense-related industries. Military hardware production is also 
strong in St. Louis, as is production of oil and natural gas 
equipment. Chicago respondents expect the demand for heavy trucks to 
rebound in 1981.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook for agricultural production and farm income 
is mixed as many Districts continue to feel repercussions from the 
summer drought. Richmond reports farm loan demand is weaker than 
normal, while repayment rates are falling sharply. Renewals and 
extensions are higher and collateral requirements are stricter. 
Dallas also notes slower loan repayments, while Kansas City 
respondents expect a doubling in the number of farmers not expected 
to meet credit standards in 1981. Many of these farmers, however, 
will be eligible for low-cost emergency loans from the Farmers Home 
Administration. The outlook for crop yields is good in Minneapolis 
and San Francisco, but the Atlanta Reserve Bank reports that crop 
production estimates for the southeast have been lowered again.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail and manufacturing inventories are generally 
lean. In Boston, stocks of home furnishings are so tight that any 
strengthening in demand is expected to translate into an immediate 
increase in production. Auto inventories, in particular, are being 
held down because of the high carrying costs according to 
respondents in New York. Other retail inventories are reported in 
line with sales with the exceptions of Kansas City and some areas of 
St. Louis where demand remains weak. These stocks, however, are 
expected to be worked down during the Christmas selling season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Academic and Financial Consultants
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All of this month's academic 
respondents agree that the recovery will be weak by historical 
standards as a result of tight monetary and fiscal policies. 
Professor Eckstein thinks that there will be a recession in 1981 as 
a result of the 15 1/2 percent prime rate. Eckstein believes that 
because of the essential inconsistency between the structure of the 
economy and the goal of price stability, only a 3 to 4 year 
recession will reduce the inflation rate significantly. Professor 
Houthakker believes 1981 will be characterized by the slow real 
growth necessary to control inflation, which he expects to moderate 
slightly next year. Houthakker is not convinced further tightening 
is warranted and warns the Fed not to fine tune monetary policy. 
Professor Samuelson believes there is a 20-25 percent chance for a 
1981 recession but 2 to 3 percent real growth is more likely. He 
feels that the inflation outlook is unfavorable and counsels the Fed 
to try to hit the money growth targets if the price is not 
exorbitant. Professor Tobin believes there is a good possibility 
that rising interest rates will cause a downturn next year, and he 
would not tighten monetary policy any further as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial consultants continue to urge the Fed to persist in its 
determination to reduce the inflation rate. Mr. Kaufman expects a 
slowing in the pace of recovery in the early part of 1981. At about 
the same time, he anticipates a temporary decline in short-term 
interest rates along with a wave of new corporate bond offerings. 
Mr. O'Leary strongly urges the Fed to continue pursuing a policy 
designed to reduce the inflation rate and to defuse expectations of 
inflation. Mr. Stone feels that the Fed should soon achieve success 
in slowing the aggregates sufficiently to meet its longer term 
growth targets. He perceives a drop in short-term rates over the 
balance of the year, and while he does not foresee a double dip 
recession, a pause in the recovery within the next three months 
should be expected.
