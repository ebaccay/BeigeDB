      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Tenth District purchasing agents report price increases on a broad 
  range of materials. Also, lead times are extending and some highly 
  skilled labor is reported as being in short supply. Retail sales at 
  major department stores are in an uptrend, especially since the end 
  of the bad weather. Consumer demand for beef remains high, and 
  further retail price increases may be expected despite recent 
  government action. While agricultural loan demand has declined, in 
  part because of higher farm prices, total district loan demand 
  remains strong. Deposit growth, on the other hand, has not as yet 
  been significantly affected by the new six-month money market CDs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Purchasing agents for major manufacturers in the district report 
  increases in materials input prices averaging close to 8 percent 
  over the past twelve months. Specific materials mentioned with near 
  8 percent increases include fiberglass, aluminum, aviation engines, 
  aviation fuel, and steel. Only copper prices were reported to have 
  come down. Looking to the remainder of 1978, drug-related chemical 
  prices are expected to remain unchanged, steel prices are expected 
  to increase 4 to 5 percent, and fabricated truck parts may increase 
  12 1/2 to 13 percent. Lead times are extending, particularly for 
  materials used heavily by the auto industry (steel, fiberglass, and 
  fabricated transportional components). Other goods with expanding 
  lead times are electric motors and copper. Demand increases and 
  capacity constraints are often given as explanations for increasing 
  lead times. Steel availability is expected to continue to tighten 
  and fiberglass insulation will be a problem until significant new 
  capacity is added. A shortage of skilled labor such as machinists, 
  tool makers, and equipment operators was reported, and a custom 
  builder of truck-tractors in Kansas City is now at "full" capacity. 
  Inventory levels at respondent firms were generally satisfactory to 
  a little heavy. Two directors reported input price increases for 
  their industries approximately equal to those noted by the 
  purchasing agents. Furthermore, both directors indicated that their 
  sales were rising far more rapidly than might be expected given 
  current real GNP growth, and each expressed a belief that the sales 
  uptrend is likely to taper off.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales have been on an uptrend since March. Most stores 
  indicated they have managed to recover fully from the bad weather. 
  Most stores also reported that input prices have not been raised on 
  all items and that a 6 to 7 percent price increase is likely for the 
  remainder of the year. All stores indicated they would pass on as 
  much of the increase as competition will allow. Inventories appear 
  to be a little on the heavy side—probably due to a lack of January-through-March buying. However, no one seemed overly concerned about 
  the situation and all respondents expect to have inventories in line 
  soon. There were no reported inventory problems. Labor supply 
  problems have resulted from the new minimum wage .and social 
  security laws. With higher operating costs some managers reported 
  they were forced to reduce their work force in order to maintain 
  their profit margins. Consequently, they are having a hard time 
  maintaining the same level of services as before. Sales are expected 
  to be up 8 to 15 percent over last year, not adjusted for inflation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The long expected price correction in the cattle market has 
  apparently occurred in recent days as futures prices have tumbled 
  from contract highs. Cattlemen have been further displeased by 
  recent government action to permit an additional 200 million pounds 
  of imported beef into the United States during the coming year. 
  Neither cattlemen nor consumers should read too much into these 
  occurrences, however. Consumer demand for beef remains quite strong 
  and in the face of this demand, new market highs for slaughter 
  cattle and further retail price increases before the end of the year 
  should not be ruled out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Banks contacted for the June Redbook indicate that loan demand 
  continues strong, though government loan programs and higher farm 
  prices have resulted in somewhat weaker demand for agricultural 
  loans. Most of the banks surveyed have increased lending rates by 25 
  basis points in the past month and expect further increases by the 
  end of the year. Deposit growth is moderately strong in the Tenth 
  District.
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction of the six-month money market CDs has not yet had a 
  major impact on inflows of time deposit funds. Surveys conducted by 
  this Bank reveal that all of the large banks and most of the small 
  banks contacted are offering the new money market CDs. All of the 
  responding banks that are offering money market CDs are paying the 
  ceiling rate. There has been a moderate amount of advertising of the 
  new six-month certificates but some bankers indicated that they 
  would intensify publicity in upcoming weeks. Consumer response to 
  the new time certificates has been disappointing at most of the 
  banks surveyed. The dollar volume of sales has been less than 
  expected at most banks, and all banks except two reported that more 
  than 75 percent of the funds used to buy the new time certificates 
  came from existing accounts within the bank. A number of bankers did
  express the belief, however, that the money market CDs would become 
  increasingly important in preventing disintermediation. After the 
  June tax payments and the credit of quarterly interest on passbook 
  accounts at the end of June, many bankers believe that the sale of 
  the six-month certificates will increase substantially.
