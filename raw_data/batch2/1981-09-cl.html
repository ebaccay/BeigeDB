      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District generally report scaling 
down their GNP forecasts for the third and fourth quarter of 1981 
because of sustained high interest rates. Current interest rates are 
expected to prevent improvement in capital goods spending over the 
remainder of the year. Steel orders have experienced across-the-board weakness in September, caused by a weaker-than-expected 
economy and ample availability of steel. Although retail sales have 
been virtually flat, retailers and manufacturers expect some 
improvement in household appliances at the expense of auto sales. 
Housing construction remains at a standstill, with S&amp;Ls continuing 
to experience heavy outflows in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several economists now expect real GNP in the third quarter 
of 1981 to have declined at a 1% annual rate. One, however, expects 
a slight gain from higher consumer spending. A capital-goods 
producer forecasts a slightly positive growth in real GNP in both 
the third and fourth quarter of 1981 because further declines in 
already depressed cyclical industries, especially autos and housing, 
are unlikely. Some expressed concern that loss in consumer 
confidence could have more serious dampening effects on spending 
than now anticipated in most forecasts. A financial economist 
expressed the view that interest rates are two to three percentage 
points higher than warranted in view of the federal funds rate, and
expects money market rates to ease further as commercial credit 
demands weaken. Several revised forecasts of real GNP show a 
reduction in real GNP growth from over 3% to about 2% in 1982. Most 
of that growth is expected to occur in the second half of 1982, in 
response to lower interest rates and further tax cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major reason for the weakness in capital goods 
spending is the sustained high level of interest rates, according to 
several respondents. However, several report that low utilization 
rates and low profitability are equally important in restraining 
capital spending programs. A capital goods producer notes that a 
large share of investment funds is going into acquisition rather 
than new capital. A machine tool producer reports that shipments of 
cutting tools in 1981, which have been supported by substantial 
reduction in backlogs, will exceed 1980 by about 15% in nominal 
terms and 6% in constant 1972 dollars. The oil field equipment 
industry remains among the few bright spots in capital expenditures,
as even auto producers are canceling or delaying machine tool 
orders. A motor vehicle supplier reports that truck-related orders 
are very weak, and truck sales are projected to fall 3% below last 
year's depressed level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A slight pickup occurred in steel orders during August and 
early September, but orders have since flattened. Orders, according 
to a steel economist, are now falling behind expectations, as the 
economy fails to strengthen and customers become less concerned 
about steel availability. Operating rates are currently between 75% 
and 80%, with the order intake equal to about 70% to 75% of 
capacity. Shipments in the second half of 1981 are expected to 
decline 10% from the first half levels. Some inventory building 
appears to be occurring at the warehouse level, apparently because 
of a sharp increase in steel imports. An industry economist is also 
concerned that a typical year-end inventory liquidation could reduce 
shipments below the expected 90 million tons in 1981. Shipments in 
1982 are expected to increase about 3%.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers generally report sluggishness in sales. 
Some are still optimistic over prospects for the next quarter, while 
some expect smaller year-to-year gains. Sales of household 
appliances, such as dishwashers and ranges, are weak, while 
microwave oven and air conditioner sales are among the few bright 
spots. A weak housing market will prevent much of a recovery in 
production and sales of consumer household goods, according to an 
appliance producer, but some improvement is likely in the fourth 
quarter if consumers decide to shift their spending pattern from 
autos to other durable goods. Several respondents report that 
inventories of consumer durable goods are low. A major national 
retailer, however, asserts that retail inventories in the third 
quarter were boosted across-the-board involuntarily because 
retailers generally over-anticipated sales gains. Therefore, he 
expects curtailment of stocks in the fourth quarter in response to 
moderate increases in sales and price promotions. Retail sales in 
the Pittsburgh area so far this year have amounted to about 1% below 
the national rate, according to a bank economist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Higher auto sales since the August rebates have reduced inventories 
substantially, according to some area auto dealers. However, an 
economist with an auto producer reports that sales in September were 
well below their expectations. Even though inventories were reduced 
in recent weeks, dealers are unlikely to build stocks of 1982 models 
because of sluggish sales and high cost of floor plans. He expects a 
5.7 million annual rate of sales for at least the next two quarters, 
with little prospects for recovery until the second round of tax 
reductions next summer. A local dealer reports that dealer margins 
have held steady because of less willingness to negotiate price. An 
import dealer reports a well-balanced 30-day supply of new cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing construction remains depressed, reports a major 
regional builder, with orders for custom houses well below half of 
year-ago levels. Consumer traffic has been off only about 10-15%, 
but many applicants fail to qualify for mortgage loans. A local 
builder has reduced his work force to a fraction of last year's 
levels, and fears the prospect of closing when his current line of 
bank credit ends in October. Several respondents expect no 
improvement in residential construction for the remainder of 1981, 
and a consumer durable goods economist is forecasting new housing 
starts at 1.5 million units in 1982. A housing analyst anticipates a 
recovery beginning mid-year 1982, even if mortgage rates were to 
fall to 14%.
     </p>
     <p>
      S&amp;Ls continues to be hard pressed by heavy outflows of funds, 
despite some success in attracting funds away from banks through 
repurchase agreements, jumbo CDs, and 30-month certificates. Losses 
in passbook accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market 
certificates have more than offset gains from repos, according to an 
economist for a regional FHLB in the District. September outflows 
are expected to be worse than August, but not as bad as the near-record losses in July. Several respondents expect the "all savers" 
certificate to improve the cost position of S&amp;Ls, along with the 
recent decline in interest rates. Nevertheless, a sharp step-up in 
merger activity is expected over the next few quarters.
