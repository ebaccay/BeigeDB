      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some further moderation is apparent in Tenth District economic 
activity. While retail sales are expected to improve further, 
housing activity and mortgage demand are generally slowing. 
Inventories of both retail goods and materials inputs are at 
satisfactory levels. Price increases have been small, and are 
expected to continue so. Total loan demand at district banks remains 
relatively constant while deposits are higher. Fall crops in most 
district states are suffering from dry weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report year-to-date sales up as much as 10 percent over a 
year ago. Sales have generally improved in the last three months, 
with apparel and accessories selling particularly well. Stronger 
sales are expected for the rest of the year. Retailers seem 
satisfied with inventory levels and plan no changes in the near 
future. Prices have generally been flat in the last three months, 
with some price declines reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Automobile Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District continue to report 
improved auto sales compared to a year ago. Credit market conditions 
are satisfactory and financing is available both for floorplanning 
and customer purchases. Dealers in some areas report that only lack 
of availability is constraining sales. Dealers are optimistic about 
sales for the rest of 1984 and early 1985. Their only concern is 
over possible supply interruptions due to a strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Purchasing Agents
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing agents generally report input prices from 2 percent to 10 
percent higher than a year ago. Most respondents had either 
unchanged prices or quite small price rises in the past three months 
and virtually all expect steady input prices for the balance of 
1984. Some firms are experiencing slight increases in lead times for 
materials, but no materials availability problems are reported and 
none are anticipated through 1984. Most respondents report 
satisfactory materials inventory levels, with several having trimmed 
inventories recently because actual sales are running below 
forecasted sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Activity and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity in the district is mixed both by 
type of structure and by location. Starts of single-family units are 
generally down, particularly since June. Starts in multi-family 
units range from below year-ago levels to considerably higher. 
Overbuilding of multi-family units is reported in some areas such as 
Colorado Springs and Oklahoma City. Housing starts are expected to 
slow through year-end if interest rates remain at, or rise above, 
their current level. Sales of new homes are generally down from last 
year, with much of the slowdown occurring since June. Inventory 
levels range from satisfactory to larger than desired. New house 
prices are stable. Building materials are in good supply and are 
expected to remain so. Prices for materials are generally steady, 
although sheet rock prices are still rising in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for mortgage funds and mortgage commitments at savings and 
loan associations is slowing from a generally robust Spring due 
mainly to the sizable increase in both fixed and adjustable mortgage 
rates over the past several months. Most respondents expect mortgage 
demand to continue decreasing, although rates are expected to be 
stable or down slightly. Savings inflows are higher than last year, 
but respondents generally anticipate a zero inflow or net outflow 
over the remainder of 1984.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loan demand was generally constant over the last month at 
Tenth District banks, although real estate and consumer loans rose 
slightly. Commercial real estate loans were slightly stronger than 
residential loans. Some respondents report difficulty in competing 
with finance companies on consumer loans. Commercial and industrial 
and agricultural loans were flat. Total deposits were higher, mostly 
due to increases in Super NOW, MMDA, and IRA and Keogh accounts. 
Conventional NOW accounts rose slightly. Demand deposits were flat, 
while large CD's and passbook savings accounts declined. Almost all 
respondents report no change in their prime rate in the last month, 
and the majority do not foresee a change in the near future. 
Consumer lending rates were unchanged at most of the banks surveyed, 
with the rest reporting higher rates. None of the respondents expect 
further changes in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dry conditions in several district states will affect production and 
yields of fall-harvested crops. In Missouri, where spring flooding 
prevented timely planting, lack of moisture and hot weather have cut 
expected crop yields. Corn yields are expected to be halved and 
soybean yields will also be substantially reduced. In Kansas, 
dryland milo production is well below average and rain is needed to 
prepare the fields for winter wheat planting this fall. Irrigated 
crops in the state are doing well, however, especially irrigated 
corn. Cotton yields in Oklahoma will be well below normal, and rain 
is also needed there for preparing winter wheat ground. Nebraska and
Colorado are not as dry as the other states. Their corn crops are in 
good shape, as are soybeans in Nebraska. In general, Nebraska and 
Colorado crop production has been very good this year. Livestock 
production has not suffered as much as crops from dry conditions, 
nor has marketing of cattle been affected by the weather. Colorado, 
parts of Kansas, and Nebraska have abundant feed, both in pastures 
and hay. In Missouri and parts of Oklahoma and Kansas, however, 
rangeland is dry and cattle weight gains have been slower than 
normal. Bankers expect below-normal paydowns on their agricultural 
loans by the end of the year, and some expect more problems with 
agricultural loans this year than last year.
