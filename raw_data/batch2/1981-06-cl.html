      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 30, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in the Fourth District generally expect very 
little growth in output through the third quarter, and many are 
beginning to lower their inflation forecast for 1981. Manufacturing 
activity in the District continues to expand, although signs of 
third quarter weakness are emerging. Consumer spending, weakened by 
the second quarter slump in auto sales, is expected to strengthen in 
the third quarter. Bank lending activity has increased in June, 
partly due to financing business inventories. Local housing 
construction has declined again in June, as saving flows into S&amp;Ls 
have weakened further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The tone of the Fourth District Round Table meeting early 
in June was somewhat more optimistic with respect to output and 
prices in 1981 than at the March meeting. The median forecast of the 
30 participants shows growth in real GNP of 3.2% between the fourth 
quarter of 1980 and the fourth quarter of 1981, and 4.0% in the 
subsequent four-quarter period. One-third of the group still expects 
real GNP to decline in the second quarter (-1.4%, according to the 
median forecast), but all 30 expect resumption of at least mild 
growth in the third quarter. The projected acceleration in growth of 
output later this year is in response to a personal tax-rate 
reduction and less intense inflation that will increase growth in 
real income. Nearly two-thirds of the group assume that growth in M-
1B in 1981 will be within its long-run target range and the balance 
expect that growth will exceed the upper limit of the range. The 
bulk of the group expects a Federal deficit for fiscal year 1981 in 
the range of $55-60 billion and a deficit for 1982 in the range of 
$45-55 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District economists scaled down their forecast of the 
GNP implicit price deflator a little from the March Round Table 
meeting. The median forecast now shows the deflator increasing by 
9.1% in 1981 (fourth quarter to fourth quarter) and 8.6% in 1982. 
While most participants expect a gradually decelerating inflation 
trend to provide thrust to economic activity, many remain doubtful 
that the underlying inflation rate has changed much, despite recent 
moderation in consumer and producer prices. Some raised doubts that 
farm price declines will continue much longer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The latest monthly Survey of Fourth District 
Manufacturing indicates continued expansion in shipments and orders 
in June, although some easing in the pace is occurring. A steel 
economist reports a letup in steel orders in recent weeks, 
apparently because of a sharp rise in imports and hedging prior to 
the price increase in June. Aluminum orders for the second half of 
1981 are weak virtually across the board, according to an aluminum 
industry economist, and some cutback in production is anticipated in 
the third quarter. Also, two regional crude-oil refineries in the 
District are still operating at about 70% of capacity. Backlogs of 
machine tool orders have been steadily cut to 12 months from 18 
months a year-ago, according to an industry economist. The long 
slide in machine tool orders is unlikely to be reversed for another 
quarter or two. The spending surge for machine tools by the auto 
industry has peaked, judging from recent cancellations and deferrals 
of spending by GMC, especially for production of additional four-
cylinder engine capacity. In view of the letup in capital spending 
by the auto industry, some machine tool producers believe they have 
sufficient capacity to accommodate an upswing in defense orders 
before reaching supply constraints, perhaps in 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite a second-quarter decline attributed largely 
to weakened auto sales, consumer spending should increase by about 
3% in 1981, according to an economist for a major department store 
chain. Retail sales of food items are expected to be flat over the 
year, but real growth in department store sales should reach 4%. A 
packaging producer for nondurable consumer goods reports that 
shipments of corrugated boxes, usually a reliable coincident 
indicator, have been dropping slowly. Several producers of durable 
consumer goods report that inventories continue to be tight at plant 
and retail levels, with some seasonally volatile items (such as air 
conditioners) experiencing slow deliveries as a result of low 
stocks. Auto producers have been trying to influence dealers to step 
up orders for the remainder of this model year, but dealers are 
reluctant to order because of high interest rates on floor plans and 
an uncertain consumer market. An auto industry economist states that 
May and June should be a post-rebate low point in auto sales, and 
summer months are expected to show increases, on a seasonally 
adjusted basis. This assumes, however, continued moderation in 
consumer prices, further declines in gasoline prices, and lower 
interest rates. The economist asserts that availability of 
installment credit, hindered by usury ceilings in many states, is 
depressing auto sales rather than higher interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand by businesses has increased in recent months, 
but consumer loan demand remains weak. A bank economist reports that 
C&amp;I loans recorded a strong increase in June. Inventory financing 
and a need for working capital appear to be significant factors for 
the step-up in borrowing from small and middle-sized corporations. 
Continuation of interest rates at current levels could have a 
crippling effect on smaller businesses over the next three to six 
months, according to several bank economists. Consumer installment 
lending continues to decline, according to a local bank official, 
but at a slower rate than during the first quarter. However, an area 
banker expects installment lending to receive a boost from new car 
buying in the fall. Credit card usage is showing signs of bottoming 
out.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mortgage loan demand remains very weak in the District, 
with mortgage rates rising to as high as 18% on conventional 80% 
mortgages. A 100-basis-point advantage on renegotiable-rate-
mortgages has not overcome consumer reluctance to buy homes under 
current market conditions, according to an S&amp;L official. An official 
for a major builder reports that orders for new houses in the second 
quarter are 30% below normal, with each month showing progressive 
weakness. The current order pattern, along with rising mortgage 
rates, does not suggest a revival in housing starts similar to that 
which occurred last summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings flows into S&amp;Ls may fall as sharply in June as in April, 
according to an economist for a regional FHLB in the District. An 
S&amp;L that has benefited from a promotion to attract funds to their 
six-month money-market certificate in May reports that competition 
from other S&amp;Ls and higher rates offered by commercial banks have 
reduced savings flows in June. Several S&amp;L officials see little 
relief from their earnings problem this quarter or next. Losses this 
quarter will apparently be even more widespread than last, which 
will aggravate those associations that have already been operating 
with relatively low liquidity. An S&amp;L official asserts that the 
proposed tax-free savings certificate would promptly improve the 
supply of and demand for mortgages, although several others feel 
such an instrument would be too late to benefit this selling season.
