      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 15, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economists from Fourth District firms who convened at the Bank last 
  week have scaled down their expectations for output and raised their 
  estimates of inflation for this quarter and 1979. Half of the thirty 
  economists expect at least one quarterly decline in real GNP next 
  year. Retailers and producers of consumer goods are cautious over 
  short-term sales prospects. Manufacturing and mining activity is 
  supported by a high level of auto production, better-than-expected 
  steel and coal production, and additional but small real gains in 
  capital spending. Financial officers prefer tax relief as a remedy 
  for the steady erosion in capital stock. The city of Cleveland 
  appears to be approaching default.
       </p>
       <p>
        Economists at the regularly scheduled meeting on the economic 
  outlook held November 10 have considerably altered their 
  expectations for output and prices from those given at a similar 
  meeting last June. At that time, the group expected real GNP would 
  increase at about a 3.0 percent annual rate this quarter and 2.5 
  percent in the first half of 1979. The latest set of forecasts, 
  submitted before the November 1 actions to defend the dollar, 
  indicates real GNP would increase at a 2.5 percent annual rate this 
  quarter, followed by a 1.6 percent annual rate of increase in the 
  first half of 1979 and a 2.0 percent annual rate of increase in the 
  second half. The participants expect the inflation rate to increase 
  at about a 7.3 percent rate in the first half of 1979 and 7.0 
  percent in the second half. Although in the aggregate the group 
  expects the expansion to continue through 1979, seven economists 
  expect a recession, and an additional eight a one quarter drop in 
  real GNP in 1979. Moreover, policy actions taken on November 1 
  further altered expectations; at least a third of the group now 
  anticipates a recession in 1979.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers and producers of consumer goods remain cautious over near-term sales prospects. Some look for a relatively good Christmas 
  season followed by sluggish sales through the winter months. 
  Retailers, especially major chains, are reported to have large 
  stocks of goods and are holding down placement of orders from 
  producers. Department store officials are said to be buying 
  cautiously, partly because of uncertain prospects and also because 
  of more than ample stocks of goods. An official with a large food 
  chain noted that consumers are paying more attention to specials and 
  private brand merchandise in an effort to maintain a fixed food 
  budget. He noted his chain is selectively expanding inventories as 
  an inflation hedge.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prospects for the auto industry in 1979 suggest a reduced level of 
  sales and production, according to a group of auto producers and 
  suppliers. Compared with an estimated domestic sales volume of 9.3 
  million units and 2 million imports this year, they expect domestic 
  sales of about 8.7 million units and 1.8 million imports in 1979. An 
  economist with an auto producer recently trimmed his 1979 forecast 
  of domestic sales to 9.1 million and imports to 1.7 million units. 
  He noted that imports will fall more than domestic sales because 
  import price increases of the past year have not yet been reflected 
  in prices paid by the consumers. He expects that part of that sales 
  loss will result in an overall market loss of 100,000 cars in 1979. 
  Auto suppliers, especially rubber and steel producers, report a 
  continued strong level of orders from the two major auto producers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel economists have become more optimistic over prospects for that 
  industry. Several weeks ago, they anticipated a continued high 
  volume of imports and inventory liquidation that would weaken 
  production this quarter. More recently, price hedging coupled with 
  an expected drop in the volume of imports this quarter will likely 
  hold production at about the 87 percent capacity rate of the third 
  quarter. However, a strike by steel haulers could curtail shipments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coal production has rebounded to the high levels of earlier this 
  year, following a summer slump. A rail strike contributed to a 
  runoff in coal stocks. Inventories of domestic coking coal, at a 
  record low, induced a surge in imports from West Germany which 
  brought charges of dumping. A freight car shortage is encouraging 
  some coal producers to buy their own cars. The industry expects 
  record production in 1979, but the operating rate would still not 
  exceed 90 percent of capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mixed expectations mark prospects for fixed investment in 1979. Some 
  economists expect real gains to exceed the 2 percent increase 
  suggested in the latest McGraw-Hill survey. One producer pointed out 
  that much of the recent increase in spending has been concentrated 
  in trucks, autos, and communications. Moreover, some industries are 
  expected to show either little gain or some decline in 1979. Heavy-duty truck production and off-highway tractors are estimated to be 
  at or somewhat below 1978 levels, and machine tool orders will 
  likely drop 20-25 percent in 1979, although a large backlog should 
  sustain production. Others anticipate real gains of as much as 5 to 
  6 percent over 1978. They cite further strength in freight car 
  production, industrial equipmentâ€”including gears and conveyor 
  equipment for miningâ€”and in industrial commercial construction.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a recent financial seminar at this Bank, chief financial officers 
  of Cleveland-area firms acknowledged that capital stock is being 
  depleted because of inadequate provision for replacement cost of 
  assets. Some asserted that competitive market pressures would not 
  permit increases in prices to reflect replacement costs. Some also 
  felt that financial markets would not accept changes in accounting 
  procedures that would attempt to cope with the problem of inflation 
  accounting. Others remarked that switching to LIFO penalizes income 
  statements and may hinder a continuous upward trend in earnings, an 
  objective of many firms. Several preferred tax relief rather than 
  changes in accounting procedures as a solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        A growing feeling of a number of observers is that the city of 
  Cleveland can hardly avoid a default in 1978. A top administration 
  official feels that Cleveland needs MAC-type assistance. Since the 
  mayoral recall election last August, Cleveland's political 
  leadership has remained divided on issues that affect the city's 
  solvency. The administration's effort to raise revenues has been 
  hampered by several factors: the city council's refusal to approve a 
  $50 million bond issue until a detailed financial plan is submitted, 
  the loss of the profitable water division to regional authority, and 
  the reluctance of banks to refinance $15.5 million in below-investment grade city notes that are due December 15. Some analysts 
  believe that even an eleventh hour rescue would only postpone an 
  inevitable default until the spring of 1979.
