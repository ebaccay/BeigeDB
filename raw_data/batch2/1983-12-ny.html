      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Introduction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of the recovery seems to be picking up a bit in the Second 
District. Consumer spending is strong, and retailers say that early 
indications point to a good holiday season. Manufacturing activity 
continues to expand at a moderate pace, and observers of the upstate 
economy feel that the worst is finally over. Homebuilders are 
working at capacity, and have become more optimistic about the 
outlook for next year. Office construction remains strong and 
leasing activity continues to grow in much of the District. Spending 
on infrastructure should be substantial in the months ahead since 
voters in New York and New Jersey recently approved the issuance of 
$l.4 billion of transportation bonds. On the financial side, 
consumer borrowing strengthened somewhat, in part due to stronger 
demand for auto loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail spending improved further in late October and November and 
the gains at District stores were broadly based. Several chains, 
running the gamut from high-income to discount stores, reported 
double-digit increases over the comparable period a year ago. The 
sharpest improvement occurred in an upstate chain which had been 
doing poorly most of the year. Sales at most stores were reported at 
planned levels or even higher, with only one respondent noting a 
weaker than expected increase. Furniture and various kinds of 
apparel were mentioned as products in strong demand. Inventories 
were generally reported at satisfactory levels, increasing only in 
line with sales. However, one chain mentioned problems in keeping up 
with demand for a few hot items. Most District retailers anticipate 
that this Christmas season will be stronger than last year's. 
Consumers have begun their buying earlier, and sales for the first 
few days of the season have been quite encouraging.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction remains strong throughout the District, 
aided by unseasonably mild weather. However, shortages of skilled 
labor and some materials continue to delay building activity in New 
York City suburban areas. Homebuilders remain booked through the 
spring and the outlook for next summer is generally improving. 
Customer traffic has been heavy and increasingly composed of serious 
buyers. Nevertheless, a few builders, fearing higher interest rates, 
are concerned about possible reduced demand in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      The nonresidential real estate market remains active and has shown 
further improvement. New leasing commitments are being made around 
the District at a rapid pace. Manhattan is particularly strong, and 
as a result, confidence is now growing in the ability of this market 
to absorb the new office space currently under construction. 
However, some concern has developed about possible overbuilding in 
parts of New Jersey and Connecticut.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State governments of New York and New Jersey have received voter 
approval for increased borrowing for infrastructure renewal. In 
November's elections a total for the two states of $1.4 billion was 
authorized for extensive upgrading of roads, bridges and public 
transportation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A further moderate expansion in District manufacturing activity 
occurred during recent weeks. The automotive sector continues strong 
with some firms, which had been using their existing workforce 
overtime, now reporting sufficient demand to allow new hiring. 
Capital goods manufacturers have also begun to show some 
improvement. Several have now returned to full workweeks after 
months of operating on shortened schedules. In addition, spending 
for plant and equipment is underway or planned by various industries 
such as computers, medical equipment, and health and beauty 
products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some upstate areas that were particularly hard hit by the recession 
now report a much more optimistic outlook and a feeling that the 
worst is over. In Buffalo, for example, the latest survey of 
purchasing managers showed the highest percentages reporting 
increased new orders and employment in several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment rates in most District labor market areas are generally 
below their levels of a year ago. However, while employment has been 
increasing in recent months, it still remains well below year-ago 
levels in several areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer borrowing has strengthened somewhat in the region. 
Discussions with bank representatives in the Second District 
indicate that most institutions are becoming more aggressive in the 
consumer loan market by reducing rates and increasing advertising. 
The demand for auto loans, in particular, has been up sharply 
because of bank promotions, termination of auto finance company 
incentives, and introduction of new car models. Some banks also 
report increased issuance of bank credit cards and higher 
outstanding balances on these accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In line with the national trend, District banks have been stressing 
adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). About half of new mortgages are 
ARMs, and several institutions report that all their new mortgages 
are adjustable rate. However, portfolios still remain heavily 
weighted with fixed rate instruments. The spread between interest 
rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate contracts is currently at 
about 2 percentage points. This spread has narrowed only slightly in 
recent months.
