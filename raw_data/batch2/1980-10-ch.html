     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 14, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the district apparently strengthened moderately in the 
past two months, but remains well below the levels of either the 
first quarter or last year. No substantial revival is expected for 
the next several months. Consumer buying is sluggish. Capital 
spending, overall, is in a downward phase. Inventories are lean and 
under tight control. Wholesale prices are strengthening again after 
a brief period of discounting last summer. Housing remains severely 
depressed. Farm income prospects have improved. Credit is generally 
available, but high rates and tighter lending standards hold down 
new credits. Complaints of "slow pay" by businesses and consumers 
are widespread.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing managers in Chicago and Milwaukee report that the modest 
improvement they noted in August continued in September. For many 
companies, however, this means merely a slower rate of decline. Some 
uptrend in orders, output, and employment has occurred, but activity 
remains well below the levels of the first quarter. Prices paid are 
strengthening again.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that sales were somewhat 
disappointing in September and early October, following an 
improvement from the low point of April-May. Price cutting and 
special sales are common. Except for strength in auto parts and 
service, no categories are singled out as particularly strong or 
weak. Credit use has revived, but customers are using their lines 
cautiously. Delinquencies continue to rise, but not alarmingly. 
Retail inventories are definitely lean, so a strong Christmas 
season, should it develop, would cause some stockouts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Airline traffic has been declining for several months. In September 
passenger miles on trunk airlines were 13.5 percent below year ago. 
Advance bookings and customer surveys suggest the picture will 
weaken further. The recession and higher fares, up 14.0 percent on 
full-pay tickets, are blamed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos and trucks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Motor vehicle sales were slow in September, partly 
because of depleted inventories of large cars. No clear reading on 
the strength of demand for 1981 models will be possible until late 
October or November. New models appear to be selling well, but high 
prices shock some potential buyers. Inventories are in much better 
balance than a year ago at this time. Most dealers have moved out 
stocks of big cars and consumer-type trucks. Rates on car loans have 
stabilized in the 14-16 percent range. Credit is available, but 
lenders are very selective on new credits, especially on 42 and 48 
month loans. Finance companies are now charging over 14 percent on 
floor plan loans, and dealers are complaining bitterly. Dealers are 
determined not to overstock again, partly because they fear that 
carrying costs, subject to change day-by-day, will increase further. 
Dealerships continue to close as losses accumulate, but not as 
frequently as last spring. Captive finance companies have 
reestablished some closed dealerships under new managements. 
Showroom traffic to view new models generally has been 
disappointing, partly because new features are not apparent in 
styling. There is little hope for a substantial revival in vehicle 
sales in the next 3 to 6 months. Sales are especially weak in 
Chicago, and the Midwest generally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital goods
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, new orders for equipment are continuing to 
decline, and backlogs are still eroding, but at a slower rate. There 
is no evidence of heavy cancellations of orders as in 1974-75. The 
oil and gas sector and machine tool builders have large backlogs. 
Demand for farm equipment and heavy trucks shows some improvement 
after a sharp decline earlier in the year. Construction equipment is 
in its worst slump ever. Orders for heavy castings have stabilized 
at a rate equal to about 60 percent of capacity. Freight car 
deliveries are declining at an accelerated rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel orders have improved since early July. Operations have moved 
from a low of 50 percent of capacity to about 75 percent, but remain 
well below the levels of 1979 or early 1980. Some laid off steel 
workers have been recalled, and closed furnaces have been started 
up. Lead times on sheets have returned to normal, but leads on most 
other products remain short. Steel inventories at all levels have 
been low for the past year, which explains the up and dawn nature of 
steel demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity is at a postwar low in 
most district centers. An incipient revival in the summer was 
aborted in August as mortgage money tightened and rates moved back 
past 12 percent. Currently, most posted rates range from 13 to 14 
percent plus fees of 2.5 to 3 points. Some lenders offering 13 
percent loans say there is no need to go higher because demand has 
"dried up." The failure of builders to get "holes in the ground" 
this fall will slow the seasonal uptrend in activity next spring. 
Used house sales also remain at a low ebb, with most realtors down 
to skeleton crews.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction is at a high rate, but is expected to 
decline in 1981. A large volume of work is in the planning stage, 
with contracts expected to be let some months hence. Financing will 
be a problem unless the insurance companies return in force to the 
commercial mortgage market which they largely closed off in late 
August.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop prices have declined somewhat, and livestock 
prices have leveled, but farm income and credit remain healthier 
than was the case early in the year. Corn and soybean harvests are 
ahead of normal. Recent frosts were light and did not significantly 
alter yield forecasts. The Wisconsin dairy industry has been 
relatively prosperous. It will be strengthened further by the 
semiannual adjustment which raised the milk support price to 14 
percent above last year as of October 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inventories
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Businesses of all types are striving to keep 
inventories low, partly because of high financing costs. Only oil 
product inventories are deemed excessive, but this would be a 
stabilizing factor if the Iraq-Iran war drags on or spreads.
