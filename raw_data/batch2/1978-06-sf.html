      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 1978
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Retail sales, especially those of domestic autos, continue strong. 
  High cattle prices are stimulating farm incomes. The forest products 
  industry is booming and reports a serious shortage of railroad cars 
  to deliver its product. Except for California, the Twelfth District 
  is characterized by full employment. Bankers are generally 
  unenthusiastic about the six-month certificates and consumer 
  response at banks has been very modest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales continue strong in the west. One Oregon observer notes 
  that nominal sales are increasing at 15 percent annual rates. A 
  survey in Tacoma, Washington, sees sales rising at an 8 percent 
  annual rate. In Seattle, domestic auto sales are reported strong, 
  but sales of imports are down sharply due to buyer resistance to 
  price increases. In southern California, sales of most cars are said 
  to be booming, but especially those of such luxury cars as Cadillac 
  and Mercedes. New car sales are also reported strong in Utah.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the agricultural sector, high cattle prices are reported to be 
  bolstering farm incomes throughout the district, but there is some 
  concern about Administration hints of raising the imported beef 
  quota. Even though fruit and vegetable prices have been rising, good 
  California weather is expected to flatten these out. Concern is 
  expressed that current farm-land prices in California are not 
  justified by the land's productive capacity, but rather by its value 
  as an asset for foreign investors fleeing inflation or domestic 
  investors seeking tax shelters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The forest products industry is reported to be quite strong due. 
  both to strong export demand and an expanding residential 
  construction sector. There are, however, two major concerns in this 
  industry. The first is that high mortgage rates (now 10 percent and 
  expected by some to move to 11 percent) could pull the rug out from 
  under housing sales and thus lumber sales. The second concern is 
  over a serious shortage of railroad cars to get forest products out 
  of the northwest—one observer claimed that the need is for 50 
  percent more cars than are currently available. A director who 
  produces railroad cars confirmed this reported shortage by noting 
  that his factories were experiencing tremendous backlogs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In southern California the construction business (especially 
  nonresidential) is still booming, though there is growing concern 
  over rising costs of labor and materials. One director in the 
  construction business claimed that rapidly rising wages accompanied 
  by falling productivity (due to low and falling unemployment rates) 
  had generated a 27 percent increase in labor costs over the past 
  year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our directors were asked whether they felt that their local areas 
  were characterized by full employment or whether there were 
  involuntarily unemployed people who could be absorbed by a rapidly 
  expanding economy. All western directors outside California 
  portrayed their local economies as having a fully employed labor 
  force. The Utah economy was said to be devouring a stream of new 
  workers migrating into the area. In the Portland area, it was 
  observed that there were virtually no skilled workers available, and 
  this shortage of skilled workers was echoed throughout the district. 
  The categories of unemployment still existing (i.e., students 
  seeking summer jobs, migrant workers, some unskilled workers and 
  central-city teenagers) were cited as not being amenable to 
  reduction through a more rapidly expanding economy. On the other 
  hand, six of our eight California directors felt that California was 
  not yet near full employment. A dean at the University of Southern 
  California notes that they are receiving hundreds of requests for 
  interviews for both academic and staff positions. Several directors 
  noted that California will move even farther away from full 
  employment in the short run due to the public-sector layoffs 
  stimulated by the passage of the Jarvis-Gann initiative (which cut 
  property taxes by 60 percent).
       </p>
       <p>
        Our banker directors were generally unenthusiastic about the new 
  six-month certificate. The general feeling seems to be that: a) 
  banks cannot compete with thrifts in this market due to the 114 
  percent differential and b) most purchases of certificates will be 
  simply internal shifts anyway. All are offering the certificates at 
  the T-bill rate. Only slightly more than half of the banks appear to 
  be advertising the certificates, and most of this advertising seems 
  to be of a minimal nature. Consumer response so far seems negligible 
  to modest, though one Alaskan and one Washington bank did report 
  favorable response. Practically all of the certificate purchases (80 
  to 100 percent) involved internal shifts of funds. The only 
  exception was the Alaskan bank for which 45 percent of the 
  certificates were new business. Most felt the certificates would 
  have only a modest impact over the next six months, and generally 
  that they would help to curtail outflows of funds rather than 
  actually generate any new inflows. One director felt the only effect 
  would be to raise the cost of funds and thus lower earnings.
