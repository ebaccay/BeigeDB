      Beige Book Report: New York

     <div>
      <p>
       <strong>
        April 12, 1977
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Business activity in the Second District has continued to improve 
    moderately according to directors, business leaders, and analysts 
    contacted recently. Department store sales have for the most part 
    been satisfactory, and several merchants reported that the New York 
    metropolitan area was doing better than the rest of the country. 
    This pattern did not carry over to District auto sales, however, 
    which were lagging the remainder of the country. Inventory positions 
    were generally considered to be in line with sales, although several 
    respondents indicated that inventory building would soon be under 
    way. Orders for capital goods remained weak; government regulations, 
    sluggish demand, and financial constraints were among the reasons 
    given. The Buffalo directors did report, however, that the near-term 
    outlook for orders in the steel industry had improved. Finally, 
    considerable concern was voiced over the outlook for prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports on department store sales in the District were generally 
    favorable. Indeed, several national retailers indicated that, in 
    contrast to recent experience, sales throughout the New York 
    metropolitan area and the East Coast in general were outpacing sales 
    elsewhere in the country. Certain other New York merchants, in 
    contrast, found sales a bit disappointing, yet even they seemed "cautiously optimistic" about future sales. In upstate New York, 
    expectations for the spring buying season were characterized as 
"reasonably good" by the Buffalo directors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports on District auto sales were less encouraging. Although sales 
    nationwide appear to be booming, the president of an automobile 
    dealers' trade association indicated that so far in 1977 sales in 
    the New York metropolitan area were lagging sales of a year ago. 
    Uncertainty about economic conditions, talk about taxes on large 
    cars, and concern about financial conditions in New York City were 
    blamed for keeping customers away from the auto showrooms. The 
    president of a New Jersey trade association likewise categorized 
    automobile sales in northern New Jersey as weak. Although dealers 
    throughout the country are experiencing difficulty in moving small 
    cars, this problem is even more pronounced in New Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventories generally appeared to be at desired levels, although 
    plans to restock inventories were reported by some respondents. The 
    vice president of a large petroleum company stated that oil 
    inventories, which had been depleted by the cold weather, were 
    rising to planned levels and that no inventory problems were 
    expected before the next heating season. Retailers have been keeping 
    a close watch on inventories, which has kept them in line with 
    sales. In the paper industry inventories had been allowed to run 
    down since mid-1976, according to a top executive of a paper 
    company, but some rebuilding is now anticipated. An economist for a 
    large publishing firm stated that he expects inventory accumulation 
    to occur throughout the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital spending in the Second District, as in the nation, has 
    recovered slowly, although conditions may be improving. The chairman 
    of a major oil company observed that, due to confusing regulations 
    in the oil industry, it is not profitable to build plants today. He 
    further stated that unless controls are eliminated, a shortage of 
    refinery capacity will develop in the early l980s. The view that 
    government regulations inhibit capital spending was echoed by an 
    executive of a major commercial bank. In the same vein, the director 
    of finance for a private utility company complained that, because of 
    delays caused by environmental regulations, the time required for 
    constructing a nuclear plant has been lengthened from six years to 
    ten years. The vice president of an iron and steel company 
    attributed the sluggishness in plant and equipment spending to 
    insufficient financial capital. And in the rubber industry, a 
    spokesman for a trade association stated that the industry is 
    reluctant to add further to its already heavy debt burden. On the 
    brighter side, a textile industry economist reported that capital 
    spending, long lackluster, has recently shown signs of turning up in 
    response to improved demand conditions. Moreover, the Buffalo 
    directors reported favorable near-term prospects for capital goods 
    orders as well as for production and employment. This was especially 
    true for the steel industry in Western New York, which is 
    experiencing new demand by Canadian customers as well as strong 
    demand by the automobile industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concern over the outlook for prices was voiced by many respondents. 
    The production manager of a machinery company reported widespread 
    increases in the cost of materials and fabricated inputs. He also 
    expressed his belief that the effects of recent increases in the 
    price of steel would continue to ripple through the economy. While 
    most businessmen were reporting higher materials prices, the 
    president of a major capital goods-producing company stated that, 
    despite increases in list prices of steel and various other 
    materials, actual prices paid by his company were about the same as 
    a year ago (with the notable exception of aluminum). An economist 
    for a paper company said he expects upward pressure on prices as 
    businesses try to rebuild their profit margins after the cost 
    increases of the past year. Oil prices are expected to continue 
    rising as the import share grows. In the consumer goods sector, the 
    editor of an industry publication reported a round of wholesale 
    price increases in February and March that are expected to show up 
    in the form of higher retail price tags in late summer and early 
    fall.
