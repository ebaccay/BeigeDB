      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 14, 1977
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Weakness in the steel industry and more cautious inventory policies 
by manufacturers and retailers have slowed the pace of economic 
activity in the Fourth District this quarter. Despite strong sales 
gains again in August, retailers remain cautious about prospects for 
the balance of 1977. Capital goods producers report continued strong 
demand for machinery and equipment, but heavy construction remains 
weak. Residential construction and mortgage loan demand continue 
strong.
      <p>
       An atmosphere of gloom seems to have marked the steel industry in 
  recent weeks. Steel orders have not rebounded as much as was 
  generally expected. Although several producers are operating at 
  about 75-to-80% of effective capacity, they expect another quarter 
  of little or no profits. A recent surge in steel imports and further 
  mild runoff of inventories have led directors and steel economists 
  to scale down forecasts for the balance of this year. Consumption 
  has remained relatively strong except for structural steel. Still, 
  one economist noted orders from the automotive industry have not 
  been as strong as previously expected when production schedules for 
  1978 model cars were announced. The industry, therefore, is marked 
  by discounting of prices, layoffs of salary and production workers, 
  suspension of cost-of-living adjustments for white-collar workers, 
  numerous closings of marginal facilities, and halting or stretching 
  out of capital-spending plans. A producer, for example, cut the 
  price of structural steel products $50 a ton below published price 
  to keep its mill in operation. Another producer hopes to improve 
  cash flow by selling its interest in iron ore properties in 
  Labrador, valued at about $75 million. While steel economists 
  anticipate that next quarter's production levels will increase to at 
  least 80% of capacity, they acknowledge little sign of improvement 
  in orders to support their expectations. Furthermore, the industry 
  would not generate much profit even at a higher operating rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers and producers generally feel inventories have been built 
  sufficiently earlier this year and approach inventory policies with 
  caution for the rest of 1977. Inventories are not judged to be 
  excessive, although some adjustment is now occurring. Still it is 
  not of the magnitude experienced late last year. A large automotive 
  and truck parts supplier expresses the view typical of cautious 
  inventory policies; keep inventories as low as possible regardless 
  of past inventory-sales ratios. Similarly, a director associated 
  with a retail chain commented that retail stocks are more balanced 
  since the July-August pick-up in sales and that should sales soften 
  later this year, orders would likely be cut back promptly to avoid 
  another inventory buildup. Steel inventories at both consumer and 
  producer levels are not judged to be high. One large producer, 
  however, will trim stocks to reduce costs. Steel consumers have been 
  cutting inventories but steel economists expect a reduction to be 
  brief and mild in contrast to that of late last year. One economist 
  estimates that steel inventories currently are only slightly above 
  those during troughs in 1970-1971 and late 1976, in spite of the 
  fact that consumption is considerably higher than in those periods. 
  Copper and scrap inventories held by one firm are reported to be at 
  an all-time high and will likely be cut. Crude oil and gasoline 
  stocks continue at levels well above a year ago, although one 
  refinery reported a rather sizable reduction in gasoline stocks 
  during August. On the other hand, distillate and residual fuel 
  stocks are only slightly above last year's levels and as sane 
  producers will apparently aim to increase those stocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors and officials associated with consumer goods are mixed in 
  their views about prospects for consumer spending. Even though sales 
  gains in August were large relative to a year earlier, some 
  retailers remain cautious. A director of a department store chain 
  cautions that slower gains in income and an unsustainably high 
  proportion of expenditures for automotive and luxury-type goods 
  would likely hold down future consumer spending. An economist in 
  retail trade expects slower growth in disposable income and 
  increased personal saving rates will hold overall gains in real 
  consumer expenditures to about a 3% annual rate of increase this 
  half. He does not believe that the rapid rate of increase in retail 
  sales last month can be sustained, nor is it consistent with 
  forecasts of only 4-to-5% quarterly gains in real GNP during the 
  second half of 1977. A director associated with a producer of 
  household products, whose sales surged in August following two 
  months of reduced order activity, took a more optimistic view. He 
  reports his firm plans to step up its capacity expansion program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recovery in capital goods industries is still not broadly based. 
  Although producers contacted expressed growing confidence that the 
  13% gain projected in the latest Commerce Department survey will be 
  realized, they see few indications that suggest an accelerated pace 
  over the next few quarters. One official with a large producer of 
  parts and equipment for industrial and agricultural machinery 
  suggests the atypical lag in the recovery can be attributed to 
  concern over the next recession, lack of strength in export markets, 
  and ample capacity. His firm experienced a substantial decline in 
  sales of components for farm implements, a trend he expects will 
  extend into 1978. Orders for medium trucks used for inner-city 
  transit are slowly increasing. On the other hand, the firm's heavy-duty truck production has rebounded rather strongly, and 1977 output 
  is expected to be 45-50% higher than last year. Similarly, orders 
  for industrial lift trucks accelerated sharply since spring and 
  shipments for the year are expected to be about 35% higher than in 
  1976, but well below 1973-1974 peak levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The contrast in capital goods industries is perhaps best illustrated 
  by the rising demand for machinery and equipment—including machine 
  tools, materials and handling equipment, forgings and communication 
  equipment for which backlogs have been rising steadily—while 
  construction of new plants and public works projects remains weak. 
  Continued weakness in public construction has prevented recovery in 
  production of off-highway equipment, structural frames for bridges 
  and highways, and structural steel. Financial officers with two 
  large international firms that design, engineer and construct plants 
  report that interest in new construction projects has either been 
  flat or weakened recently. One noted a tendency for shelving 
  projects until an energy program and tax legislation are enacted. 
  One of these officials also expects that it may be at least a year 
  or more before construction of new plants begins to accelerate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential construction remains strong and demand for mortgage 
  loans is at or near record levels, according to officials of several 
  large S&amp;Ls. A major northeastern Ohio utility increased its forecast 
  of 1977 housing starts by 10% because sales have kept pace with 
  completions. Several S&amp;Ls continue to report very strong demand for 
  mortgage loans. None report disintermediation but an official with a 
  $360 million deposit association reported a recent runoff in 
  deposits because maturing 4-year certificates were not redeposited. 
  In fact, some associations have had to step up borrowings from 
  Federal Home Loan banks. While still above the 7% requirement, 
  liquidity at S&amp;Ls has generally been reduced.
