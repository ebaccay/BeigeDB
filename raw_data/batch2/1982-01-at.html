      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 27, 1982
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Sixth District's economy appears to be slowing. Retail sales 
have stalled due to inclement weather and slack labor markets. The 
construction sector continues to contract as the housing industry 
grinds to a halt. Unemployment insurance rolls are expanding; 
layoffs are mounting. A severe freeze destroyed large portions of 
citrus and vegetable crops and hampered livestock production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Holiday sales were only fair in much of the 
District, about the same as last year. Exceptions are Georgia and 
Louisiana, where merchants noted substantial gains over 1980. Weak 
sales, combined with heavy promotion expenses and pre-Christmas 
discounting, continued to erode retailers' profits. Reports of fewer 
return items in the post-Christmas period may confirm that buyers 
were especially price and quality conscious. The recent severe 
weather has slowed sales of many non-food items. Retailers expect 
softer than normal sales, especially of low-quality goods, early in 
the year because of the deepening recession. In response, they are 
attempting to lower inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales continue at severely depressed levels throughout most of 
the District. State auto dealers association representatives in some 
District states note that sales of large cars are holding up better 
than sales of small cars. Spokesmen attribute this to the stable-to-
lower price of gasoline and to the small additional cost of buying 
desired features on larger cars. There are widespread reports that 
auto dealer bankruptcies and auto repossessions are trending 
upwards.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Interest rates continue to wreak havoc 
with the real estate and construction industries. Across the 
District, December sales of single family homes fell to half the 
year-earlier level. Transferees are declining in number. The only 
purchasers are those in high income brackets and/or two-income 
families with no children. Lower and middle-income families have 
been locked out of the market. Realtors claim that 85 percent of 
financing involves assumable mortgages and/or owner financing. An 
increasing number of sales come from actual and impending 
foreclosures.
     </p>
     <p>
      The apartment market is also severely affected. Many cities are 
experiencing severe drops in the apartment vacancy rates as 
potential home buyers wait out high interest rates. In other cities, 
low vacancy rates and construction cost factors have caused rent 
increases which in turn caused drastic increases in the apartment 
vacancy rates. Singles are doubling up or moving back home. The 
housing market effect on apartment vacancy and rental rates has 
varied considerably from city to city.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most realtors are pessimistic about 1982. Customers cannot afford 
high interest rates and have concerns about job security. Realtor 
agencies are closing branch offices while independents are closing 
shop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Industry
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New applications for unemployment insurance 
soared in Georgia from November to December as layoffs in the 
automobile, construction, and carpet industries mounted. Some 1,500 
federal government workers are expected to be laid off between 
February and March, bringing to 2,000 the total number of federal 
civilian jobs lost in Atlanta since October. Federal officials are 
confident, however, that enough new jobs will be created in defense 
to place these workers if they are willing to relocate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor market conditions in Florida are healthy by national and 
regional standards. The inflow of migrants to the state has 
moderated somewhat due to the depressed national housing market. 
Florida's jobless rate has risen only slightly since the national 
recession began. On the other hand, unemployment rates are well 
above the national average in Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, and 
Louisiana. Unemployment insurance was extended for 13 additional 
weeks in Tennessee, with one in ten of the state's workers 
unemployed. Alabama's unemployment rate is around 12 percent and 
reports of layoffs suggest that higher rates are in the offing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although airlines have recently announced price increases for most 
domestic routes, fares to Florida vacation cities remain at cut-rate 
levels due to slack passenger traffic. Hotel managers in South 
Florida fear that publicity about their recent cold snap could have 
further adverse effects. Cruise ship travel is down, with Miami's 
port director predicting a dismal year. Corporate travel is also 
being reduced. The sluggish economy is affecting theme park 
attendance as families take trips closer to home. A spokesman for 
Walt Disney World-with the largest volume of visitors of any park in 
Florida-notes attendance figures down 8 percent from the same time 
last year. New promotional campaigns aimed at in-state residents 
have been undertaken.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In January, the southeast was nipped by severe freezes 
that extended well into South Florida. Below-freezing temperatures 
destroyed about 25 percent of the orange crop and 55 percent of 
Florida's winter vegetables, according to preliminary (and disputed) 
estimates of a federal agency. Sugar cane was also damaged, but most 
of the crop can be salvaged if it reaches processing plants before 
deterioration sets in. Some damaged oranges were also salvaged, but 
the rapid return of warmer weather hastened spoilage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of orange juice have risen sharply since the freeze, but 
future increases may be held in check by relatively large stocks of 
juice in storage and the likelihood of increased imports of 
Brazilian juice. Retail vegetable prices are expected to rise at 
least 15 percent by March, as they did following a similar freeze a 
year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Widespread snow and ice across most of the southeast increased feed 
requirements of livestock and slowed poultry production. Broiler 
prices have risen abruptly in January, reversing a decline of 
several months.
