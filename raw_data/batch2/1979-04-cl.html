      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Automotive production and employment in the Fourth District is being 
  hampered by the Teamsters strike, but other key manufacturing 
  industries are operating close to effective capacity. High operating 
  rates and fear of shortages have stimulated some inventory building. 
  Manufacturers see little sign of let-up in price pressures in the 
  near-term. Retailers still view short-term sales prospects 
  cautiously and some expect smaller gains in sales this quarter than 
  last. Deposit flows at S&amp;Ls in recent weeks have slackened, and 
  officials are uncertain over future deposit flows and mortgage 
  lending.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except for the automotive industry, the Teamsters strike has not yet 
  had disruptive effects on employment and production, although 
  sizable cutbacks are likely if the strike lasts beyond mid-April. 
  Auto production so far this month has been cut nearly 8 percent from 
  the scheduled 825,000 units. GMC has already shortened the workweek 
  at plants in Cincinnati and last week furloughed 7,400 workers for 
  one week at the Lordstown assembly plant and another 6,000 workers 
  at a nearby electrical equipment plant. Production losses were 
  reported at about 7,500 passenger cars and vans. Ford Motors expects 
  a cutback of about 55,000 passenger cars this month, nearly 25 
  percent of their planned schedule, even if the strike ends this 
  week. They expect that two-thirds of the production loss will be 
  made in May and June, but 10 percent or more will not be recovered 
  in this model year because of poor sales of certain models. In 
  addition, Chrysler announced a shutdown of six plants in Ohio 
  beginning April 9. However, the shutdown probably stems from excess 
  inventories rather than the Teamsters strike.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonautomotive industries, including primary metals, machine tools, 
  trucks, rubber and plastics and paper and paperboard, are reported 
  to be at high or near peak operating rates. Effects of the Teamsters 
  strike on employment and production in these industries have been 
  minimal, although steel, glass and auto components producers expect 
  disruptions should the strike continue much longer. Steel and 
  aluminum industries are operating at effective capacity. Steel is 
  expected to operate at about 95 percent capacity this quarter, a 
  presumed maximum rate, unless hindered by the Teamsters strike. A 
  shortage of domestic coke has boosted imports. One economist expects 
  some domestic steel users to step-up imports because of fear of 
  shortages and lengthening lead times at domestic mills. A major flat 
  glass supplier to GMC reports a full order book through this summer. 
  An axle and transmission producer also reports no cutbacks in 
  production have yet resulted because of the Teamsters strike and 
  remarked that should the auto industry be shut down, this producer 
  would continue at full production in order to relieve a shortage in 
  axles. Some softening is noted in sales of vans because of higher 
  fuel prices. A shortage of polyvinyl chloride has led some producers 
  to allocate production. Tire producers have been operating at 
  capacity partly because of high demand and also because of 
  expiration of the labor contract on April 20. An economist with a 
  tire producer expects that the probability of a strike in the rubber 
  industry will be heightened if the Teamsters strike continues 
  through April 20. Paperboard capacity has tightened because U.S. 
  producers have stepped up exports in response to higher prices 
  abroad than in U.S. markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Businesses assert they are still cautious in inventory policies but 
  are more willing to step up inventory building because economic 
  activity in the fourth quarter of 1978 and again in the last quarter 
  was better than some expected, which has given rise to a feeling 
  that the widely discussed recession is not yet apparent. An 
  automotive parts suppliers note that their inventories are at record 
  levels but in terms of day's supply, stocks at the end of last month 
  fell because of further increases in sales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Intense price pressures show little sign of abatement in the near-
  term, nor are they expected to let up as long as manufacturing 
  activity continues to operate at or near peak rates. Some officials 
  remarked that only recently have markets for their products been 
  strong enough to absorb price increases. Only scattered signs of 
  moderation in price pressures are indicated. For example, additional 
  FVC capacity is expected to be in operation within the next two to 
  three months, which should end allocation of that product and ease 
  strong upward price pressures. Also, steel scrap prices in some 
  regions fell recently but this was not expected to spread to all 
  steel producing regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike ebullient remarks from manufacturers, retailers remain 
  cautious in their appraisal of consumer spending prospects. The 
  Easter season does not appear to have stimulated GAF sales so far 
  this month. A department store official notes that consumers respond 
  well to bargains and heavy promotions. An economist with a major 
  department store chain expected April sales will increase about 9 to 
  10 percent from a year-ago, but he expects only an 8 percent year-
  over-year increase in sales this quarter compared with a 9.5 percent 
  increase last quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        S&amp;L reports on deposit flows and consumer responses to recent 
  changes in money market certificates are mixed. Some feel that the 
  March 15 changes that set maximum rates on certificates may not have 
  much adverse effect on deposit flows. An economist with a FHLB in 
  this District perceives that associations are not strapped for 
  funds, at least as suggested by an increase in paybacks instead of 
  in new borrowings in recent weeks. On the other hand, some others 
  feel associations have not been successful in rollover of maturing 
  certificates. Nevertheless, some officials believe they can still 
  draw down liquidity and step up borrowing to support mortgage 
  demand, which is typically described as rising seasonally but not as 
  strong as a year-ago. Prices of new houses continue to rise rapidly, 
  although prices of new houses have tended to increase less rapidly 
  than last year, according to some lenders.
