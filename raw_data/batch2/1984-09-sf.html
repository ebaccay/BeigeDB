      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 16, 1984
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy continues to grow, but at a slower rate 
due to weakness in certain sectors. Retail sales at department 
stores and automobile dealerships are reported to have dropped in 
August, although there may have been extenuating circumstances such 
as the effect of the Olympic Games and shortage of popular 
automobile models. Nonresidential construction activity continues to 
pick up, with additional projects announced recently. But rising 
mortgage interest rates have further reduced both the construction 
and sale of new homes. Weakness in certain industries, especially 
primary metals and lumber, is slowing the overall growth of 
manufacturing employment. The agricultural sector has been 
experiencing a dismal summer as overly abundant harvests have 
brought low prices for fruits and vegetables, and farm land prices 
have continued to drop. Banks reported strong consumer loan growth 
in August, but most expected some slowdown.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales at department stores and shopping malls are reported to 
have dropped off in August, following a favorable month in July. For 
example, the four major department stores in Southern California 
experienced a noticeable slowdown which reduced their year-to-year 
gain in sales for that month to 13 percent compared with 17 percent 
in July. A similar slowdown was reported for stores in Washington 
and Utah. In Southern California, some of the slowdown occurred 
because residents stayed away from the stores during the Olympic 
Games. But the fact that sales fell even further in early September 
suggests that consumers may be becoming more cautious. Back-to-
school apparel sales were disappointing, while sales of furniture
and appliances declined. The slowdown has left retail inventories 
above desired levels. As a result, retailers plan to restrain their 
inventory investment until just before the Christmas holiday season. 
Automobile sales apparently also fell in August, but respondents 
attributed at least part of the decline to extreme shortages at the 
end of the model-year. Despite the pause, retailers expect a strong 
Christmas selling season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The growth of manufacturing employment in most Twelfth District 
states has slowed during the third quarter, reflecting weakness in 
such important industries as primary metals, lumber and petroleum 
refining. Aluminum companies in the Pacific Northwest and copper 
producers in the Intermountain states have been curtailing 
operations recently as the rising foreign exchange value of the U.S. 
dollar has increased the influx of lower-price imports and forced 
domestic producers to reduce their prices. The administration's 
decision in early September to deny copper producers import 
protection suggests that further layoffs will occur in that 
industry. Pacific Northwest lumber mills increased production in
August, following extended vacation closures in July, but output 
still remained well below levels reached earlier this year due to 
the downtrend in national homebuilding activity and inroads by 
Canadian lumber imports. Two lumber companies declared bankruptcy in 
August due to their inability to pay for high-cost public timber 
under contract, and numerous others also could be forced to go out 
of business if Congress does not grant the industry contract relief. 
Fortunately, the paper segment of the forest products industry is 
experiencing extremely strong demand. The largest gains in 
manufacturing employment continue to occur in those industries 
benefiting from rising federal expenditures for defense and space 
programs and increased business investment. These include the 
electronic equipment, aircraft and missiles and nonelectrical 
machinery industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing starts in the West have shown further weakness recently, 
with the pace now off about 25 percent from this year's peak reached 
in January. Sales of new homes have declined by a similar percentage 
from levels reached earlier this year. Permits point to a further 
slowdown in homebuilding. The inventory of unsold new homes has 
risen but is not considered to have reached a disturbing level, 
partly because developers have attempted to protect themselves by 
building mainly on a pre-sold basis. Home prices are about equal or 
slightly higher than those of a year earlier. The use of creative 
financing is rising. In addition to below market interest rates, 
some builders are offering to pay all closing costs. Despite rising 
interest rates, nonresidential investment continues strong in the 
West, with a large number of office towers, shopping malls and 
hotels planned or under construction in major metropolitan areas. 
Office vacancy rates in these areas already are considerably above 
the national average. Rental rates are falling, and bankers are 
concerned that a serious excess supply of office space may be 
developing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This summer has been dismal for the California agricultural sector. 
Unusually hot weather either damaged fruit and vegetable crops or 
alternatively hurried their harvest, flooded the market with excess 
supplies and reduced prices below the break-even point for many 
growers. The fact that the heat caused many crops to ripen all at 
once aggravated the downward pressure on prices. Table grape prices 
have been the lowest in three years. The raisin inventory already 
amounts to two years' consumption, so the current harvest of raisin 
grapes is expected to bring very low prices. Similarly, the nation's 
largest wineryâ€”Galloâ€”is reported to be offering only 40 
percent of last year's price for wine grapes not already under 
contract. The hot weather helped spur the growth of the California
cotton crop, but the strong U.S. dollar and prospect of record world 
production have caused futures prices to move even lower recently. 
In California, Utah and other Intermountain states, the livestock 
sector has not shown significant improvement. In August, beef cattle 
prices were just about equal to last year's level, while dairy 
cattle prices were well below the level of a year earlier. Farm and 
ranch real estate values continue to fall, especially for nut and 
grape acreage in the San Joaquin Valley area of California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In August, consumer credit (not seasonally adjusted) at large banks 
in the Twelfth District grew at a 24 percent annual rate. This 
represented the largest monthly increase in 1984 and offset weakness 
in commercial and real estate lending. A sample of smaller 
institutions showed similar behavior. These increases continue the 
pattern of strong consumer loan growth shown earlier this year. 
Bankers in the region attribute the strength to improved economic 
conditions which have boosted consumer purchases of new cars and 
recreational vehicles. While a number of banks also report strength 
in home equity loans, others have experienced slow to flat demand 
for those loans as consumers have shifted to use of personal credit
lines and credit cards for financing. The forecast for consumer 
credit remains mixed. Many banks expect these loans to continue to 
grow rapidly through year-end. However, an even larger number of 
institutions expect slower growth in personal income and rising 
interest rates to cause a slowdown in both consumer spending and 
borrowing. A few of these already have experienced a falloff in 
consumer loan demand.
