      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 13, 1981
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District remains depressed 
relative to the nation. Nevertheless, year-to-year comparisons in 
sales and orders for April and May will appear favorable because of 
the sharp "free fall" declines that occurred last year. Employment 
in all five district states is running below last year's level, with 
no significant near-term improvement anticipated. The recent rise in 
interest rates cut-off a very modest, incipient improvement in 
housing. More businesses and state-local governments are 
experiencing financial problems. Demand for capital goods is 
generally weak. Steel orders continue to be strong. Although sales 
of autos and trucks remain disappointing, general merchandise has 
been surprisingly good. With improved moisture conditions crop 
prospects are good, but farm income estimates for 1981 have been 
reduced because of depressed prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Inflation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price inflation has moderated in highly competitive 
sectors. Retailers report a general slowing of the rise in prices. 
Concrete and lumber are down. Over 70 percent of Chicago area firms 
reported paying higher prices in April, compared to 90 percent a 
year ago, but none paid lower prices. All transportation costs are 
up sharply. Utilities insist that large boosts are needed to prevent 
insolvency. Overall there has been no improvement in inflationary 
psychology.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for workers continues slow throughout the 
district. Help-wanted ads in Chicago papers are about one-third 
below last year. A number of permanent plant closings involving farm 
and construction equipment, motor vehicles, oil refining, and meat 
packing have been announced in the past two months. Hirings by state 
and local governments are curtailed by budget constraints. Many 
business firms are pushing wage cost reduction programs. These 
efforts are complicated by pressure to meet EEO quotas. Attempts to 
get unions to accept concessions are seldom successful.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Large national general merchandise retailers 
headquartered in the district reported increases in sales averaging 
20 percent over last year in April. This was the best showing in 
years, and was surprising to merchants who had noted some 
improvement in March. Part of the surge is attributed to depressed 
sales of homes and motor vehicles, and to reduced vacation travel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Capital spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for capital goods is generally 
disappointing. Foreign orders are up, however. Machine tool orders 
are off by one-third and cancellations are up sharply. Demand for 
heavy trucks and trailers, freight cars, mining equipment, and 
construction equipment is weak. Farm equipment is mixed. The oil and 
gas development sector is very vigorous, but the district has only a 
limited participation. Utilities are slowing capital expenditure 
programs, partly because of financial problems, and partly because 
of reduced estimates of demand. The auto industry is postponing 
major projects because of inadequate sales and reduced cash flow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State and local government
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial stringencies on state and 
local governments are worse than at any time since the 1930s. 
Officials in all five states have commented that programs are being 
constrained by shortages of funds caused by shortfalls in revenues 
and reduced federal grants. Medical care costs are up. Wisconsin, 
which had led other district states in economic performance, has 
been hurt by layoffs in capital goods, motor vehicles and 
recreational products. Its governor recently said the state was in a 
"deepening depression." The Chicago area has been warned of a 
possible shutdown of its vital rapid transit service.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Motor vehicles
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Auto assemblies in the second quarter will be about 
20 percent above last year, following a decline in the first 
quarter. Long model change-over periods at some plants to convert to 
Front Wheel Drive cars and will hold output at last year's level in 
the third quarter. Sales dropped off sharply in late March and April 
after the rebates were withdrawn. Sales of heavy trucks dropped back 
in the first quarter instead of increasing as expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Steel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for steel from Chicago area mills has been strong, 
partly because of inventory building. A leading firm is operating at 
effective capacity and expects this to continue into the third 
quarter. Detroit mills, heavily dependent on autos, are operating at 
lower rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Improvement in home sales noted in March was wiped out in 
April and May as credit tightened. Some lenders are quoting mortgage 
rates as high as 171/4 percent, but with few takers. Some S&amp;Ls; are 
not making any new commitments, probably an unprecedented situation 
at this time of year. Many sales involve loan assumptions or seller 
subsidies. There is no evidence that recent easing of regulations in 
VRMs is having a significant effect. There are reports of cuts in 
asking prices for new and used homes, but there is no reliable 
quantification.
     </p>
     <p>
      Non-residential construction. Growing deficits have caused state and 
local bodies to cut back on bridge and highway work and other public 
facilities. A major boom in office buildings is in progress in 
Chicago's downtown area, but some analysts believe the wave is "over 
the top."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District farmland prices rose two percent in the first 
quarter according to our survey, but only half as fast as in the 
second half of 1980. Liquidity at district agricultural banks is 
ample, but loan demand is held back by high interest rates, low farm 
earnings, and by use of non-bank lenders. Recent rains have ended 
drought fears, but have slowed field work which had been ahead of 
schedule. The outlook for good crops is still favorable. Hope for 
high grain prices have been dimmed by smaller than expected exports 
and large harvests abroad. Both cattle and hog farmers report that 
selling prices remain below costs of production. Overall, these 
developments have caused analysts to reduce estimates of the extent 
of the rebound in farm income this year.
