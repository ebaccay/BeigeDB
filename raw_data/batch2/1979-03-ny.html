      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 14, 1979
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        <p>
         Business activity in the Second District continued to expand 
moderately in February and early March, according to recent comments 
of Directors and other business leaders. Consumer spending remained 
fairly strong; inventory levels appear to be well balanced, or even 
a bit low, relative to sales; and capital spending continued to 
advance. While supplies of most intermediate and basic materials 
appear ample, there are growing reports of minor shortages in 
certain product lines. In the face of these shortages and higher 
energy prices, there is widespread apprehension over the worsening 
price outlook. On the financial front, there is evidence that 
liquidity pressures are building for some small- and medium-sized 
firms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Retail sales in the Second District are continuing to grow, although 
many retailers noted that the rate of growth is difficult to 
interpret since the year-over-year comparisons of retail sales have 
been distorted by unusual weather in the past two years. On balance, 
sales gains were characterized as "generally good," although results 
varied with individual retailers. Merchants are optimistic about the 
near-term outlook, expecting consumption spending to hold up and the 
New York region to outperform the rest of the east. For most firms, 
inventories appear to be well aligned with sales. Several large 
retail chain stores, however, reported that their inventories were 
higher than they had intended. As a result of the fairly strong 
performance of retail sales during the first week of March, these
merchants feel confident that they will have no trouble in running 
down any excessive stocks. Consumer spending on automobiles in the 
last month or so remained strong with new car dealers reporting a 
marked pickup in their sales. One dealer noted heightened interest 
by buyers in fuel-efficient models.
        </p>
        <p>
         Outside of retailing, business activity is continuing to move along 
at a strong pace. New orders are brisk, capital spending is healthy, 
and inventories are reportedly well under control or indeed low 
relative to shipment levels. One Director of the Buffalo branch 
reported business has been so strong for paper products that it was 
not feasible to build inventory stocks. Prospects for the Buffalo 
area appear to be brightening, with a general step-up in planned 
capital spending. The start of construction of a light rail rapid 
transit in Buffalo is expected to further bolster local business 
activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although no critical bottlenecks have surfaced, reports of shortages 
of various kinds appear to be multiplying. The recent runups in the 
prices of some raw and intermediate materials and minor delivery 
delays suggest to some observers that certain industries are nearing 
capacity. The Buffalo Directors reported minor shortages of certain 
office equipment and auto parts. Several of the head office 
Directors noted there were some minor delays in procuring supplies 
and materials. One Director noted that brass is now being allocated 
and that shipments are eight weeks behind schedule. Among the 
shortages of building materials that were noted were sheet rock, 
cement and lumber. Another Director indicated difficulties in 
obtaining replacement parts for heavy equipment and special orders.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the price front, respondents were concerned over the worsening 
inflation outlook. Several respondents noted that shortages of some 
products had led to rather marked price increases in these items. At 
the same time, there was skepticism over the usefulness of the price 
guidelines. Some respondents felt that the controls had boosted the 
inflation rate as businesses anticipated the imposition of mandatory 
controls in the future. Several respondents noted some manufacturers 
appear to be passing along increases in their costs as fast as 
possible, probably in part due to their fears of future controls. 
Some firms are also reportedly imposing "surcharges" to cover the 
rapid increases in the cost of certain scarce materials such as 
molybdenum and chrome. Thus, after a producer sets an average unit 
price within the guidelines, further price increases are added on 
parts to cover higher costs. Most of the Directors who were 
contacted reported that industrial material price increases had 
either taken place or were in the process of accelerating. In their 
view, many of these increases were energy-cost related. While there 
was little anxiety over shortages of fuel oil, several respondents 
were very concerned about possible fuel cost increases.
        </p>
        <p>
         With respect to financial conditions, the Buffalo Directors noted 
that liquidity appears to be a growing problem for small- and 
medium-sized firms. It is apparently becoming increasingly difficult 
for these smaller businesses to collect their accounts receivable. 
Bankers reported that loan demand remains robust.
