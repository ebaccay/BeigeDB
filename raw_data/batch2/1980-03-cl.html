      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 11, 1980
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Fourth District continues to show strength, 
although accelerated inflation and higher interest rates have caused 
some respondents to lower their forecasts of GNP for 1980. Consumer 
spending continues to expand, and most respondents expect only a 
gradual rise in the savings rate. The steel industry is experiencing 
a rebound in orders because customer attitudes about inventories 
have apparently been revised upward. Consumer loans are showing 
signs of slowing because of higher interest rates, C&amp;I loans 
remain strong, especially among larger banks. Several S&amp;Ls report a 
sharp decline in mortgage lending and few expect any improvement in 
the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists who attended a Fourth District Economists Roundtable held 
at this bank on March 7 still expect a recession in 1980, but one 
that is more mild than they expected at a similar meeting last 
November. Of sixteen economists who attended the meeting, fifteen 
forecast a slight decline in real GNP this quarter and expected that 
the balance of the recession would get underway in the second 
quarter. The meeting forecast of this group shows a 0.2 percent 
annual rate of decline in real GNP in the first quarter, 2.8 percent 
decline in the second, 1.6 percent decline in the third, and a 
recovery of 0.5 percent and 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 
1980 and first quarter of 1981, respectively. Next quarter reduction 
in GNP is associated largely with a substantial reduction in the 
rate of growth in nominal consumer spending and another decline in 
residential construction. Skepticism over a mild recession scenario 
was expressed by some of the group who felt that high inflation and 
high interest rates may result in a more serious recession than 
indicated in immediate forecasts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some of the upward shift in expectations about the economy was 
associated with continued, though mixed, strength in consumer 
spending. Consumers have been cutting back usage of some goods in 
order to have money available for goods that are perceived to be a 
hedge against inflation or that are perceived as a bargain. A major 
producer of appliances reports a better than expected order pattern 
in recent weeks, after weakening in December. A producer of 
nondurables, however, has not experienced the increase in his 
business that was expected because of high inflation. An economist 
for a major department store chain expects a 10 percent increase in 
total goods sales (current dollars) in 1980, which is still below 
his expected inflation rate. An automotive economist reports that 
consumers are taking advantage of price discounting on 1979 models, 
but sales of 1980 models have been adversely affected. Although most 
respondents expect the personal savings rate to remain low in the 
near term, they also expect a gradual pickup to about a 4.5 percent 
rate by year-end. Demographic changes and inflation psychology are 
the most often given explanation for the low rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reflecting the changes in expectations, new orders and shipments in 
the steel industry have shown unexpected strength since the 
beginning of the year. As a result, some recalls of workers have 
taken place. According to one steel economist, many customers had 
cut orders more than necessary at the end of 1979. Most of the cuts 
came from steel service centers in attempts to liquidate inventory. 
Now, however, steel inventories are judged low and some customers 
have begun to rebuild stock. A steel official reports a 50 percent 
increase in bookings during January and February, but attributes 
some of that strength to hedging against an April price increase for 
flat-long steel. The capacity utilization rate in the industry is 
currently about 83 percent of capacity, but new orders, according to 
a steel economist, are equivalent to a 90 percent rate. However, 
some steel officials expect customers to be under pressure to cut 
inventories because of the high cost of financing inventories and 
because the availability of steel is no longer a serious concern.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer loans have softened. One District banker reports 
installment loans have been reduced because credit terms have 
tightened. Although demand remains strong, loans are only being made 
to better customers who meet stringent requirements, including 
higher down payments. One bank official reports that interest rates 
on auto loans have been boosted to 17 percent, which is expected to 
dry up consumer loans and to affect auto dealers who cannot sell to 
commercial buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Larger banks generally expect increased demand for C and I loans, 
while smaller banks report C and I loans to be relatively slack. One 
bank official reports that firms are cutting back on equipment 
spending and some firms postponed debt offerings. Some banks exposit 
nervousness among borrowers about credit availability, but they've 
discouraged requests for increased lines of credit. One bank 
economist reports increased inquiries by utilities and expects 
higher loan volumes in the near future. Large firms can still pay 
higher interest rates and strong loan demand is expected for several 
months, partly because of inventory demand, hedging against further 
increases, and a surge in acquisition loans. On the other hand, some 
small businesses are cutting back because of higher interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage lending weakened substantially in February and several S&amp;Ls 
are reported to have withdrawn from the market in recent weeks. 
Mortgage rates vary from 14 1/2 percent to 16 percent, plus two 
points or so. One S&amp;L official states that current mortgage rates 
and credit conditions disqualify many potential buyers. A respondent 
reported a 50 percent decline in loans and a 60 percent decline in 
commitments in February from a year earlier, and expects March to be 
even worse. A supplier to the residential construction industry 
confirms that a collapse in orders has occurred. Housing, according 
to an S&amp;L economist, will continue to weaken in 1980 until interest 
rates decline. Although prolonged high interest rates are encouraged 
through S&amp;Ls, several official expressed concern that credit 
controls could accelerate disintermediation. Since 35 percent of all 
certificates mature in July, interest rates must decline by then to 
prevent a total collapse of the mortgage market, according to one 
S&amp;L official.
