     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 23, 1983
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Additional signs of an upturn in the Second District economy have 
appeared in recent weeks. Retail sales continued to exceed year-ago 
levels in February and showed signs of further strengthening in 
early March. Lower mortgage rates stimulated a decided pickup in the 
residential real estate market and builders anticipate a moderate 
recovery this spring. In the nonresidential sector, the pattern was 
mixed: leasing of office space grew in some areas but remained low 
in others. In manufacturing, rising orders spurred some firms to 
expand production, although many industries have not seen any 
improvement so far. Business leaders have become more confident that 
the recovery is getting underway but are unsure how quickly it will 
gain momentum.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      During February, retail activity continued to equal or surpass year-ago levels. Heavy promotional activity continued and helped recoup 
the sales lost during a blizzard early in the month. Two of our 
contacts reported that sales improved further in early March. 
Consumer electronics and soft goods such as apparel moved well. Big-ticket items remained weak overall. However, one respondent noted 
strength in home furniture and others observed increases in 
installment sales. Inventories were generally at planned levels, and 
one department store had raised its desired stocks in anticipation 
of future sales growth. Other merchants also were hopeful that sales 
would strengthen further during the spring, but some expressed 
concern that renewed consumer caution would limit any gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A decided pickup in the housing market occurred in recent weeks. 
Spurred by lower mortgage rates and a widespread concern that rates 
could rise again, potential homebuyers were out looking in sizable 
numbers. Thus far, however, there has been only a modest increase in 
sales of new and existing homes. Residential construction activity 
appeared to be heading up also. In Manhattan plans for two large 
luxury apartment buildings were announced and several other sites 
have been cleared for construction. In suburban areas builders and 
suppliers were reported to be very busy. Respondents anticipate 
further improvement through the spring but they noted that higher
 
lumber costs could push home prices up.
     </p>
     <p>
      The nonresidential real estate sector continued to strengthen in 
much of the District. A noticeable improvement occurred in the 
Manhattan office market where several major leasing deals were 
signed in the midtown area. While no major construction projects 
have been started in New York City since the last Redbook, 
construction on projects begun earlier remained strong and plans for 
another large office building were announced. In suburban areas, 
however, activity was mixed. The office markets in Long Island and 
Connecticut were soft while inquiries for space rose significantly 
in New Jersey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from business leaders around the District reinforced the 
view that manufacturing activity is beginning to turn up. A variety 
of firms experienced increased orders, and with inventories very 
low, this renewed business led to sizable backlogs in some cases. 
Companies ranging from electronics producers to suppliers of auto 
components expanded production. Some plants lengthened their 
workweeks, even to the point of adding overtime. Employment finally 
stabilized, with recalls and new hiring at some plants sufficient to 
offset the workforce cuts still occurring at others. Nonetheless, 
our contacts emphasized that many industries have not yet benefited 
from any pickup. Manufacturers of chemicals and capital equipment,
for example, were noted still to be operating at very low levels, 
and our respondents believed it would be some time before any 
improvement spread to these industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business leaders are becoming increasingly confident that a recovery 
is getting underway. Their main concern now is that the initial 
upswing may be too gradual to generate momentum for the longer run 
because manufacturers are reluctant to expand until they are sure 
the recovery is sustainable. Our contacts expect many firms to wait 
for a substantial accumulation of orders before committing 
themselves to rehiring workers, rebuilding inventories, or investing 
in new equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Panel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This month we have comments from Donald Riefler (Morgan Guaranty 
Trust), Francis Schott (Equitable Life Assurance Society), and 
Robert Stone (Irving Trust): Their views of course are personal, not 
institutional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Riefler: The recent firming of interest rates is a normal reaction 
to the improving economy. However, the resurrection of M-l as a 
policy concern has raised the level of uncertainty in the market 
about the future direction and level of interest rates. In view of 
the unusual relationship of M-l to GNP in the last 12 to 18 months 
and the virtual impossibility of predicting with any certainty the 
impact of "Super Now Accounts" on M-l, the de-emphasis of this 
aggregate as a policy guide should be reiterated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schott: There has been a major easing of cash flow at thrifts and 
life insurance companies. Funds for medium-term bonds and mortgages 
are readily available. Lenders are still extremely reluctant to make 
long-term fixed-rate commitments. A clash between Federal deficit 
financing needs and rising private credit demand is foreseen, 
perhaps by early or mid-1984. It is feared that either inflation 
will return or else interest rates escalate again. An attack on the 
structural part of the Federal deficit appears to be the only way to 
assure a steady supply of long-term funds for private capital 
formation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stone: Whatever it is the Fed has been doing, it ought to continue 
to do it. No reduction in the discount rate seems warranted since 
recovery is getting under way without it and since given the concern 
that some people have over the aggregates, the reaction could turn 
out to be perverse. My own view of the aggregates is that their 
significance is still not sufficiently clear to warrant taking any 
action to rein them in at a time when the recovery is still in its 
early stages. Should the pace of recovery accelerate, and should 
aggregate growth remain high, the Fed may at some point have to take 
action that would lead to higher interest rates. But it would be 
very premature to do that now. Hence I repeat the opening sentence: 
whatever the Fed has been doing, it ought to continue to do it.
