      Reports from Sixth District contacts suggested that business activity continued to expand through mid-February.   Merchants' sales, with the exception of auto dealers, met or exceeded expectations and the near term outlook was upbeat.   Residential housing markets remained generally strong, and commercial real estate markets began to pickup slightly from low levels.   Factory activity was increasing in the District, and transportation contacts reported improving business.   The District's tourism sector continued to outperform last year, aided in part by the weaker dollar.   Banking industry contacts noted a steady flow of deposits, but subdued business investment activity.   Reports indicated that hiring had picked up in some fields, including manufacturing, but many firms continued to rely extensively on flexible staffing options.   Price increases were generally restrained except for certain commodities such as lumber, fuel, and steel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Strong January retail sales moderated slightly in early February 
              but remained positive relative to last year. Women's apparel, jewelry 
              and home-related products were noted as strong sellers. Most retailers 
              anticipate that sales over the next few months will continue to 
              increase modestly compared with last year. Retail inventories were 
              mostly described as balanced. Regional car sales were mediocre in 
              January and early February. Sales of domestic models fell behind 
              year-ago levels, and sales of foreign models slowed considerably 
              from the strong pace set in late 2003.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to Realtor contacts, home sales in the sixth District 
              during January and early February were similar to last year's levels, 
              whereas builders reported that new home construction was up modestly 
              compared with last year. Both sales and construction were expected 
              to increase during the first quarter. Inventories were viewed as 
              being balanced in most markets, and low in parts of Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      There was some evidence that commercial real estate markets in 
              the region have stabilized. Vacancy rates have declined from recent 
              peaks in many markets; net absorption has been positive; and there 
              are continued reports of small improvements in leasing activity. 
              While still at low levels, development activity has reportedly picked 
              up slightly as well, particularly the construction of institutional 
              facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to improve in many industries during 
              January and early February. Suppliers to the District's auto industry 
              were increasing staffing levels. Lumber mills in Alabama, Georgia, 
              and Florida reported strong markets and a paper mill was shipping 
              samples to new overseas markets. Major new defense contracts added 
              jobs in Alabama and Florida. A manufacturer of capital goods for 
              factories worldwide increased payrolls. A high-tech manufacturer 
              noted a longer factory workweek and an upbeat near term outlook. 
              Less positively, additional closings of textile plants were announced.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District's tourism and hospitality sector were positive. 
              In south Florida, the tourist industry experienced a strong season, 
              driven primarily by unusually cold weather up north and a weaker 
              dollar. Hotel occupancies there remained strong, and some restaurants 
              reported record business. Advance bookings from Canada and Europe 
              were up along Florida's Gulf Coast, and the gaming industry continued 
              to expand along Mississippi's Gulf Coast. Reversing the trend over 
              the last two years, bookings at some Atlanta hotels increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responses from the financial sector were mixed. Deposit flows remained 
              steady in January and consumer delinquencies were down from last 
              year. However, business loan and venture capital investment activity 
              continued to be restrained. Demand for commercial loans was described 
              as flat, and businesses continued to approach major capital expenditures 
              very cautiously. Some mortgage bankers noted a decline in new loan 
              applications. Merger activity picked up within the District's banking 
              industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional truckers across the District reported generally improved 
              business conditions in January and early February, following on 
              the robust performance in late 2003. However, a few contacts noted 
              that higher diesel prices had reduced profit margins for trucking 
              companies. Airborne traffic recovered somewhat in Atlanta and Miami 
              for both domestic and international shipments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reports indicated that hiring was picking up in early February. 
              Some hiring involved recalls of previously laid off workers, but 
              many firms were relying more on temps or contract employees. In 
              Louisiana and Florida, layoffs in the banking industry, following 
              recent bank mergers, were reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although most contacts indicated that competitive pressures continued 
              to restrain prices, a few reports noted price increases for lumber, 
              steel, fuel, and raw materials used in steel and petrochemical production. 
              New regulations limiting truck drivers' hours were said to have 
              caused freight costs to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts from citrus and sugar industries expressed concern about 
              global over-production this year, and resulting weak market conditions. 
              The District's large poultry industry will be impacted by export 
              bans related to avian influenza. However, District shipments to 
              Russia, the region's largest export market, were currently unaffected.
