      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       General Business Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Restrained in part by a generally sluggish manufacturing sector, the 
District economy continues to follow a path of moderate expansion. 
Construction activity appears strong for the season, perhaps a 
reflection of mild temperatures. Elsewhere, District conditions 
remain nearly the same as in the previous few reports.
     </p>
     <p>
      Low rates of unemployment, among other employment indicators, 
suggest that District labor markets continue to be somewhat tight. 
Labor shortages are being reported in many areas and job categories, 
including construction workers, nurses, engineers, and some business 
service occupations. At a recent meeting of District small 
businesses, several employers noted difficulty in retaining skilled 
workers and indicated that training costs were increasing as workers 
moved into more skilled job classifications. These costs are seen as 
a large and growing component of noncompensation labor costs in the 
region. Employers note that the migration of workers into skilled 
positions is pushing up wages for unskilled workers, who are 
reportedly in short supply in many parts of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing has been slow in the District, especially in 
September. A Cleveland source states that very little growth 
occurred last quarter, purchase orders are down, and capital 
spending for major projects is being deferred until a later date. 
However, in a view that is more representative of most responses, a 
Cincinnati manufacturer reports that although orders growth has 
fallen from the pace of the previous six months, production levels 
remain relatively high. Much of the moderation in manufacturing 
activity has come from a softening in domestic business, while 
export orders are continuing to strengthen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel prices are still roughly 5 to 15 percent above last year, but 
have been falling in recent months. Material costs for construction 
have remained relatively high compared to two years ago, especially 
in southwestern Ohio. Prices for paper and some chemicals are also 
reported to be moving sharply higher. However, earlier reports of 
rising materials costs have dissipated, and in many cases, prices 
have begun to come down recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing employment is holding about even with the second 
quarter, although hours have come down and many manufacturers have 
eliminated overtime. Project managers, supervisors, engineers, and 
other skilled workers are reported to be migrating from western 
Pennsylvania to Ohio, where labor market conditions are considerably 
stronger. A report from Dayton indicates difficulty in finding civil 
engineers and other skilled workers such as machinists and some 
construction workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the District have been disappointing this season, 
showing little improvement following a slow start. Home improvement 
goods, women's apparel, toys, sporting goods, and certain domestic 
items have been selling weakly, only partially offsetting an 
increase in sales of computers, home theater systems, and infant 
clothing. Some retailers attribute poor sales to the warm weather 
that has persisted into the beginning of autumn. In any event, 
inventories are generally characterized as heavy as retailers head 
into the holiday shopping period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents continue to report pressure to hold prices down, and 
margins are still being squeezed by rising costs, especially for 
labor. As companies prepare to hire temporary workers for the 
holiday season, there is a strong demand for qualified workers in 
southwest and northeast Ohio. Cincinnati has many unfilled jobs in 
the retail sector. One large retailer in northeast Ohio says that 
hiring difficulties have been partially accommodated with more 
flexible work schedules.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales across the Fourth District were mixed in September. Dealers in 
northern Ohio reported better results than their counterparts 
elsewhere in the District. Compared to last September, most dealers 
reported stronger sales. Overall, inventories are currently at 
desired levels across the district. Dealers in the Fourth District 
have not been significantly affected by a limited trucking strike, 
although the arrival of domestically produced vehicles at 
dealerships has been somewhat slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases on 1996 models have varied from above 5 percent to 
less than 1 percent, although most have been around 3 percent. 
Dealers report that higher interest rates are having little negative 
effect on sales. Although dealers are optimistic that sales will 
pick up further this quarter, several expressed concern that we are 
nearing the end of what has historically been the strongest sales 
period for a new model year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit demand remains strong and generally growing, although some 
slowing in both consumer and commercial credit growth has been 
observed. Commercial credit growth remains the stronger of the two 
credit categories, however, much of which appears to be targeted for 
business expansion. Mortgage credit demand continues to be mixed by 
area. Loan delinquency rates are still reported to be quite low. 
Several sources have seen a falloff in deposit growth recently, and 
a move to shorter maturities was noted.
