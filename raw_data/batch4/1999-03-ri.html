      Fifth District economic activity continued to advance at a healthy 
pace during the past two months. Retailers reported robust sales and 
brisk shopper traffic but services providers gave mixed reports. 
In manufacturing, shipments rose modestly and producers expressed 
more optimism regarding future business prospects. Real estate 
activity in the District continued upbeat, despite a somewhat slower 
pace of expansion in commercial activity in some areas. Loan demand 
remained generally strong across the District. Mild weather in 
January and February helped District crops and boosted tourist 
activity at coastal resorts but reduced patronage at ski resorts. 
Labor markets tightened, although wage increases remained moderate. 
Prices changed little in manufacturing and rose only slightly in the 
services sector.
      <p>
       <b>
        Retail
       </b>
       <br/>
       Warm weather and unusually large post-holiday price discounts 
sparked a sharp rise in retail sales in recent weeks. Shopper 
traffic was particularly brisk in February and sales of big-ticket 
items picked up. Furniture sales were notably strong, benefiting 
from a robust housing market. One Northern Virginia furniture 
retailer commented that "almost all of our sales have been to people 
who just closed on a new house." Sales of winter apparel, however, 
remained lackluster. A department store manager in Charleston, W.V., 
complained that it had been "too warm; we weren't able to sell 
winter goods at any price!" Inventories rose as apparel retailers 
ordered larger-than-normal shipments of spring lines, signaling 
their optimism regarding sales in upcoming months. Despite their 
expectations of strong demand, retailers continued to say that they 
had no pricing power; many reported trimming workforces in an effort 
to control costs and hold the line on prices.
       <p>
        <b>
         Services
        </b>
        <br/>
        Services sector activity has been mixed across industries since the 
beginning of the year. Electric and gas utilities reported declining 
revenues because of unseasonably mild weather. Business services and 
hotels, however, enjoyed substantial revenue growth. A hotelier in 
Baltimore, Md., attributed higher revenues to increased automobile 
and air travel. Employment in the services sector fell in recent 
weeks and wage pressures declined, but prices were little changed. 
Services providers remained optimistic about the demand for their 
services in coming months.
        <p>
         <b>
          Manufacturing
         </b>
         <br/>
         District manufacturing activity strengthened since our last report. 
New orders and order backlogs grew more quickly in February and 
capacity utilization rates rose for the first time since October. 
Manufacturers reported increased shipments, particularly of lumber, 
furniture, paper, and food. A North Carolina furniture producer told 
us that he expected strong furniture sales to continue this year 
because housing starts remained buoyant and unemployment remained 
low. Manufacturing employment in the District was little changed in 
January and February despite increased layoffs in the textile 
industry. Producers reported a pickup in wage growth, but indicated 
that their prices remained flat. Looking forward, most manufacturers 
were more optimistic regarding the growth of shipments and new 
orders during the next six months.
         <p>
          <b>
           Finance
          </b>
          <br/>
          District loan officers reported generally steady lending activity since our last Beige Book. Solid growth in business activity generated brisk demand for commercial loans. Commercial lending remained competitive; a banker in Virginia said that he had to be 
"proactive" just to avoid losing his existing customers to an ever-growing number of rivals. Residential mortgage lending remained strong in January although the pace slackened somewhat in recent weeks as mortgage rates moved higher. A lender in Greenville, S.C., noted that higher mortgage rates made it more difficult for first-time homebuyers to qualify for loans. He speculated that further increases in mortgage rates could appreciably reduce loan demand.
          <p>
           <b>
            Real Estate
           </b>
           <br/>
           Residential real estate activity expanded at a healthy clip in 
January and February. Realtors told us that homes in all price 
ranges were moving quickly and that a "seller's market" remained 
intact. Home sellers were said to be "getting their asking prices" 
in most areas, especially in Maryland, where multiple offers on 
properties were common. A realtor in Richmond, Va., remarked that 
the pace of house sales was "as fast as a race car." In some areas, 
strong demand for housing contributed to shortages of labor and 
building materials--particularly of drywall and insulation. Recent 
increases in mortgage rates have had both positive and negative 
impacts on residential real estate activity. A West Virginia realtor 
told us that some of her clients were getting nervous about rates 
going up and were trying to get in "under the wire," implying that 
higher rates may have stimulated activity there. On the other hand, 
a Charlotte, N.C., contact said that mortgage rate increases had 
caused "some weakness" in entry-level home sales in his area.
           <p>
            Commercial real estate activity also remained strong in recent 
weeks, although the pace of growth slowed somewhat outside of the 
Carolinas. A Washington, D.C., realtor said that people were simply 
"running out of steam" in his area. In contrast, activity in the 
Carolinas remained robust; one North Carolina agent likened the 
market there to a "runaway freight train." Competition for 
commercial space in the Carolinas has intensified in recent weeks. A 
Raleigh, N.C., realtor said that tenants were willing to pay 
additional "fees" in return for priority access to available retail 
space. According to a contact in Columbia, S.C., small tenants in 
that area were being "forced out of buildings" once their 
leases expired to make room for expansion by larger, more 
established tenants.
            <p>
             <b>
              Tourism
             </b>
             <br/>
             Unseasonably mild weather in recent weeks had mixed impacts on 
District tourist activity. Tourism in coastal areas benefited; one 
hotelier on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, for example, reported 
that her resort was "booked to capacity" during Valentine's Day 
weekend. She also said several restaurants that normally close for 
the winter and reopen around Easter had opened early this year 
because of strong tourist traffic. Mild weather, however, 
contributed to lower revenues at several area ski resorts this 
winter. A contact at a Virginia resort that offers both ski and golf 
facilities noted that higher revenue from golfing had helped offset 
sharply lower revenues from skiing.
             <p>
              <b>
               Temporary Employment
              </b>
              <br/>
              The demand for temporary workers picked up since our last report, 
exerting additional strains on the District's already taut labor 
markets. Most contacts at employment agencies told us that employers 
continued to complain about the shortage of workers, but so far, 
relatively few were offering substantially higher wages to attract 
employees. A greater number of agents, however, now say that they 
expect wages to rise at a quicker pace in coming months. A recruiter 
in Charlotte, N.C., remarked that employers will almost certainly 
need to raise wages if labor markets get any tighter. In his words, 
"the dam can only hold back the water for so much longer."
              <p>
               <b>
                Agriculture
               </b>
               <br/>
               Above-normal temperatures generally benefited District farming 
activity. Warm weather helped small grain crops, which were reported 
to be unusually mature this year. Mild weather conditions also 
boosted winter pastures, reducing the demand for feed supplies by 
livestock producers. Due to the warmer weather, however, fruit trees 
in some areas showed signs of early budding, increasing the risk of 
spring frost damage to the District's peach and apple crops.
