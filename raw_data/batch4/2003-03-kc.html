      <p>
       The Tenth District economy showed some signs of strengthening in late January 

  and February, despite widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers. 

  Retail sales posted slight gains, manufacturing activity improved, and energy 

  activity picked up. In addition, residential real estate activity continued 

  at a strong pace. On the negative side, auto sales were weak and commercial 

  real estate remained in a slump. In the farm economy, many ranchers and farmers 

  continued to suffer from the effects of drought. Wage and price pressures remained 

  largely subdued across the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales in the District improved slightly in late January and February 

  after a sluggish holiday season. Sales were above year-ago levels at most stores 

  and flat or only slightly lower elsewhere. Many retailers attributed the recent 

  gains to heavy discounting. Among product categories, apparel and electronics 

  sold particularly well, while sales of some types of home furnishings were weak. 

  Most managers were optimistic about future activity after solid Valentine's 

  Day sales and expect some inventory building leading up to the Easter season. 

  Motor vehicle sales were flat after declining at the end of last year but were 

  only slightly below year-ago levels in most areas. Compared with contacts in 

  other industries, auto dealers appeared to be more adversely affected by uncertainty 

  over a possible war with Iraq. Still, most dealers expect solid sales by summer. 

  In the tourism industry, activity at Rocky Mountain ski resorts remained solid 

  after record numbers of visits during the holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity improved slightly in late January and February 

  after slipping in December. Production, shipments, and new orders at District 

  firms rose back above year-ago levels, and many firms reported small increases 

  in capacity utilization rates. However, new hiring and capital spending remained 

  weak, and inventories of raw materials fell. Firms appeared somewhat apprehensive 

  about activity in the immediate future, but their optimism about production 

  activity later in the year was quite high. Although manufacturing employment 

  is also expected to pick up by the summer, capital spending is not expected 

  to change much from current modest levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate activity in the District remained strong in late January 

  and February, although commercial real estate activity weakened further. Single-family 

  housing starts throughout much of the District rose from already high levels. 

  Most of this strengthening continued to be for lower priced homes, but there 

  were also reports of increased construction of midrange homes in some areas. 

  High-end home building, on the other hand, largely remained in a slump. Most 

  builders expect home construction to remain solid in coming months, although 

  builders in some drought-stricken areas were concerned about the effects of 

  new water restrictions on permit applications. Home sales across the District 

  were also solid, though reports were not as uniformly strong for housing starts. 

  In the months ahead, most realtors expect sales to continue at the recent pace. 

  Mortgage demand remained strong throughout much of the District, as refinancing 

  activity continued at high levels. Nearly all recent refinancings have been 

  used to reduce monthly payments-a contrast from previous surveys, when a sizable 

  portion of refinancing activity was for the purpose of taking out cash. Lenders 

  generally expect mortgage demand to stay solid and to possibly increase further 

  in the spring. Commercial real estate activity remained weak across the District, 

  with some markets experiencing even further deterioration. Office vacancy rates 

  rose again in Denver, and commercial construction activity fell in nearly all 

  markets. Absorption and prices of office space were down slightly in most areas, 

  and many landlords were offering rent concessions to keep or attract tenants. 

  Commercial realtors generally do not expect a turnaround in activity any time 

  soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Bankers report that loans and deposits both held steady since the last survey, 

  leaving loan-deposit ratios unchanged. Demand increased for home mortgage loans 

  but edged down for consumer loans. Demand for other loan categories was largely 

  unchanged. On the deposit side, small increases in NOW accounts and money market 

  deposit accounts were offset by a slight decline in large CDs. All respondent 

  banks left their prime lending rates unchanged since the last survey, and most 

  banks also held their consumer lending rates steady. Lending standards were 

  unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District energy activity expanded in late January and February in response to 

  the rise in energy prices that began in mid-December. The count of active oil 

  and gas drilling rigs in the region has risen more than 30 percent since the 

  beginning of the year and is now well above the previous peak reached last summer. 

  Some District contacts expect further increases in natural gas drilling in the 

  Rocky Mountains in coming months, as new pipelines to areas east and to California 

  open in the spring and summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Much of the District's farm economy continues to face drought conditions. The 

  region's winter wheat crop has deteriorated since the previous survey, and timely 

  rains will be needed to help develop the crop and renew pastures. Despite the 

  drought, supplies of forage and feedstuffs have been adequate, but ranchers 

  in some areas have been forced to pay a premium. Livestock prices have moved 

  higher in recent months, improving profitability in the industry. Overall, District 

  bankers report few significant problems with their farm loan portfolios. However, 

  some highly leveraged borrowers will need to carry over or restructure their 

  debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Wage and price pressures remained generally subdued across the District. Labor 

  markets were still very slack, with little evidence of rising wages. Managers 

  reported few problems finding workers, although some retailers and manufacturers 

  expressed difficulties retaining quality hourly employees. The pace of layoff 

  announcements continued to decline from recent peaks last fall. Some retail 

  prices eased due to post-holiday discounting, although jewelry prices edged 

  up due to recent increases in the price of gold. Retailers generally expect 

  little change in prices in the near future. Prices for construction materials 

  were basically flat, but some builders expect lumber and gypsum wallboard prices 

  to increase in coming months. Manufacturers continued to report rising prices 

  of petroleum-based products, and several firms also reported surcharges from 

  suppliers due to increased transportation and insurance costs. At the same time, 

  many manufacturers continued to have difficulties passing cost increases through 

  to customers.
