      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 18, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District grew moderately in late 
November and December. Areas experiencing growth included the 
service-producing sector, state revenues, and agriculture. Strong 
holiday sales boosted consumer spending. Port trends were mixed, and 
manufacturing and commercial real estate activity were flat. Loan 
demand, home sales, and tourist activity declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail associations and retail analysts contacted by telephone 
reported that Christmas sales increased between 8 percent and 12 
percent from last year's level and that after-Christmas sales were 
good. They also said that retailers offered fewer after-Christmas 
discounts than they did last year. Analysts' outlooks for early 1995 
sales were mixed. Those expecting weaker sales compared to 1994 
pointed to higher consumer debt levels, while those expecting 
stronger sales pointed to last year's unusually harsh weather that 
kept shoppers at home.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service-Producing Firms
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Preliminary results from a mail survey indicated that activity in 
the service-producing sector increased in December. Revenues rose, 
except in health services, where they decreased. Wages also rose, 
and employment changed little. Service producers indicated that 
prices rose 0.5 percent in December. They expected increased demand 
for their services and an increase of 1.3 percent in their prices 
during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of factory activity changed little in December from their 
November levels, according to preliminary results of a mail survey 
of District manufacturers. Raw materials inventories were up 
compared to six months ago, and respondents expected a further 
increase during the next six months. Manufacturers expected 
shipments and employment to increase during the next six months, but 
they anticipated little change in the workweek. Finished goods 
prices increased faster in December than in November, but at a rate 
less than the general inflation rate. Raw materials prices increased 
more in December than in November, and at a rate higher than the 
general inflation rate. In December, respondents expected prices to 
rise more during the next six months than they had in November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated that tourist activity generally decreased in 
December from November. December activity at ski resorts was below 
its year-ago level because of warmer weather, but bookings were up 
for the rest of the winter. Contacts expected better-than-normal 
business and slight price increases during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Telephone interviews with representatives at the District ports of 
Baltimore and Hampton Roads (Norfolk) indicated that import and 
export levels in November were higher than those of a year ago but 
were mixed compared to their levels in October. Charleston's 
representative, however, reported that the Charleston port 
experienced one of its busiest months ever. Representatives at 
Charleston and Baltimore expected imports and exports to increase 
during the next six months, but the representative at Hampton Roads 
expected both to decrease.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions contacted by telephone reported that 
loan demand continued to slow during late November and December. 
Consumer and commercial loan demand fell moderately, while mortgage 
loan demand declined slightly. Interest rates were higher on 
consumer, commercial, and mortgage loans. Many District lenders 
expressed concern that future interest rate increases might dampen 
loan demand. Most consumer and commercial lenders in North Carolina, 
however, were confident that loan demand would remain strong in that 
state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a telephone survey of District realtors and builders, 
residential real estate activity declined in December. District home 
sales decreased despite increased sales of lower-priced houses. 
Building permits, buyer traffic, and housing starts, however, were 
unchanged. Most real estate agents attributed the decline in home 
sales to increased mortgage interest rates. Home prices remained 
stable, although prices of nonlumber building materials rose 
slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported that commercial real estate activity in 
December grew at the same pace as in November. Real estate contacts 
reported little change in construction, except in West Virginia, 
where retail outlet building activity increased. Posted commercial 
rental rates increased throughout the District. Commercial vacancy 
rates remained steady except in North Carolina and Virginia, where 
they declined. Leasing agents reported that the availability of 
prime office space tightened, especially around Washington, D.C.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State government forecasters said that tax collections grew 
moderately in November and December. Real revenue growth was strong 
in Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, somewhat 
weak in South Carolina, and flat in the District of Columbia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions were better than a year ago, according to 
District farm analysts. Small grains were in good-to-excellent 
condition because temperatures were above normal in December and 
early January. Tobacco prices remained strong, and farmers' 1995 
production quotas rose because tobacco companies purchased farmers' 
excess stocks of tobacco. Hog and poultry output rose despite 
sharply lower hog prices and slightly lower poultry prices. One 
contact said long-term contracts insulated North Carolina hog 
producers against plunging prices on national markets.
