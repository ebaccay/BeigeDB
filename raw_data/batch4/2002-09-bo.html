      Beige Book Report: Boston

       September 11, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The New England economy 
                is moving sideways, on net, with some sectors level to down and 
                others up modestly. Manufacturers report flat revenues; retailers 
                and tourism contacts say business is slow. Commercial real estate 
                markets are depressed in the Boston area and flat elsewhere in 
                the region. Software and IT markets are still "tough." The outlook 
                remains uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most New England retail contacts report sales in the June-August 
                  period level or down from a year earlier. A high-end retailer 
                  with sales down 20 percent plans to close several stores in 
                  the next six to nine months. Tourism contacts continue to report 
                  declines in international and long-distance travelers. The number 
                  of business travelers in the Boston area was significantly lower 
                  than expected, resulting in one of its weakest summers in years. 
                  An upbeat report came from a surplus discount store with sales 
                  12 percent above last year's level; they expect to open three 
                  additional stores next quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail contacts are mostly holding headcounts 
                  level, although some are choosing not to fill open positions. 
                  Wages are generally steady, but one respondent implemented an 
                  increase of 3 percent. Vendor prices and selling prices are 
                  mostly flat. New England hotels, restaurants, and tourism companies 
                  continue to offer special pricing and package deals. Capital 
                  spending remains modest. Many respondents are being cautious, 
                  with some scaling back marketing expenses and one putting large-scale 
                  IT projects on hold indefinitely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, contacted retailers have low expectations 
                  for the remainder of the year. Many hope the upcoming months 
                  will be profitable, but few anticipate growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District manufacturing contacts report that business conditions 
                  have been difficult in the third quarter, with revenues largely 
                  flat from a year earlier. Manufacturers of consumer goods and 
                  nondurable business products tend to indicate that sales were 
                  disappointing in the July-August period, compared to trends 
                  earlier in the year or to budgets. Manufacturers of commercial 
                  and industrial equipment saw only glimmers of improvement, at 
                  best, during these months; sales at firms making aircraft parts 
                  and equipment used in commercial construction remain on a downward 
                  trajectory. The only bright spots mentioned are residential 
                  appliances and military equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Selling prices and materials costs are mostly 
                  flat to down, and contacts report that they and their customers 
                  are bargaining for extended payment terms. Responding firms 
                  face ongoing sharp increases in insurance costs and recent increases 
                  for steel and plastics. Manufacturers raising their selling 
                  prices to cover rising costs say the increases have been less 
                  than desired because of competitive pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      The majority of manufacturers have reduced 
                  employment during the past year and expect to make only minor 
                  adjustments in headcounts during the remainder of 2002. Some 
                  companies lifted pay freezes or reversed reductions at midyear 
                  or have plans to do so in 2003. Where they are occurring, pay 
                  increases are typically 2 to 3 percent. Responding companies 
                  generally report that capital spending remains modest. Most 
                  seem reluctant to spend while the economy remains weak or uncertain. 
                  The only exceptionâ€”a company embarking on the largest initiative 
                  in its historyâ€”is doing so to save on labor inputs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts believe their sales will be 
                  fairly flat over the next six to 12 months and that they will 
                  face pressure on net income. A couple of capital goods producers 
                  indicate that conditions are unlikely to turn around before 
                  late 2003 or sometime in 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The staffing industry reports modest improvement. Cutbacks in 
                  hiring that occurred during the second quarter have subsided. 
                  Some contacts report slight growth in the third quarter, usually 
                  the strongest quarter in the year. Contacts in Boston and Hartford 
                  report signs of recovery after a long period of inactivity. 
                  Respondents in Vermont, where labor demand has been weakened 
                  by layoffs at IBM, continue to struggle. Certain occupations 
                  and industries display pulses of activity, including sub-assembly 
                  manufacturing, low- technology consumer goods manufacturing, 
                  health care, non-profits, customer service, and office and clerical. 
                  By contrast, professional sectors such as information technology, 
                  finance, law, and telecommunications remain in the doldrums. 
                  One positive sign is that assignment durations are lengthening, 
                  in some cases from a few days or weeks to indefinite.
     </p>
     <p>
      Temp industry profits are depressed as costs 
                  for workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, and wages 
                  move up while clients maintain downward pressure on bill rates. 
                  Both year-round and seasonal labor remain plentiful. Most contacts 
                  were overwhelmed with summer job inquiries from students but 
                  had few openings for them. Respondents are cautiously optimistic 
                  that business will pick up in the fourth quarter; they expect 
                  to inch rather than surge forward for the remainder of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate markets in New England remain sluggish. 
                  Contacts report very low activity levels throughout the region, 
                  with Greater Boston continuing to trail other major metro areas. 
                  Commercial markets outside of Boston are said to be steady; 
                  vacancy and rental rates have been flat. Boston-area contacts 
                  report virtually zero demand for additional rental space in 
                  either the city or the suburbs. They indicate that rental rates 
                  for available space have decreased 15 to 20 percent over the 
                  past year, to approximately half of their 2000 levels. Office 
                  vacancy rates in the Boston area continue to rise. In addition, 
                  companies occupy substantial unutilized space that is not included 
                  in the published rates. Respondents anticipate that vacancy 
                  rates will rise further in the near future when a number of 
                  large leases expire and unutilized and sub-leased space is returned 
                  to owners, possibly further depressing rents. At the same time, 
                  however, respondents report strong demand to purchase office 
                  and apartment buildings, which they suggest is spurred by low 
                  interest rates, volatile stock market conditions, and confidence 
                  that the space market will eventually recover.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate respondents do not 
                  anticipate any major changes during the next six months, provided 
                  there is no deterioration in overall economic conditions. Boston-area 
                  contacts do not see signs that the market will improve this 
                  year.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Software and Information Technology 
                  Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A majority of respondents in the IT and software sector report 
                  modest to average growth in sales and revenues over the summer 
                  months. By exception, companies producing health care systems 
                  and information software report revenue increases of 15 to 18 
                  percent compared to last year, but note that their performance 
                  reflects regulations coming into effect in 2003 (the Health 
                  Information Protection Act) that will drive hospitals to upgrade 
                  the security of their software systems. Contacts in the rest 
                  of the IT sector report sales growth of about 2 percent from 
                  year-earlier. One respondent, however, notes an unexpected sharp 
                  decline in sales in August after a very successful June and 
                  July.
      </p>
      <p>
       Producers of human resources software, custom 
                  applications development, and program development tools report 
                  either flat or 5 to 10 percent growth in employment. All cite 
                  significantly reduced turnover rates, with one company claiming 
                  one-quarter of the turnover in the past few years. None of the 
                  responding firms plan to cut back their capital budgets. While 
                  the contacted companies are generally gaining, their senior 
                  executives note that sales and profits of some competitors are 
                  down by as much as 20 to 50 percent. Thus, they believe the 
                  market for IT and software products is still "tough," with the 
                  rebound slower than expected. Most respondents express cautious 
                  optimism for growth in the next 12 months, but admit that their 
                  outlook has either remained unchanged or been revised down since 
                  May.
