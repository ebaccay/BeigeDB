      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District remained at 
relatively high levels in recent weeks, although a few pockets of 
slowing or declining activity existed. Retail sales growth increased 
slightly from earlier this year, but results varied by state. The 
District's housing activity picked up in March and April, with 
several contacts seeing buyers motivated by concern of possible 
further mortgage interest rate increases. With some exceptions, 
manufacturers were reporting increases in overall activity. Bank 
lending activity remained at high levels, and some banks even 
reported strong loan growth. Labor market shortages continued to be 
the main concern of businesses, despite softening demand for workers 
from the manufacturing sector. Grain prices increased sharply in 
recent weeks due to a combination of strong demand, both here and 
abroad, and weather-related problems which threaten to exacerbate 
already tight supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales improved slightly in March, with further 
sales increases reported through much of April. Several retailers 
stated that Midwest sales were above year-ago levels and slightly 
ahead of gains in other regions. However, unseasonably cold weather 
may have hindered sales growth of spring merchandise, particularly 
in Michigan. Several retailers were concerned that sales lost to 
poor weather may not be made up in coming months, although one 
retailer reported a seasonal buildup of inventory in anticipation of 
increasing sales in May and June. While a survey of small 
independent Michigan retailers showed that sales continued to be 
slow in March, most respondents were optimistic that pent-up demand 
will boost second quarter sales, especially when warm weather 
settles in. Several auto dealerships reported that sales over the 
last several weeks were somewhat sluggish for this time of year, 
mostly due to a reduction in fleet sales. However, dealers are 
expecting marked improvement in the months ahead and dealer 
confidence remains high. One regional distributor of foreign cars 
reported that their new- and used-car sales were doing very well and 
dealers were "screaming" for more stock.
     </p>
     Housing/Construction. Housing activity picked up more than 
seasonally in March and contacts reported that this pace continued 
through April. However, several sources surmised that the sharp 
increase in fixed-rate mortgage loan rates may have prompted 
indecisive buyers to take action. Existing home sales in the Midwest 
increased sharply in March to their highest level since April 1994. 
Contacts across the District reported that sales activity remained 
brisk in April, with one realtor adding that "if a home is sharp, 
it's gone in a day." New home sales in the Midwest posted modest 
gains in March and a national survey of builders suggested that the 
sales pace of new homes in April continued to exceed the nation's. 
Midwest builders were the most optimistic of any region in the 
country about prospective sales for the next six months. Commercial 
development remains slow, despite positive absorption rates and 
finning rents in both office and retail space. An industry analyst 
noted, however, that rental rates are not yet high enough to prompt 
much new commercial building activity in most downtown areas.
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity continued to expand 
at a moderate pace in March and early April, despite declines in 
some key industries. Recent purchasing managers' surveys from around 
the District were generally indicating flat-to-moderately increasing 
activity, including the survey from one major metropolitan area that 
had been signaling a contraction in overall activity in its two 
previous reports. Most durable-goods producers were upbeat, 
reporting recent orders or sales to be slightly stronger than they 
were expecting at the beginning of the year. Several pointed to 
exports as a key source of strength. A supplier of specialized 
equipment to the mining and paper industries reported strong demand 
for new equipment. machine tool producer reported a modest slowdown 
in demand for small- and medium-sized metal-cutting machines, but 
total demand was boosted by orders from the auto industry. A steel 
analyst stated that integrated mills supplying the auto and 
appliance industries had full order books through the second quarter 
and demand for structural steel continued to rise. Mills had been 
running behind on filling orders from the auto industry and were 
able to use the recent strike-related disruptions to catch up. Most 
producers reported that inventories were lean or, at worst, slightly 
above plan and would only increase, if necessary, to keep in line 
with any sales gains. However, some seasonal inventory building was 
taking place to prepare for summer plant closings. The pricing 
environment continues to be described as "tough." However, a March 
survey of businesses around the nation indicated that firms in the 
Midwest were more likely to be experiencing increases in prices paid 
and prices charged than in other regions.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few industries reported declining activity. A producer of heavy 
construction equipment experienced weaker-than-expected orders in 
recent months and reported that production had been cut to levels 
below the end of last year. An analyst for the heavy-duty truck 
industry reported rising dealer inventories and cuts in build plans, 
although the industry is postponing major adjustments until the 
summer shutdown period due to better-than-expected gross new orders. 
Auto assemblies in the District declined sharply in March due to a 
strike against a major automaker, but few businesses reported being 
impacted by the strike unless they were a direct supplier to the 
plants affected. Auto production bounced back in April as strike-
related plants reopened and efforts were made to recapture some of 
the lost production.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking Conditions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most bankers reported stronger-than-expected 
loan demand, with growth rates generally described as moderating 
from earlier months but still strong. Commercial and industrial 
lending was strongest among mid- and small-sized businesses, with 
one bank economist attributing some of the strength to recent merger 
and acquisition activity among local businesses. A large regional 
bank detected less pessimism among corporate borrowers than was 
prevalent at the beginning of the year, and one bank noted a decline 
in C&amp;I; loans for inventory financing. However, several banks noted 
some slowing in consumer lending. Every bank contacted reported that 
mortgage applications were down sharply in recent weeks, mostly for 
refinancing. Most banks viewed credit quality (excluding retailer 
loans) as remaining unchanged at very good levels, despite some 
increase in delinquency rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor markets
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Labor markets remained much tighter in the District 
than in the nation as a whole; with unemployment rates well below 
the national average. Temporary help agencies reported that a 
shortage of qualified workers in the technology and information 
industries persists throughout the District and demand for skilled 
clerical workers is very strong. The employment component of 
purchasing managers surveys in March and April were mixed, 
supporting other reports of a stagnant employment situation in the 
manufacturing sectors. However, several sources reported that there 
are signs, including increases in average weekly hours, that 
manufacturers will again be increasing employment soon. Most sources 
also indicate that there is very little upward pressure on wages.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Grain prices have soared recently, setting new highs in 
both the cash and futures markets. The latest surge reflects strong 
domestic and foreign demand for corn, as well as a realization that 
the winter wheat crop suffered extensive damage from weather related 
problems during the fall and winter months. Higher grain prices are 
a major concern for livestock producers, although the District's 
pork producers have fared reasonably well so far. In addition, some 
observers question whether the depleted grain stocks might result in 
pipeline disruptions to feed supplies prior to the new harvest crop. 
An extended period of high grain prices may trigger cuts in 
livestock production which would, in time, tighten supplies of meat, 
milk, and eggs. However, the high prices will likely add to the 
large increase already expected in spring crop plantings now 
underway in the Midwest. Increased grain prices are, in part, 
responsible for rising farmland values. Our latest survey showed 
that District farmland values increased by over 4 percent in the 
first quarter and are now 10 percent higher than a year ago.
