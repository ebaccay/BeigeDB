       Business conditions in the Third District improved slightly in September.  Manufacturers reported increases in orders and shipments for the month.  Retail sales of general merchandise in September were up slightly from August and from September a year ago.  Auto and light truck sales eased in September from August but were up somewhat on a year-over-year basis.  Bank lending has been rising, with advances in business, consumer, and residential mortgage lending.  Business at service firms has begun to show some improvement, although the gain has been slight.
       <p>
        The consensus forecast in the Third District business community is for slowly improving conditions.  Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments and orders during the next six months.  Most of the retailers surveyed in September expect sales in the fourth quarter of this year to exceed sales in the fourth quarter of last year, and some store executives have recently raised their forecasts.  Auto dealers anticipate steady sales.  Bankers expect continued slow growth in lending.  Service companies expect some growth, but in general they anticipate only slight gains in the next two quarters.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturers' shipments and orders increased in September compared 
                with August, continuing the upward trend that began in the summer. 
                Although around half of the firms polled in September indicated 
                that their shipments and orders were running at steady rates, 
                nearly a third reported gains. Order backlogs at area plants edged 
                up in September. Backlogs have been moving up slowly for the past 
                several months. Firms in most of the District's major manufacturing 
                industries reported increased demand for their products in September, 
                but producers of transportation equipment and apparel noted some 
                declines in orders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking ahead, manufacturers in the region expect 
                further improvement. More than two-thirds of the firms contacted 
                for this report expect increases in shipments and orders, and 
                virtually none expect decreases during the next six months. Around 
                one-third of the manufacturers surveyed in September have recently 
                increased planned production for the fourth quarter compared with 
                plans made earlier this year, and only one in ten have trimmed 
                production schedules for the quarter. More area manufacturers 
                plan to increase rather than reduce capital expenditures in the 
                next six months, but not by a large margin.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Third District retailers contacted for this report indicated that 
                sales in September were slightly above August levels and a bit 
                above the sales level posted in September of last year. Merchants 
                generally indicated that some easing in sales growth was expected 
                in September after income tax rebates and back to school demand 
                pushed up sales in August. There was a pickup in sales of fall 
                apparel and accessories during September, and sales of furniture 
                and home furnishings remained strong. With an apparently improving 
                trend of sales, stores have been able to limit discounting of 
                fall merchandise compared with the extensive markdowns they made 
                to clear out summer goods.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third District retailers expect sales in the 
                final quarter of this year to exceed the same period a year ago, 
                and some have recently raised their forecasts. Merchants believe 
                consumer confidence is building slowly and that shoppers will 
                begin to make purchases that they have been postponing. Nevertheless, 
                in a continuing effort to contain costs, many stores are limiting 
                their inventories and implementing measures to reduce order cycle 
                times.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto dealers reported an easing in the sales 
                rate in September after very strong August sales. Compared with 
                a year ago sales in September were up slightly. In general, dealers 
                indicated that inventories were at appropriate levels, but some 
                dealers said they still had 2003 models that they were trying 
                to clear out. Dealers expect sales to run at a roughly steady 
                rate during the rest of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Finance
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks was on the rise 
                in September. Banks reported modest increases in commercial and 
                industrial loans, with slightly higher loan demand from firms 
                in a fairly wide range of industries. Consumer credit also expanded, 
                for both personal loans of various kinds and credit card lending. 
                Besides the increase in personal loans booked during September, 
                some banks noted that they approved personal lines of credit during 
                the month that have not yet been fully utilized. Banks generally 
                reported continuing increases in overall residential real estate 
                lending, but most of those contacted for this report said refinancing 
                activity has slowed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankers in the District expect continued slow 
                growth in lending through the rest of the year. Some said growth 
                in business and personal loans could accelerate somewhat next 
                year if the pace of business activity in the region quickens. 
                Most of the lending officers surveyed in September expect lending 
                for home purchase mortgages to continue to increase in tandem 
                with any increase in home sales in the region, but they anticipate 
                further declines in refinancings. In general, bankers in the District 
                indicated that credit quality for both personal and business loans 
                has been steady, but some noted that debt service to income ratios 
                have risen for both individual and business borrowers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stock brokers and investment management companies 
                indicated that cash flows into most types of funds and financial 
                instruments were steady in September. Executives of the nondepository 
                financial firms contacted for this report said investors are still 
                concerned about fundamental economic conditions. They do not expect 
                investment activity to pick up significantly until employment 
                begins to move up consistently.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Service firms contacted in September generally reported steady 
                or slightly growing activity. Demand for general business services 
                has been edging up and the region's health services sector continues 
                to advance, but telecommunications activity remains nearly flat. 
                Several local service sector firms indicated they see the beginnings 
                of rising demand, although most of those surveyed expect growth 
                in the next two quarters to be slow. Some noted that their corporate 
                customers are still emphasizing cost-cutting, and are limiting 
                their use of outside services until overall business conditions 
                show more significant improvement.
