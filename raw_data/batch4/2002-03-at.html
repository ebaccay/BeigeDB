      Sixth District contacts reported improved 
              conditions in many sectors during January and early February, and 
              most noted cautious optimism regarding the near-term outlook. The 
              majority of retail contacts described sales as exceeding their expectations. 
              Automobile sales did fall from the robust pace of past months, but 
              inventory levels were mostly described as acceptable. Reports indicated 
              positive signs from the manufacturing sector as orders and inventories 
              were stabilizing. The defense industry, in particular, received 
              a significant boost in new orders. Residential real estate markets 
              maintained their strength, but contacts noted that weakness persisted 
              in the District's office and industrial markets. The improving trend 
              in the tourism and hospitality industry also continued, although 
              hotel occupancies remained below those of a year ago. Bank lending 
              activity was still sluggish, and remained supported primarily by 
              robust mortgage refinancing. Price pressures were subdued overall. 
              Several contacts noted rising health care, insurance, and security 
              costs.
      <p>
       <b>
        Consumer Spending
       </b>
       <br/>
       Reports from District retailers were upbeat in January. Most indicated 
              that sales were above year-ago levels. There was some softening 
              noted in early February, but most contacts indicated that recent 
              sales had met or exceeded expectations. Apparel and home-related 
              products were reported to have sold well. The majority of contacts 
              anticipated that sales would rise moderately in the first half of 
              the year compared with the same period last year. In contrast, District 
              automobile sales were weak during January and the first part of 
              February, as remaining incentive programs failed to significantly 
              boost sales. Despite the softer conditions, no major imbalances 
              were reported in automobile inventory levels.
       <p>
        <b>
         Real Estate and Construction
        </b>
        <br/>
        Low mortgage rates continued to support strength in the District's 
              single-family housing market, with contacts noting that the Florida 
              market remained particularly robust. Most reports indicated that 
              District home sales during January and early February were near 
              the previous year's level. Home construction was described as near 
              or slightly ahead of last year. Home inventories and new home construction 
              was seen as balanced, although several contacts noted that Florida's 
              housing inventory was low. Looking to the spring selling season, 
              most contacts were cautiously optimistic.
        <p>
         District commercial real estate markets remained 
              weak in January and early February. Office and industrial vacancy 
              rates continued to run at high levels and prices were under downward 
              pressure. The majority of new construction work is government-related 
              or small build-to-suit projects.
         <p>
          <b>
           Manufacturing
          </b>
          <br/>
          Reports on the District's manufacturing sector during January and 
              early February were mixed, but generally suggested improved conditions. 
              Alabama steel processors noted that conditions did not worsen in 
              January and several District paper mills and lumber manufacturers 
              reported maintaining employment levels. Orders for building products 
              were described as picking up in some areas. The region's aerospace 
              industry received a boost with new orders from defense contractors, 
              and hiring for Nissan's new plant in Mississippi continues. On a 
              less positive note, contacts reported a further contraction in the 
              textile and apparel industry with a large plant closing in Mississippi 
              and problems for some producers in Tennessee related to the Kmart 
              situation.
          <p>
           <b>
            Tourism and Business Travel
           </b>
           <br/>
           The hospitality and tourism industry in the District continued to 
              recover through mid-February. Convention and conference bookings 
              in Florida and Georgia were improving, although contacts noted that 
              attendance at many events was subdued. Cruise lines out of Miami 
              were sailing at near capacity levels and the use of deep discount 
              pricing was less prevalent. South Florida hotel occupancy rates 
              continued to be adversely affected by a dearth of international 
              tourists. However, attendance at central Florida theme parks continued 
              to improve, and reports on the President's Day weekend were upbeat.
           <p>
            <b>
             Financial
            </b>
            <br/>
            Overall bank lending remained sluggish in January, but contacts 
              noted that mortgage refinancing continued to be strong. Consumer 
              loan volume at credit unions was also strong in some areas. The 
              pace of investment bank activity was reported to have improved slightly, 
              although direct commercial lending remained subdued. Contacts also 
              noted that there was little new money entering the venture capital 
              industry.
            <p>
             <b>
              Wages and Prices
             </b>
             <br/>
             Labor market conditions remained weak in January and early February. 
              Many businesses reported that they were willing to incur overtime 
              costs in the short term rather than hire additional workers. Nonetheless, 
              outplacement firms reported some improvement in activity, although 
              it was noted that it was taking much longer for people to find employment 
              than a year ago.
             <p>
              Prices were described as stable by most accounts. 
              However, continuing increases in health care costs, security costs, 
              and insurance was noted, and price discounting for rental cars and 
              cruises were ending. Reports from the Gulf coast noted that high 
              natural gas inventories and continued warm weather were keeping 
              natural gas prices in check.
              <p>

                Agriculture
               </b>
               <br/>
               Citrus growers in Florida benefited from recent rains and colder 
              temperatures, but the outbreak of citrus canker disease in prime 
              Indian River tree areas could have a significant impact on Florida's 
              citrus crop and on citrus prices.
