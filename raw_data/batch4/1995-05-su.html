      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Federal Reserve District Banks reported continuing gains in 
economic activity from March through April, but at a somewhat slower 
pace. Overall business conditions were described as improving 
solidly in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis 
Districts. Growth was reported to be continuing at a somewhat slower 
pace by Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San 
Francisco. Business activity was described as mixed in New York and 
less strong in Philadelphia. Most Districts reported sluggish growth 
in retail sales and declines in automobile sales, while 
manufacturing was up by varying degrees in most Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although reports of rising commodity and industrial prices remain 
widespread, except for construction materials, reports from many 
Districts described these increases as moderate or not accelerating 
or indicated that they were not being passed through to finished 
goods prices. In addition, despite tight labor markets in some 
sectors or regions, wage pressures were described as moderate in 
most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported sluggish growth in general merchandise 
sales, although Chicago and Minneapolis reported improved sales and 
a few Districts (New York, Cleveland, and Atlanta) noted some 
improvement in April compared to March. Richmond indicated that 
sales growth was slowing. In the Boston and Philadelphia Districts 
sales were mixed and generally below expectations. Store inventories 
were on the rise, according to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and 
San Francisco. Auto sales softened in all Districts except Dallas. 
Some weakening in sales of home furnishings and consumer durables 
was also reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained strong in Cleveland, Kansas City, 
Minneapolis, and Dallas. Continuing, but smaller, gains were 
reported by Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis. 
Demand was strong for capital goods, electronics, and 
petrochemicals. However, even in Districts with increases in overall 
manufacturing, demand for construction materials was easing.
     </p>
     <p>
      San Francisco District manufacturers reported mixed results. 
Aerospace and lumber companies experienced declining demand, while 
producers of electronic goods, machinery, and aluminum increased 
output. Overall manufacturing activity declined in the Philadelphia 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate activity was improving in most Districts. 
Office leasing and construction were reported on the rise by 
Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Dallas and Minneapolis noted 
increased construction of warehouses. Nonresidential construction 
was mixed in the San Francisco District, moving up outside of 
California, particularly in Nevada and Alaska, but easing in the Los 
Angeles area. Boston and New York gave mixed reports; gains in some 
parts of those Districts were offset by declines in others.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction or sales were up somewhat in the Chicago 
and Kansas City Districts, but were slipping in the Atlanta, St. 
Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reported 
slower growth in residential construction. Multifamily construction 
was increasing, according to Atlanta and Dallas, but real estate 
contacts in those Districts expressed concern that apartments were 
approaching an overbuilt situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall bank lending was increasing moderately in most Districts, 
with gains most often noted in commercial and industrial lending. 
All five District Banks that reported on consumer lending 
(Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco) 
noted drops in the demand for consumer loans. New York, Richmond, 
and St. Louis reported increased real estate lending. Lending terms 
in April were reported to be substantially the same as earlier in 
the year, but competition for business loans remains strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several Districts noted some concern in agricultural areas about the 
outlook for summer crops because planting has been delayed. Cold and 
wet weather has caused postponements in planting in the Cleveland, 
St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, while dry 
weather has affected parts of the Richmond and Dallas Districts. 
According to agricultural contacts in Minneapolis, the delay could 
curtail crop yields later this year regardless of weather conditions 
during the summer. But the winter wheat crop is in good condition, 
according to reports received by St. Louis and Kansas City. Floods 
in California have damaged vegetable, fruit, and nut crops, 
according to information obtained by San Francisco, and some crop 
prices are expected to remain high through mid-summer. Both Kansas 
City and Dallas report falling livestock prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Spring tourism business has picked up in the Boston, Richmond, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, and part of the Atlanta 
District. Tour agencies and hoteliers in these regions expect a good 
summer. Boston and Atlanta both noted an increase in international 
visitors to some tourist regions. Atlanta also noted, however, that 
a weakening of tourism in southern Florida has been attributed to 
the drop in the value of the peso. Boston also was told that 
spending by domestic tourists appears to be off from prior years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent increases in oil prices have boosted drilling activity a bit, 
according to the Kansas City, Dallas, and Minneapolis Districts. But 
a relatively mild winter depressed demand for natural gas, and 
natural gas prices and production remain weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Minneapolis reported that rising demand for gold and copper was 
prompting output and employment increases in the District. San 
Francisco also reported increased production from gold and silver 
mines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Except for prices of materials used in residential construction, 
reports of rising commodity and industrial prices remain widespread, 
although many Districts described these increases as moderate or not 
accelerating (including Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, and 
Richmond) or indicated that they were not being passed through to 
finished goods prices (including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, 
and Dallas). Chicago was the only District that reported that input 
price increases were more frequently being passed through to final 
goods prices. While some business contacts told District Banks that 
the rise in commodity prices appeared to be slowing, Boston, 
Chicago, and Cleveland reported the range of commodities affected by 
the increases was expanding. Cleveland and Kansas City contacts said 
retail prices were steady, while Richmond contacts reported higher 
retail prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tight labor markets in some sectors or regions were reported by 
Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas, but 
wage increases were described as moderate in most of these areas, 
and Kansas City noted few reports of wage increases. Demand in some 
Districts for both skilled and semi-skilled workers, as well as 
technical and managerial workers, was strong. Labor markets appeared 
to be less tight in the Philadelphia District, where manufacturers 
reduced work forces in April, and in the Boston District, where 
business contacts gave no reports of labor shortages or growing wage 
pressures.
