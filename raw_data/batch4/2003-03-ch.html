       Reports from Seventh District contacts generally suggested that economic activity 

  remained soft in January and February. Consumer spending was again relatively 

  weak, and caution persisted in businesses' capital spending and hiring plans. 

  Strength continued in sales of both new and existing homes, while nonresidential 

  building and real estate activities were again soft. Manufacturing activity 

  remained generally weak but appeared to have improved further from our last 

  report. Bankers continued to report strong mortgage demand from households and 

  weak loan demand from businesses. There were a few new reports of input cost 

  increases, particularly for energy, but prices at the retail level remained 

  largely in check. District farmland values in 2002 posted the largest year-over-year 

  gain since 1997, even as concerns increased about the impact of drought and 

  continued low dairy prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall consumer spending remained weak in January and February. Most retail 

  contacts indicated that sales results in January fell short of their conservative 

  expectations, although one national chain noted some slight improvement in February. 

  Merchants said that sales of food and consumables were stronger than other items, 

  particularly apparel. Inventories generally remained lean as retailers sought 

  to tightly control stocks, although one merchant reported that inventories were 

  rising faster than sales. A contact in casual dining noted that sales had been 

  softening since mid-January, in part because of bad weather and increased fears 

  of terrorism. Auto dealers indicated that light-vehicle sales in the District 

  had slowed from the torrid pace of year-end 2002, particularly in February. 

  Contacts said that light-vehicle inventories were higher than desired, with 

  one noting that "some dealers are getting nervous," given the great deal of 

  uncertainty about sales in coming months. A manufacturer of recreational vehicles 

  said that demand for lower priced units remained strong but that the high end 

  was "suffering." Tourism activities were reported to be flat to down in most 

  areas, and one contact noted fewer attendees at boat and RV shows in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Business spending generally remained weak in January and February. Most contacts 

  suggested that there had been little, if any, change in their actual capital 

  spending or investment plans early in the year. Many expressed uncertainty about 

  the strength of the economy and continued to take a "wait and see" attitude. 

  One computer industry contact indicated that businesses continued to defer both 

  upgrades to mainframe equipment and additions to capacity, which were also adversely 

  affecting software vendors. There were a few reports of stronger advertising 

  activity in January, but it had softened somewhat in February. Business travel 

  remained weak, and there were some reports of firms encouraging workers to postpone 

  or cancel business trips as a result of the increased threat of terrorism. Hiring 

  plans remained very cautious. Reports from temporary staffing firms were mixed 

  but generally indicated that demand remained lackluster. Contacts from many 

  industries suggested that uncertainty about overall economic conditions and 

  the need to contain costs were constraining hiring.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Construction and real estate activity was again strong on the residential side 

  and soft on the nonresidential side. Sales of both new and existing homes remained 

  strong, according to homebuilders and realtors. Demand for lower priced homes 

  was strongest in most markets, although there were a few reports of improving 

  demand for higher priced new homes in some. One builders association in Wisconsin 

  noted record attendance at their annual home show in January, with builders 

  and remodelers optimistic about the "quality of leads" from the show. Apartment 

  occupancy rates continued to trend down, despite little new development of multifamily 

  rental units. Nonresidential activity remained weak. Office vacancy rates crept 

  up in some markets, in part because of lease termination agreements. While these 

  deals increased official vacancy rates, they also reduced the amount of sublease 

  and "shadow" space on the market. One contact said of office leasing activity, 

  "As for net new demand, we're just not seeing it." Some reports suggested that 

  vacancies rose in some older retail developments and that the number of new 

  retail projects in the pipeline was slowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall, manufacturing activity remained generally soft but continued to show 

  signs of improvement. Nationwide, light-vehicle sales slowed in January and 

  February but were still tracking at historically strong levels. A contact with 

  one automaker said that the industry expected volatile sales in coming months, 

  and manufacturers were prepared to raise incentives to smooth out sales volumes. 

  This contact also noted that production was down slightly from a year ago, and 

  inventories were a little high. A producer of heavy trucks said that sales had 

  been gradually improving after bottoming in August of last year, and it appeared 

  that "people are buying the new engines" that meet more stringent EPA emissions 

  standards. Production was also holding up, with no plans for additional plant 

  shutdowns. Strong shipments to China were said to be helping buoy steel production, 

  according to one industry contact, but inventories had increased somewhat in 

  recent months. A few producers of machine tools reported that quoting activity 

  (especially for larger projects) was up, and this was translating into some 

  new orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall lending activity continued to reflect the bifurcation in economic activity, 

  with strength on the household side and softness on the business side. Applications 

  for mortgage refinancing may have slowed somewhat, but remained much stronger 

  than most bankers had anticipated. Contacts noted some improvement in household 

  loan quality, as delinquencies and charge-offs decreased modestly. Business 

  lending activity remained very weak. A contact with one large bank said soft 

  business demand was reflected in relatively flat loan volumes, a trend that 

  has persisted over the past six months. Banks that did experience volume increases 

  suggested that the gains were due to market share shifts rather than a general 

  increase in demand. On balance, banks did not appear to be tightening standards 

  on business loans, and there were a few reports that overall business loan quality 

  had improved slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Employment Costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There were a few new reports of increasing input costs, but retail price increases 

  remained largely subdued. Of particular concern to many contacts were rising 

  prices of energy and inputs derived from petroleum. One contact said that prices 

  for diesel fuel had risen to "frighteningly high" levels, which could potentially 

  send some small freight carriers into bankruptcy. By contrast, steel prices 

  were said to be stabilizing after some significant increases in 2002. There 

  were no new reports of intensifying pressure on wages, and some companies were 

  said to have delayed merit increases until later in the year. Businesses continued 

  to express concern over rising health and other insurance costs. Despite some 

  increases in input costs, fierce price competition kept most output prices in 

  check. Small-business owners appeared particularly concerned with this trend, 


  as they were finding it increasingly difficult to compete with larger producers 

  on price.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       On average, District farmland values at the end of 2002 were up more than 7 

  percent from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year gain since 1997, according 

  to our survey of rural bankers. Nearly 40 percent of eligible farms in the District 

  had signed up for aid under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, 

  with a crush of applications likely this spring. With drought covering about 

  half the District and another third of the region abnormally dry, there was 

  increasing concern about the growing season. Corn and soybean prices remained 

  higher than a year ago, and contacts suggested prices could rise further, given 

  low stocks and the potential for drought conditions to reduce yields. Higher 

  crop prices had already led food producers to raise some prices. Very low dairy 

  prices and low crop yields last year in parts of Illinois and Indiana contributed 

  to increased financial stress in the District's farm sector.
