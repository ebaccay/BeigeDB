      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Third District business contacts were mixed for 
February but, on balance, suggest a slackening rate of growth. 
Manufacturers noted some gains in shipments and orders during the 
month although order backlogs continued to fall. Retailers generally 
said the February sales rate eased from January and auto dealers 
noted a drop in sales as well. Bankers indicated that loan demand 
was soft with flat business lending and declining consumer lending. 
Realtors said home sales were steady in February and a large number 
of homes remain on the market. Commercial real estate conditions 
continued to be soft, according to real estate contacts, but demand 
for industrial space was firming. Construction activity of all types 
remained low.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, manufacturers expect continued growth although the 
level of optimism has declined somewhat from the beginning of the 
year. Both general merchants and auto dealers said they expect sales 
to pick up in the spring. Bankers, however, expect economic growth 
to slacken, keeping lending activity flat or possibly inducing a 
decline. Residential realtors said sales could pick up in the 
spring, especially if mortgage interest rates come down. Commercial 
realtors do not foresee much better conditions in the near future 
except for industrial space and perhaps for office buildings in a 
few suburban locations in the District. Builders expect some 
stepped-up activity in the spring for home building and commercial 
construction, primarily in suburban locations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District moved up slightly in 
February, according to survey contacts. Just over one-fifth of the 
manufacturers polled said business had picked up compared to January 
although about two-thirds said operations at their plants were just 
steady. Makers of nondurable goods fared slightly better for the 
month than producers of durable goods. In particular, metal 
fabricators and producers of electrical machinery noted a falloff in 
demand for their products. Overall, however, about one-third of the 
industrial firms surveyed reported increases in orders and shipments 
in February while just over half said orders and shipments were 
steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers added slightly to payrolls during 
February although the average workweek was unchanged compared to 
January. Manufacturers also reported steady inventories. With 
respect to prices, plant managers are evenly divided between those 
reporting steady input prices and those reporting increased costs 
for purchased inputs. For their own products, two-thirds are holding 
the line on prices although one-fifth have implemented increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the outlook among Third District manufacturers is for 
continued growth, the number forecasting improvement has slipped 
somewhat since the beginning of the year. About half of the 
manufacturers contacted for this report expect business to be steady 
during the next six months while one-third anticipate continued 
improvement. On balance, local industrial firms expect further gains 
in shipments and orders, but they anticipate that the current 
downward trend in order backlogs will continue also.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District retailers contacted for this report said 
sales in February eased from the January pace. A slowdown in sales 
of furniture and other big-ticket home furnishing items was cited by 
several merchants. Store executives generally indicated that the 
overall sales rate appeared to be steady as the month came to a 
close, and they were not revising their expectations that sales will 
pick up in the spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers also noted a drop in sales in February compared to 
January. Some said they believe that sales were held back by recent 
price increases and a drop in consumer confidence. Although dealers 
anticipate an upturn in the spring, some said that a continuation of 
the lower sales rate in March would call such a forecast into 
question.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers generally described loan demand as soft at 
the end of February. Most of those contacted for this report said 
commercial and industrial loan volume outstanding was flat compared 
to January, and that applications for new loans were falling. They 
also reported softening consumer lending as February came to a 
close, with declines in credit card balances and other unsecured 
consumer loans as well as auto financing. On balance, bankers making 
forecasts for the year expect overall economic growth to slacken and 
lending activity to remain flat or edge down for at least the first 
half of the year, and possibly longer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District realtors described the recent rate of home sales as 
steady in most parts of the District although a few noted increasing 
sales. Home builders reported some increases in traffic at their 
sites but said this had not yet been reflected in increased sales. 
Realtors indicated that the number of homes listed for sale remains 
high, keeping a lid on price appreciation. Some realtors said they 
expect mortgage interest rates to ease by the spring and they expect 
this easing and the usual seasonal pattern will lead to increased 
sales at that time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for commercial real estate remains soft, according to 
commercial realtors and building agents, especially in the 
Philadelphia central business district. Realtors estimate the office 
vacancy rate at about 15 percent in Philadelphia and in the range of 
just under 15 percent to 20 percent in other parts of the Third 
District. Although this is an improvement from a year ago, some of 
the improvement is due to a reduction in space available for lease. 
Realtors said the rebalancing of demand and supply will only 
gradually be reflected in firming lease rates and purchase prices 
near the end of the year. Demand for industrial space is stronger, 
according to realtors, and could result in higher lease rates and 
purchase prices during the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to contacts in the construction industry, building 
activity remains soft throughout the District. Expectations are that 
the pace will pick up somewhat in the spring, with increases in home 
building, construction of industrial buildings, and perhaps some 
office buildings in suburban areas.
