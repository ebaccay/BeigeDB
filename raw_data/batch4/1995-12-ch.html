      Beige Book Report: Chicago

      <strong>
       December 6, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy continued to expand in October and 
November, although manufacturing activity exhibited signs of 
moderating. Retail sales improved through mid-November following 
lackluster October results, although most retailers contacted expect 
holiday sales gains to be smaller than last year. Housing and 
construction activity remained strong in the District and 
expectations for the near future are still high, despite 
unseasonably cold weather in early November. Manufacturing activity 
was mixed, with signs of improvement stronger in October than in 
November. Labor markets remained tight in the District, with 
shortages still being reported in some areas. The District's corn 
and soybean harvest fell short of last year's record highs, while 
usage rates and prices remained high. District lending activity was 
mixed, with demand for business loans remaining strong while 
consumer demand showed signs of softening.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the District improved through most of November, 
following generally weak October sales. However, one survey 
suggested that retailers are not expecting sales gains this year to 
match last years strong holiday season. Retailers in the region 
generally plan to increase promotional activities and start these 
promotions earlier than last year. Competition has been intense in 
major metropolitan areas of the District, with some downtown area 
department stores cutting prices to attract customers from discount 
outlet malls. Sales of electronics generally have outperformed other 
market segments, while unseasonably cold weather boosted apparel 
sales in much of the region. A large national retailer reported 
stronger than expected sales, especially in the region, for the 
first big holiday shopping weekend following Thanksgiving. 
Particular strength was noted in appliances and furniture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from District auto dealers through mid-November have been 
mixed. A major Midwest dealer of foreign nameplates reported that 
sales of core products were doing well but sales of niche products--
especially sports cars--were weak. A domestic nameplate dealer 
described sales of new models as "spotty," but indicated that 
November sales were on target to meet expectations. Several dealers 
noted that minivan and sport/utility vehicle sales have shown 
improvement, while auto sales remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from realtors and homebuilders suggest that home sales in 
the region had been strengthening in recent months, but the sales 
pace may have slowed slightly in November. Several contacts 
attribute any recent slowing to unseasonably cold weather in a large 
portion of the District. One of the largest realtors in the District 
indicated that sales of existing homes were up considerably from 
year-earlier level and continued to strengthen on a seasonally 
adjusted basis. A survey of homebuilders showed some weakening in 
new home sales in the region from October to early November. 
However, these assessments remained substantially above year-earlier 
levels and stronger than the national average. Expectations for 
future new home sales remained at the high levels of the third
quarter. Contacts with commercial realtors and builders suggest 
continued strength into November, while noting a normal seasonal 
slowdown. Mortgage lenders expect that refinancing activity may pick 
up in the near future in the event of a further decline in mortgage 
interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District was somewhat mixed in recent 
weeks, with most of October's gains reportedly linked to auto 
production. Most of the purchasing managers' surveys around the 
District posted increases in October, with the Detroit survey pulled 
up markedly by the auto component of its overall index. Chicago's 
purchasing managers' survey for November indicated no change in 
overall activity after October's advance, but orders and production 
continued to expand. Auto producers indicated a pickup in output at 
several District assembly plants, related either to new models or 
added capacity. Two large steel producers reported that orders for 
the fourth quarter from their auto customers were strong, with one 
producer indicating that incoming orders moved from 80 percent of 
their plant capacity in the late summer to exceeding full capacity 
in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to the auto-related sectors, several reports from other 
producers suggest some recent slowing in demand. A small steel 
producer serving a diversity of markets reported that recent orders 
were flat to slightly down from last quarter, although production 
was being maintained by selling more steel to their affiliates. An 
analyst in the medium and heavy-duty truck industry reported a 
slowing pace in gross orders and fairly high cancellations, but 
noted that production of some models was being maintained even 
though inventory was being built. Producers of construction 
equipment continued to indicate an easing in orders and production. 
A major appliance producer reported that demand has been mixed, with 
demand for refrigerators and freezers doing well while demand for
dishwashers has weakened. In contrast, producers of agricultural 
equipment reported that demand was strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained tight in most of the District, with 
unemployment rates in District states remaining at or near their 
lowest levels of the last 20 years. Purchasing managers' surveys 
suggested a slowing of momentum in manufacturing hiring in a 
seasonally adjusted basis. Help-wanted advertising in the region 
increased slightly in the third quarter and remained slightly above 
year-ago levels. Temporary help agencies continued to report 
difficulty in filling positions, and reports of wage increases for 
entry-level positions persisted in the District. One analyst in a 
large market reported that a large fast-food chain has had to 
increase starting wages twice in the last two months. However, this 
contact noted that there has been no fast-food price increases due 
to labor shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The fall harvest progressed at a slightly faster than normal pace in 
District states and is now virtually complete. Latest estimates 
indicate that both the corn and soybean harvest fell well short of 
the record highs set a year ago. Because of strong consumption 
patterns and sharply higher prices, however, the market value of the 
District's fall harvest may prove to be one of the highest in 
several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity around the District was mixed in October and 
November, with demand for business loans remaining strong and demand 
for consumer loans softening. Wisconsin and western Michigan, both 
areas of very low unemployment, continued to experience solid 
business loan growth, especially for new investment projects. 
However, some increase in inventory financing was also noted. 
Several bankers in major metropolitan areas reported a slowdown in 
consumer lending. The slowdown was attributed in part to an effort 
to charge higher interest rates and increase profit margins. Another 
contributing factor noted was a marked increase in delinquency rates 
in both installment and mortgage loans. One banker expected consumer 
loan demand to remain relatively subdued for the rest of the year.
