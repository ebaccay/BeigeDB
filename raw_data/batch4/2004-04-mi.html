      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       April 21, 2004
      </b>
      <p>
       From late February through mid-April, the overall 
              Ninth District economy demonstrated solid growth. Residential real 
              estate, manufacturing, agriculture, consumer spending, mining, energy 
              and tourism were up, while commercial real estate activity was slow. 
              District employment grew slightly. Wage increases and overall price 
              increases for consumer goods were modest; however, significant increases 
              were noted in a number of manufacturing and construction inputs 
              and commodities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </b>
       <br/>
       Commercial construction was generally slow. Contracts awarded for 
              large construction projects in Minnesota and the Dakotas were down 
              1 percent for the three-month period ended in February compared 
              with a year ago. The value of permits for commercial construction 
              projects for the first three months of 2004 in Billings, Mont., 
              were down compared with the same period last year, but the number 
              of permits was up slightly. With recent vacancy rates at about 20 
              percent, rental rates in several downtown Minneapolis office buildings 
              are more than 15 percent lower than five years ago. In contrast, 
              a company plans to expand into as much as 100,000 square feet of 
              additional office space in downtown Minneapolis, the largest office 
              space absorption in some time, according to a commercial real estate 
              company. Furthermore, a real estate developer noted increased activity 
              in industrial building on speculation in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
              area.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to commercial construction, residential 
              real estate activity generally grew. Home sales activity was brisk 
              in February and March in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, according 
              to a representative of a realtors association. Home closings increased 
              almost 2 percent in Billings, Mont., during February compared with 
              a year ago. Housing units authorized in district states; however, 
              were down 4 percent for the three-month period ended in February 
              compared with a year ago. In addition, recent apartment vacancy 
              rates in Sioux Falls, S.D., reached 10 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </b>
       <br/>
       Overall consumer spending increased moderately. A major Minneapolis-based 
              retailer reported same-store sales during March were 7 percent higher 
              than a year ago. Traffic in February and March was up about 6 percent 
              at a South Dakota mall compared with last year. February same-store 
              sales at a North Dakota mall were up 2 percent to 3 percent compared 
              with a year ago. Two Minneapolis area mall managers reported that 
              same-store sales were up about 10 percent for February compared 
              with a year ago and reported optimism for spring and summer sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto sales were up in February after a very slow 
              January, while sales in March were strong, according to a Minnesota 
              auto dealer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Winter tourism finished the year sturdily in many 
              parts of the district. Snowmobiling and cross country skiing activity 
              was well above year-ago levels and ran late into the season in northwestern 
              Wisconsin, according to a chamber of commerce official. Convention 
              bookings in Duluth, Minn., were recently reported up by 25 percent 
              in 2004. However, winter use of Yellowstone National Park was down 
              18 percent, primarily due to issues regarding snowmobile regulations. 
              Tourism officials and resort owners are optimistic for a healthy 
              summer season in northern Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing
       </b>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity increased. A March survey of purchasing managers 
              by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated robust growth in 
              manufacturing activity in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Several Minnesota 
              manufacturers noted strong demand and have added work shifts, employees 
              and machines. A new beef processing plant is planned for South Dakota. 
              A hydraulic machinery fabricator in western Wisconsin plans a major 
              expansion. In Montana, a linerboard facility, formerly at risk of 
              closing, will remain open due to increased demand. However, in Minnesota, 
              an industrial baking equipment manufacturer reduced production due 
              to low orders, and an ammunition plant will shut down and move production 
              to a facility outside the district. In western Wisconsin, an industrial 
              automation company will close a plant and move production to other 
              facilities in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Energy and Mining
       </b>
       <br/>
       Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased. Late March 
              district oil and natural gas exploration and production amounts 
              increased from early February levels. In addition, progress on several 
              wind-energy and other energy projects has accelerated. Meanwhile, 
              prices for most major district mining commodities remain strong. 
              District iron ore mines continue to produce at capacity and "can't 
              make pellets fast enough," said an iron mining official. In 
              Montana a mining official noted that the higher mining commodity 
              prices "have increased the health of the existing companies, 
              but as yet we have not seen this transition into significant exploration."
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Agriculture
       </b>
       <br/>
       Agricultural conditions are positive. Prices remained robust for 
              most district agricultural commodities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
              reported that mid-March prices for livestock, corn and soybeans 
              increased significantly from February. Dairy producers in Wisconsin 
              expected record prices for their milk in March. District farmers 
              intend to plant more acres of soybeans and fewer acres of wheat 
              in 2004 compared with 2003. Even though the western part of Montana 
              still faces extreme drought, late winter and early spring storms 
              reduced drought pressures across most of the district. Calving and 
              lambing are on schedule. About 40 percent of the winter wheat crop 
              in Montana and South Dakota is rated good or excellent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Employment, Wages and Prices
       </b>
       <br/>
       Employment increased slightly since the last report with signs of 
              future increases. Nonfarm employment increased 0.9 percent in February 
              compared with a year earlier, the fastest year-over-year rate of 
              growth since January 2001. In South Dakota, a trailer manufacturer 
              plans to create up to 35 jobs beginning this spring and the aforementioned 
              beef processing plant is expected to eventually create 300 jobs. 
              A temporary staffing agency survey showed that 32 percent of employers 
              in Minneapolis-St. Paul expect to hire more workers during the second 
              quarter of 2004 and 1 percent expect to reduce payrolls. Last year 
              18 percent expected to increase payrolls and 7 percent planned reductions. 
              A nursing shortage was reported in several areas of the district.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, in Minnesota an energy company recently 
              announced plans to reduce staff by 100 employees at its headquarters, 
              and a retirement services company will layoff 100 employees due 
              to consolidation. Recent announcements of closings and lay-offs 
              in Eau Claire, Wis., will likely result in about 600 job losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall wage increases were modest, while health benefits 
              remained a key issue in contract disputes. During March and early 
              April, over 2,000 bus workers were on strike in the Minneapolis-St. 
              Paul area, primarily over retiree health benefits. Meanwhile, employment 
              officials noted upward pressure on wages in Bozeman, Mont., due 
              to the low unemployment rate (2.9 percent).
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall price increases for consumer goods were modest, 
              while significant increases were noted in a number of manufacturing 
              and construction inputs and commodities. Helena bank directors noted 
              that recent price increases were generally moderate. The Billings, 
              Mont., area consumer price index increased 0.3 percent in February 
              from January. Meanwhile, news reports and bank directors noted significant 
              price increases in several manufacturing and building materials, 
              including steel, copper, aluminum and lumber. Gasoline prices in 
              Minnesota for the week of March 29 were up 13 percent from a year 
              ago. Prices received by North Dakota farmers for agricultural products 
              were up 10 percent in March compared with the same month last year.
