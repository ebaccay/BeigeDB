      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 6, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic
      <br/>
      growth generally continued to be moderate to strong in March and 
  April. Expansion was occurring in nearly all Districts, although 
  Dallas reported some recent signs of slowing growth amid basically  
  strong regional economic conditions and Minneapolis noted some  
  weakening of business activity in parts of that District. Consumer  
  spending was generally robust in all regions of the country. 
  Manufacturing activity advanced. Real estate markets were generally  
  strong. Agricultural conditions were mixed, as was lending activity.  
  Activity has eased in oil drilling and mining.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to be tight. There was some evidence of 
  increased wage pressures in service industries and for computer and 
  technical professionals. Despite increases in labor costs, business 
  contacts indicated that competitive pressures were holding prices in 
  check for most goods. Some increases in service prices were noted, 
  however, in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales rose generally throughout the country in April. In New 
  York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas the strength of the gain 
  exceeded merchants' expectations. Increases were said to be more 
  modest in Philadelphia and Richmond, and retailers in several 
  Districts cautioned that the April results were probably boosted 
  above trend by this year's late Easter. Spring apparel has been 
  selling well in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and 
  Minneapolis. Healthy sales of home furnishings, furniture, and 
  appliances were also cited by several Districts. Merchants said 
  store inventories were in line with sales in Boston, New York, 
  Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City, but some retailers in 
  Richmond said inventories were at higher than desired levels, 
  although they were not increasing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In most of the Districts reporting on auto sales, demand has
      <br/>
      slipped. In Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San 
  Francisco, sales of cars have softened in recent weeks. In contrast, 
  Cleveland and Dallas reported recent increases in motor vehicle 
  sales.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Spring tourism was described as very good in Richmond and Atlanta. 
  Reservations for summer lodging were strong in coastal areas of the 
  Richmond District, and Atlanta reported that cruise bookings were at 
  an all time high in Miami. But the recently concluded winter tourism 
  season in the Minneapolis District was called disappointing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand. In March and April,
      <br/>
      strong gains were recorded in Chicago and Minneapolis. Activity grew 
  in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, 
  and San Francisco. Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas also reported 
  gains, but the rate of growth in those Districts has slowed from 
  earlier in the year.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output has increased in a wide variety of industries. 
  In particular, construction materials and home-related goods, such 
  as furniture and appliances, were mentioned by several Districts. In 
  contrast, output of electronic items was said to be down in Boston 
  and Chicago, and chemical production fell in St. Louis and Dallas. 
  Declining exports to Asia were cited as the main cause of weakness 
  in these industries. Richmond noted falling exports of machinery. 
  Increased competition from imports was reported by manufacturers of
      <br/>
      metals in Philadelphia and chemical manufacturers in Cleveland.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All Districts reporting on commercial real estate markets described 
  improvement. For office buildings, rents were rising, vacancy rates 
  were falling, and construction activity was rising. Boston and 
  Richmond reported speculative construction in areas around Boston 
  and the District of Columbia, respectively. New York City office 
  rental costs have increased markedly since the beginning of the 
  year. Besides these Districts, increases in office occupancy and 
  construction were reported from Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, 
  Dallas, and Atlanta. However, Atlanta also noted that vacancy rates 
  in the industrial sector have risen slightly. San Francisco noted 
  increased construction in Alaska for highways and oil-development 
  infrastructure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Demand for housing was on the rise in seven of the eight Districts 
  that obtained information on this sector. Home construction was 
  increasing in April in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, 
  Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Sales of new and existing homes were 
  up in Richmond, as were home prices. Real estate contacts in several 
  Districts were wary that recent warm weather has encouraged home 
  buying earlier this year than normal and that sales could slip 
  later. Perhaps as a harbinger of this trend, home sales in Atlanta 
  fell in April after an increase in March.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions were mixed, as favorable developments for 
  some crops were offset by weakness in livestock markets. The winter 
  wheat crop was said to be in good condition in the Cleveland, St. 
  Louis, and Kansas City Districts; however, St. Louis noted some 
  damage to the peach crop because of freezing conditions earlier this 
  season. Spring field preparation and planting was ahead of schedule 
  in Cleveland, on schedule in Richmond and Dallas, but behind 
  schedule in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City because of wet 
  ground. Wet conditions have also delayed planting of cotton and some 
  other crops in the San Francisco District.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Low livestock and feed grain prices have seriously impaired farm
      <br/>
      income in the Minneapolis District, and a fall in hog prices in
      <br/>
      Kansas City has led to some liquidation of herds. Livestock sales
      <br/>
      and prices were said to be waning in San Francisco also, although 
  Chicago reported some firming of feed cattle prices in April.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Natural Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Oil-drilling activity has declined recently in the three Districts
      <br/>
      that reported on it: Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Dallas
      <br/>
      did note, however, that drilling for gas remains active, although
      <br/>
      below the strong level recorded near the end of last year.
      <br/>
      Minneapolis noted that mining operations for most minerals have been 
  reduced because of low prices.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Financial Services and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Districts reporting on loan demand indicated that
      <br/>
      commercial lending was rising and residential mortgage activity was 
  up, but consumer loan demand had slipped recently. Six Districts 
  were recording increases in bank lending to businesses while one 
  District, Cleveland, said business borrowing was flat. The increases 
  in commercial and industrial loans were posted in Philadelphia,
  Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. 
  Mortgage originations, both new and refinancings, were up in all of 
  the Districts that mentioned real estate lending: New York, 
  Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San 
  Francisco.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Consumer lending varied. In recent weeks it was up in Atlanta and 
  Chicago, down in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, and flat 
  in New York and Cleveland. Despite these mixed results, bankers said 
  the quality of their institutions' consumer loan portfolios was 
  either steady (in Atlanta) or slightly improved (in Philadelphia, 
  Cleveland, and Chicago).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Employment and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seven Districts obtained assessments of their overall labor markets 
  from business contacts, and in all these, conditions were described 
  as tight. Strong labor demand was noted in Cleveland, Richmond, 
  Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Wage increases in a variety of industries were estimated to be in a 
  range of 2 to 6 percent above last year's levels according to 
  surveys in Boston and Cleveland. Boston noted that computer 
  professionals and engineers were getting wage increases of 8 to 10 
  percent, and Cleveland reported that temporary help firms were 
  boosting wages by 5 to 20 percent.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Richmond and Dallas received reports that wage increases were
      <br/>
      becoming more frequent in service industries, but the increases were 
  not sharp. In Atlanta and Chicago, wage gains were said to be more 
  widespread, but the size of the increases was not great. Contacts in 
  St. Louis said upward pressure on wages was growing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Information obtained by most Districts suggests that goods prices at 
  most stages of production are nearly steady. Retail prices were 
  steady according to reports obtained by Boston, New York, 
  Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Prices for manufacturing 
  inputs were said to be steady in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
  Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Some increases were noted in the 
  Kansas City District, however, along with declines. As already 
  noted, livestock prices were said to be weak in San Francisco and 
  Minneapolis, and Minneapolis reported low prices for natural 
  resource commodities. Oil prices also were reported to be low. One 
  factor apparently keeping goods prices in check is import 
  competition in intermediate and finished consumer products, 
  primarily from Asian countries, as reported to New York, 
  Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas. While the prices 
  of most goods are nearly steady, growing construction activity has 
  resulted in some price increases for construction materials, 
  especially lumber. In contrast to the prices of goods, increases in 
  the prices of business services were noted by Dallas and San 
  Francisco.
