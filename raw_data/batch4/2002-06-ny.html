      <p>
       The District's economy has shown further signs of perking up 
                since the last report, despite some softening in consumer spending 
                and consumer borrowing. There has been no discernible pickup in 
                price pressures. The labor market has shown signs of firming. 
                Retail sales were generally below plan in May, partly due to unseasonably 
                cool weather, with same-store sales little changed from a year 
                earlier; still, inventory levels were reported as satisfactory, 
                while selling prices were little changed. Surveys of regional 
                manufacturing firms and purchasing managers suggest a slight deceleration 
                in growth in May, but a
                pickup in cost pressures. Housing markets have strengthened further,
                especially in the New York City area. Office markets have stabilized, 
                though rents are still down by well over 10 percent from a year 
                ago. Finally, bankers report weaker demand for consumer loans, 
                but stronger demand from commercial borrowers, along with declining 
                delinquency rates for consumer and home mortgage loans and tighter 
                lending standards.
       <p>
        <b>
         Consumer Spending
        </b>
        <br/>
        Most retail chains report that sales were below plan in May; compared 
                with a year earlier, same-store sales changes ranged from a 7 
                percent decline to a 4 percent increase. Unseasonably cool weather 
                was blamed for some of this recent weakness. While various contacts 
                noted sluggish sales of apparel, lawn and garden, and luggage, 
                most indicate relatively strong sales of home appliances, furnishings 
                and electronics. Despite the sluggish sales in recent weeks, most 
                retailers report that inventories are in good shape. Retailers 
                generally report that selling prices, merchandise costs, and wages 
                are stable, but continue to note sharp escalation in medical and 
                property insurance costs. One large chain reports that employee 
                turnover has declined and that a growing proportion of workers 
                are full-time; this has led to an increase in wage rates but also 
                a large increase in worker productivity. Contacts express mixed 
                levels of concern about the possibility of a West Coast longshoreman's 
                strike this summer.

         Construction and Real Estate
        </b>
        <br/>
        Housing markets have shown signs of gaining further momentum in 
                recent weeks—particularly in the New York City area. Homebuilders 
                in northern New Jersey report that demand remains strong and that 
                supply shortages persist—although construction activity is lower 
                than a year ago, price increases are sticking and buyers have 
                been requesting more features and options. According to realtors 
                in New York State and northern New Jersey, median selling prices 
                of existing single-family homes are reported to be up 15-25 percent, 
                year-to-date, from comparable 2001 levels in and around New York
                City, while gains in upstate New York have ranged from 1 to 9 
                percent. Unit sales are running 10-20 percent ahead of 2001 levels 
                in metropolitan New York City and roughly 5 percent ahead in upstate 
                New York.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding the multi-family sector, a leading New York City appraisal 
                firm and a major real estate firm both report further strengthening 
                in Manhattan's co-op and condo market in April and May. A number 
                of recent transactions have had multiple bids, though only modestly 
                above the asking price, and prices are reported to be roughly 
                back on par with a year ago and increasing. These contacts also 
                report that Manhattan's rental market, though still somewhat slack, 
                has shown clear signs of picking up since the last report. In 
                contrast, eastern Long Island's summer rental market is said to 
                be much weaker than
                last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial real estate markets in the New York City area have 
                shown more signs of stabilizing since the last report. In Manhattan, 
                Midtown's vacancy rate edged up from 7.8 to 8.1 percent in April, 
                but Downtown's rate held steady at 11.9 percent. Asking rents 
                are reported to be down 10-15 percent from a year ago, and this 
                is said to understate the decline in actual rents. Office rental 
               
                markets in New York City's suburbs have been mixed, with vacancy 
                rates
                declining in Westchester County, little changed in Long Island, 
                but rising in
                central and northern New Jersey and Fairfield County, Connecticut.
                Separately, office vacancy rates in the suburbs of Albany rose 
                to a nearly 10-year high in May, but vacancy rates in downtown 
                Albany have declined over the past year.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Other Business Activity
        </b>
        <br/>
        A leading employment agency reports further improvement in New 
                York City's labor market in April and May. Hiring activity has 
                remained strong in the legal services industry and has picked 
                up in the financial services sector. However, there is still reported 
                to be a large pool of unemployed information technology workers, 
                with only sporadic hiring in that area. Separately, Manhattan 
                hotels have seen stable tourism activity—both occupancy and room 
                rates were little changed in April, at or close to pre-attack 
                levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to our May survey of New York State manufacturers, 
                a smaller proportion of respondents reported improvement in business 
                conditions than in April, but positive responses still outnumbered 
                negatives. Moreover, expectations on the near-term outlook were 
                overwhelmingly positive, even more so than in April. However, 
                manufacturers increasingly indicate that input costs have risen, 
                but that they have been unable to raise selling prices.
                Separately, a growing proportion of New York City area purchasing 
                managers report favorable business conditions in May, though those 
                in the manufacturing sector report some deceleration from the 
                rapid pace seen in April. Meanwhile, Buffalo-area purchasers report 
                some weakening in manufacturing-sector conditions and production 
                activity, but a modest pickup in hiring. Purchasers in both Buffalo 
                and New York City note some pickup in price pressures in May.

        <b>
         Financial Developments
        </b>
        <br/>
        Bankers at small to medium-sized Second District banks report 
                sagging loan demand on the consumer side, but rising demand from 
                commercial borrowers. Roughly twice as many respondents report 
                increased demand for commercial and industrial loans and nonresidential 
                mortgages as report decreases. For consumer loans, in contrast, 
                responses were roughly the reverse. Demand for residential mortgages 
                was little changed on balance, while refinancing activity continued 
                to recede.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the supply side, bankers report tightening credit standards 
                for all types of loans except for residential mortgages, for which 
                standards remained stable. Loan rates decreased for most types 
                of loans, though rates on nonresidential mortgages held steady. 
                Deposit rates also fell since the last report. Lenders report 
                lower delinquency rates on consumer loans and residential mortgages, 
               
                but little change in rates for non-residential mortgages and commercial 
                and
                industrial loans.
