      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in most sectors of the Second District continued 
to improve since the last report. Most retailers report that sales 
rebounded in August and were running on or ahead of plan. Real 
estate markets strengthened across the board, with demand for both 
single- and multi-family homes firming throughout the region and New 
York City's office market tightening further. Purchasing managers in 
the region report ongoing improvement in the manufacturing sector in 
August. Private-sector job growth accelerated in July, but public-
sector employment fell sharply, mostly due to reductions in the 
federal summer jobs program. There are no signs of increased price 
or wage pressures, aside from some firming in real estate values. 
Finally, banks report a slight softening in demand for commercial 
and industrial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the district were generally on or above plan in 
August, as business picked up from July's disappointing pace. On a 
year-over-year basis, same-store sales gains ranged from 3-7 
percent. Upscale women's apparel and men's casual wear continued to 
be the top performers. Home goods were again characterized as 
lagging other categories; one contact attributed this ongoing 
weakness to relatively cool weather, especially compared to last 
summer, which held down sales of air conditioners and other hot-
weather goods. Inventories were generally at desired levels, with 
contacts crediting effective control systems, as well as increased 
caution after last year's overhang. Expectations for the Christmas 
season were mixed, with same-store sales expected to be up 3 to 6 
percent from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers report that price and wage pressures remain subdued. 
Selling prices are said to be flat to slightly higher, while 
merchandise costs are steady to slightly lower. All contacts report 
that there is no noticeable wage pressure; most anticipate a modest 
impact, if any, from the upcoming minimum wage hike.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction &amp; Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New York City's commercial real estate market continued to firm in 
July. Office leasing activity accelerated, and availability rates 
declined for the second consecutive month. (Availability rates 
include vacant space, as well as space coming on the market over the 
next six months). Downtown Manhattan's availability rate fell to 
23.9 percent-an 18-month low-from 24.7 percent in June; Midtown's 
rate edged down to 14.3 percent from 14.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's residential real estate markets continued to improve 
in July and August. Homebuilders in New Jersey report that both 
traffic and sales have picked up in recent weeks, after a sluggish 
second quarter. Builders in New York report a continued pickup in 
activity across most of the state, with only the Syracuse and 
Binghamton areas lagging. Strong demand and thin inventories are 
reportedly spurring more speculative building activity, mostly in 
downstate New York (notably Long Island). In general, demand 
continues to be strongest at the lower end of the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, realtors in both states report strong sales of existing 
homes, along with moderate price appreciation. New York State 
realtors report that July home sales were up 18 percent from a year 
ago, while prices were up 8 percent. In New Jersey, second-quarter 
sales climbed 13 percent from a year earlier, to their highest level 
in nearly a decade, with prices up 5 percent. Similarly, Manhattan's 
co-op and condominium market has been buoyed by rapidly rising 
rents. One large real estate broker reports that demand for studio 
and one-bedroom apartments, which had languished for years, has 
picked up dramatically in recent months, with some buyers bidding 
above the asking price.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional surveys of purchasing managers suggest continued growth in 
the manufacturing sector and a slight easing of price pressures. 
Buffalo purchasing managers report that manufacturing activity 
resumed a strong pace of growth in August, after pausing in July. 
New York City area purchasing managers report continued improvement 
in the local manufacturing sector in August, though growth has 
slowed from July's torrid pace. (A parallel survey of purchasing 
managers in New York City's non-manufacturing sectors signals 
steady, fairly robust growth for the third consecutive month).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Private-sector job growth in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut 
accelerated in July, but reductions in the federal summer jobs 
program caused a temporary but sharp drop in public-sector 
employment-particularly in New York. New York's unemployment rate 
rose 0.2 points to 6.5 percent in July, New Jersey's edged down 0.1 
point to 6.1 percent, and Connecticut's edged down 0.1 point to 4.7 
percent (a six year low). New York City's tourism boom may be 
abating, but only slightly-hotel occupancy rates (seasonally 
adjusted) edged down in July, though they remain near record highs, 
and room rates are still up more than 12 percent from a year 
earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial loan demand weakened moderately, while consumer loan 
demand held steady in August, according to the latest survey of 
senior loan officers in the Second District. Demand for commercial 
and industrial loans was lower at almost 30 percent of the banks and 
higher at just over 15 percent. Refinancing activity continued to 
slow, decreasing at 40 percent of the banks. The proportion of loan 
officers reporting increased willingness to lend declined since the 
last report, but is still higher than during the spring. Nearly all 
banks say their credit standards are unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Average loan rates were steady to slightly lower in all categories, 
after rising in the prior survey, while deposit rates were generally 
higher. Loan delinquency rates, which had risen moderately in July, 
held steady for consumer loans and declined for commercial loans in 
August.
