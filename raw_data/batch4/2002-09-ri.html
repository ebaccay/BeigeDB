      Beige Book Report: Richmond

       September 11, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of continued strength 
                in District housing markets, and a pickup in retail activity in 
                some areas, there were only scattered signs of growth in the Fifth 
                District's economy in July and August. Manufacturing activity 
                was essentially flat; shipments edged lower and new orders were 
                unchanged. Services firms' revenues also were flat, and retail 
                sales growth strengthened in some areas but was sluggish in others. 
                Residential mortgage lending rose as mortgage interest rates continued 
                to trend down, while commercial lending remained weak. District 
                home sales were strong, but with the exception of some pickup 
                in retail leasing, commercial real estate activity was little 
                changed. Price inflation remained modest throughout the District's 
                economy. In agriculture, recent rainfall helped crops, but prolonged 
                hot and dry weather during much of the summer reduced corn and 
                soybean yield prospects and distressed pastures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the District said sales growth was mixed in the 
                  weeks since our last report. In Gastonia, N.C., contacts said 
                  layoffs at textile plants had led to weaker sales. In contrast, 
                  a large department store with locations throughout the District 
                  reported that their business had been up. In Virginia's Tidewater 
                  region, a big-box retailer described the pace of sales as unchanged 
                  from six weeks ago, and a department store manager there characterized 
                  sales as "good." Reports from automobile dealers were mixed, 
                  and many were offering manufacturers' price incentives to reduce 
                  inventory as they got ready for next year's models. Most District 
                  retail businesses were not hiring, but a respondent at an upscale 
                  retail firm said it had difficulty finding staff for its planned 
                  new store in the Washington, D.C., area.
     </p>
     <p>
      &gt;
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Services firms generally reported flat revenues in recent weeks. 
                  Trucking firms in Maryland and North Carolina reported that 
                  demand softened and healthcare systems and hospitals in the 
                  Fifth District reported that demand was flat. Restaurants in 
                  Charleston, S.C., and around the Chesapeake Bay reported decreased 
                  revenues. However, internet services companies in central North 
                  Carolina, West Virginia, and suburban Washington, D.C., told 
                  us that demand had increased. Several North Carolina firms that 
                  assist with business bankruptcies also said they saw stronger 
                  demand in manufacturing-dependent regions, suggesting weak economic 
                  conditions persist in those areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of District manufacturing activity was sluggish in 
                  the weeks since our last report. Shipments edged lower, while 
                  new orders and employment were little changed. Capacity utilization 
                  edged higher in August after several months of declines. According 
                  to our contacts, demand softened further in the chemicals, electronics, 
                  furniture, and textiles industries. A North Carolina chemical 
                  producer told us that his firms' shipments and new orders declined 
                  in August. He said that his company remained cautious about 
                  capital spending because there was "no sense as to the direction 
                  of the economy." A North Carolina-based furniture manufacturer 
                  said that weak demand for higher-priced lines contributed to 
                  an 8-percent reduction in new orders at his firm in August. 
                  In contrast, a manufacturer of packaging supplies in South Carolina 
                  told us that business picked up in August and he expected shipments 
                  to be strong during the next six months. In general, District 
                  manufacturers reported little new hiring and only modest wage 
                  increases since our last report. Prices in the manufacturing 
                  sector rose at less than a 1-percent annual rate in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District loan officers reported that lending activity rose at 
                  a moderate pace in July and August. Residential mortgage lending 
                  picked up appreciably as lower mortgage rates spurred additional 
                  refinancing activity. Refinancings accounted for 70 to 80 percent 
                  of some bankers' lending in August. A mortgage lender in Charleston, 
                  S.C., reported that loan demand had been exceptionally strong 
                  in recent weeks but he expected refinancing activity to slow 
                  in the fourth quarter. Commercial lending continued to be weak 
                  as many businesses remained cautious about taking on more debt 
                  in the sluggish economic environment. A banker in Virginia noted 
                  a pickup in borrowing by businesses providing security services, 
                  but said that overall commercial demand remained generally weak. 
                  A Charleston, W.V., banker noted that even though his local 
                  economy had been surprisingly resilient, businesses there remained 
                  "cautious" about borrowing for expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District residential real estate agents continued to report 
                  strong sales in late July and August. A realtor in the Washington, 
                  D.C., area said home sales had been "tremendous" in recent weeks. 
                  He noted that while the market for higher priced homes had softened 
                  somewhat, low- to moderate-priced homes were "absolutely gone" 
                  as soon as they came on the market. Likewise, a contact in Maryland 
                  said home sales in her area were very strong and a realtor in 
                  Virginia Beach, Va., said that the market there was "hot." A 
                  homebuilder in the Carolinas described home sales as "skyrocketing," 
                  particularly in the Charlotte area. Most realtors cited low 
                  mortgage interest rates as the driving force behind the solid 
                  sales results. Stock market declines were also said to be a 
                  factor--a contact in Virginia Beach commented that some investors 
                  "burned" in the stock market were finding a safer investment 
                  in real estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to commercial realtors, leasing 
                  and construction activity in the Fifth District remained generally 
                  flat in recent weeks. Many brokers attributed the market's inertia 
                  to seasonal factors--a contact in Washington, D.C., noted that 
                  "potential customers were focusing on vacations, not deals." 
                  By sector, demand was weak for office and industrial space, 
                  but interest in retail space edged higher--a Columbia, S.C., 
                  realtor reported that "high-end retail establishments" continued 
                  to perform well. Vacancy rates stabilized in the retail sector, 
                  but continued to creep up in the office and industrial sectors. 
                  Commercial rental rates changed little, but contacts in the 
                  Carolinas and Northern Virginia reported the re-emergence of 
                  landlord concessions in the office and industrial sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity was mixed since our last report. Hoteliers 
                  at Virginia Beach, Va., and Myrtle Beach, S.C., told us that 
                  bookings for the Labor Day weekend were somewhat higher than 
                  a year ago. However, a contact on the Outer Banks of North Carolina 
                  reported that business was a little softer than during Labor 
                  Day weekend last year. She attributed weaker bookings to an 
                  inundation of mosquitoes and jellyfish in the area. She also 
                  noted that tourists were not dining out as much, reducing revenues 
                  at area restaurants. Looking ahead, a respondent in Myrtle Beach 
                  expected tourist activity to be somewhat weaker in coming months, 
                  in part because of fewer flights into the area as financially 
                  strapped airlines trimmed costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts at temporary employment agencies reported that the 
                  demand for workers firmed somewhat in recent weeks. An agent 
                  in Raleigh, N.C., reported that a few of his clients were "finally 
                  willing to launch new projects" due in part to having somewhat 
                  more confidence in the economy. He also reported seeing an increase 
                  in direct-placement requests at his agency. A Charlotte, N.C., 
                  agent reported stronger demand for workers and the agent expected 
                  the economy to improve in coming months. Sales and customer 
                  service representatives were the most highly sought after job 
                  categories in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought conditions persisted in most areas of the Fifth District 
                  in July and August. Despite widespread rainfall at the end of 
                  August, soaring temperatures and depleted ground moisture reduced 
                  potential crop yields--particularly in South Carolina, where 
                  over 80 percent of the corn crop and 60 percent of the soybean 
                  crop were reported to be in poor condition. Drought-stricken 
                  North Carolina continued to suffer and soybean development was 
                  delayed there. Pasture conditions continued to decline and farmers 
                  in Virginia and West Virginia reported early feeding of hay 
                  and hauling water to livestock. In addition, cattle farmers 
                  in North Carolina and Virginia were culling their herds to avoid 
                  possible feed shortages this fall and winter.
