      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District grew moderately in 
late March and April. Retailers, manufacturers, port 
representatives, temporary employment agencies, and service 
producers reported that growth was higher in their sectors. Activity 
in the tourism and financial sectors was mixed, while the growth of 
state revenues varied across states. Residential real estate 
activity grew more slowly but commercial real estate activity 
strengthened. Conditions in agriculture were normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most indicators of retail activity suggested increased 
growth in April, according to preliminary results from a mail survey 
of District retailers. Sales revenue and shopper traffic growth 
increased. Employment growth increased slightly; wage growth changed 
little; and the growth of inventories and big-ticket sales slowed. 
Survey respondents indicated that their prices rose less in April 
than in March. Respondents' six-month outlook was for their prices 
to rise more slowly than was their forecast in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service Production
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of expansion in the service-sector rose 
in April, according to preliminary results from a District mail 
survey. Revenue and employment growth was higher and wage growth 
changed little. Service producers reported that their prices rose at 
the same rate in April as in March. Respondents' six-month outlook 
was for their prices to rise more slowly than was their forecast in 
March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most indicators of manufacturing activity growth 
increased in April, according to preliminary results from a monthly 
mail survey of District manufacturers. Except in Maryland, survey 
respondents reported a faster pace of expansion in shipments, new 
orders, and order backlogs. Maryland manufacturers reported that 
growth weakened, and one contact there attributed the weakness to 
defense cutbacks. Manufacturing employment and the workweek changed 
little and respondents continued to report a scarcity of skilled 
labor. Manufacturers indicated that finished goods prices increased 
slightly in April from the month before, but that raw materials 
prices declined. Respondents' six-month outlook was for their prices 
and the prices of raw materials to rise faster than was their 
forecast in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts 
throughout the District indicated that April tourist activity was 
above March levels but below those of a year ago. Baltimore contacts 
reported that baseball boosted tourism above last year's strike-
affected level. Compared to a year ago. District beach activity was 
hampered by an earlier Easter and colder-than-normal temperatures, 
but spring bookings were up. Contacts expected better-than-normal 
business and slight increases in prices during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      br&gt;
Representatives at District ports indicated that both 
export and import levels in March were higher than in February and a 
year ago. Contacts continued to expect exports and imports to 
increase during the next six months, with exports expected to rise 
faster than imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of District temporary 
employment agencies indicated that the demand for temporary workers 
was higher than in early March and a year ago. Wages paid to 
temporary workers increased faster than the general price level 
during the past year, but were unchanged during the last six weeks. 
Contacts indicated that companies were hiring more temporary workers 
into permanent positions than a year ago. Looking forward, contacts 
expected the demand for temporary workers to strengthen during the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts at District financial institutions reported that 
lending activity was mixed during late March and April. Lenders 
indicated that the demand for commercial and consumer loans was 
unchanged from early March and that the demand for mortgage loan 
refinancings weakened. Compared to the previous six weeks, interest 
rates were unchanged on commercial and consumer loans but were 
higher on mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a telephone survey of District 
real estate agents and homebuilders, residential real estate 
activity increased more slowly in late March and April. Housing 
starts, sales, and customer traffic grew at a somewhat slower pace. 
Homebuilders claimed that the recent increase in mortgage interest 
rates had negatively impacted their markets. Real estate agents said 
that the recent increase had forced some potential buyers out of the 
market but had led others to close more quickly on open 
transactions. Construction wages and building materials prices 
increased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported that commercial 
real estate activity picked up in late March and April. Leasing 
activity increased, landlord concessions all but disappeared, and 
commercial rents continued to rise. Vacancy rates fell, except in 
West Virginia where they were unchanged. The availability of prime 
office space continued to tighten in most of the District and nearly 
half the respondents reported shortages; one Maryland contact 
characterized the shortage in his area as "desperate." Contacts 
continued to report new construction, especially in the Carolinas 
and the District of Columbia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State tax collections were mixed in March compared 
to February. Real revenue growth was stronger in North Carolina, 
Virginia, and West Virginia; flat in South Carolina; and somewhat 
slower in Maryland and the District of Columbia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in agriculture progressed at a normal pace 
according to district agricultural analysts. Warmer weather in late 
April allowed farmers to catch up on planting activity delayed by a 
colder-than-usual March. Winter's bite still affected crops; 
analysts reported that the condition of small grains and fruit trees 
were worse than normal.
