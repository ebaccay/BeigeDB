      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 23, 2003
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested that the pace of 

  economic activity continued to be lackluster during March and the first two 

  weeks of April. Although Richmond observed continued modest growth, reports 

  from Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized 

  economic conditions as still mixed or soft. Since the last Beige Book, New York, 

  Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted that the recent pace 

  of economic activity had been slower than reported earlier. The onset of the 

  war with Iraq appeared to have some effect on sales and spending, although it 

  is too early to ascertain the full effect of the war on both consumer and business 

  confidence.
      <p>
       Reports on consumer spending were generally weak in March, but respondents 

  attributed part of the weakness to poor weather and the onset of war. Contacts 

  also cautioned that year-over-year comparisons of sales for March were difficult 

  because Easter fell in late March last year but falls in the third week of April 

  this year. Optimism remained that the retail environment would improve within 

  the next six months.
       <p>
        Most Districts continued to report weakness in manufacturing, although some 

  pockets of growth were noted in most of the reports. Businesses continued to 

  report a cautious attitude toward spending, and commercial real estate was reported 

  to still be in a slump. In contrast, homebuilding activity remained strong across 

  all Districts. Mortgage lending, buoyed by refinancing activity, remained strong, 

  and a few Districts noted some improvement in commercial loan demand. Agriculture 

  conditions generally improved as rain and snow eased drought conditions in several 

  Districts. Labor markets remained soft, but some Districts noted moderating 

  layoffs or improvements in demand for temporary labor.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Consumer Spending
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Overall consumer spending remained subdued in March. Although some of the weakness 

  is attributable to Easter falling later this year, the onset of military action 

  in Iraq and poor weather also had negative effects on March sales figures in 

  most Districts. Atlanta and San Francisco, however, noted that March sales were 

  "near year-ago levels" and "largely stable on net" respectively.
         <p>
          Although retail sales have been sluggish, most Districts indicated that their 

  retailers were not concerned about inventory levels. Cleveland, Atlanta, and 

  Chicago reported heavy discounting or increased promotional environments. The 

  outlook among retailers in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis suggested 

  that at least a slight improvement in conditions would occur in these Districts 

  before the close of 2003.
          <p>
           Reports regarding automobile sales in March were mixed: The Cleveland, Richmond, 

  Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco auto markets saw some rebound 

  in March after slowing in February. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and 

  Kansas City, on the other hand, reported faltering auto sales in March, although 

  Minneapolis and Kansas City saw some recovery in auto sales in early April in 

  response to manufacturers' incentives.
           <p>
            Travel and tourism spending strengthened in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and 

  Kansas City Districts, but slowed in the Chicago and San Francisco regions. 

  San Francisco noted that international travel had weakened, due in part to the 

  SARS outbreak in Asia. Dallas observed a decline in air travel due to the onset 

  of the war and the SARS outbreak. Atlanta reported mixed conditions: Although 

  international tourism fell in the District, the decline was offset by a successful 

  spring break season.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Manufacturing
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Nine of the twelve Districts reported slowing activity in manufacturing. New 

  York and Dallas reported mixed conditions, and Cleveland reported flat or slightly 

  improving conditions. In general, contacts reported lower levels of production, 

  sales, and new orders.
             <p>
              Still, pockets of improvement in the industry were noted by more than half 

  the Districts in this report. In Boston, companies producing hardware, semiconductors, 

  and machine tools reported an increase in business activity, as did nondurable 

  goods producers in the Cleveland District. Atlanta's defense-related manufacturers 

  reported improving conditions, and the hiring of temporary workers in manufacturing 

  rose slightly. In the St. Louis District, some auto parts producers were planning 

  to expand their facilities. The energy-related sector in Dallas observed strong 

  growth since the last report. Despite declining conditions at the time of the 

  survey, manufacturers in the New York and Philadelphia Districts seemed optimistic 

  that activity would improve somewhat within the next six months.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Construction and Real Estate
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Residential activity remained strong while commercial building activity continued 

  to be characterized as sluggish. Most Districts reported high levels of residential 

  building activity and sales. Still, some homebuilders suggested that there was 

  a slight softening in their markets: In the Boston District, sales were being 

  limited by supply, and in New York and Atlanta, demand for higher-end homes 

  had eased.
               <p>
                On the commercial side, weakness in construction activity persisted as none 

  of the Districts reported solid improvements in the industry. Office vacancy 

  rates continued to climb in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, 

  Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and some Districts reported 

  falling rental prices.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Banking and Finance
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 Home lending activity, fueled mainly by refinancing, remained strong across 

  all Districts, but the Chicago District noted some slowing in mortgage activity. 

  Consumer and commercial lending was generally flat, although some bankers in 

  the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts saw slight increases 

  in commercial loan demand. Several Districts reported growth in deposits, but 

  New York reported a decline. Richmond noted a decline in consumer credit demand 

  as clients were paying down their debts.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Agriculture
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  Recent precipitation has helped to allay fears of continued drought in the Richmond, 

  Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Farmers in the Kansas City District 

  expected to strengthen their balance sheets if relief from drought conditions 

  continues. Various Districts reported stable or rising commodity prices for 

  items such as sugar cane, vegetables, cattle, cotton, tree fruits, and nuts, 

  but prices for milk remained low. The Atlanta and Chicago Districts reported 

  that higher energy prices have resulted in higher market prices for farming 

  inputs, but in Chicago it did not appear to have a large effect because most 

  farmers had negotiated contracts when input prices were lower.
                  <p>
                   <strong>
                    Labor Markets
                   </strong>
                   <br/>
                   Most District reports indicated continued weakness in labor markets, as several 

  Districts noted substantial layoffs in March and early April. Still, some hints 

  of improvement had emerged: Both Cleveland and Kansas City reported fewer plans 

  for staff reductions, while New York, Atlanta, and Dallas reported stronger 

  demand for temporary workers. Several Districts reported a lack of upward pressure 

  on wages, but firms continued to note substantial increases in the costs of 

  health care and insurance.
                   <p>
                    <strong>
                     Prices
                    </strong>
                    <br/>
                    Many Districts reported price pressures in specific segments of their economies, 

  and no reports of widespread inflationary pressures were mentioned. In general, 

  energy-related inputs in manufacturing saw substantial price increases in March 

  and early April, but most manufacturers held the prices of their goods steady. 

  Retailers noted heavy discounting and promotions, with notable drops in apparel 

  and electronics prices.
