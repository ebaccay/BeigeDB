      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The First District economy continues to expand as the summer draws 
to a close. Manufacturers and personnel supply firms report solid 
growth. Most retail contacts indicate that sales were better than 
expected in August. Investment management firms are growing 
modestly. Residential real estate markets in much of New England are 
in good shape. With exceptions, input and selling prices are said to 
be stable while wages and salaries are up 2 to 4 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retail contacts in the First District are upbeat about the 
economy and report higher-than-expected sales, particularly in 
August. Retailers of high-priced apparel and home building materials 
cite sales increases from year-earlier levels as high as 37 percent 
in July and August; by contrast, two respondents note sales declines 
of 3 to 9 percent during the summer months compared with a year ago. 
Retail respondents are cautiously building inventories in 
anticipation of holiday sales, and they expect 2 to 10 percent sales 
gains for the remainder of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vendor and customer prices remain stable; by exception, the retail 
price of leather has risen 5 to 10 percent and the cost of lumber 
continues to move up. Contacts note that offering fewer sales 
promotions has generally improved gross margins; profits, however, 
are mixed for the first half of the year. Capital spending increases 
this year are limited primarily to improvements in technology. Only 
one respondent cites a major reduction in employment; most others 
have level job counts and anticipate wage increases of 2 to 4 
percent for the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most manufacturing contacts in the First District report that 
overall sales are solidly higher than a year ago. Incoming orders 
generally suggest a continuation of current trends. Results for 
similar products vary across firms, however. For example, one 
producer reports continued double-digit increases in the demand for 
plastic parts, while another reports sharp declines. Such unevenness 
extends to the medical, industrial, and utility equipment markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the whole, inventories are reported to be roughly in line with 
company targets. However, a contact in the paper industry is 
curtailing production in order to eliminate excess inventories. A 
producer of industrial machinery intends to add to inventories, 
while a metals fabricator reports being unable to do so because the 
company is operating at full capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers report that selling and input prices generally are 
little changed from a year ago. By exception, the price of memory 
chips has fallen by half in the last few months. Thus far, this 
development has not led to an intensification of the downward trend 
in computer prices, however. Paper prices have recovered a bit from 
their recent lows but remain far below year-ago levels. Plastics 
prices have subsided after rising earlier this year, while some 
metals prices continue to increase a little.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturing contacts indicate that their U.S. employment is 
flat to slightly higher than a year ago. Wages and salaries have 
increased 2 1/2 to 4 percent, with the lower end of this range 
reflecting contracts negotiated in previous years. Businesses 
recruiting computer specialists or engineers indicate that they must 
offer attractive salaries and profit-sharing or discounted stock 
plans. Nevertheless, contacts report that they are able to hire the 
employees they need even in such sought-after professions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers typically are continuing to spend the same amount on 
capital as last year. Such spending represents sizable increases in 
capacity for about one-third of the contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment Firms
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Personnel supply firms in the First District report very good 
business in the summer of 1996, with revenues expanding 20 to 30 
percent from a year earlier. Summer sales rose in the clerical 
sector because of student workers and leveled off in high technology 
fields, trends that typically reverse in the fall. Temporary-to-
permanent job conversions have subsided, and workers reportedly 
continue to leave full-time payroll employment to work on a contract 
basis for higher hourly pay and state-of-the-art projects. 
Nonetheless, demand for qualified temporary labor is rising faster 
than supply, so wages have risen. As competition continues to 
increase, contacts are exploring new recruiting methods such as the 
Internet. Double-digit revenue growth is anticipated for the 
remainder of 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential real estate market remains in good shape across much 
of New England. Contacts report that sales of existing homes in the 
last two months are above year-ago levels in Connecticut, Rhode 
Island, and Massachusetts. A respondent in Maine reports that the 
spurt of sales earlier in the spring has slowed substantially in the 
last two months. While the recent activity in Connecticut and 
Massachusetts reflects a steady trend of sales growth over the last 
year, reports from Rhode Island and Maine show no sustained pattern 
of gains or losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory levels are reported to be adequate in most parts of the 
region except Massachusetts, where one contact suggests that low 
inventories could lead to diminished sales in the rest of the year. 
New construction remains solid overall, and credit for consumers and 
builders is reported to be readily available. Contacts note signs of 
decline in real-estate-related employment in southern New England, 
with consolidation reported among brokers in Rhode Island and 
appraisers in Connecticut.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonbank Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District investment management firms report modest increases 
in assets under management since the beginning of the second 
quarter. Inflows into small company and growth funds were still 
positive despite the July correction in stock prices, but bond funds 
continued in net liquidation. Most respondents plan to increase 
employment during the rest of the year, but some report that it 
takes a long, time to fill open positions, particularly in the area 
of retirement planning.
