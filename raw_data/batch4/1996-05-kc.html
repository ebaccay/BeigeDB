      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district economy continued to grow at a moderate pace 
during the past month. Retail sales strengthened, manufacturing and 
homebuilding activity remained brisk, and activity in the energy 
industry increased slightly. In agriculture, farm income prospects 
weakened due to dry weather and weak profits in the cattle industry. 
District labor markets remained tight, with some manufacturers 
reporting rising wages for skilled labor. Prices of manufacturing 
materials and retail products generally held steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers report that sales increased moderately 
last month and remained above last year's levels Apparel sales were 
strong while furniture and appliance sales were weak. Reports were 
evenly divided on sales prospects for the months ahead, with some 
retailers expecting sales to hold steady and others expecting sales 
to strengthen modestly. Most retailers indicate inventories are in 
line with expected sales, although some plan to trim inventories. 
Automobile dealers also report sales increased last month and 
remained above the year-ago level. Dealers note that high consumer 
debt has eroded the quality of automobile loan applications. 
Nevertheless, sales are expected to remain strong, and most dealers 
are expanding automobile inventories in anticipation of continued 
sales strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers report that plants are 
operating at moderate to high levels of capacity use. Few 
manufacturers report production bottlenecks due to capacity 
constraints. Manufacturing materials remained readily available, and 
lead times required to obtain materials continued to decline. Nearly 
all of the manufacturers were trimming inventories, with some 
indicating the reduction was a normal seasonal occurrence.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most builders report starts of both single-family and 
multifamily homes held steady last month and remained well above 
last year's pace. Builders generally expect steady construction 
activity through the summer. Sales of new homes also held steady 
last month and stayed much stronger than last year's level. Builders 
report the inventory of unsold homes remained lean with home prices 
somewhat higher than the year-ago level. Building materials are 
readily available, although materials prices have increased slightly 
during the past year. Builders expect little change in materials 
availability or prices in coming months. Mortgage lenders report 
mortgage demand remained strong last month and should increase 
seasonally this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks generally report total deposits grew faster than 
loans last month, slightly lowering loan-deposit ratios. Most banks 
report gains in demand deposits, NOW accounts, MMDAs, small time and 
savings deposits, and IRA and Keogh accounts. Large CD deposits were 
steady. Banks also report gains in commercial and industrial loans, 
home mortgages, home equity loans, and commercial real estate loans. 
Consumer loans and construction loans held steady, and agricultural 
loans declined slightly. Security investments increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most banks held their prime rate steady last month, and few expect 
to change their prime rate in the near future. A few banks raised 
their consumer lending rates slightly, but most expect no change in 
the near term. Some banks also tightened their lending standards 
slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite strong energy prices, activity in the district 
energy industry picked up only slightly last month. Prices of 
natural gas and crude oil stayed well above year-ago levels, even 
though natural gas prices declined recently. The average number of 
drilling rigs operating in the district during the first three weeks 
of April rose slightly from the month before and matched last year's 
level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The driest winter and spring in decades has hurt yield 
prospects for the district's winter wheat crop. Among district 
states, the drought is most severe in Oklahoma and Kansas, where 
about 60 percent of the crop is rated in poor or very poor 
condition. In Kansas, usually the nation's leading wheat producing 
state, current estimates suggest the harvest may be half as large as 
normal. The dry spring weather has been ideal for preparing fields 
for the district's spring-planted crops, but concerns are growing 
that a continued dry spell could also trim corn and soybean yields.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large supplies of beef and competing meats continue to hold down 
cattle prices, while soaring grain prices boost feed costs. As a 
result, many district cattle feedlots and ranches are operating at a 
loss. With financial losses accumulating and forage supplies limited 
by the continued dry weather, some district ranchers have begun to 
reduce the size of their herds.
     </p>
     <p>
      District bankers generally expect the quality of their agricultural 
loan portfolios to weaken somewhat in 1996. High grain prices will 
help offset crop losses caused by the drought, shoring up incomes 
for grain producers. But bankers expect profits to be scarce in the 
district cattle industry in 1996. Overall, district bankers expect 
strong balance sheets to enable most farmers and ranchers to 
withstand the rough year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although labor markets remained tight in much of 
the district, employers report few wage increases. Some retailers 
report a shortage of available workers, but wages have held steady 
since a normal annual increase at the beginning of the year. 
Manufacturers report shortages and rising wages for some kinds of 
skilled labor, especially welders and machinists. Prices of 
manufacturing inputs were generally flat during the past month, 
although several manufacturers report a decline in steel prices. 
Prices at the retail level held steady last month but remained 
somewhat higher than last year's level.
