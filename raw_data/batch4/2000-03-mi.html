      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis

      <strong>
       March 8, 2000
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      As spring approaches, the Ninth District 
            economy continues to look very strong. Construction, manufacturing 
            and consumer spending remain robust, energy and iron mining are making 
            a rebound, and even agriculture shows some signs of improvement. Of 
            the major industries, only tourism exhibits little growth. The economic 
            strength continues to be reflected in labor markets, which remain 
            tight, and with businesses reporting some wage pressures. However, 
            while input prices have been rising, there are still few signs of 
            accelerating inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Construction 
              and Real Estate
      </b>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction remains bustling. Contract awards for construction 
              projects in Minnesota and the Dakotas increased over 20 percent 
              for the three-month period ending in January compared to a year 
              earlier. A materials supplier in Great Falls, Mont., is unusually 
              busy this winter, partially due to favorable weather for building. 
              A commercial real estate firm reports that the downtown Minneapolis 
              retail and entertainment sector is expected to expand with the addition 
              of new hotels and increased residential development.
      <p>
       Residential construction is also strong. Due to 
              low vacancy rates, the outlook for Minneapolis/St. Paul apartment 
              building is promising, according to a commercial real estate firm. 
              Rental rates are up about 10 percent in the Minneapolis/St. Paul 
              area compared to a year earlier. Home prices finished 1999 up 5 
              percent to 9 percent compared to a year earlier for several district 
              cities, including a 9.3 percent climb in Minneapolis/St. Paul. District 
              housing units authorized in 1999 finished with the second highest 
              fourth quarter of the decade.
       <p>
        <b>
         Consumer Spending
        </b>
        <br/>
        Retailers remain optimistic about current and prospective sales. 
              A major Minneapolis/St. Paul-based discount and department store 
              retailer reports same-store earnings for January up 5.7 percent 
              compared to a year earlier. Electronics retailers in Billings, Mont., 
              expect 12 percent gains in 2000 compared to last year, according 
              to a Helena branch director. South Dakota new car and truck registrations 
              are up 10 percent for January from a year earlier. A Montana dealership 
              reports sales up 20 percent for January compared to a year ago.
        <p>
         Tourism is expected to finish flat overall, with 
              gains in areas with normal or above normal snowfall, and losses 
              where snowfall came late in the season. A ski area in northern Montana 
              reports excellent snow conditions and a 35 percent increase in business 
              compared to last year. In contrast, tourism businesses in parts 
              of Minnesota with light snow cover are concerned. Below normal snowfall 
              in South Dakota has stifled winter sports. "We would have a lot 
              more business if we had more snow," says a tourism official.
         <p>
          <b>
           Manufacturing
          </b>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing in the Ninth District remains strong, although some 
              weakness is reported in North Dakota. A January purchasing manager 
              survey by Creighton University indicates languishing manufacturing 
              conditions in North Dakota; however, the same survey reports a strong 
              manufacturing sector in Minnesota and South Dakota. Examples include 
              a 50 percent increase in sales from a year ago for a Minnesota construction 
              materials producer, a 5 percent increase in sales from year-earlier 
              levels for an industrial equipment company and strong sales at a 
              Wisconsin industrial glass maker. In addition, a diecasting component 
              manufacturer plans to build a new plant in the Upper Peninsula of 
              Michigan. "The outlook for investment in plants is substantially 
              stronger than earlier in the year," notes a bank director. In contrast, 
              a North Dakota pasta cooperative reports it is shutting down its 
              plant, and a Minnesota printing plant and a metal processing facility 
              plan to close this year due to industry consolidation.
          <p>
           <b>
            Mining and Energy
           </b>
           <br/>
           The iron ore industry has rebounded from its slump, while Montana 
              gold mining continues to struggle. An iron ore industry spokesperson 
              reports full production and strong demand. November iron ore production 
              was 1.5 percent above year ago levels, while inventory levels are 
              down 16 percent from a year ago. In Montana, a gold mine plans to 
              reduce production and lay off 70 workers.
           <p>
            Meanwhile, Ninth District oil exploration has 
              increased as oil prices have risen. In February, nine rigs were 
              operating in North Dakota compared to one a year ago. In addition, 
              estimated February oil production in North Dakota was up 5 percent 
              from year-ago levels. However, in Montana only three rigs were operating 
              compared to five a year ago and Montana oil production is down 9 
              percent from a year ago.
            <p>
             <b>
              Agriculture
             </b>
             <br/>
             "Government payments have again helped our local producers get through 
              another year," reports a North Dakota agricultural lender. Farmers' 
              financial condition continues to improve based on preliminary results 
              of the Ninth District's first quarter (February 2000) survey of 
              agricultural credit conditions. Farm income improved as 46 percent 
              of respondents reported that farm income is below normal levels 
              compared to 64 percent of fourth quarter 1999 survey respondents 
              and 86 percent of the third quarter 1999 respondents.
             <p>
              Looking ahead, a continued warm winter has farmers 
              worried about lack of snow coverage for winter grains and a possible 
              drought next summer as a result of dry soil conditions. Moreover, 
              some ranchers tell of problems getting water to their animals, but 
              the mild winter continues to reduce stress on livestock.
              <p>
               <b>
                Employment, Wages, and Prices
               </b>
               <br/>
               Labor markets remain taut. Shippers in Duluth, Minn., complain about 
              "sailing short," with a smaller crew than called for by union contract 
              during the past year. Minneapolis/St. Paul temporary employment 
              agencies are offering free training and starting to offer an array 
              of benefits.
               <p>
                Companies are still looking for workers. A telecommunications 
              company based in Superior, Wis., will add more than 300 jobs by 
              early March. A major electronics retailer based in Minneapolis/St. 
              Paul recently announced plans to add 2,000 workers at its headquarters 
              over the next five years.
                <p>
                 Wages continue to creep higher. An informal survey 
              of Upper Midwest businesses conducted in January reports that wages 
              are generally about 2 percent to 4 percent higher than last year. 
              A major Minneapolis/St. Paul-based airline increased the bonus pay 
              to mechanics with specialized licenses by $1.50 an hour; custodians 
              and cleaners received $500 bonuses. A Fargo, N.D., hospital is offering 
              $4,000 signing bonuses for registered nurses.
                 <p>
                  While overall prices are not accelerating, input 
              prices and transportation costs are increasing. Surveys of manufacturers 
              show that input prices are higher compared to a year earlier. The 
              Creighton University survey reports that an index of input prices 
              for January in Minnesota and South Dakota is almost twice as high 
              as a year ago. Through January, the Upper Midwest business survey 
              reports that an average of 41 percent of respondents over the past 
              five months have reported higher input prices compared to 22 percent 
              for the first eight months of 1999. Rising oil prices have affected 
              transportation costs, but businesses aren't showing noticeable concern.
