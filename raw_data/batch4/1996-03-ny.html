      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       Reports on Second District economic conditions were mixed, but on 
  balance were more positive than In recent months. Beginning with the 
  more upbeat developments, retail sales strengthened considerably in 
  February. Moreover, robust leasing activity led to improvement in 
  Manhattan's commercial real estate market. Finally, aggregate loan 
  demand has strengthened over the past two months. In contrast, 
  reports on homebuilding and manufacturing activity were mixed. The 
  market for new homes In the New York City-Northern New Jersey area 
  improved, while the upstate market did not. Conversely, 
  manufacturing output Increased in the Buffalo region but declined In 
  the New York City area during February.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        District retail sales strengthened In February, following 
  disappointing January results. Year-over-year comparable-store sales 
  gains ranged from +2 to +10 percent and averaged roughly 6 percent 
  in February, nearly twice January's average result. Nearly all 
  contacts report that February sales were on plan and inventories 
  were generally at desired levels. A broad range of products --
  including better apparel, home furnishings, and commodity 
  consumables -- sold well. Several retail contacts noted that 
  competitive price-cutting was widespread during January; in 
  contrast, February saw a return to more "normal" pricing patterns.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Construction &amp; Real Estate
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Manhattan's commercial real estate market improved in January. 
  Although leasing activity in Midtown Manhattan rose to a five month 
  high, the vacancy rate was virtually unchanged at 14.1 percent. In 
  Downtown Manhattan, leasing activity was fairly brisk for the third 
  month in a row, pushing the vacancy rate down to 24.9 percent in 
  January, from 25.1 percent in December and 25.4 percent in November.
         <p>
          The market for new homes has picked up in the New York City and 
  Northern New Jersey areas, but upstate New York's depressed market 
  showed no improvement. Homebuilders in the New York City area, which 
  includes Long Island and the lower Hudson Valley, report that sales 
  are higher than a year ago; one contact described the market as "perky". Similarly, contacts in Northern New Jersey report some 
  pickup in both traffic and buying activity in the past six weeks, 
  but this is compared to an exceptionally weak market in late 1995. 
  Also, some expressed concern that the pickup In activity may just be 
  a temporary spike, with the recent uptick in mortgage rates 
  motivating potential buyers with a sense of urgency.
          <p>
           Homebuilders in upstate New York report no recent improvement; they 
  say demand for new homes continues to be depressed by corporate and 
  government down-sizing and pervasive consumer pessimism. Moreover, 
  high inventories of unsold existing homes -- partly due to 
  corporations unloading homes of relocated employees onto the market 
  -- are pushing down prices and competing with the new-home market. 
  Only the low-end of the market, particularly subsidized units, is 
  performing reasonably well. Contacts in both New York and New Jersey 
  believe that the market is too weak to support any increase in 
  selling prices.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Manufacturing
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Buffalo area purchasing managers report steady growth in 
  manufacturing output in January and February. In contrast, 
  purchasers in the New York City area report a fairly sharp downturn 
  In local manufacturing activity in February (and a more modest 
  decline in activity outside the manufacturing sector). Both surveys 
  show commodity price pressures easing in February, continuing recent 
  trends.
            <p>
             Nearly two-thirds of District manufacturers polled in a recent 
  Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey expect unit sales to 
  increase over the next six months, with exports expected to grow 
  more rapidly than domestic sales. Ninety percent of the respondents 
  anticipate that prices will either remain unchanged or decline; 
  however, one-quarter reported that they had raised prices recently. 
  Wages are expected to rise 3 to 4 percent and capital spending will 
  be similar to that of 1995.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Other Business Activity
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Unemployment rates in the district were essentially unchanged in 
  January. New York State's rate held steady at 6.2 percent, while New 
  Jersey's rate edged down to 6.5 percent. Both states reported sharp 
  drops in payroll employment in January, but these were attributed to 
  temporary factors: a blizzard that hit during the survey week and a 
  building workers' strike in New York City.
              <p>
               Consumer confidence for the Middle Atlantic region (New York, New 
    Jersey, and Pennsylvania) rebounded in February, after falling to 
    its lowest level in more than 2 years. Still, residents remain 
    exceptionally pessimistic about job prospects. More large 
    corporations have announced workforce reductions in New York State: 
    TRW, General Electric, Nationwide, Bausch and Lomb, Pratt and 
    Lambert, Deluxe Corporation, Reader's Digest and UPS announced 
    layoffs totaling nearly 2,000 workers.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Financial Developments
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Demand for nearly all types of loans strengthened over the past two 
  months, according to a survey of senior loan officers at small and 
  medium-sized banks. In general, loan demand was stronger at more 
  than 25 percent of the banks surveyed and steady at over 55 percent. 
  The largest increase in activity occurred in the consumer loan 
  segment, with demand higher at nearly 45 percent of the banks and 
  steady at close to 40 percent. Refinancing activity for all types of 
  loans increased, and is now higher at approximately 40 percent of 
  the banks.
                <p>
                 Average loan rates were steady or lower at nearly all of the 
  reporting banks, resulting in a narrower spread between lending and 
  deposit rates at almost 65 percent of the banks. Loan delinquencies 
  were higher at 20 percent of the banks and steady at 70 percent, 
  with the nonresidential mortgage segment experiencing the largest 
  increase in delinquencies. Although several of the survey 
  participants tightened credit standards, nearly 60 percent of the 
  banks were just as or more willing to lend than they were two months 
  ago.
