       Overall Ninth District economic activity 
                increased in late August and September. Residential real estate, 
                manufacturing, agriculture, consumer spending and mining grew. 
                Meanwhile, tourism was mixed, and commercial real estate and energy 
                were down slightly. Labor markets were soft. Wage and price increases 
                were generally moderate; however, significant price increases 
                were noted in natural gas, freight and health insurance, with 
                decreases in gasoline.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial real estate activity was down. According to a local 
                business magazine, landlords of commercial property in the Minneapolis-St. 
                Paul area have recently offered generous incentives to prospective 
                tenants, such as payment for improvements, free furniture and 
                discounted monthly rent. In addition, contracts awarded for large 
                building projects in Minnesota and the Dakotas were down 3 percent 
                for the three-month period ending in August compared with the 
                same period a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Home building and residential real estate activity 
                grew. Housing units authorized in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area 
                were up 15 percent in September compared with last year. The number 
                of closed home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area was 25 percent 
                higher in August compared with a year ago, while the median home 
                sale price increased 9 percent. A Montana bank director reported 
                that real estate sales and prices have been up steadily in the 
                Bozeman area, with no immediate signs of a slowdown. Another bank 
                director noted that refinancing activity dropped significantly 
                during early September in southwestern Wisconsin, but signs of 
                recovery were seen by the end of the month.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall retail sales grew modestly. A major Minneapolis-based 
                department store and discount retailer reported same-store sales 
                in August up 5.7 percent compared with a year ago. A representative 
                of a nationwide retailer noted strong back-to-school sales at 
                stores in North Dakota. Storeowners in southwestern Montana reported 
                solid back-to-school sales activity. Two mall managers in North 
                Dakota reported recent sales about at last year's strong levels. 
                In southwestern Wisconsin, recent sales for men's and women's 
                apparel were soft, but jewelry sales were up from a year ago. 
                A representative of a Minnesota-based women's apparel retailer 
                expected September same-store sales to finish flat to up slightly. 
                Some store managers noted that federal tax rebate checks sent 
                to taxpayers with children may have helped strengthen sales. In 
                contrast, high-end stores in two Minneapolis-area malls reported 
                recent sales behind last year's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto sales were slower in September compared 
                with July and August. Showroom traffic was slow in September, 
                and truck orders were down in rural areas, according to an auto 
                dealers association representative in Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourism activity was mixed. Visits to Glacier 
                National Park were down significantly due to fires, while August 
                visits to Yellowstone National Park increased compared with July. 
                A bank director reported strong bookings for fall conferences 
                and the ski season at hotels in the Bozeman, Montana, area. Tourism 
                conditions were mixed among attractions in Minnesota, according 
                to a tourism official; summer tourism picked up in August relative 
                to a slow start earlier in the summer. In South Dakota visits 
                to Mount Rushmore increased about 5 percent in August compared 
                with a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity was up slightly. A September survey of 
                purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Nebraska) 
                indicated overall increased manufacturing activity in the Dakotas 
                and Minnesota. As evidence, a South Dakota video display producer 
                had the busiest fall season in the history of the company. A Minnesota 
                manufacturer of snowmobiles and ATVs plans to build a large research 
                and development site in the district. Advisory Council on Small 
                Business and Labor members reported generally increased manufacturing 
                production and orders. However, a large meat company announced 
                plans to close a processing plant in Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy and Mining
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the energy sector decreased slightly, and the mining 
                sector increased. September district oil and natural gas exploration 
                levels decreased slightly from mid-August. However, most major 
                district operating iron ore mines are producing at near capacity. 
                Metal prices firmed up, and several Montana mines plan to renew 
                or upgrade operations. "The future is looking better every day," 
                commented a Montana mining official.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural economic conditions improved in September from August. 
                The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported higher prices, as 
                Wisconsin farmers and ranchers were expected to receive 4 percent 
                more for milk and 6 percent more for beef cattle in September 
                compared with August. The district experienced a large harvest 
                of small grains, and winter wheat plantings have started. The 
                USDA reported big increases in wheat and oat yields, and production 
                in 2003 compared with 2002 for most district states. For example, 
                North Dakota's wheat production increased 46 percent from 2002 
                to 317 million bushels. Due to drought, which was eased somewhat 
                by September rains, row crop harvests started early this year. 
                The USDA reported mixed conditions for Minnesota's row crops, 
                as 30 percent of corn and 24 percent of soybeans were rated good, 
                while 29 percent and 33 percent, respectively, were rated poor 
                or very poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Labor markets were soft with some layoffs reported. In South Dakota 
                a computer manufacturer will lay off 650 workers by the end of 
                the year. In Minnesota, a computer-storage product manufacturer 
                recently cut about 150 jobs companywide, while a telecommunications 
                equipment and services company recently laid off 100 employees. 
                Also in Minnesota, a software company just announced plans to 
                cut 80 jobs, and an office product manufacturer laid off 55 workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, a mine opening in Montana will 
                likely create 400 jobs by year end. A temporary staffing agency 
                survey showed that 32 percent of employers in Minneapolis-St. 
                Paul expect to hire more workers during the fourth quarter and 
                13 percent expect to reduce payrolls. Last year 23 percent expected 
                to increase payrolls; 11 percent planned reductions. Initial claims 
                for unemployment insurance in Minnesota decreased 8 percent in 
                August compared with a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increases in wages and salaries were moderate. 
                For example, a teachers union in Minnesota recently agreed to 
                an average salary increase of 2.5 percent the first year and 1.2 
                percent the second year of a two-year contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Price increases were generally moderate, with 
                significant increases noted in health insurance, natural gas and 
                freight, while gasoline prices were down. Several members of the 
                Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor mentioned that overall 
                price increases were minimal, while health insurance rates increased 
                well over 10 percent in 2003, compared with last year. Natural 
                gas prices were recently 15 percent above last year's levels; 
                double-digit increases on fuel bills are expected this winter. 
                An owner of a trucking company in Montana reported that recent 
                freight rates were notably higher than a year ago. Gasoline prices 
                in Minnesota decreased 21 cents from mid-September to the end 
                of the month.
