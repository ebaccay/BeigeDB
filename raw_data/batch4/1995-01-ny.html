      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 18, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on District developments in recent weeks by and large 
indicated some improvement. Most retail contacts reported that 
holiday sales were on or slightly above their expectations and 
office leasing activity was sufficient to reduce the vacancy rates 
in several parts of the District. District unemployment rates fell 
sharply in December. Homebuilding activity, though, has been 
seasonally slow. Almost 90 percent of the senior loan officers 
surveyed at small and midsized banks reported steady or lower 
aggregate loan demand compared with two months earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retail contacts reported that holiday sales results 
were on or slightly above plan though their own targets were 
apparently lower than many analysts saw for the industry as a whole. 
The weak sales plans were at least in part based on lackluster sales 
of apparel and outerwear during much of October and November. As a 
result, some respondents had reduced their orders for soft goods 
prior to Thanksgiving, and all prepared for what several described 
as the most promotional holiday selling season they could remember. 
As a result, profit margins are expected to have suffered.
     </p>
     <p>
      The annual survey of the Retail Council of New York State found that 
sales gains throughout the state averaged 3 to 5 percent above the 
1993 level for the day-after-Thanksgiving through day-after-
Christmas period. Household durable goods, computers, VCRs, jewelry, 
accessories and in-line skates were some of the best-selling items. 
Individual retail contacts in the District reported over-the-year 
changes ranging from virtually flat to +8 percent during December. 
Inventories were generally in satisfactory shape by year-end with 
most contacts expecting to eliminate any excess amounts during 
January clearance sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilding activity has been seasonally slow in most of the 
District recently. Looking ahead, some contacts expressed concern 
that higher interest rates may become more of a deterrent in the 
spring (when buyer traffic typically picks up substantially) than 
they have been up to now. Others are apparently more optimistic as 
witnessed by the fact that several large, long-stalled projects have 
recently been revived in the District. These include waterfront 
developments in Jersey City and the Bronx as well as a townhouse 
project on Staten Island.
     </p>
     <p>
      While office leasing activity has reportedly slowed somewhat from 
earlier months, it was sufficient to reduce the vacancy rates in 
several parts of the District recently. In downtown Manhattan the 
office vacancy rate has moved down in each of the last three months 
after a jump in September, while in midtown Manhattan, the rate in 
December was a full percentage point lower then three months 
earlier. Among other areas reducing office vacancy rates between the 
third and fourth quarters were Fairfield County, Connecticut and, in 
New York State, Westchester County, where the rate fell more than 
two percentage points, and Nassau County. Office vacancy rates rose 
in the fourth quarter in Northern New Jersey and Suffolk County.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District unemployment rates fell sharply in December as New York's 
rate dropped to 5.4 percent from 6.3 percent in November and New 
Jersey's declined to 6.1 percent from 6.6 percent State unemployment 
rates are very volatile, however, and could bounce higher in the 
near future. There have been several recent announcements and 
reports which point to future job cuts. Chemical Banking plans to 
eliminate 3700 positions, 9 percent of its staff, and further 
layoffs are slated in the brokerage industry as well. Cutbacks and 
reduced profits in the financial industry have been cited as one 
major factor in the recent widening of New York City's budget gap. 
The City, New York State, and New Jersey all face budget gaps in the 
billions of dollars which at best will mean further declines in 
services and could involve additional employment cutbacks. Finally, 
as an outcome of the Macy-Federated merger, A&amp;S; will close its 
executive offices in Brooklyn, laying off some 650 employees there.
     </p>
     <p>
      On a more positive note, New York City was one of six cities chosen 
nationwide as urban empowerment zones, each of which will receive 
$100 million in social service grants and tax breaks for businesses 
located in the zones. In addition, KMart recently signed a lease to 
open its first Manhattan store--the latest of the chain stores 
making their first forays into the borough in response to lower 
rents and the enticement of population density.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Almost 90 percent of the senior loan officers surveyed at small and 
midsized banks in the District reported that aggregate loan demand 
was either steady or lower when compared with two months earlier. 
The residential mortgage and refinancing segments saw the largest 
declines in activity. About half of the banks experienced less 
residential mortgage demand while over three-fourths experienced 
lower or no refinancing activity. The commercial and industrial loan 
segment was the strongest, with over half of the survey participants 
reporting steady demand and about one-fourth reporting higher 
demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan rates are mainly higher or the same across all categories of 
lending. Almost all of the respondents noted that recent increases 
in deposit rates resulted in no change or a narrowing of the spread 
between the average lending and deposit rates. Of the senior loan 
officers surveyed, about 80 percent maintained and about 20 percent 
increased their willingness to originate various types of loans. 
Very few banks changed their credit standards, and almost all had 
stable or lower delinquency rates.
