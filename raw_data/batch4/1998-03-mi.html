      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance the Ninth District economy continues to show steady to 
strong growth in most sectors. But overall strength and booming 
urban areas are shaded slightly by slowing in nonurban areas of the 
district due to adverse weather and declining commodity prices.
      <p>
       Most sectors and households continue to enjoy a very strong economy. 
Construction and manufacturing are striding workhorses that continue 
to provide impetus to the economy as a whole. Retail sales of 
general merchandise are very strong. Oil and iron ore production 
levels are at decade highs. Banks reportedly have good loan volumes 
in a competitive environment. Unemployment is low and price 
pressures are scarce.
       <p>
        But declining prices for hogs, corn and soybeans combined with 
already low wheat prices and concerns about moisture availability 
have sharply curtailed farm profitability and optimism for the new 
year. Warm weather and poor snow cover hurt revenues for many winter 
recreation firms. Many businesses are cramped by labor shortages.
        <p>
         Manufacturing and Business Services 
Manufacturers generally report good orders. Medical electronics and 
devices continue strong in Minnesota. Machining, metal finishing, 
electronic instrumentation, printing, metal tubing and other firms 
in Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota also report good business. 
North Dakota firms producing specialized mining machinery and wiring 
harnesses and remanufacturing aircraft announced expansion plans. An 
insurance processing operation will employ 400 in Sioux Falls, S.D., 
and a software firm will hire 50 in Duluth, Minn. One computer 
materials plant employing 100 people will close as the parent firm 
streamlines operations.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          "Business building booming," was the headline for a Sioux Falls news 
story, but could have applied as well in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Eau 
Claire, Wis., Fargo, N.D., or other urban areas where industrial, 
commercial and office construction is very robust. "New home sales 
soaring," was the word in Minneapolis-St. Paul where January new 
permits ran 7.2 percent above 1997. Residential builders are busy 
and anticipate a good year in virtually every city over 10,000 
population, with the exception of a few in Montana. Publicly let 
building and infrastructure projects are running about even with 
last year's record pace.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Natural Resource Industries
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Oil output in North Dakota has risen to its highest point this 
decade, and drillers for both oil and gas in that state and Montana 
continue to benefit from a mild winter. However, while rig counts 
remain high compared to earlier in the decade, industry sources warn 
that dropping energy prices soon will curtail drilling since most 
wells in the district are high-cost relative to yield.
           <p>
            Lake Superior iron mines anticipate overall production slightly 
above the 16-year record output set in 1997, but express concern 
about how lower Asian currency values may boost U.S. imports of 
steel and steel-containing products from that region. One mine cut 
its projected output slightly and laid off some 20 workers. A 
Montana gold mine closed with the loss of nearly 300 jobs due to low 
gold prices and to unrelated financial problems in the parent firm.
            <p>
             Forest product output is expected to be largely steady in western 
areas of the district due to cutting constraints, but strong in 
Minnesota and Wisconsin as oriented strand board plants run at 
capacity to meet builders' demand. Paper production is described as 
steady to moderately stronger.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Agriculture
              </strong>
              <br/>
              "The mood among wheat farmers is pretty grim," says one Montana 
implement dealer. That observation has been true for several months, 
but recent declines in corn, soybean and hog prices have extended 
the region in which farmers are under financial stress. "The bloom 
sure came off the hog market in a hurry," says a southern Minnesota 
banker. Slaughter hog prices have dropped to the low $30 per cwt 
range, down 40 percent from a year ago and 20 percent from early 
December. Corn and soybean prices have also weakened from early 
winter, though relative to costs are still more favorable than that 
of wheat. Farmers in the western Dakotas and Montana are concerned 
about unusually small snowpacks, low reservoir levels and inadequate 
soil moisture.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Banking
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Pricing competition reportedly is intense. A senior correspondent 
banker remarks that "banks may have come to the point where they 
simply cannot lower prices." The competition for loans raises some 
bankers' concerns about future credit quality. Loan volume is good 
overall but there remains considerable variance by locality. Like 
loan demand, liquidity is good overall with substantial variation by 
locality.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Consumer Spending and Tourism
                </strong>
                <br/>
                "Retailers report strong February," headed a news article on sales 
by Minnesota-based national firms. The report cited warm weather as 
a positive factor for electronics, appliance, apparel and other 
consumer product sales nationwide. A regional chain also reported 
good sales, which is supported by reports from mall managers in 
urban areas. Several sources report softening sales in nonurban 
areas of the Dakotas and Montana.
                <p>
                 Vehicle sales remain mixed, with continued slowness in Montana and 
rural areas of the Dakotas. Minnesota and Wisconsin sales are 
reportedly "stable" and "a little above last year." "We aren't 
getting the benefits of mortgage refinancing that we did a few years 
ago," says one auto dealer. Unseasonable warmth and inconsistent 
snowfall across the district produced uneven results for tourism 
businesses. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a tourism official 
reports that the snowmobile season and some ski hills ended early 
due to lack of snow during February. A chamber of commerce in 
northern Wisconsin expects winter tourism to be 15 percent to 20 
percent lower than last year. While snowmobiling was stifled in 
northern Minnesota, a downhill ski resort expects a 10 percent 
increase for the season. Recent snowfall in South Dakota has boosted 
snowmobile traffic and inquiries to a local tourism office.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Employment, Wages and Prices
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  The recent headline "Newspapers reap bounty as classified ad volume 
soars," highlights one sector benefiting from extreme tightness in 
labor markets. Minneapolis-St. Paul newspapers have seen double-
digit increases in help-wanted ad revenues in each of the last three 
years. With unemployment rates at or near record lows, most urban 
businesses in the district feel labor market tightness in one way or 
another. While extensions of benefits, hiring bonuses and so forth 
are quite common, across-the-board wage and salary increases 
generally remain in the 2 percent to 4 percent range. Minneapolis-
St. Paul hourly earnings in manufacturing are about 2 percent above 
year-earlier levels.
                  <p>
                   Energy prices remain well below year-earlier levels. With such 
prices and with warm weather, household heating costs in most areas 
are the lowest in many years. Gasoline prices are down as much as 20 
cents per gallon from early 1997. Commodity and intermediate good 
prices are down or quiescent. Increased prices at the consumer level 
are relatively rare.
