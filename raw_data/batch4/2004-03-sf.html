      Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicate that the economy 
              continued to expand soundly in January and early February. Consumer 
              and producer prices generally were stable, although respondents 
              noted increases in some energy and material costs. Respondents indicated 
              that hiring activity in recent weeks was mixed, with moderate expansion 
              of payrolls in retail, construction, agriculture, and high-tech 
              manufacturing, and little new hiring in banking and the rest of 
              manufacturing. Wage and salary increases remained restrained, with 
              total compensation continuing to rise more noticeably. Sales of 
              retail merchandise showed modest growth. Manufacturing activity 
              in the District continued to improve, driven in part by an increase 
              in demand for information technology upgrades by firms. Business 
              conditions for cattle ranchers in the District recovered to some 
              extent in recent weeks as fears surrounding mad cow disease apparently 
              abated; other District agricultural and natural resource businesses 
              faced stable conditions. Respondents noted solid house price appreciation 
              and a brisk pace of new home construction in most District markets. 
              Commercial real estate markets stabilized further. Reports from 
              District banking contacts indicated that demand from businesses 
              for commercial and industrial loans improved slightly from the previous 
              survey period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      During the most recent survey period, District contacts generally 
              noted little change in prices other than for energy products and 
              certain raw material inputs, such as steel and nonferrous scrap 
              metal. Several respondents reported that stiff competition, particularly 
              among domestic businesses, continued to hold down final sales prices. 
              In the telecommunications industry, competition among rival technologies 
              and excess inventories restrained prices for wireline telecommunications 
              providers; cable service providers, on the other hand, were able 
              to increase prices somewhat after several months of flat rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage and salary pressures in the District remained modest in recent 
              weeks. The costs of medical and workers' compensation insurance 
              premiums rose further, however, particularly in California. According 
              to respondents, increases in non-wage labor costs generally constrained 
              hiring of full-time employees throughout the District, while hiring 
              of temporary workers strengthened further. Indeed, the division 
              of healthcare premium costs between employers and employees is a 
              central issue in the labor strikes among grocery workers in Southern 
              California and construction workers in Hawaii.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents indicated that hiring activity since the last survey 
              period was mixed. Contacts in banking and manufacturing, with the 
              exception of high-tech manufacturing, generally reported little 
              new hiring, while those in retail, construction, and agriculture 
              noted moderate increases in payrolls. Looking ahead, most contacts 
              expect little change in hiring activity in the near future, with 
              the exception of contacts in high-tech manufacturing and retail, 
              who expect the rate of hiring to pick up from its pace in recent 
              weeks. Those contacts expecting an increase in hiring generally 
              attributed it to improving business conditions. Those contacts expecting 
              no change or a slowing of hiring, though, generally pointed to productivity 
              gains stemming from the use of IT and other technologies which allow 
              businesses to meet product demand without substantial increases 
              in staffing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts indicated that sales of retail merchandise showed 
              modest growth in the most recent survey period, particularly for 
              mid-range department stores. An increase in consumer demand fueled 
              increases in unit sales despite somewhat less discounting by retailers; 
              inventory control generally was tight. Automobile dealers reported 
              that sales of new and used domestic brands slowed a bit, while sales 
              of imports performed better than domestic sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the services sector continued to improve 
              in the District. Demand strengthened for media and high-tech services. 
              The increased demand for high-tech services was reportedly due in 
              large part to replacement and upgrading of information technology 
              equipment by firms. Demand for preventative and outpatient healthcare 
              services edged up further. Conditions in the District travel and 
              tourism sector remained strong. Favorable snow conditions aided 
              winter tourism activity in several areas of the District. Hotel 
              occupancy rates improved and allowed many hotels to raise rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity picked up further in January and 
              early February. Sales of semiconductors and other high-tech products 
              strengthened, driven in part by increased business spending on information 
              technology upgrades. Low inventory and high capacity utilization 
              have led to modest increases in prices for these products. District 
              apparel makers reported increased new orders and expansion of inventory 
              levels, although capacity remained ample. The availability of raw 
              materials remained uncertain for some industries in recent weeks; 
              several manufacturers noted that prices for inputs, such as metals, 
              escalated as a result of short supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On balance, conditions in District agricultural markets remained 
              stable in the most recent survey period. Prices for beef have firmed 
              a bit in recent weeks, halting their steep decline following the 
              mad cow incident in the state of Washington; however, prices have 
              fluctuated recently due to uncertainty regarding export markets 
              for beef and beef products. Prices for most other agricultural goods 
              reportedly were stable and inventories generally remained in balance. 
              Agricultural exports were helped by the depreciation of the dollar 
              relative to several foreign currencies. In the energy sector, natural 
              gas producers operated at close to full capacity in recent weeks, 
              pushing up wholesale prices. Contacts indicate that large investments 
              are currently being made to expand generation capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District residential real estate markets generally were robust in 
              January and early February. According to contacts, a limited supply 
              of homes for sale combined with low mortgage interest rates led 
              to solid price appreciation, though there are signs that appreciation 
              may have slowed somewhat. Construction of new homes, particularly 
              low to moderately priced homes, expanded further in recent weeks 
              in most parts of the District. Contacts reported that skilled construction 
              workers, such as carpenters and cement masons, were scarce in some 
              areas. In Hawaii, the strike by workers of major concrete firms 
              in early February reportedly delayed construction of major residential, 
              retail, and public sector projects. As for commercial real estate, 
              office vacancies and lease rates improved slightly in most District 
              markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported conditions in the banking sector to be generally 
              healthy and stable in January and early February. Several respondents 
              indicated that demand for commercial and industrial loans was up 
              modestly from the previous survey period. As for residential real 
              estate, contacts reported that mortgage loan volume, particularly 
              for refinancings, was unusually low in December and January, though 
              activity was higher than expected in early February.
