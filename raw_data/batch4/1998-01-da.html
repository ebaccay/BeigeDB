      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In December and early January, Eleventh District economic activity 
grew at a slightly slower pace than reported in the last Beige Book. 
While prices of most manufactured products were flat or down, 
services and some construction-related industries saw price 
increases. Manufacturing and retail firms reported slightly slower 
sales growth, while service industries said sales growth was up.
Most contacts anticipate- but have not seen-effects from the Asian 
crisis; a few attributed recent price and sales declines to the 
situation. Energy and construction activity remained strong. Loan 
demand was unchanged, and agricultural conditions remained 
favorable.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       With the exception of food and some construction-related products, 
most goods-producing contacts reported prices decreased or remained 
steady. In contrast, service industry contacts reported rising 
prices. Contacts in the lumber, retail apparel, paper and metal 
industries expect the Asian crisis to cause price declines in coming 
months.
       <p>
        Prices of poultry, feed grain, beef, pork loin, pine lumber, memory 
chips, crude oil and refining products were reported to be down. A 
few retailers reported they are also seeing lower prices for a 
variety of Asian imports. Contacts attributed much of the decline in 
memory chip prices to worldwide excess capacity, but also believed 
events in Asia played a role. Contacts reported crude oil prices 
were hit hard by unseasonably mild weather, the resumption of Iraqi 
oil sales, and expectations of a decline in Asian demand. Crude oil 
prices, which averaged $21 to $22 per barrel in October, slipped to 
about $17 by early January. Retail gasoline, heating oil and natural 
gas prices were also reported to be down.
        <p>
         Prices of primary and fabricated metals, plastics, petrochemicals, 
telecommunications products, and paper were generally flat. 
Petrochemical prices held steady despite the addition of three 
ethylene facilities over the past month because strong construction 
activity in late 1997 depleted inventories of construction-related 
plastic products and the petrochemicals from which they are
made.
         <p>
          Prices increased over the past six weeks for fruits, vegetables, 
some processed foods, hardwoods, brick and cement. Food industry 
contacts reported prices rose because of a cold snap which knocked 
out 80 percent of Mexico's crops. Contacts reported that high levels 
of construction activity led to increased cement prices and 
shortages of skilled workers in construction and construction-
related industries. Brick and hardwood lumber producers said wage 
increases fed through to product price increases of 2 percent to 3 
percent since the last survey.
          <p>
           Service-producing contacts reported increases in prices in the past 
six weeks. Passenger airlines reported unusually high demand for the 
post-Christmas season, with record load factors and an 8-percent 
fare increase. Service sector growth translated into increased 
recruiting of skilled and semiskilled workers, higher compensation, 
and in most cases, higher prices, although there were some reports 
of squeezed profit margins.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Manufacturing
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Growth in sales was slightly lower for manufactured products. Sales 
of semiconductors and heating fuels, and some construction 
materials-such as fabricated metals, cement and some lumber 
products-softened slightly over the last six weeks. Economic turmoil 
in Asia reduced sales of some manufactured products, particularly 
semiconductors, but the magnitude of the effect is not yet known. 
One semiconductor producer noted that, while his revenue forecasts 
have not changed significantly, the uncertainty surrounding the 
forecasts has increased sharply because of events in Asia. However, 
manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and lower-priced 
microprocessors reported continued, steady growth. Sales of products 
used in residential construction rose slightly. Shipments of paper 
products are down seasonally, but strong year-over-year, and 
inventories remain low. Sales of apparel increased. Warm weather 
reduced sales of heating oil and natural gas (and increased 
inventories) but also stimulated unusually strong winter gasoline 
sales.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Services
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Business service firms reported an increase in activity late last 
year driven by strength in mergers and acquisitions, real estate 
transactions, banking and manufacturing. Business service contacts 
expect reduced demand from customers who export to Asia. Freight 
forwarders reported a decline in export tonnage. Domestic cargo 
shipments remained strong. Although some contacts reported improved 
rail service during the past six weeks, others saw little 
improvement in bottlenecks.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Retail Sales
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Retailers reported that sales were slow in the first part of 
December but picked up strongly right before and right after 
Christmas. Contacts indicated that overall sales were less than in 
previous years, partly because of increased competition. Retailers 
also reported sales were lower because consumers now spread their 
purchases over the entire year and spend more of their income on
leisure activities. Retailers said inventories have been in good 
shape for some time, and as a result, markdowns have not been big.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Financial Services
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Loan activity kept a constant pace, contrary to some respondents' 
previous expectations of slowing in the fourth quarter. Competition 
for commercial loans remained strong but eased for consumer loans. 
Delinquency rates remained stable "at comfortable levels." 
Preliminary reports were mixed about the use of home equity loans 
that became available in Texas at the first of the year. Consumers 
and bankers were still learning the details of the new law.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Construction and Real Estate
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Construction and real estate activity continued to expand, led by 
increases in residential and office construction. Despite increased 
construction, strong sales of single family homes left inventories 
low. Builders of lower-priced starter homes reported that lower 
interest rates are stimulating sales. Office rents continued to rise 
sharply, and similar increases are expected in 1998. Although 
current construction is expected to be absorbed, an increase in 
speculative building left some contacts concerned about possible 
overbuilding in the future. Pre-leasing was down in the industrial 
real estate market, but demand was expected to keep pace with new 
supply through 1998.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Energy
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 Demand for oil field services remained very strong, with continued 
reports of inadequate capacity. Weak energy prices had not yet 
affected drilling activity, and are not expected to do so unless 
prices fall to less than $17 per barrel for a sustained period.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Agriculture
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  Overall agricultural conditions remained favorable. Small grain 
production benefited from wet weather in most areas. In the northern 
portion of the District, however, snow and cold temperatures hurt 
some livestock operations.
