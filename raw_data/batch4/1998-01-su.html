      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Federal Reserve Districts reported that as 1997 came to a close the 
pace of economic growth continued to be moderate. After a slow start 
in early December, retail sales gathered momentum in the days before 
Christmas and during the post-holiday weeks. Overall, retail sales 
for the holiday season were mainly at or slightly above 
expectations. Motor vehicle sales picked up at yearend due mainly to 
strong sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans, and light trucks. 
Manufacturing activity remained fairly strong, although some 
Districts reported signs of easing. Construction and real estate 
markets were strong at yearend, with tight markets for office and 
industrial space in several regions. Some Districts reported 
evidence of more speculative construction in response to
increasing rental rates. Lending activity was brisk throughout the 
nation despite softer demand for consumer loans. Agriculture reports 
were generally favorable, although adverse weather has hurt 
livestock production in some Districts. The impact of Asian 
financial turmoil was felt in most Districts. Manufacturers and 
agricultural firms report weaker exports to Asia, and there was some 
evidence of increased competition from Asian products in U.S. 
markets. Despite lower prices, oil and natural gas drilling activity 
was strong last month.
      <p>
       Labor markets remained tight or very tight in all Districts. Reports 
of firms scaling back production or expansion plans due to labor 
shortages were more common. Some Districts reported increased wage 
pressures, particularly for retail workers and some skilled 
occupations. According to business respondents, prices were 
generally flat due to intense competition and lower import prices.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most Districts reported that retail sales were slow in early 
December but picked up strongly during the days before Christmas and 
during post-holiday sale events. With few exceptions, holiday sales 
met or slightly exceeded expectations. Retailers noted that sales of 
electronics, computers, appliances, and jewelry were particularly 
strong. Some merchants reported disappointing sales of winter-
related items, such as snow-blowers and winter clothing, due to 
unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country. Post-holiday 
inventories were at desired levels. The tourism industry posted 
strong holiday results, with hotels operating at record high 
occupancy rates in areas such as New York, Boston, Florida, and 
California. Ski resorts, however, reported problems due to lack of 
snow.
        <p>
         Automobile dealers enjoyed good overall results last month, although 
sales were mixed across vehicle categories. Sales of sport utility 
vehicles, minivans, and light trucks remained stronger than sales of 
passenger cars.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing activity remained fairly strong, although some 
Districts showed signs of easing. Boston and Philadelphia reported 
manufacturing activity improved last month, while New York and 
Dallas noted weaker performance for the sector. Richmond reported a 
sharp slowdown in activity. Strong demand, production, shipments, 
and new orders were reported for aircraft parts, telecommunication 
and computer-related products, capital goods, and automobiles. In 
most Districts, the Asian financial turmoil started to have some 
impact on manufacturing activity. Some Districts reported weaker 
export demand for industrial equipment, building materials, aircraft 
parts, semiconductors, processed food, and some metals. There was 
also some evidence of increased Asian competition in the domestic 
market. Manufacturers in several regions expressed concern that the 
Asian turmoil and the overall strength of the dollar might hurt 
sales and profits in 1998.
          <p>
           Labor availability remained a major concern in most Districts. 
Manufacturers continued to report difficulties in hiring skilled 
technical workers, such as engineers. Some contacts in the St. Louis 
District could not meet demand because of a shortage of workers, and 
a major producer of high-tech equipment in the Chicago District had 
to cancel some projects because of the shortage of engineers.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Construction and Real Estate
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Construction activity and real estate markets remained strong in 
most parts of the nation. The only two exceptions were Atlanta and 
Kansas City. New home sales in the Atlanta District were flat-to-
down compared to last December, while construction activity was 
spotty. In the Kansas City District housing starts were down 
slightly last month.
            <p>
             Low and declining vacancy rates for retail, office, and other 
commercial space in urban areas began to put upward pressure on 
rental rates. Evidence of some speculative construction was cited by 
Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas as a response to persistently 
strong demand for commercial and industrial space.
             <p>
              The housing market remained strong in most regions. Unseasonably 
warm weather in many areas of the country boosted traffic and sales 
of new homes above their average December levels. Housing markets 
showed further signs of strength in New York and Dallas and a slight 
rebound in Chicago. In the Minneapolis District a fast construction 
pace became the norm.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Banking and Finance
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Lending activity was brisk in most Districts, led by strong demand 
for commercial loans and mortgages. New York reported small to 
medium-sized banks faced softer demand for loans, especially for 
consumer loans and residential mortgages. Minneapolis reported that 
demand for bank loans was softening after a very strong 1997.
               <p>
                Most Districts reported that demand for mortgage refinancing was 
strong due to falling mortgage rates but that demand for consumer 
loans remained sluggish. New York, Cleveland, and Dallas noted that 
loan delinquency rates declined or stabilized at moderate levels.
                <p>
                 Lenders in most Districts reported that strong competition was 
reducing the spread between borrowing and lending rates, 
particularly for quality borrowers. In contrast, contacts in 
Richmond indicated that pricing spreads had been maintained. In 
general, lending standards were unchanged in most of the Districts.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  The agriculture reports were generally favorable, although 
performance was mixed across crops and livestock. Favorable crop 
conditions were reported by Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and 
Minneapolis. Winter wheat and small grain crops appeared to be in 
good shape. Crop harvesting was near completion in the Richmond 
District, and contacts there suggested that yields of most crops 
might fall short of 1996 levels. Chicago noted that farm prices for 
many key Midwest commodities have declined recently, which may hurt 
farm earnings in 1998. Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco 
reported that some agricultural producers were concerned that Asian 
turmoil will lead to weaker farm exports in 1998.
                  <p>
                   In the livestock sector, Kansas City and Minneapolis reported 
favorable conditions, while Dallas reported that snow and cold 
temperatures hurt some livestock operations. San Francisco also 
reported herd losses due to unfavorable weather and grazing 
conditions, particularly in the mountain states. Chicago noted that 
a seasonal rise in domestic hog marketings and a bulge in hog
imports from Canada contributed to a decline in U.S. hog prices.
                   <p>
                    Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported strong drilling 
activity for oil and natural gas last month despite weak energy 
prices. Minneapolis noted that output for iron ore and most forest 
products may stabilize in 1998 after strong or moderate growth in 
the last two years. San Francisco reported that a number of western 
mines had shut down operations due to falling gold prices.
                    <p>
                     <strong>
                      Labor Markets, Wages and Prices
                     </strong>
                     <br/>
                     All Districts reported that labor markets were tight or very tight 
last month. Although labor shortages appeared to be broad-based, 
some skilled workers were in especially short supply. Most areas 
noted problems in finding computer-related workers, construction 
skilled tradesmen, and technicians. Shipbuilders in New Orleans were 
looking to hire foreign welders, shipfitters, electricians, and 
others. A company in Nashville was forced to idle more than 10 
percent of its equipment due to labor shortages. In the Chicago 
District some projects were canceled due to a lack of labor, while 
in the St. Louis District some contacts were unable to meet 
production schedules due to labor problems. Some businesses in the 
Cleveland District increased their recruiting efforts, resulting in 
higher demand for human resources personnel.
                     <p>
                      Some Districts reported increased wage pressures, especially for 
some specific industries and skilled occupations. Boston and 
Richmond reported upward wage pressures in the retail sector. Boston 
also noted that some manufacturers began offering double-digit pay 
increases in categories such as engineering. San Francisco reported 
that wage and salary pressures remained high in financial 
institutions. Some employers in the Dallas District began offering 
higher compensation for skilled and semiskilled workers in the 
service sector and for skilled workers in construction, fabricated 
metals, bricks and lumber. Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis 
reported that wage pressures were generally being held in check, 
with more significant wage pressures confined to specific skilled 
workers.
                      <p>
                       Most Districts suggested that employers continued to be creative in 
finding and recruiting additional labor. Some companies were 
subsidizing transportation for employees located far away from their 
work sites. Employers in several Districts adopted flexible work 
schedules and more generous benefit packages.
                       <p>
                        While reports of price changes for goods and services were mixed, 
prices overall remained generally flat. At the retail level, many 
Districts reported that most of the holiday sales occurred late in 
the season at large discount levels. Richmond reported that prices 
in the retail, service, and manufacturing sectors grew at a somewhat 
slower pace than in the last report, except for soaring
prices for starter homes in a specific area of North Carolina. 
Manufacturers in most areas reported stable prices for their inputs 
and final goods, due to intense competition and lower import prices. 
Minneapolis noted that manufacturers of intermediate goods continued 
to receive pressure from customers to lower prices. Tourism appeared 
to be an exception from the overall price picture, with Boston, New 
York, and Atlanta reporting higher rates for hotel rooms. Higher 
rental rates were also reported for commercial and industrial space 
in many urban areas.
