     Eleventh District economic activity remained 
            weak in January and the first half of February. Retail sales improved 
            some, but other service-sector activity continued to be sluggish, 
            and manufacturing activity was weak. Construction and real estate 
            activity continued to soften. Energy activity showed signs of bottoming 
            out, but many contacts fear a collapse in natural gas prices could 
            lead to future declines. Respondents in the financial services industry 
            have lowered their expectations for loan demand, but note that consumer 
            lending has held up better than expected. Agricultural conditions 
            remained dry.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <p>
      <b>
       Prices and Labor Markets
      </b>
      <br/>
      There were some signs of increasing price pressures in the service 
              sector, but prices were mostly unchanged or lower in the manufacturing 
              and energy industries. Continued weak global demand and very warm 
              weather in the United States have pushed down most energy prices 
              despite stability in the price of crude. November 2001 through January 
              2002 was the second warmest ever recorded in the United States. 
              Crude oil prices were pushed up to near $20 per barrel in January 
              after OPEC and non-OPEC countries reduced production. Some contacts 
              expressed concern that if global demand does not pick up soon, OPEC 
              unity will be tested severely and a price collapse could follow. 
              U.S. crude inventories are 33 percent higher than last year, and 
              heating oil inventories are 23 percent higher than a year ago. There 
              is still too much petrochemical capacity, and downward pressure 
              on prices continues. Chemical inventories are very low because customers 
              expect prices to fall further. Warm weather has limited demand for 
              natural gas and left storage facilities very full. Companies that 
              hold natural gas in storage will not want to hold the gas over the 
              summer, and many contacts expect serious downward pressure on natural 
              gas prices in the Spring. Paper producers say that selling prices 
              continue to fall because of excess capacity in the industry.
      <p>
       Many industries continue to report rising costs 
              for all types of insurance. Security costs are also rising, particularly 
              for the airline industry. Contacts in several industries note that 
              stiff competition has prevented these cost increases from being 
              passed along to consumers. While labor markets have loosened, many 
              firms say competition remains stiff for quality workers and wages 
              are increasing for those employees.
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        Manufacturing activity remained weak. Producers of fabricated metals 
              said demand continued to be very slow, while producers of primary 
              metals, brick and tile reported a drop in demand over the past 8 
              weeks. Paper producers say sales are still sluggish. One contact 
              noted that a lot of manufacturing has moved offshore, reducing demand 
              for packaging materials produced domestically. Demand for glass, 
              cement and concrete and food products was unchanged. Apparel producers 
              reported an increase in sales over the past 8 weeks, because retailers 
              are restocking after clearing out inventories during Christmas. 
              Still more layoffs were announced in the apparel industry as the 
              industry continues to move to lower cost off shore locations.
        <p>
         The high-tech industry reported that sales continued 
              to bounce around the bottom of the cycle. While most respondents 
              believe a recovery has begun, it is expected to be very slow. Demand 
              for telecommunications products was still very weak, particularly 
              in Europe, and sales of personal computers continued to be "anemic." 
              Inventories are lean across high-tech industries, according to contacts.
         <p>
          Demand for petrochemicals and refined products 
              remained weak. Some refineries have announced cuts in production 
              while others have begun early turnarounds to produce gasoline for 
              the spring and summer.
          <p>
           <b>
            Services
           </b>
           <br/>
           Activity in the service sector continued to be sluggish, although 
              there were some areas of improvement. Temporary service firms said 
              that demand for workers remained down, particularly to supply manufacturing 
              and light industrial positions. Demand was strong, however, for 
              workers to staff administrative and clerical positions, the banking 
              and retail industries, as well as some professional services. Legal 
              contacts say transactional activity, particularly venture capital, 
              is slower than a year ago, but other types of business activity 
              is starting to improve. Litigation and bankruptcy work remained 
              strong. Accounting firms say activity remained strong for auditing 
              and taxes but consulting work had declined. Demand for transportation 
              services was still weak, but is showing signs of slowly improving 
              from the very depressed level a couple of months ago.
           <p>
            <b>
             Retail Sales
            </b>
            <br/>
            Retail sales improved some in February from a very weak January. 
              Contacts say this is a difficult time of year to infer trends from 
              sales data and remain conservative with their purchases despite 
              recent signs of a pick up. Retailers are happy that inventories 
              have been drawn down. One contact explained that stronger-than-expected 
              sales could result in a brief price spike which they would prefer 
              to having too much inventory. Auto sales have been solid and better 
              than expected following the low interest rate deals from last year. 
              Inventories are a little high and the average gross profit on auto 
              sales is down.
            <p>
             <b>
              Financial Services
             </b>
             <br/>
             Loan demand declined seasonally as expected at levels slightly lower 
              than a year ago. While contacts have generally lowered their expectations 
              for activity, they note that consumer lending has been stronger 
              than expected. Commercial and industrial lending has been flat to 
              moderately positive. Credit conditions are mostly unchanged, with 
              only a couple of contacts reporting an increase in delinquencies. 
              Credit standards remained stable since the last survey, according 
              to contacts, and are not expected to change in the near future.
             <p>
              <b>
               Construction and Real Estate
              </b>
              <br/>
              Activity remained weak over the past 8 weeks. There was a slight 
              uptick in leasing activity in the Dallas area, stimulated by free 
              rent and other incentives. Contacts say long-term leases are only 
              being signed with deep financial concessions. Rents have declined 
              20 percent and are not expected to increase this year. The Houston 
              market has been jolted by the sudden addition of substantial office 
              space, leading to uncertainty about how low the occupancy rate could 
              fall.
              <p>
               Residential activity is still weak, and potential 
              homebuyers continue to back out of deals, according to contacts. 
              Existing home inventories have risen as people continue to leave 
              houses they can not afford. Demand for multifamily housing is also 
              weak and concessions are prevalent. Demand remains solid, however, 
              for lower priced homes.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Energy
                </b>
                <br/>
                US drilling activity showed signs of bottoming out in recent weeks, 
              but there are concerns about future declines. Some projects are 
              being delayed and contacts say the possibility of a collapse in 
              natural gas prices could lead to a decline of as many as 150 rigs. 
              International drilling is also seeing some delays, although day-rates 
              for rigs in the deep Gulf and key international markets continue 
              to hold up well.
                <p>
                 <b>
                  Agriculture
                 </b>
                 <br/>
                 Overall conditions remained dry despite heavy precipitation in mid-February. 
              Land preparation for corn and cotton is proceeding on schedule except 
              in a few areas where producers had to wait for the ground to dry 
              out. Despite low prices and a large surplus of cotton, farmers are 
              continuing to plant as if it was a normal year. Ranchers are reducing 
              livestock herds because dry conditions have prevented pastures from 
              reaching their usual winter production levels.
