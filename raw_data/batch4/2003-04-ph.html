      <p>
       Business conditions in the Third District softened in April. Manufacturers 

  reported declines in shipments and new orders compared with March. Retail sales 

  of general merchandise in early April were running below the rate set in the 

  same period a year ago, and sales of automobiles and light trucks were off as 

  well. Bank lending was edging up, with slight gains in business and residential 

  real estate lending. Business conditions for most of the service firms contacted 

  in the first half of April were virtually flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook in the Third District business community is cautious. Manufacturers 

  forecast some increases in shipments and orders during the next six months despite 

  the current weakness, but contacts in other sectors are less optimistic. Retailers 

  have mixed views. Some expect sales to improve soon, but others believe consumers 

  will continue to limit spending. Auto dealers expect a lower sales rate in 2003 

  compared with 2002. Bankers generally expect business and consumer loan demand 

  to rise very slowly in the next few months, but they anticipate a decrease in 

  residential real estate lending. Employment agencies forecast very modest increases 

  in hiring in the second quarter, mainly by financial services firms, but they 

  anticipate little change in employment in other sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District manufacturers reported declining orders and shipments in mid-April, 

  in a continuation of the slackening in demand for their products that they noted 

  in March. Most of the firms contacted for this report said the decrease in orders 

  set in before the start of combat in Iraq, although some noted drops in orders 

  after it had begun. Order backlogs continued to shrink in April, and local plants 

  trimmed working hours. Although conditions in the region's manufacturing sector 

  remained weak, some firms that produce lumber and metal products reported rising 

  orders, mainly for goods and materials used in home construction and remodeling. 

  Most area manufacturers indicated that prices for both the inputs they use and 

  the goods they manufacture have been steady, although many said they are paying 

  more for gasoline and other fuels and for petroleum-based products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the persistence of weak conditions, the region's manufacturers forecast 

  better business ahead. Over half of the firms surveyed in April expect increases 

  in orders and shipments during the next six months, and only one in ten anticipate 

  decreases. Area manufacturers' capital spending plans call for increases, on 

  balance, although half of the firms polled in April indicated their capital 

  expenditures will be steady. Few firms were planning major expansions, and several 

  noted that outlays for new equipment in the immediate future will be on an as-needed 

  basis only.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District retailers reported lower store traffic and slower sales in late 

  March and early April compared with the same period a year ago. The decline 

  in sales has affected all lines of merchandise. Store executives said a combination 

  of unseasonably cold weather, deteriorating consumer confidence about the economy, 

  and the war in Iraq has dampened consumer spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking ahead, store executives have mixed views. Some believe the spring season 

  will bring an upturn in sales once normal weather prevails and the conflict 

  in Iraq subsides, but others are concerned that consumers will continue to limit 

  spending until there are positive signs that the economy is improving. Retailers 

  said they were fully stocked with spring merchandise, as is usual at this time 

  of year, and they do not anticipate making extensive price reductions unless 

  sales in the weeks ahead fall significantly below their current expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto dealers generally indicated that sales were down in April compared with 

  March and with April of last year. Although a few dealers saw some continuing 

  strength in demand for new cars, most said sales have been on the decline and 

  inventories have increased. Some dealers said that sales of large sport utility 

  vehicles have been particularly weak since gasoline prices have risen. Although 

  some manufacturers have stepped up incentives, dealers in the region anticipate 

  sales for this year as a whole will fall as much as 5 percent from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks has barely grown in recent weeks. 

  Bankers generally reported slight gains in business loans and residential real 

  estate lending but virtually no growth in consumer lending. Bankers noted that 

  business firms and individuals have been very cautious about adding to their 

  indebtedness. Bank lending officers generally reported that commercial loan 

  quality has been steady, although some said they have become concerned about 

  the financial conditions of some commercial real estate owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investment companies indicated that cash inflow in the past few months has 

  been running significantly below the pace during the same period a year ago. 

  Individual investors continue to prefer bonds to equities, and they appear to 

  be favoring savings accounts over money market funds due to the higher rates 

  available from depository institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers in the Third District generally expect lending to businesses and individuals 

  to grow very slowly in the near term, and they anticipate a decline in residential 

  real estate lending along with lower home sales this year compared with last 

  year. Investment companies expect continued reluctance by individual investors 

  to increase the amount of their investments in stocks, but they believe institutional 

  investors might step up their equity investing later this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most of the service firms contacted in April reported little change in activity 

  in recent weeks. Demand for information technology services has increased somewhat, 

  mainly from government agencies, according to contacts in this industry, while 

  demand from the commercial sector has been flat. Other types of business services 

  firms generally indicated that they have had little or no growth in activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employment agencies in the region reported that hiring plans among their client 

  firms call for some increases in the second quarter but not strong gains. The 

  best prospects for increased employment are among financial services firms, 

  according to employment agencies, while most other sectors are expected to see 

  little change in employment.
