     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 13, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District is stilt experiencing growth in many sectors but 
softness is evident in a few. Residential, commercial and heavy 
building continues to show strength. Business for mining and energy 
firms remains favorable, with increased oil drilling giving western 
North Dakota an extra boost. In forest products, paper mills are 
pressing their output limits, while lumber and building board 
producers report increased output compared to the spring. As the 
summer has worn on, favorable weather has improved the prospects for 
district farmers. Tourist spending is up in the eastern half of the 
district, but retail and auto sales are generally described as soft. 
Manufacturing sales are not increasing as rapidly as a year ago. 
Employment growth is modest; some shortages of skilled and entry-
level workers are reported and unemployment rates remain low. Wage 
increases reportedly are small, as are price increases, and 
manufacturers report no delays in delivery of raw materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Builders are having trouble finding enough carpenters and 
subcontractors to work on the homes being built right now. No one 
has time to take on another contract." That description of 
residential building in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area by a builder's 
association representative also characterizes home-building in many 
district communities. Industrial and commercial building is strong 
too. Numerous 50,000 to 60,000 square foot industrial or warehouse 
buildings are under construction in Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs, 
where some 5 million square feet of retail space is also reportedly 
being built. New retail buildings are also going up in smaller 
cities from Escanaba, Mich., to Great Falls, Mont. Publicly let 
contracts in Minnesota and the Dakotas through July, largely for 
heavy projects, are even with 1994's near-record levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The oil boomlet continues in western North Dakota, with drilling for 
new wells up markedly from 1994 levels and production up somewhat. 
Iron ore shipments are at the highest level so far this decade, with 
shipments from Minnesota mines expected to hit 47 million tons. 
Copper mines are running at capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumber production is up from this spring, and mill operators report 
improved prices and sales. Hardwoods are the one exception. Building 
board plants continue to produce at capacity and have eliminated the 
sharp price discounts offered this spring. Paper mills are generally 
running flat out.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For district farmers, conditions are also better than last spring 
when adverse weather was threatening crops. Most crops are in good 
shape, in spite of some periods of intense heat and a few instances 
of destructive hail. While an early frost could still upset the 
apple cart, many observers expect yields of major crops to be near 
long-run averages, though somewhat below 1994's records. Combined 
with grain prices that are about 25 percent above 1994 levels, near-
average yields will mean improved income and debt service 
capabilities for farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      In livestock, hog prices have risen substantially from earlier in 
the year in spite of continuing high slaughter levels, and producers 
are generally making better profits. But cattle prices remain 
depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Overall our business is good, but not nearly as strong as last 
year," says a district manufacturer. "We had real softening in the 
second quarter, but sales picked up significantly in the last five 
weeks," states another.. These statements suggest Ninth District 
manufacturing sales are generally good, but not growing at the pace 
they were a year ago. Earnings of firms producing industrial 
machinery and high-tech products, like biomedical devices, however, 
have been very strong, while they have been weak for some consumer 
goods manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Our sales reflect continued solid performance. . . but with higher 
than expected promotional markdowns. They also reflect a general 
softness in the retail market," says a major district retailer. A 
mall manager agrees: "Traffic at the mall is OK, but probably not up 
to last year." A manager with a regional department store chain 
reports slow sales of appliances, which is echoed by other sources 
who also note that apparel sales are lower than projected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers report a roller coaster year with sales very slow 
in the spring, some strengthening in June and July, but apparent 
weakening again in August. "People are just being very conservative" 
says one Montana dealer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "I've never seen so many people; this has to be the best season 
ever," comments one northeastern Minnesota business owner as people 
have flocked north to escape this summer's unseasonably warm 
weather. Tourist operators and association officials across northern 
Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan confirm this report. But their counterparts on the plains 
are less expansive. Montana officials report tourist activity
somewhat below 1994 levels. And in South Dakota visits to major 
attractions such as Mount Rushmore and the Badlands are a few 
percentage points below 1994 levels, although visits to state parks 
are up. Some observers in these areas noted strengthening in late 
July and in August, but they think that the, season as a whole will 
not catch up to last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Firms look high, low for skilled workers" was a recent headline in 
one western Wisconsin newspaper that typified the situation faced by 
many district employers. With unemployment rates in western 
Wisconsin falling below 4 percent for the first time since 1988, 
that state's labor agency is conducting workshops for employers 
entitled "Solutions for a Tight Labor Market."
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment is up modestly in most areas of the district and in most 
job categories compared to a year ago. Unemployment rates remain 
below year-ago levels in many areas of the district and well below 
national levels in all areas except Michigan's Upper Peninsula. "We 
never used to see "help wanted" signs in Missoula, but we do now," 
says one Montana small business owner, who reports having to give 
modest raises to entry-level workers to avoid losing them. Another 
small business owner in North Dakota lists machinists, welders and 
CAD/CAM technicians as being particularly hard to hire. But most 
employers insist that overall wage increases are low.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We aren't getting any price increases on the material we buy," says 
one North Dakota manufacturer, "and lead times from order to 
delivery are back to normal." That seems to be the case for raw 
materials and intermediate goods in most sectors, with the continued 
exception of paper and packaging materials. Petroleum product prices 
have declined 3 cents to 4 cents a gallon from increases posted in 
late spring and are close to year-earlier levels.
