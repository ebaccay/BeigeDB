      Beige Book Report: Chicago

       April 21, 2004
      </strong>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The Seventh District economy continued to 
              expand in March and early April, with reports suggesting that gains 
              were more widespread than during the previous Beige Book period. 
              Contacts suggested that both consumer and business spending continued 
              to improve modestly. Hiring generally remained subdued, though there 
              were scattered reports of firming labor demand. Overall construction 
              and real estate activity remained strong. Manufacturing continued 
              to expand solidly. Lending activity generally picked up slightly. 
              Prices appeared to be firming at both the producer and retail levels, 
              though there were no new reports of upward pressure on wages and 
              other labor costs. The situation for farmers continued to improve, 
              as agricultural prices generally rose and field conditions were 
              favorable for spring planting in almost all of the District.
       <p>
        <b>
         Consumer spending
        </b>
        <br/>
        Reports on consumer spending were again somewhat mixed, but

suggested further improvement in March and early April. A contact with one

national department store chain said that sales gains so far this fiscal year

were in the low double digits, above their expectations. These gains were

driven primarily by strong sales of home-related items as well as a notable

pickup in women's apparel and accessory sales. Moreover, a large regional

discounter said that food and other nondurables were selling well. Consumers

were also said to be more responsive to advertising. On balance, merchants said

that inventories remained lean. March theater ticket sales were up from a year

earlier, according to one contact, due in part to some highly anticipated movie

releases. Light vehicle sales in the District were somewhat soft again in March

and early April, despite increased consumer incentives. Some dealers said that

inventories were higher than desired, and they were cutting back orders for new

vehicles. Contacts in tourism said that leisure travel in the region was

generally flat.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Business spending
        </b>
        <br/>
        Overall business spending continued to firm modestly in March and

early April. A contact with one large technology firm said the improving

economic environment led Information Technology managers to raise their

forecasts for equipment and software spending in 2004. Some retailers have

boosted their expansion plans for the year. However, contacts suggested that

business travel remained relatively weak. A contact with one staffing services

firm noted that new orders from manufacturers picked up sharply in recent weeks,

particularly in the skilled trades. There were scattered reports of new

permanent full-time hiring, and more firms indicated that they plan to hire

later in the year. Still, much of the actual new hiring so far appears to be

temporary, seasonal, or part-time. According to several contacts, many firms

still lack enough confidence in the expansion's sustainability to increase

their permanent workforces.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Construction and real estate
        </b>
        <br/>
        Overall construction and real estate activity remained strong,

buoyed by low interest rates and improving economic conditions. Existing home

sales were again robust in most areas, with one Chicago-area Realtor adding

that some homes in the ultra-luxury market were "starting to move, after

sitting on the market for quite a while." New home sales and permits were

strong as well, although some contacts said that the upper end of the new home

market remained soft. Realtors and builders alike appeared more optimistic

about home sales in 2004 than they had been during our previous reporting

period. Nonresidential activity was still sluggish, although there were

scattered reports of improvement. Much of the new activity was reported to be

in the light industrial, retail, and infrastructure segments. Although office

leasing picked up slightly, the market remained soft and many contacts

suggested it will remain so in the foreseeable future. One contact said that

with weak job creation and an abundance of available space, office rents were

generally flat, and landlords were "beating each other up to get a lease

signed."
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        Manufacturing activity continued to expand solidly in the District. Contacts in

a wider array of key industry segments reported stronger new orders, shipments,

and backlogs while inventories remained generally lean. One steelmaker

described demand as "still very hot," adding that his firm was

running at capacity and turning down some new orders. In turn, a heavy

equipment manufacturer noted that production was being limited somewhat by

shortages of materials, particularly steel. This contact also said that new

orders and backlogs in March were up considerably from a year ago, due in part

to continued strength in construction and a rebound in some mining industries.

Producers of cement and gypsum wallboard also cited the active construction

market as contributing to strong new orders and shipments. Automakers noted

that light vehicle demand continued to firm nationally in March, though

inventories were still somewhat elevated. However, automakers have not altered

second-quarter production plans because they expect sales to pick up.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Banking and finance
        </b>
        <br/>
        On balance, lending activity picked up slightly in recent weeks. On the

consumer side, one lender reported that credit card volumes were trending up in

March and early April. Applications for residential mortgages rose in March;

many bankers said that new originations remained strong into early April, while

refinancing subsided after a "mini boomlet" in March. Consumer credit

quality generally continued to improve and there were no changes reported in

standards and terms for household loans. Business loan volumes were again

relatively flat, well below most bankers' expectations. Many lenders said that

their customers' cash flows were improving, and that firms were using that cash

to meet their short-term liquidity needs rather than borrowing. Demand for

small business and commercial real estate loans appeared stronger than for

other types of loans. Business credit quality continued to improve modestly,

and there were no discernible changes in covenants and/or collateral

requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Prices and costs
        </b>
        <br/>
        Reports of firming prices were more frequent in March and early April. Apart

from auto dealers, retailers generally indicated they were using less

discounting to move merchandise than a year ago. Some materials prices (such as

for steel, cement, and gypsum wallboard) increased notably in March. Many

contacts suggested that domestic inventories of some materials were very lean,

and the availability of low-priced foreign product was limited by a weaker

dollar and sharply higher freight rates. At the producer level, manufacturers

were largely successful in passing materials cost increases through to their

customers. There were no reports of new upward pressures on wages and other

labor costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Agriculture
        </b>
        <br/>
        Agricultural conditions improved again this reporting period. Agricultural 
              prices for corn, soybeans, milk, hogs, and beef generally were higher. 
              Most farmers have sold their stored crops, generating higher farm 
              income that has contributed to an increase in overall spending in 
              rural communities. Sales of both new and used farm equipment have 
              increased, especially smaller items at auction. With spring planting 
              beginning, ground moisture levels were reported to be abundant in 
              most of the District, with only a few areas facing inadequate subsoil 
              moisture. Contacts reported that planting intentions had shifted, 
              with more acres expected to be allocated to corn and fewer to soybeans. 
              This shift was due to recent relative price changes as well as expectations 
              for higher soybean yields resulting from planting soybeans every 
              third year rather than alternating every year with corn. With most 
              farmers applying fertilizer in the fall, energy price increases 
              have not had a large impact yet. Land values and cash rents of agricultural 
              land moved upward again, leading to speculation that some leases 
              will be renegotiated this summer.
