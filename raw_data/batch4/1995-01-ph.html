      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 18, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Third District business contacts in early January 
suggested that economic activity was continuing on an upward path, 
but the rate of growth had eased somewhat from the pace set in the 
fourth quarter of last year. On balance, manufacturers reported 
increases in orders and shipments, but the gains were not as 
widespread in January as they had been in December. Retailers gave 
mixed reports for the Christmas shopping period. Sales of consumer 
electronic goods were up strongly from the prior year, but apparel 
sales were below expectations, leading to widespread discounting to 
clear out inventories in the weeks after Christmas. Auto dealers 
said sales slowed seasonally in December, but the overall trend 
continued to be up, with strong demand for certain models leading to 
price increases and waiting periods for buyers. Bankers generally 
indicated that lending continued to move up moderately as the new 
year began, with business and credit card lending being the 
strongest categories of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasts for the new year in the Third District are generally 
positive, although guarded. Manufacturers expect activity to 
continue to rise, but they anticipate just steady employment over 
the next six months. Auto dealers expect unit sales in 1995 to 
exceed those in 1994, but other retailers say it is difficult to 
make a forecast for the year at this time. Bankers expect some 
continued growth in lending in the months ahead, but some believe 
loan growth may taper off in the second half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District manufacturers in early January indicated 
that industrial activity continued on an upward trend, although the 
rate of growth had slackened from the final quarter of last year. 
Slightly more than one-fourth of the firms polled reported that they 
were receiving more orders and making more shipments in January 
compared with December, while about half indicated that orders and 
shipments were steady. Gains were more common among producers of 
metal products and equipment, while steady conditions or declining 
activity were more frequently noted by makers of nondurable goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment conditions were virtually steady at manufacturing plants 
in the District. While there were a few reports of stepped-up 
hiring, three-fourths of the industrial establishments contacted 
were holding employment steady. On balance, area firms were reducing 
working hours slightly in early January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial prices in the region continued to move up as the new year 
began. More than half of the firms commenting on prices said they 
paid more for inputs in January than they had in December, and there 
were very few reports of price declines. About one-fourth of the 
manufacturers contacted said they were raising prices for their own 
products; most said they were holding prices steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District manufacturers expect business to 
continue moving up through the first half of the year. About four in 
ten of the firms contacted for this report forecast increases in 
orders and shipments, and two in ten anticipate declining demand for 
their products. Overall, Third District manufacturers plan to hold 
employment and working hours steady, and to reduce inventories. 
While most will also keep capital spending on an even pace, more 
than one-fourth have scheduled increased investment expenditures for 
the first half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the Third District gave mixed reports on sales for the 
Christmas shopping period. Stores selling consumer electronic items-
-personal computers, large-screen televisions, and camcorders--said 
sales were well above the year-ago period. Home furnishings were 
also listed among the categories of merchandise that sold well. 
Apparel retailers had disappointing results; with sales falling 
below expectations, they were prompted to offer deep discounts both 
before and after Christmas. The pace of retail sales in early 
January appeared to be somewhat subdued, with price reductions being 
continued in efforts to reduce inventories, especially for apparel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers said sales slowed seasonally in December 
but rose above the level of December 1993. In general, dealers 
reported sales gains for 1994 over 1993, and they expect continued 
increases in unit sales in 1995. Sport-utility vehicles continued to 
be in demand, and price increases and waiting lists were becoming 
common for these and some other popular models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District commercial bank lending officers contacted in early 
January said loan volume was growing moderately. Several mentioned 
modest growth in commercial and industrial lending, with middle-
market companies prominent among new borrowers. Bankers continued to 
describe the market for new business lending as competitive. In 
general, bankers also said consumer credit was growing, with credit 
card borrowing being the strongest category of personal lending. 
Some bankers noted that while there were signs of increased interest 
by institutional investors in commercial real estate, banks in the 
District did not plan to increase their exposure in office or 
industrial properties.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among the commercial bank officers interviewed for this 
report is generally positive but cautious. While most expect the 
region's economic performance to be good, at least through the first 
half of the year, they foresee a slowdown in the growth of consumer 
spending that will limit growth in total business activity for the 
year as a whole. In line with this forecast, they expect overall 
loan growth to ease as the year progresses. Several bankers also 
noted that loan profitability, for both business and consumer 
lending, has been coming under pressure and that they may review 
their own lending plans for the year as a result.
