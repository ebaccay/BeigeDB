      Beige Book Report: Atlanta

      <strong>
       December 6, 2000
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy continued to expand 
              at a moderate rate during November, largely matching the slower 
              pace noted in the last report. The outlook is for a continuation 
              of slower growth through the remainder of the year. Retailers' reports 
              were generally subdued, with warm weather stalling apparel sales 
              in many parts of the region, while larger automobiles and sport-utility 
              vehicles were selling more slowly than a year ago. Growth in Thanksgiving 
              retail sales appeared to be strong, particularly at discount stores. 
              New residential and nonresidential construction and sales continued 
              to soften in the District. Factory activity also slowed, but some 
              new projects were announced in the transportation equipment sector. 
              Reports from the tourism and hospitality industry were more positive 
              than in our last report. Loan activity remained strong but was expected 
              to slow in the near term. Labor market pressures eased slightly, 
              while reports of price increases remained limited.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Consumer 
              Spending
      </b>
      <br/>
      Unusually warm weather through the middle of November dampened apparel 
              sales in many parts of the District, and larger automobiles and 
              sport-utility vehicles were also selling more slowly than a year 
              ago. Some retailers reported that sales results during early November 
              had fallen below expectations, and there were more instances of 
              higher than desired inventory levels than in the last report. Stores 
              reported mostly brisk sales during the Thanksgiving weekend, with 
              the strongest reports coming from discount retailers. The use of 
              discounting and other sales promotions appeared to be more widespread 
              than last year. Many District retailers said that they expect fourth-quarter 
              sales results to moderately exceed last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Construction
      </b>
      <br/>
      Single-family home construction and sales remained sluggish. New 
              home sales declined notably during October and early November compared 
              with a year ago. Homebuilders continued to report slow customer 
              traffic and greater use of price concessions. However, inventories 
              were mostly described as balanced. Most realtors and builders contacted 
              anticipate further slowing in the housing sector through the first 
              quarter of next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction also slowed, continuing 
              a trend from the third quarter. Office vacancy rates rose moderately 
              in several key markets, although net absorption continued to be 
              strong in most areas. Industrial vacancy rates fell in some markets. 
              Multifamily construction continued to slow, with several locations 
              experiencing higher vacancy rates. Reports continued to indicate 
              little near-term risk of oversaturation in the commercial real estate 
              market. Overall District construction employment payrolls in October 
              were estimated to be around 1.5 percent higher than a year ago, 
              which was the slowest annual growth since 1992.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Manufacturing
      </b>
      <br/>
      Activity slowed in many manufacturing industries, but contacts reported 
              new orders or planned expansions in some areas. Nissan recently 
              chose a Mississippi location for a new plant to produce sport-utility 
              vehicles and minivans. The facility will reportedly cost nearly 
              $1 billion and eventually employ around 4,000 workers. Also, some 
              District shipyards gained new contracts for ships, and work at drilling 
              rig fabricators continued to expand. In response to slower demand, 
              cutbacks by producers of heavy-duty truck and trailers continued, 
              and the slowing housing market is reported to have resulted in closings 
              and layoffs at several producers of housing materials. Production 
              has also continued to slow at many of the District's paper mills.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </b>
      <br/>
      Most contacts were cautiously optimistic about the winter tourist 
              season in Florida and along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Major Miami 
              convention and tourist hotels reported strong forward bookings. 
              Rising passenger traffic through Miami International Airport over 
              the next six months is anticipated. With recreational travel to 
              the Middle East having been largely curtailed, many travelers are 
              expected to opt for travel to Florida and the Mississippi Gulf instead. 
              There was an unexpected surge in demand for hotel rooms in Tallahassee 
              during late November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Financial
      </b>
      <br/>
      Bankers indicated that strong consumer and commercial loan demand 
              continued to fuel overall growth in bank lending in the District, 
              although demand for automobile loans slowed slightly and mortgage 
              demand was mixed. Reports suggested that the number of nonperforming 
              loans and charge-offs has increased but remains at relatively low 
              levels. Banking contacts expected overall loan growth to slow in 
              the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Wages and Prices
      </b>
      <br/>
      Overall labor market conditions loosened slightly in the District. 
              Many firms observed that unskilled and semi-skilled workers were 
              easier to find than earlier in the year. However, skilled and professional 
              staff remained scarce. Local technology companies reported making 
              increased use of foreign temporary workers to meet demand. Reports 
              also suggested that hospitals are having great difficulty attracting 
              and retaining key personnel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of price increases were more frequent 
              than in our last report, but limited to certain sectors. Some contacts 
              mentioned increasing prices for industrial commodities such as copper 
              and aluminum. Higher fuel prices have caused problems for local 
              truck manufacturers and transportation firms. Health care costs 
              continued to increase throughout the District, while lumber and 
              paper prices were down notably. A few reports noted accelerating 
              wage growth.
      <p>
       <b>
        Agriculture
       </b>
       <br/>
       Cotton production forecasts for 2000 have been revised lower for 
              Georgia and increased for Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee. 
              In Florida, the damage from the citrus canker remained limited, 
              and the initial forecast for this season's orange crop is 3 percent 
              higher than last season.
