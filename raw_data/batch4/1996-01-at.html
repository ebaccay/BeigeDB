      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 17, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      : Reports from contacts in the District suggest that the 
Southeast economy continued to grow modestly at the end of 1995 amid 
increasing signs of deceleration. Retail sales were generally below 
retailers' expectations and just slightly above last year's levels. 
Manufacturing slowed at the end of the year. On the other hand, 
tourism and business travel were described as strong throughout the 
District. New home construction remained active seasonally in most 
areas. Commercial and multifamily construction continued to rebound. 
Bankers reported that overall loan demand is steady. Most contacts 
reported only modest wage and price pressures.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       : District retailers generally reported that sales 
during December were below their expectations. However, most 
contacts noted that overall holiday sales did exceed last year's 
strong levels. The most positive reports came from upscale 
retailers. The busiest shopping period fell during the ten days 
before Christmas and was dominated by heavy discounting. Most 
retailers reported that they are comfortable with current inventory 
levels which were initially lean going into the season. They noted 
that the best-selling items during the holiday season were 
computers, electronics, fine jewelry, and cosmetics. Home-related 
products had a strong showing in New Orleans and in the Florida 
Panhandle because of weather-related replacement purchases. 
Generally, retailers' outlook for the first quarter is subdued with 
little year-over-year growth anticipated.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        : Factory operations have slowed since the last 
Beigebook, according to industry spokespersons. Recent reports have 
noted general declines in shipments and production. A larger number 
of contacts also reported a decline in new orders. Most 
manufacturers anticipate modest near-term output declines and do not 
expect to increase payrolls significantly. However, several 
manufacturing firms expect to increase capital expenditures. The 
District's apparel sector continues to lose ground in competition 
with producers from abroad. Suppliers to the auto industry noted 
slowing new orders and shipment volumes, reflecting the sluggish 
auto market. Restructuring in the paper industry is resulting in 
labor force cutbacks at some regional plants. NASA cutbacks are 
expected to result in the loss of a substantial number of jobs at 
the Kennedy Space Center. More positively, contacts anticipate that 
rebounding home sales and construction will boost residential carpet 
and building materials production. Several regional chemical 
producers noted increases in exports.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Tourism and Business Travel
         </strong>
         : The tourism, convention, and business 
travel industry remains one of the District's most rapidly growing 
sectors, according to most contacts. Occupancy rates at central 
Florida hotels are relatively high, and new attractions are expected 
to lure more conventions to the area in the next year. In Miami, 
contacts report that the number of European visitors is up. 
Snowbirds are flocking to Southern Florida in record numbers, 
although a recent interlude of bad weather temporarily damped the 
number of arrivals. Advance bookings at south Florida hotels have 
been strong enough to suggest that tourism will continue to grow 
well into the new year. According to contacts along the Mississippi 
Gulf Coast, casino gambling continues to be a catalyst for new 
economic development in the area.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction
          </strong>
          : While home sales and construction were below strong 
year-ago levels in December, most contacts still felt that local 
markets were relatively active. Inventories continue to run low in 
several markets, stimulating new home building. Contacts have 
witnessed a rise in home prices, with escalating new home prices 
pushing all home prices higher. Overall, District contacts are 
optimistic concerning prospects for the first quarter, in large part 
because of the low mortgage rate environment. Most Realtors and 
builders anticipate gains over last year's weak first quarter 
results.
          <p>
           Contacts from across the District described commercial and 
multifamily real estate markets as growing robustly. Low vacancy 
rates and higher rents continue to propel new apartment and office 
development. While most office and retail projects continue to be 
build-to-suit, contacts also noted a number of speculative projects 
that have gotten underway in recent months. Most real estate 
professionals contacted predict that the pace of new commercial and 
multifamily construction will remain strong well into 1996.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Financial Services
            </strong>
            : The majority of contacts characterized overall 
loan demand as steady. Commercial lending continues to be stronger 
than consumer lending in most areas. As 1995 came to a close, 
activity in commercial, industrial, and real estate lending 
generally was reported to be growing. However, most bankers noted 
that consumer lending was weak, particularly auto lending.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Wages and Prices
             </strong>
             : Most contacts continue to report little change in 
prices received for finished goods and prices paid for materials. 
Those reporting materials price increases were mainly confined to 
the chemical or apparel industries. Fewer contacts than in the last 
Beigebook think that prices will increase for materials or finished 
goods over the next few months. Wages are generally reported to be 
remaining stable in the region.
