      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity slowed to a moderate pace in 
June and July. Manufacturing orders were weaker for most products, 
and retail sales were reported to be very sluggish. Demand for 
business services increased slightly, however, and construction and 
real estate activity remained at high levels. Financial institutions 
reported higher residential real estate and consumer loan demand. 
Energy activity held steady despite a drop in oil and natural gas 
prices. Agricultural conditions have weakened.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, there are few reports of price end wage pressures. Prices 
stopped falling for electronic products and were higher for some 
business services and agricultural products. Scattered wage pressure 
was reported in manufacturing, and service firms continued to have 
difficulty hiring skilled workers. Chemical prices leveled off after 
several months of increases, however, and recently announced price 
increases were rescinded. Some manufacturers said competition  may 
bring price decreases in the near future. Retailers reported that 
real selling prices were below a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders weakened for most manufactured products, with the notable 
exception of telecommunications and semiconductor products where 
demand remained strong. Demand for paper products slowed slightly. 
Sales weakened for most construction-related products including 
lumber, fixtures and metals. A drop in sales to automotive and 
construction industries led to reduced demand for glass and 
inventory accumulation. Sales of primary metals weakened, and 
inventories were reported to be high, particularly for construction-
related products. Demand wee up for fabricated metals, however, 
although lower costs led to a 3 to 4 percent decline in selling 
prices. Apparel sales were steady and contacts reported that input 
costs have continued to rise. Weaker domestic economic activity led 
to slower demand for petrochemicals. Inventories have rebounded from 
low levels to normal for most chemicals, but some companies now 
report that inventories are too high. Yet, chemical companies are 
proceeding with capital expansion plans along the Gulf Coast. Demand 
for most refined products remains strong, although oversupply has 
caused gasoline prices to fall faster than oil prices, putting 
refiners margins under substantial pressure. Profit margins at the 
pump have grown, however, because pump prices have been relatively 
stable while wholesale prices have fallen sharply. Demand for oil-
field machinery held steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business services increased slightly, although demand for 
trucking and air cargo services was flat to slightly down. Temporary 
help firms continued to report the greatest strength, followed by 
legal and accounting firms. Hiring was unchanged at cargo service 
firms but increased slightly at temporary, legal and accounting 
firms. With the exception of temporary services, competitive 
pressures held wages and price, at the same level. Increased 
competition and slower demand for interstate and intrastate 
shipping, however, has put downward pressure on shipping rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales remained very sluggish in June and July. National 
retailers reported that Texas sales were significantly weaker then 
the rest of the country. Sales were said to be slow across the 
state, with continued poor performance at stores along the Texas-
Mexico border. While costs remained stable, discounting had 
increased and contacts said real selling prices were below a year 
ago. Auto sales increased in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial institutions reported steady loan demand except for
residential real estate and consumer loans which increased over the 
past three months. Business and consumer loan demand is expected to 
pick up slightly, particularly for auto and home improvement loans. 
Contacts reported that prospects for mergers and acquisitions are 
continuing, particularly for smaller banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate activity remained at high levels in 
June and July. Homebuilders reported a pick-up in new home sales and 
were more upbeat about the outlook for the rest of 1995. Contacts 
reported tight occupancy and strong demand for apartments, although 
construction is expected to slow from its current pace. 
Nonresidential construction was at high levels, mostly due to strong 
retail and industrial demand. Occupancy rates for industrial and 
office space continued to improve and rents remained steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy activity held steady despite a drop in oil and natural gas 
prices. Continued strong growth in international drilling stimulated 
revenues for service companies, although domestic drilling activity 
was 5 percent below a year ago. The normal seasonal increase in 
drilling activity has been concentrated almost entirely in gas and 
industry contacts report that domestic oil drilling is at the lowest 
level ever recorded. After falling by more than $2 in aid-June, oil 
prices have remained near $17 per barrel despite very strong demand 
for crude. Natural gas prices have consistently weakened throughout 
the summer despite strong demand from the recent heat wave.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hot, dry weather, scattered insect infestations and reports of 
aflatoxin have weakened agricultural conditions and raised costs. 
The June Texas All Farm Products Index of Prices Received increased 
1.1 percent above the May level. Higher prices for corn, potatoes, 
sorghum, wheat end most livestock offset lower prices for cotton and 
hay.
