      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy expanded at a slightly higher 
rate in May and early June than earlier in the year, led by a 
moderately expanding manufacturing sector. Retail sales continued to 
improve through April and May, while inclement weather dampened the 
sale of seasonal items and delayed many housing and construction 
projects in the District. Manufacturing activity continued to post 
modest gains in May, led by increased orders and production. Banking 
activity remained strong in most categories, although margins 
continued to be squeezed by competition for loans. Labor markets 
remained tight, manufacturers were increasing their payrolls, and 
spot shortages of qualified workers persisted. Grain prices 
retreated from record levels, but District farmers remained well 
behind in their plantings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the District continued to improve 
through April and May and were up slightly in year-over-year 
comparisons. Several large retailers reported that sales growth in 
the Midwest was slightly below their national average. Most 
retailers reported that sales could have been better, but inclement 
weather hampered the sale of seasonal goods. Most contacts reported 
that inventories were in line with target levels for the coming 
Father's Day and summer sales events. The retail environment 
continued to be very competitive and a survey of small retailers in 
Michigan suggested that sales gains resulted from increasing 
promotional efforts. Auto dealers and distributors in the District 
reported that sales were very strong in May. One dealer reported 
that showroom traffic was up, model availability was adequate, and 
expectations remained high. Analysts at a June auto conference in 
the District reported raising their sales forecasts for the second 
half of 1996, although sales are not expected to continue at the 
strong pace set in the first half.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing/construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing and construction activity slowed 
moderately in May and early June, but District sources attribute the 
bulk of this slowdown to inclement weather. New home sales increased 
slightly in April, but a survey of homebuilders suggested that sales 
in the Midwest were off moderately in May. Conversations with 
builders across the District confirm a May downturn, but one builder 
stated that the downturn was "75% weather, 25% (the recent rise in 
mortgage) interest rates." Realtors also reported a weather-related 
slowdown in traffic through existing homes in May. However, most 
builders and realtors contacted believe that the market is still 
very strong. In addition, the national survey showed that Midwest 
builders were the most optimistic for the coming six months, 
although the rise in mortgage interest rates had dampened their 
optimism slightly. Lumber and cement dealers in the District 
reported a slowdown in shipments in May, but also noted that 
shipments picked up in early June. These dealers believe that most 
construction has been delayed due to inclement weather--not 
canceled--and have raised their expectations for the third quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall manufacturing activity in the District 
increased modestly in May and early June, while scattered pockets of 
softness persisted from earlier in the year. Purchasing managers' 
surveys from around the District continued to indicate solid gains 
in new orders and production, although backlogs continued to 
contract. Inventories varied from reports of accumulations in 
Michigan, some of which were intended, to liquidations in Wisconsin. 
The surveys were mixed with regard to prices paid, with declines 
reported in Michigan and increases reported in Wisconsin (primarily 
for commodities such as copper, aluminum, and fuel). An appliance 
industry analyst reported record high appliance shipments to dealers 
in April and shipments continued to indicate strength through May. 
However, some unplanned inventory building was also occurring. 
Several steel producers reported that order books were full through 
the third quarter, although competition from new capacity coming on 
stream over the next several months was restraining price increases. 
A diversified producer of specialized machinery, including material 
handling equipment, noted that orders were up in May and were well 
up year-to-date. Analysts cited continued softness in the heavy 
construction and heavy-duty truck industries, but in both cases, 
orders through May were slightly better than the industry had 
expected earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District bankers continued to be upbeat, 
although competition was widely described as being intense. Most 
contacts reported that consumer lending activity continued to be 
strong, with one bank reporting some pickup in loans for the 
financing of new car leases. Although home refinancing activity 
virtually stopped in recent weeks, new originations remained fairly 
strong. One banker noted that loan demand for low-end housing was 
doing much better than for luxury homes. C&amp;I; lending continued at a 
high level in May, with some contacts reporting continued solid 
growth while others noted a decline from the peak levels reached in 
late 1995. While credit quality remained generally high and 
delinquencies remained low in recent weeks, one banker expressed 
concern over the increase in local bankruptcies, especially among 
older businesses (including several retailers). Despite the high 
lending volume, bankers generally reported downward pressure on 
margins, with new banks moving into local markets and customers 
becoming more selective in their choice of banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment remained at record levels for the District 
through May and early June and spot labor shortages continued. A 
national survey of employers reported that Midwest employers 
continued to have the most optimistic hiring plans of any region 
heading into the third quarter, led by expected strength in the 
manufacturing and construction industries. Manufacturing employment 
rebounded in April after two months of slight decline, and 
purchasing managers' surveys from around the District suggested that 
moderate growth in manufacturing payrolls had continued through May. 
Construction employment increased seasonally despite adverse weather 
conditions across much of the District which hindered the progress 
of many projects. Several sources reported that shortages of 
qualified workers persisted in most major markets, but may be easing 
somewhat due to a summer influx of students into the temporary labor 
force. Increases in the starting wage of entry-level workers over 
the last year seem to have tapered off. However, several contacts 
reported that most employers were willing to pay slightly more to 
keep good employees. Temporary help agencies reported a shift from 
temporary to temp-to-permanent assignments, suggesting employer 
optimism about continued strength in the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cash and futures grain prices recently moved lower from 
record highs as export demand waned and favorable weather conditions 
improved prospects for the wheat harvest and allowed farmers to make 
progress in planting corn and soybeans. However, prices remained 
well above year-earlier levels. Despite recent progress, the pace of 
crop plantings continued to lag in District states. Corn planting in 
Indiana and Michigan was significantly delayed and progress in 
soybean planting was also running behind the normal pace in all 
District states. In contrast, corn planting in Iowa was nearing 
completion. Many planted cornfields were plagued by cool 
temperatures and excessive rainfall, leading to low surviving plant 
populations and forcing farmers to consider the added expense and 
uncertainty of replanting.
