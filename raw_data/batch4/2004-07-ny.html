      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 28, 2004
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in the Second District appears to have moderated somewhat since 

  the last report, though most sectors remain buoyant. While input price pressures 

  persist, prices of most consumer goods and services have advanced at a relatively 

  modest pace. The labor market has shown further improvement, though to a lesser 

  degree than earlier in the year. Retailers report that sales softened in June 

  and early July, while selling prices were up slightly, due to less discounting. 

  Business surveys conducted in June and early July suggest some renewed strength 

  in manufacturing-sector activity, and continued upward pressure on input costs.
      <p>
       The housing market remains strong, though not quite as robust as the spring--the 

  sales market has moderated a bit, while the rental market has strengthened. 

  Residential construction remains firm, while construction costs have moderated 

  somewhat. Office markets in the New York City area were mixed at mid-year. Tourism 

  has been particularly robust in recent months, with brisk gains in air travel, 

  hotel occupancy, and theater attendance. Finally, bankers report across-the-board 

  declines in delinquency rates, slight weakening in household loan demand, but 

  further increases in demand for business loans.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Retail sales, which had been running well ahead of plan during the Spring, slowed 

  noticeably in June and early July: on a year-over-year basis, same-store sales 

  gains were mostly in the range of 1 percent to 3 percent in the more recent 

  period. Contacts attribute the slowing, in part, to unseasonably cool weather; 

  however, most also characterize the brisk pace of sales earlier this year as 

  unsustainable and indicate that lean inventories of clearance merchandise have 

  hampered sales recently. In fact, most retail contacts maintain that inventories 

  are still on the lean side. Most contacts note that sales of home goods have 

  softened further, though one describes this category as still strong. In general, 

  retail contacts indicate that effective selling prices are somewhat higher than 

  a year ago, due to fewer and smaller markdowns. Retailers report little in the 

  way of wage pressures, and most continue to indicate that rising energy costs 

  have little impact on total costs.
        <p>
         Consumer confidence was, again, little changed in June. Based on Siena College's 

  survey of New York State residents, confidence edged down last month, led by 

  a dip in the New York City area. At the same time, the Conference Board's survey 

  of Middle Atlantic state (NY, NJ, PA) residents shows confidence rising modestly 

  in June, reversing a modest dip in May.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Housing markets have moderated somewhat since the last report, though they are 

  still described as strong, particularly in and around New York City. Realtors 

  in all five boroughs report that home prices were up well over 10 percent in 

  the second quarter, compared with a year earlier. A Manhattan industry contact 

  notes that that market for co-ops and condos was fairly robust in June, though 

  less "frenzied" than in April, when low inventories and strong demand sparked 

  numerous bidding wars. Manhattan's rental market, in contrast, has continued 

  to strengthen: one contact notes that a growing number of prospective buyers 

  have opted to rent in recent weeks and reports that rental rates continue to 

  rebound and are now roughly on par with a year ago. New Jersey homebuilders 

  report that demand continues to outstrip supply, keeping prices firm; input 

  costs remain high but are said to have abated somewhat since the last report.
          <p>
           Office markets in the New York City area have been mixed. Vacancy rates have 

  edged down further in Long Island, Fairfield County (Connecticut), and both 

  Midtown and Lower Manhattan. In contrast, northern New Jersey's vacancy rate 

  reportedly ended the second quarter at almost 18 percent, the highest level 

  in nearly a decade. Westchester County's rate rose moderately but was still 

  lower than a year ago.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Other Business Activity
            </strong>
            <br/>
            A major New York City employment agency reports continued improvement in the 

  labor market in June and early July, though at a more gradual pace than in the 

  last report. There is reported to have been some renewed softening in demand 

  for IT workers, though this may be partly due to a seasonal slowdown.
            <p>
             Our latest monthly survey of New York State manufacturers indicates further 

  strength in business conditions in early July; continued widespread increases 

  in input costs were noted, but only about one in four firms indicate that they 

  have raised their selling prices. Similarly, June surveys of purchasing managers 

  in both the New York City and Buffalo areas indicate improved business conditions 

  in June. Buffalo purchasers report increasingly widespread gains in both production 

  and new orders, while New York purchasers indicate a resumption in manufacturing 

  sector growth, following a May lull. Purchasers in both areas again report increasing 

  input prices, though these were a bit less widespread than in recent months.
             <p>
              Tourism-related industries continue to turn in very strong results. Airport 

  passenger traffic, year-to-date, is up 15 percent from 2003 levels at New York 

  City area airports and up 10 percent at both Buffalo-Niagara and Greater Rochester 

  airports. Manhattan hotels report that revenue was up more than 20 percent from 

  a year earlier in June, reflecting a 7 percent increase in occupancies and a 

  14 percent rise in average room rates. Broadway theaters report a further acceleration 

  in business in June and early July, as total revenues were up roughly 12 percent 

  from a year earlier; virtually all of the increase reflects higher attendance, 

  while the average ticket price was little changed.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Financial Developments
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Small to medium-sized banks in the district report mixed demand for loans in 

  the latest survey. Loan demand rose slightly in the commercial segments but 

  declined slightly in the consumer category. There was a continued widespread 

  decline in demand for home mortgages: nearly two-thirds of bankers report lower 

  demand, while only 16 percent report higher demand. Refinancing activity decreased, 

  according to 52 percent of bankers, with 21 percent reporting an increase.
               <p>
                Loan rates increased across all categories, with the commercial and industrial 

  segment loan rates registering the most widespread increase. Average deposit 

  rates are reported to be steady to higher. Credit standards remained unchanged 

  according to virtually all respondents. Finally, bankers report lower delinquency 

  rates across all loan categories.
