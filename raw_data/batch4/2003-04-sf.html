      </b>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Reports from Twelfth District contacts suggest that economic 
                growth was sluggish during the period from March through early 
                April, with limited negative effects arising from the start of 
                military operations in Iraq. Price and wage pressures were minimal, 
                and retail gasoline prices largely remained at elevated levels. 
                General retail sales held up on net, though they appear to have 
                weakened a bit toward the end of the survey period, partly due 
                to concerns about the war in Iraq. The war, along with the East 
                Asian outbreak of the respiratory ailment "SARS," had a discernible 
                negative effect on travel and tourism activity, especially visits 
                from abroad. Demand for high-tech equipment and other District 
                manufactured products fell slightly on net, and respondents noted 
                significant excess capacity for various products. Sales of agricultural 
                products were solid, due in part to strong export demand, and 
                contacts reported capacity expansion in the fuel and energy sectors. 
                Although commercial real estate markets weakened further, home 
                demand was strong, although slower activity was reported in some 
                markets. Banks and other financial intermediaries saw continued 
                weak demand for business loans and strong demand for residential 
                mortgages.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Wages
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District contacts reported little upward pressure on wages and 
                prices in the most recent survey period, except for increases 
                in employer benefit costs and the price of transportation services. 
                Despite a recent decline in oil prices, retail fuel prices fell 
                only slightly from elevated levels established in early March. 
                Providers of transportation services passed on some of the increased 
                fuel costs to customers, and shipping costs rose due to delays 
                associated with tightened security procedures related to imports. 
                More generally, upward price pressures were quite limited, as 
                stiff competition forced many retailers and service providers 
                to offer their products at discounted prices. Although rising 
                prices for health insurance increased employer costs for employee 
                benefits, wages reportedly were flat to down a bit, as most labor 
                markets were characterized by significant excess supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for retail goods and services weakened a bit compared to 
                the previous survey period. Retail sales were largely stable on 
                net, and contacts noted that consumer spending held up better 
                after the start of the war in Iraq than it did following the start 
                of Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Sales of new and used automobiles 
                and light trucks were described as robust for the survey period 
                as a whole, though some dealers noted a pause in activity when 
                the military conflict began. Retail inventories in general have 
                been kept lean in recent weeks, and one contact reported cancellations 
                of apparel orders by some department stores.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travel and tourism activity fell noticeably in some areas in 
                response to the start of the war and the outbreak of the SARS 
                epidemic in East Asia. Respondents reported extensive reservation 
                cancellations and lower hotel occupancies in Los Angeles, Hawaii, 
                and other areas, largely due to a decline in visitor arrivals 
                from East Asia. Moreover, airlines cut flights on selected Asian 
                and European routes in response to a decrease in bookings and 
                lower passenger load volumes. Domestic travel also remained weak. 
                Outside of travel-related industries, service demand was largely 
                stable, with robust conditions reported for health care and related 
                services.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturers struggled with somewhat weaker sales and 
                significant excess capacity during the survey period. Demand for 
                most technology products was sluggish and perhaps fell a bit, 
                as businesses further delayed upgrades to their existing stocks 
                of computer, networking, and communications equipment. Capacity 
                utilization reportedly was low for all but the most advanced technology 
                products, and utilization was well below preferred levels in other 
                industries, such as machine tools and food processing. Inventories 
                of unused planes were at high levels, which undercut demand for 
                new commercial aircraft. Due to high production and a steady flow 
                of Canadian imports, lumber prices reportedly were at twelve- 
                to fifteen-year lows, which may lead to curtailed domestic production 
                going forward. Among manufacturers reporting modest strength, 
                such as providers of construction equipment and building materials, 
                demand increases have been met largely through the use of overtime 
                hours rather than through the hiring of new employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District agricultural and resource-related businesses reported 
                solid demand in recent weeks. Sales and prices of tree fruits 
                and nuts were strong, spurred in part by continued strong export 
                demand, and favorable weather produced healthy growing conditions 
                for many West Coast crops. Contacts noted substantial new investments 
                and expanded capacity for extraction of oil and natural gas, along 
                with plans for new electrical generation facilities in some areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for commercial real estate remained stagnant in most areas, 
                while residential market activity continued at high levels overall, 
                despite scattered signs of cooling. Office vacancy rates generally 
                remained high, and rental rates fell further in some areas. However, 
                vacancy rates for commercial space improved a bit in Southern 
                California and Hawaii, where overall economic conditions have 
                been relatively favorable. Home sales continued at a rapid pace 
                in most areas, fueled in large part by low mortgage interest rates. 
                However, the pace of sales growth and price appreciation fell 
                slightly in some areas, most notably in Utah. Moreover, citing 
                a weak economy and economic uncertainties related to the war in 
                Iraq, a few District developers have delayed planned construction 
                projects in recent weeks, including several multifamily housing 
                developments that were put on hold in Salt Lake City.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported generally weak loan demand by businesses but 
                strong demand for new residential mortgages and extensive refinancing 
                activity for residential and commercial real estate loans. In 
                contrast to most areas, banks in Southern California and Hawaii 
                saw steady growth in commercial loans. The volume of residential 
                mortgage loans remained high but fell a bit in some areas, notably 
                in Utah. Credit was amply available for low-risk borrowers throughout 
                the District.
