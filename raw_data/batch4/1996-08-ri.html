      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fifth District economic growth moderated somewhat in June 
and July. Manufacturers reported slower activity, particularly in 
textiles. Decreased imports led to a decline in port activity, and 
sluggish housing sales translated into weaker residential 
construction. Service sector activity expanded; retail sales grew at 
a steady pace; and commercial real estate activity strengthened. 
Contacts in several sectors continued to report wage pressures. 
Despite the adverse impacts of Hurricane Bertha, tourism expanded 
and yield prospects for some crops improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that retail sales growth 
changed little in recent weeks, although big-ticket sales, 
inventories, and shopper traffic grew more slowly. Respondents to a 
mail survey indicated that employment growth picked up and wages 
rose faster in July. Over the past several weeks, retail prices rose 
at a faster rate and retailers expected the rate of increase to 
accelerate somewhat during the next six months. Contacts anticipated 
a slight decrease in demand for their products in the second half of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service producers contacted by mail indicated that the 
pace of business activity increased in July. Revenues and wages grew 
more quickly and employment growth was unchanged. Service producers 
said their prices rose faster in July than they had in June. 
Respondents expected prices and demand for their products to rise 
during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity weakened in July and tight 
input markets continued to constrain some firms. Except in West 
Virginia, respondents to a mail survey of District manufacturers 
reported declines in shipments. Most durable-goods producers 
indicated that new orders had weakened in July, although one West 
Virginia manufacturer noted that his company had difficulty meeting 
its customers' delivery requirements. Manufacturers continued to 
indicate that their inventories were above desired levels. Textile 
manufacturers reported that sluggish apparel sales forced them to 
cut back production to avoid inventory buildups. Several industrial 
machinery and equipment suppliers reported that their output was 
constrained by a scarcity of skilled labor. Manufacturers indicated 
that finished goods prices increased slightly and that raw materials 
prices were down slightly in July from June. Respondents' six-month 
outlook was for lower finished goods prices and somewhat higher raw 
materials prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity continued to pick up in July despite the 
effects of Hurricane Bertha along the District's coastal areas. Our 
contacts noted that activity during the Fourth of July holiday was 
above a year ago and they attributed the increase to unseasonably 
mild weather and the holiday falling late in the week. One contact 
from a popular mountain resort in West Virginia reported that the 
Fourth of July tourist activity was the strongest in that resort's 
history. Hurricane Bertha inflicted only minor property damage along 
the District's coastal areas, but a contact from North Carolina's 
Outer Banks told us that the area lost over $5 million in business 
revenues after tourists were evacuated. A hotel manager in the 
Virginia Beach area said he had 300 rooms vacant because of the 
hurricane. Contacts reported that summer bookings continued to look 
good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity at District ports declined in June from May. 
When compared to a year ago, export shipments increased and imports 
fell. Port representatives continued to anticipate that exports and 
imports would increase during the next six months, with five of six 
ports expecting exports to rise faster than imports. One port 
contact attributed the pickup in exports to increased shipments of 
poultry to Eastern Europe and auto parts to South America.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The demand for temporary workers continued to 
increase in recent weeks. Demand was particularly strong for 
secretarial help, skilled warehouse and production workers, and 
computer-literate workers; the need for general laborers declined. 
In most areas of the District, temporary workers' wages were 
unchanged, and contacts in those areas expected little change during 
the next six months. However, in areas of the District with low 
unemployment and a shortage of skilled labor, temporary-worker 
agencies reported pay hikes and expected further increases in coming 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported that overall loan demand 
softened slightly in the last six weeks. The demand for mortgage 
loans, especially refinancings, continued to weaken in the face of 
higher interest rates. Many contacts noted that while higher 
mortgage rates had pushed some marginal home buyers out of the 
market, some qualified buyers were "priced out psychologically" by 
the higher rates. According to several lenders, current economic and 
political uncertainty had also left many commercial borrowers 
"sitting on the fence."
     </p>
     <p>
      However, one contact noted that since the first of June, lending for 
commercial real estate development in his area had picked up 
considerably.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District real estate agents and 
homebuilders contacted by telephone indicated that residential real 
estate activity softened somewhat in most areas of the District in 
June and July as potential home buyers' interest waned. Builders 
reported that they took out fewer building permits and started 
slightly fewer homes. A West Virginia homebuilder reported that the 
largest supplier of residential electrical supplies in his area went 
out of business because of sluggish housing construction activity. 
District real estate agents said that, despite higher customer 
traffic, sales were sluggish. One contact summed up the situation by 
observing, "the traffic is nice, but the sales conversion ratio is 
low." Despite somewhat lower activity, pressures on inputs markets 
remained. Lumber prices increased and subcontractor wages rose. A 
South Carolina homebuilder told us, "we are scraping bottom for 
labor in our area."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate activity picked up in 
June and early July. Commercial real estate brokers contacted by 
telephone indicated that leasing activity continued to escalate; one 
South Carolina contact said activity in his area was at a "fevered 
pitch." Vacancy rates declined, and rental rates continued to climb, 
as they have since last fall. A South Carolina contact noted that 
"rent concessions have evaporated," and a North Carolina respondent 
said she expected the market in her area to stay "landlord-
oriented." The availability of prime office space continued to 
tighten, and many contacts reported shortages. Respondents 
throughout the District, and especially those in North Carolina, 
witnessed an increase in new construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State tax collections were higher in West Virginia 
but were flat in other District states in June. Withholding tax 
collections increased significantly in West Virginia as employment 
growth improved over the past two months, particularly in the 
construction and business service sectors. Growth in retail sales 
collections remained the same in South Carolina, Virginia, and West 
Virginia; were slightly lower in Maryland; and rose substantially in 
North Carolina. Real estate receipts rose in Maryland and West 
Virginia. However, one Virginia contact indicated that fewer 
mortgage refinancings had reduced real estate recordation receipts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Intense storms damaged some District crops, but the 
rains associated with the storms benefited others in recent weeks, 
according to agricultural analysts. Hurricane Bertha caused up to 
$180 million in crop damage in North Carolina--over half of that to 
the tobacco crop. Corn and cotton also sustained substantial damage. 
On the plus side, Bertha's rains were credited with saving the corn 
crop in the eastern areas of Maryland and Virginia that had been 
suffering from severe drought; an agricultural extension agent now 
looks for a "bumper" corn crop there. Post-Bertha thunderstorms in 
late July led to scattered crop damage in parts of Virginia and 
Maryland, but also improved District crops' yields prospects.
