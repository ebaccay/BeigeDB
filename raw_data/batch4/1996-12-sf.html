      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Beige Book contacts

portray a moderate pace of economic

growth in most Twelfth District states in

recent months, with an expectation of

picking up to a faster underlying growth

trend.  Retailers generally reported

moderate growth in overall sales through

October and an intended inventory build-up

that reflects expectations of a strong

holiday sales season.  Producers of

services noted further growth of demand,

and reports on District manufacturing

production and orders generally were

favorable.  Residential real estate market

activity reportedly was strong in most

District states, with relatively high levels

of residential construction continuing in

the fastest-growing states.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Sentiment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District respondents generally

expect continued favorable national

economic performance, with regional

economic growth outpacing the national

rate.  Most respondents expect U.S. real

GDP growth next year to continue at about

the long-run average pace of around 2

percent, leaving the national

unemployment rate near the current

relatively low level.  Inflation is expected

to pick up only slightly.  More than three-quarters

of respondents expect their local

economies to do better than the nation.

This optimism is apparent in California

and in the fast-growing states of the

Intermountain area and the Pacific

Northwest.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail Trade and Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most District

states reported moderate growth in overall

retail sales in recent months.  In many

cases inventories have been built up in

anticipation of a strong

Christmas selling season, and current

stocks generally were reported to be under

control.  The sanguine view of current

inventory levels also was held by motor

vehicle dealers, even though October truck

sales reportedly dropped back, and auto

sales remained flat.
        <p>
         Among respondents from service-producing industries, providers of

telecommunications services continue to

report a strong pickup in demand.

Demand for other utility services is

increasing.  Tourism activity in the

District also continued to be strong.  Hotel

occupancy rates reportedly increased in

several areas, including Utah, where the

ski business is benefitting from an early

snowfall.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Reports on District manufacturing

activity generally were favorable.  The

positive spillovers from the ramp-up in

production of commercial aircraft at

Boeing reportedly are extending to the

aircraft parts industry and fueling

demand for some types of primary and

fabricated metals, electrical machinery,

and components.  However, except for

titanium, material supplies have not been a

problem thus far; other metal products

such as aluminum appear to be in

abundant supply.  Lumber producers in

the Pacific Northwest reported a recent

pickup in demand for their products,

owing both to increased building activity

and increased market share, given reduced

Canadian supply.  Demand for pulp and

paper products also reportedly

improved recently.  Elsewhere, in the

machine tool industry, slowing domestic

orders are being offset by a slight pickup in

foreign orders.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Resource Related Industries
           </strong>
           <br/>
           District agricultural conditions

were good through the fall.  In the Pacific

Northwest, bountiful harvests of most

crops were reported.  California?s Central

Valley vegetable growers were able to

produce enough to take advantage of high

prices, which have been elevated by short

crops elsewhere in the nation.  Cotton

yields in California also generally were

high, with the exception of some southern

areas that experienced hot weather.  A

large drop in feedgrain prices increased

the demand for feeder cattle.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Real Estate and Construction
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Residential real estate market

activity reportedly was strong in most

District states, although activity slowed in

some of the strongest markets and picked

up in other areas.  Respondents from the

Intermountain states of Arizona, Idaho,

and Utah reported that the recent rapid

pace of sales and of price gains for existing

homes was not sustained in recent months.

Within California, notable increases in

home prices generally were confined to the

San Francisco Bay Area.  In contrast,

housing sales and prices reportedly picked

up in Washington and Oregon, owing to

strengthening economic conditions,

population inflows, and increasingly

binding constraints on the availability of

urban land.
            <p>
             Relatively high levels of residential

construction appear to have continued in

the fast-growing states where home prices

have been appreciating rapidly, but home

building remained weak in California.  In

the fast-growing Intermountain and

Pacific Northwest states, non-residential

construction also was reported at high

levels this fall.  The overall strength in

demand for construction labor in such

areas is exerting significant pressure on

wages, given also the tightness in the

broader labor market.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Financial Institutions
              </strong>
              <br/>
              District financial institutions

generally report continued favorable

conditions.  Loan demand increased in

most areas, including Southern California,

where overall economic conditions have

been weaker than elsewhere.  However,

even in the fastest-growing areas, banks

report some concern about deteriorating

consumer credit quality, as measured by

increasing delinquencies and

bankruptcies.
