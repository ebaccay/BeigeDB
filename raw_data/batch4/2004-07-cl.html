      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 28, 2004
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Following significant increases in activity in recent months, the pace of economic 

  activity appeared to slow in the Fourth District through the eight weeks ending 

  June. The pace of production increases slowed for most District manufacturers, 

  though production typically remained above year-ago levels. In the retail sector, 

  several firms reported that sales gains slowed in the late spring. Residential 

  builders reported that sales continued to slow as well, especially in the lower-price 

  part of the market, while business conditions for commercial builders remained 

  weak. By contrast, District banks continued to report rising commercial loan 

  demand. Trucking and shipping firms continued to see strong activity.
      <p>
       Input price pressures remained a persistent feature of the economic environment, 

  with a wide array of metals, energy, and food prices rising in recent weeks. 

  Few firms reported any significant hiring plans for the remainder of 2004.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The increases in production that were typical throughout the District in the 

  early part of 2004 appeared to taper off in the eight weeks ending June. Nevertheless, 

  production for most manufacturers remained above year-ago levels. These trends 

  were largely the same for both nondurable and durable goods producers. Among 

  durable goods producers, domestic steel manufacturers continued to report strong 

  shipment volumes at a time when they would typically expect demand to decline 

  due to seasonal patterns. In fact, many mills continued to limit the amount 

  of steel they provide to their contract customers. District auto plants appeared 

  to see an increase in production levels in the late spring, but these levels 

  remain below those of a year ago.
        <p>
         Manufacturers typically reported that they were running their plants at or 

  above normal utilization levels. While capacity utilization rates remained particularly 

  strong among steel producers, some noted that they continued to be constrained 

  by shortages of some raw materials. Several durable goods manufacturers reported 

  that their inventories had risen above acceptable levels. Nondurable goods manufacturers, 

  by contrast, continued to report that their inventories were at acceptable levels. 

  Regarding hiring, most firms reported that they had not added additional staff 

  recently, and several durable goods firms foresaw staff reductions in the months 

  ahead. Wage rates reportedly remained stable in recent weeks.
         <p>
          In general, input costs continued to increase for manufacturers in May and 

  June. Prices for various metals, including aluminum and steel, rose further 

  recently; these prices reportedly remained significantly above their levels 

  of a year ago. And several food processing firms reported that prices for some 

  foods increased sharply in recent weeks, including milk, chicken, and beef. 

  Finally, prices for petroleum-based products also continued to rise. Several 

  producers reported that they could partially pass these input cost increases 

  through to their customers.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail Sales
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Several District retailers reported that sales gains slowed in the late spring. 

  This follows the robust increases in spending that occurred earlier in 2004. 

  Many contacts attributed the recent sluggishness in sales to unseasonably cool 

  temperatures throughout the District in the eight weeks ending June. Some also 

  noted that fewer markdowns might have held consumers back. On a year-over-year 

  basis, discount stores saw sales gains, while sales at department stores were 

  typically weaker. Several contacts also indicated that the Midwest has tended 

  to see slower sales growth recently than other parts of the country.
           <p>
            Retailers reported holding less inventory than at this time last year. While 

  wage rates remained steady, increases in input costs were more widely reported 

  than in the recent past. Increases in food prices were especially pronounced 

  recently, affecting restaurateurs and grocers. Nevertheless, the prices of many 

  other categories of goods continued to fall, for example, electronics and apparel.
            <p>
             In general, new car sales were sluggish throughout most of the District in 

  May and June, though sales in northeastern Ohio were reportedly robust during 

  this period. In addition, several dealers reported that sales of larger vehicles 

  remained strong despite high gasoline prices.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Construction
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Reports from residential builders pointed to a further slowing in sales in the 

  last several weeks. The decline in demand seemed particularly evident in the 

  lower-price part of the market, which builders view as being more sensitive 

  to increases in interest rates. Indeed, many builders attributed the recent 

  slowing in sales to rising mortgage rates and are altering their financing products 

  accordingly in an attempt to make them more attractive. In contrast to previous 

  reports, many homebuilders now expect that sales in 2004 will not surpass those 

  seen in 2003. While input costs are still said to be higher than in the winter 

  and at this time last year, they have reportedly remained steady in the last 

  several weeks.
              <p>
               After some signs of improvement in previous months, business conditions for 

  commercial builders reportedly remained weak through the eight weeks ending 

  June. One exception was school construction, which continued to be a bright 

  spot in an otherwise weak environment. It is reported that input costs continued 

  to rise for commercial builders, especially for items such as steel, lumber, 

  concrete, and petroleum products. Only a few contacts reported that they could 

  fully pass input cost increases on to their end consumers.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Banking
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Loan demand from commercial clients reportedly remained strong in the eight 

  weeks ending June and has also increased from this time a year ago. District 

  banks have reported stronger commercial borrowing consistently since the beginning 

  of this year. By contrast, consumer loan demand was mixed in May and June. Some 

  institutions continued to report strong residential real estate lending, though 

  the rate of refinancing activity has continued to slow. Delinquency rates reportedly 

  remained largely unchanged in recent weeks, and applicant credit quality was 

  characterized as stable or slightly improving. Contacts reported that their 

  core deposits had grown both in recent weeks and relative to this time a year 

  ago. With respect to hiring, some institutions indicated some difficulty finding 

  qualified entry-level employees, despite an abundance of applicants.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Trucking and Shipping
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 Contacts from the trucking and shipping industry continued to report robust 

  conditions in May and June, with shipment volumes rising in recent weeks and 

  advancing ahead of those from this time a year ago. As has been the case for 

  some time, demand came from an array of industries. It was reported that requests 

  to ship steel were especially strong, and foreign shipments of steel were said 

  to be the strongest in approximately three years. All trucking companies reported 

  running their fleets near capacity. Several noted that they plan to purchase 

  trucks to expand their fleets soon, though truck orders can take up to six months 

  to fill. Input costs continued to be high, with fuel prices fluctuating in recent 

  weeks but reportedly staying stable on average. Finally, firms reported that 

  drivers were demanding higher wages recently.
