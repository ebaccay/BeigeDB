      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts around the District, the Southeast 
economy continued to expand in early spring, although reports showed 
some softness as well as strength. Retail contacts reported that 
same store sales in March and early April exceeded year-ago levels, 
despite increased competition and bad weather. Manufacturing 
activity fell in March for the second month in a row. Recent reports 
from the tourism and convention sectors were largely positive, and 
the outlook remains upbeat. According to real estate contacts, the 
single-family housing market continues to maintain its strong 
performance from earlier in the year, and expectations among 
builders and Realtors are positive. Commercial and multifamily 
markets continued to improve. Bankers characterized overall loan 
demand as steady. There were scattered reports of wage pressures in 
parts of the District, but also reports of price deflation in lumber 
and paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retailers report that sales in 
March and early April exceeded year-ago levels. However, some 
retailers did note that increasing competition and cold weather in 
early March did cut into sales. Most contacts reported that 
inventories were currently on target, but several did say that their 
inventories were uncomfortably high. Home-related products continue 
to be a strong seller across the District but apparel sales were 
mixed. The outlook remains positive as most contacts anticipate 
second quarter sales will exceed last year's level, even if only 
moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of industry contacts reported that 
factory activity edged down or was steady in March and early April. 
A plurality of manufacturers anticipate a modest increase in 
production over the next few months, and they expect the volume of 
new domestic orders to slow, while the volume of new orders for 
export is expected to increase. More contacts now intend to trim 
factory payrolls and substitute capital equipment than was the case 
early in the year. Finished goods and materials inventories at the 
plant level increased moderately over the past month. A recent 
pickup in new orders and production for some textile and carpet 
manufacturers is encouraging. One contact thinks that increasing 
building activity will stimulate carpet production over the next few 
quarters. However, reports of downsizings and plant closings of 
weaker, less competitive, apparel firms continue in parts of 
Mississippi and Alabama, and stubborn inventory excesses continue to 
plague apparel manufacturers in other parts of the District. Some 
contacts express concern over building paper inventories, and 
several lumber mills have cut back on total hours worked. Slack new 
orders are forcing a heavy-duty truck supplier to cut its workforce, 
and a supplier of components to the auto industry notes decreasing 
orders and shipments. More positively, strong business activity is 
reported for producers of electrical and electronic machinery. A 
large consumer durable manufacturer is also expanding in the western 
part of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The outlook is positive for the tourism 
and convention sectors, according to industry contacts. South 
Florida destination resorts are fully booked and summer advance 
bookings are ahead of last year. The average length of stay has 
reportedly been several days longer at south Florida resorts than 
last year at all price levels. The number of European visitors to 
central Florida is up at double-digit rates from a year ago, and 
attendance at central Florida theme parks is expected by local 
tourism officials to continue to post strong gains. However, spring 
break attendance at some Florida destinations was not as strong as a 
year ago, and the number of Venezuelan visitors to south Florida is 
likely to decline as a result of the devaluation of the bolivar. In 
Nashville, hotel managers feel that the third and fourth quarters 
will be strong with rising occupancy rates. Casino operators along 
Mississippi's Gulf Coast report continued good traffic with gambling 
revenues rising moderately over last year.
      <p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most real estate contacts reported that single-family 
home sales were ahead of year-ago levels in March and anticipate 
April sales will be strong as well. Throughout most of the District, 
inventories are in good shape. Overall, inventories are on the rise 
in Atlanta and Nashville, but demand remains extremely strong in 
these markets and real estate contacts do not anticipate market 
saturation. In the Birmingham market, new home inventory is said to 
be less than normal, while demand is strong. As a result, some 
District contacts report a rise in home prices. However, a contact 
in south Florida reports that home inventories are too high and 
prices are stagnant, although first time buyer homes are moving 
fast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contacts from across the District report that commercial and 
multifamily real estate markets continue to improve. Low vacancy 
rates and higher rents are propelling new apartment and office 
development. While most commercial projects are still build-to-suit, 
several speculative developments are underway and more are 
anticipated this year. Most real estate professionals continue to 
anticipate that new commercial and multifamily construction will 
grow this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Financial Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Contacts in the banking industry described 
overall loan demand as steady. Bankers report that commercial 
lending continues to outpace consumer lending. Some contacts 
reported that commercial lending was up over earlier in the year but 
down from last year's levels, and that consumer loans were slightly 
stronger than early in the year. Bankers also found automobile 
financing to be performing extremely well, and mortgage lending up 
slightly.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Wages and Prices
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Contacts report a few instances of wage pressures 
in scattered parts of the region. Some merchants and other service 
industry spokesmen report that the ability to fill entry level 
positions has become a challenge. Atlanta's boom in new retail and 
service businesses has forced many employers to pay well over 
minimum wage. Manufacturing contacts report fewer increases in 
prices for both finished goods and materials than was the case in 
late winter. Some factory contacts note price deflation, especially 
in paper products. One contact expects timber product prices to 
continue to decline for the next few months. A large chemical 
producer notes price erosion because of foreign competition. An 
oversupply of heavy equipment manufacturing capacity is keeping 
prices down for some producers, according to one industry spokesman.
