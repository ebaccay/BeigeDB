      Beige Book Report: Chicago

      <strong>
       May 10, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic activity gained momentum in April, after 
slowing in the first quarter, while reports of price increases grew 
increasingly frequent and widespread. Retail sales and housing 
activity showed signs of strengthening in March and April on a 
seasonally adjusted basis. Manufacturing output continued to expand 
at a moderate pace. District labor markets remained tight. Business 
loan demand remained quite strong, including financing demand for 
working capital, capital equipment, plant expansion, and 
inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumption/Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys and reports from individual firms suggest that retail sales 
and housing activity gained momentum in March and April in spite of 
lingering cold, wet weather. A survey of Michigan retailers showed 
increased sales growth in March, while optimism about future sales 
gains remained high. A survey in the Chicago area indicated that 
consumers' appraisals of their own financial condition improved 
during the first quarter and into April, after weakening in the 
fourth quarter of 1994 and into January. Retailers and 
manufacturers' associations indicated that durable goods sales 
growth (excluding autos) has not accelerated significantly since the 
fourth quarter of 1994, but sales results for April were 
encouraging, and gains from a year ago remained substantial.
     </p>
     <p>
      New vehicle sales remained relatively slow for the time of year, 
according to a survey of District auto dealers, but dealer optimism 
remained high. Used vehicle sales continued to strengthen, 
particularly for late-model cars, and dealer service revenues 
related to "fix-or-buy" decisions were not increasing in line with 
what might have been expected if the new car market were 
fundamentally weakening. Vehicle availability has improved, and a 
dealer association stated that "dealers still don't want to get 
caught short like they did last year." Incentives declined from the 
fourth quarter of 1994 to the first quarter of 1995, but area auto 
dealers expect higher rebates as well as increased dealer incentives 
in May and June. Significant redesigns for half of the top 10 
selling vehicles are reportedly constraining new vehicle sales. A 
survey of auto dealers indicated that interest rates on new car 
loans continued to increase in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from District realtors suggest that existing home sales 
improved in March and April on a seasonally adjusted basis, with 
declining interest rates on mortgage loans playing an important 
role. Expectations for future sales have risen in recent months. An 
association of home builders stated that new home sales are still 
anticipated to decline slightly in 1995, after a very good year in 
1994. "Builders are prepared for some slowing, however, and 
inventories are not especially high." Traffic quality (buyer 
interest, credit-worthiness) remains strong. Cement producers also 
expected somewhat slower growth in shipments volume, partly because 
of weaker-than-expected public infrastructure spending. Shipments 
for cement used in residential construction gained renewed momentum 
in the region in recent months, however, and overall shipments 
volume is still expected to post a new record in 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers' surveys pointed to continued but somewhat 
slower growth in District industrial output in the first quarter of 
1995. The Chicago survey posted a small increase in April, however, 
and first quarter earnings reports for large District industrial 
firms were generally stronger than many analysts expected. 
Industrial power sales in the Detroit area posted a significant 
increase in the first quarter (over a strong year-earlier period), 
according to an electric utility, and power sales strengthened 
further in April. District steel production fell back somewhat 
during April after a robust first quarter, but an industry analyst 
noted that an explosion and subsequent cutback at a large furnace 
accounted for most of the decline. Heavy-duty truck orders climbed 
to a record during March, and an industry analyst stated that order 
backlog quality remains high. Unit sales of construction machinery 
rose nearly 20 percent in early 1995 over a particularly strong 
early-1994 period, but unit sales gains are expected to moderate as 
1995 progresses. An association of appliance manufacturers noted 
some slowing in shipments growth in recent months, but still 
expected shipments this year to slightly exceed their record level 
in 1994, as increased export shipments offset a small decline 
domestically.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets remained tight. A recently released survey of 
job openings in the Milwaukee metropolitan area showed a sharp 
increase in the share of employers characterizing job openings as 
"hard to fill" in late 1994, with wage increases most clearly 
evident in the lowest paying occupations. One of the survey's 
organizers stated that the market continued to tighten in early 
1995. A regional business analyst stated that many firms in Western 
Michigan face serious labor shortages, particularly for "qualified" 
workers. These shortages have curtailed expansion plans, added to 
recruitment and training costs, and combined with other factors to 
prompt some price increases in some industries. A staffing services 
firm specializing in manufacturing occupations stated that producers 
are paying higher salaries for executive positions, and 
manufacturers in the Midwest are incurring higher relocation costs 
with an increasing share of new workers recruited from other areas. 
The distribution division of a large overseas-based manufacturer of 
heavy equipment stated that the firm was not keeping up with market-
driven salary increases for field service engineers, citing margin 
pressure from exchange rate changes. An industry analyst believed 
that labor shortages have not yet resulted in significant wage 
increases among production workers in the fragmented plastics 
industry, but stated "we may be at the crux of this problem right 
now."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Purchasing managers' surveys suggested that purchased material price 
increases moderated in the region during early 1995. However, 
reports from individual firms and manufacturers' associations 
included increasingly frequent reports of price increases being 
passed through into final goods prices. Price increases accounted 
for a greater share of expected revenue growth in several industries 
anticipating slower growth in sales volume. A construction machinery 
industry analyst expressed some surprise with the number and size of 
price increases in this industry in early 1995. Prices paid by 
machinery dealers to manufacturers have been rising at a faster pace 
than list prices, while sales terms and conditions have tightened as 
well. Cement producers are running at "extremely high levels," 
according to an industry analyst, and shortages are most severe in 
the Midwest. Customer dissatisfaction with shortages is high - not 
because price increases cannot be passed through, but because supply 
is still short and delayed, even at the higher price. Construction 
contractors have been reporting raw material price increases of 
about 30 percent in early 1995. An association of home builders 
expressed some concern about appreciation in land prices, and 
expected them to combine with labor and material cost increases to 
prompt greater increases in new home price increases in the latter 
half of 1995. A wide variety of paper buyers reported continuing 
price increases, with one large company stating that the increases 
"aren't stopping like we thought they would." Four times as many 
respondents to a survey of retailers in Michigan reported higher 
consumer prices in recent months as those reporting declining 
prices, while virtually all surveyed stores expected prices to 
increase in coming months.
