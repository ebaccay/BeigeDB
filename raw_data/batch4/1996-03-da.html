      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity continued to expand at a 
  moderate pace in January and February, although weaker demand led to 
  falling prices or inventory build up in several industries. Most 
  contacts do not expect to change employment growth, and several 
  major expansion plans remain in place. Manufacturing orders 
  continued to weaken, but production remained at moderate levels. 
  Demand for business services expanded. Retail sales were sluggish in 
  January but picked up in February. Lending activity was unchanged, 
  with the exception of an increase in residential real estate. 
  Construction activity continued to expand, but some apartment and 
  retail projects were scaled back because of concerns about 
  overbuilding. Energy activity was at a high level. Agricultural 
  conditions worsened.
      <p>
       Contacts reported falling prices for several products, although 
  energy prices were higher and there was continued upward pressure on 
  wages for skilled workers in some industries. In February, paper and 
  box prices fell about 8 percent from the previous month, and 
  contacts expect prices to fall another 5 to 10 percent over the next 
  3 to 6 months. Semiconductor prices had dropped "precipitously" since the last beige book, and stiff competition forced computer 
  manufacturers to pass lower input costs to their customers. 
  Petrochemical prices were pushed to low levels as slower demand, 
  particularly for olefins, led producers to dump products on the spot 
  market. Contacts expect any significant economic upturn to push 
  chemical prices back up, however. Lower livestock prices outweighed 
  a slight increase in crop prices, leading to a 1.0 percent drop in 
  the January Texas All Farm Products Price Index from the previous 
  month. Retailers reported little change in selling prices. Input 
  costs were higher for apparel products, but selling prices were 
  unchanged. Weather extremes, and changing expectations about Iraqi 
  oil re-entering the market, kept crude oil and heating fuel prices 
  swinging. Prices for most energy products, particularly natural gas 
  and fuel oil, were high and volatile during the past two months.
       <p>
        Manufacturing orders continued to weaken, but production remained at 
  moderate levels. Demand had slowed for paper, boxes, apparel, 
  primary metals, petrochemicals and semiconductors. Inventories were 
  up for paper, apparel, primary metals and some types of 
  semiconductors. Producers reported a slight increase in demand for 
  computers and specialized semiconductors, but demand for memory 
  computer chips and microprocessors dropped off significantly in the 
  last 6 weeks. Overall, semiconductor sales were weaker than 
  expected, and contacts expect demand to increase at a slower pace 
  than in 1995. Petrochemical markets continued to soften. Chemical 
  producers said there had been no significant inventory build up and 
  sales were still profitable, which is unusual when demand is weak. 
  Cold weather boosted demand for refined products, although rising 
  crude prices kept profits mediocre. Low inventories of crude forced 
  refiners to purchase crude on the spot market to raise output and 
  take advantage of high product prices. Producers reported a slight 
  pickup in demand for oil field machinery and lumber, and demand 
  remained steady and strong for cement and fabricated metals.
        <p>
         Demand for business services continued to expand at a good pace. 
  Accounting firms said demand was strong. Activity at temporary firms 
  picked up in February after a seasonal slow down in January. 
  Transportation firms reported steady cargo volume and a slight 
  increase in passenger traffic.
         <p>
          Retail sales were sluggish in January but picked up in February. 
  Retailers were cautious about drawing conclusions from stronger 
  sales in February, what a contact referred to as "one short month." District sales were reported to be about even with the rest of the 
  country after several months of reports that sales were slower than 
  the nation. The change may have been a result of an improvement in 
  sales comparisons along the Texas-Mexico border, rather than any 
  relative change in consumer spending. Dealers reported that auto 
  sales were sluggish in January and February, leaving them with 
  larger than desired inventories.
          <p>
           The financial services industry reported no change in lending 
  activity, with the exception of an increase in residential real 
  estate. Contacts said that the increase was spurred by lower 
  interest rates and was mostly due to refinancings. Residential loan 
  demand continued to decline in Laredo, however, where economic 
  activity has been sluggish since the peso devaluation. District 
  lenders are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for loan demand 
  over the next 3 to 12 months and expect all types of lending to 
  increase. Contacts reported that there is a lot of discussion about 
  further mergers and acquisitions among financial services companies.
           <p>
            Construction activity expanded, but some apartment and retail 
  projects were scaled back because of concerns about overbuilding. 
  Lower mortgage rates boosted sales of new and existing homes. Demand 
  for commercial space remained high, and industrial demand was very 
  strong. While the construction of office space is sparse, some 
  contacts said rising office occupancies in the suburbs may spur new 
  construction in 1996.
            <p>
             Energy activity remained at a high level since the last beige book. 
  Demand for oil services and equipment continued to strengthen, 
  thanks to offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and around the 
  world. Oil services contacts reported that strong demand had boosted 
  profits well above expectations. Higher capital budgets for 
  exploration from integrated companies are expected to lead to 
  another good year in 1996. The domestic U.S. and Texas rig count 
  continued to be low, however, operating at levels comparable to this 
  time last year.
             <p>
              Agricultural conditions worsened in January and February. Continued 
  drought led to more than 350 fires which destroyed more than 20,000 
  acres of pasture land. Hay shortages still were reported in many 
  areas. Supplemental feeding of livestock continued and rising feed 
  prices were cutting into profits. As planting gets underway, some 
  farmers expressed concern about having adequate water to produce a 
  good quality yield.
