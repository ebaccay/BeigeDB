      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy continues to generate stable business growth 
coupled with few signs of rising consumer prices. Retail sales 
growth met most contacts' expectations, and they anticipate stronger 
growth this spring. District manufacturing firms are experiencing 
growth in sales and new orders, while continuing to cope with tight 
labor markets and moderate wage pressures. A Manpower survey of 
District firms shows the pace of hiring picking up in the second 
quarter compared with the first quarter. Unseasonably mild winter 
conditions supported higher than usual levels of residential and 
commercial construction and real estate sales in most parts of the 
District. Loans outstanding at large District banks rose 2.4 percent 
in the first two months of 1998, compared with a 0.8 percent decline 
in the same period a year ago. The Asian situation is not yet 
pulling down cotton exports to the degree that many District 
producers expect.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report that January sales were up about 4 percent over the 
previous year-a pace that met contacts' expectations. Sales of 
winter clothes have been very slow due to mild winter weather, while 
sales of home furnishings have picked up in anticipation of an early 
spring. Although most contacts report that current inventories are 
at desired levels, several noted that their inventories are slightly 
high. Retailers are anticipating a moderate increase in sales growth 
in the second quarter. Sales in Missouri may be boosted by the 
recent refund of state budget surpluses; these refunds averaged $300 
per household.
       <p>
        Automobile dealers report that sales in January were down an average 
of 12 percent to 15 percent over the previous year. Several 
speculated that high levels of consumer debt kept buyers away. More 
than half of the contacts have been using rebates and incentives 
more than usual to move stock. In addition, nearly half of the 
respondents indicate that their current inventories are too high. 
Dealers remain optimistic, though, that sales will pick up in the 
second quarter.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Overall, District contacts report that business conditions remain 
favorable, and that growth in sales and new orders continues to chug 
along at a moderate pace. Contacts also report that competitive 
markets and productivity improvements are keeping price increases at 
bay, even though input costs continue to increase modestly. Tight 
labor markets continue to plague District firms. Contacts in
Kentucky are concerned that UPS will have a difficult time finding 
the 6,000 workers or so it will need as part of a just-announced 
$860 million expansion in Louisville.
         <p>
          Contacts from a variety of District industries report growth in 
sales and orders. A contact in the furniture industry, for example, 
reports that industry sales have been high and growing modestly 
recently. That said, some smaller furniture manufacturers aren't 
faring well compared with their larger competitors. District auto 
plants are stepping up production of pickup trucks and sport utility 
vehicles, and a tire producer is considering going to seven day 
(from six), 24-hour shifts to keep up with demand. To cut costs, 
however, a maker of home appliances will shift production from 
Kentucky to plants in Georgia and Mexico. In anticipation of costly 
settlements or lawsuits, tobacco firms are cutting back on workers 
to preserve profits.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Employment Outlook
           </strong>
           <br/>
           According to Manpower's second-quarter employment outlook survey, 
the pace of hiring will pick up in Little Rock, Louisville and 
Memphis relative to the first quarter. Gains are expected to be most 
pronounced in Little Rock, where about half of surveyed firms intend 
to boost their payrolls. In St. Louis, by contrast, little change in 
second-quarter hiring is expected. Compared with a year earlier, 
though, considerably less hiring is expected, with only Memphis 
firms anticipating higher employment levels.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Real Estate and Construction
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Mild winter conditions led to unseasonably high levels of 
residential building construction in most parts of the District in 
January. In almost all of the District's 12 metropolitan areas, 
monthly and year-over-year building permits were up. Sales of new 
and existing homes also were unseasonably high, with most contacts 
reporting moderate increases in average selling prices. Commercial
construction-dominated by office, retail and apartment-is also 
strong in many parts of the District. Some contacts are concerned, 
however, that apartment construction might be too aggressive in some 
areas, given the expected demand.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Banking and Finance
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Total loans on the books of a sample of large District banks have 
increased 2.4 percent since the start of the year. One year ago, 
total loans declined 0.8 percent over the same period. Commercial 
and industrial loans have risen 1.3 percent, while real estate loans 
have increased 3.3 percent. Consumer loans have declined 1.8 percent 
over the period.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Agriculture and Natural Resources
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Cotton industry contacts report that the Asian situation has not yet 
affected export quantities to the degree anticipated a few months 
back; the largest effect, they believe, has been on prices. Although 
exports to certain Asian markets have been reduced, the drop in 
cotton prices has spurred additional sales to other markets, such as 
Mexico and Turkey. Overall, cotton producers still expect some 
reduction in exports to Asia, although not to the extent anticipated 
three months ago. A cotton industry report suggests that cotton 
plantings this spring could be the lowest in 15 years.
