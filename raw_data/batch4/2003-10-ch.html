       Seventh District economic activity continued 
                to show signs of modest improvement in late August and September. 
                However, many businesses wanted to see a longer period of firming 
                in demand before committing to hiring, expanding capacity, or 
                inventory building. Consumer spending was stronger than earlier 
                in the year, but sales results were mixed by retail segment. Business 
                attitudes appeared to improve further, yet spending and hiring 
                plans remained cautious. Construction and real estate activities 
                continued to be characterized by strong residential markets and 
                weak commercial markets. Manufacturing activity continued to expand. 
                Bank lending remained relatively soft. There were only small changes 
                in the price and cost environments. Early harvest results suggest 
                that corn output will be at least average, but that soybean output 
                will be well below average.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending in August and September still appeared to be 
                stronger than earlier in the year, although reports were mixed. 
                Retailers said that sales generally exceeded expectations, as 
                consumers continued to purchase deeply discounted merchandise. 
                Inventories were leaner than expected as a result. Still, most 
                merchants were not confident enough about sales prospects to boost 
                inventories in the near term. While apparel sales generally remained 
                sluggish, there was a sharp rise in sales of baseball-related 
                apparel in the Chicago area. By contrast, a contact in casual 
                dining indicated that food service sales remained soft. District 
                auto dealers said that light vehicle sales fell from August to 
                September, and seemed softer than the national trend in both months. 
                With weaker sales, dealers continued to curb light vehicle orders 
                and draw down inventories. Many dealers also noted that service 
                sales slowed in September after picking up toward the end of summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Business attitudes continued to improve, although spending and 
                hiring plans remained cautious. Several contacts noted that businesses 
                were seeing better earnings, but much of the improvement resulted 
                from cost containment rather than revenue gains. One contact suggested 
                that firms want to see several periods of stronger revenue growth 
                "in their rearview mirrors" before they commit to capacity expansion 
                and permanent hiring. Most capital equipment spending continued 
                to go toward the maintenance, repair, or replacement of existing 
                stock. On the hiring side, contacts with temporary help firms 
                reported a seasonal pickup in worker orders; for one national 
                firm, this was the first seasonal boost in three years. The jump 
                in worker assignments was particularly evident in the light industrial 
                and office/clerical categories. Several contacts suggested that 
                the bulk of new temporary hiring was done by small employers rather 
                than large. Still, most businesses remained very reluctant to 
                add permanent full-time help, although there were a few reports 
                of increasing worker hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       As has been true for some time now, District real estate markets 
                were strong on the residential side and weak on the commercial 
                side. New home sales were again robust, with one contact's comment 
                that "business is great" generally summing up builders' sentiment. 
                Sales of first-time-buyer and trade-up homes continued to drive 
                the market, although there were a few reports of a pickup in the 
                luxury segment. Traffic through builders' annual "Fall Parade 
                of Homes" was very high in most areas, leaving builders more optimistic 
                that new home sales will remain strong well into the fall. Existing 
                home sales were also very strong in most parts of the District. 
                Commercial activities appeared to slow somewhat. Some contacts 
                said that the number of office property tours and prospects fell 
                recently, after picking up through the summer. On balance, office 
                vacancy rates were flat in the third quarter, and rents remained 
                under downward pressure. Light industrial vacancies remained elevated 
                and there were some concerns that big-box retail space was overdeveloped.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity continued to expand in late August and 
                September. Nationally, light vehicle demand exceeded some automakers' 
                expectations over the summer months, which helped bring inventories 
                down to desired levels sooner than anticipated. Despite stronger 
                sales, automakers did not report any changes to production schedules. 
                A leading producer of home appliances said that shipments picked 
                up in recent months as distributors replenished depleted inventories. 
                Some heavy equipment industries were seeing a "pretty good recovery," 
                according to one contact, and even though inventories were rising, 
                the inventory-to-sales ratio continued to decline. Medium-duty 
                truck dealers were also said to be rebuilding inventories, helping 
                to boost shipments in September. Some producers of machine tools 
                noted increases in price quotes, new orders, and shipments. Moreover, 
                one contact suggested that the increase in demand for machine 
                tools was coming from customers across a wider range of industries. 
                Despite little change in demand, domestic steel production improved 
                modestly as imports continued to fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall lending activity remained relatively soft, although bankers 
                reported slight increases in both household and business loan 
                demand. Residential refinancing activity increased somewhat from 
                its summer lull, but remained well below the peak reached in June. 
                One banker said that margins on mortgage loans were being squeezed 
                as firms that had built up "a huge mortgage lending infrastructure" 
                competed for a smaller pool of potential borrowers. Some contacts 
                also noted modest increases in home equity and credit card volumes. 
                Household loan quality was reported to be largely unchanged. Business 
                loan demand remained very soft on balance, though there were scattered 
                reports of improvement in some segments. A few bankers noted increased 
                lending to small businesses, and one saw a pickup in middle-market 
                lending. For the most part though, large corporate borrowers remained 
                on the sidelines. Business credit quality was said to be improving, 
                and there were no changes reported for standards and terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Employment Costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       On balance, there was little change in the pricing and cost environments. 
                Manufacturers of some products said that a weaker dollar enabled 
                them to raise output prices from very low levels. However, producers 
                of other goods attempted to push through price increases with 
                limited success. Many retailers indicated that the long trend 
                toward steeper discounts may be coming to an end, with one adding 
                that "prices simply can't go much lower." Business contacts continued 
                to report that higher energy and insurance costs were squeezing 
                profits. To keep the rise in employment costs down, more employers 
                were planning to shift higher health insurance premiums to their 
                workers. In addition, several contacts reported that firms continued 
                to limit and/or delay merit pay increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Crop conditions generally stabilized during September after deteriorating 
                during August due to heat and lack of precipitation. In eastern 
                portions of the District, however, harvesting was running behind 
                average since fields were too wet and crops were maturing late. 
                Corn yields across the District were coming in close to normal 
                or above, but soybean yields were mostly below normal. Widespread 
                spraying for aphids kept soybean yields from falling more, but 
                boosted input costs. On balance, expectations for farm income 
                have been reduced, potentially stressing farmers' cash flows and 
                thus generating concerns about loan repayments. As a result, slower 
                capital expenditures in farming are expected for the District, 
                except for repairs. Nonetheless, strong competition between farmers 
                and nonfarm investors persisted, driving farmland values and rental 
                rates higher. With less development in some areas, there are signs 
                that the role of tax-deferred exchanges in pushing up land values 
                has begun to slow.
