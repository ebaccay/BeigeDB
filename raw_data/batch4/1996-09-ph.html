      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District was gaining slightly in 
August. Manufacturers continued to report increases in orders and 
shipments, although the portion of firms noting increased demand for 
their products was smaller than it had been earlier in the summer. 
Retailers said sales were starting to move up for the back-to-school 
period, and they were expecting the year-over-year increase to be a 
few percent in current dollars. Auto dealers reported steady sales 
in recent weeks. Bankers generally reported that consumer lending 
was moving up slightly, but business loan volumes have been flat. In 
commercial real estate markets, office vacancy rates have edged down 
since the beginning of the year, but rents have been steady. Demand 
for industrial space remained healthy, and there has been stepped-up 
construction of warehouses. Most of this construction has been 
build-to-suit, and vacancy rates for industrial space have remained 
steady. Reports from residential builders varied across the 
District; overall, however, the pace of residential construction has 
been steady since summer began.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus outlook is positive but modest. Manufacturers expect 
some further gains in output, but they are not planning to increase 
employment, on balance. Retailers expect a small year-over-year 
improvement in sales this fall, but auto dealers anticipate just 
steady sales. Bankers foresee little change in loan demand. Real 
estate contacts expect relatively steady conditions to persist, with 
commercial space demand and supply remaining in balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers generally noted continuing increases in 
orders and shipments in August, although the number of firms posting 
gains was fewer than in the prior two months. About four in ten 
reported increased demand for their products during August, while 
two in ten reported declines. Business was relatively weak for 
manufacturers of building products, as it has been since June. In 
addition, some makers of consumer products indicated that the 
seasonal increase in orders they usually see at this time was below 
their expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to plant managers contacted in August, both employment 
levels and working hours have been increased slightly. However, 
capital spending plans have been trimmed; only one in four of the 
firms surveyed indicated they would be boosting outlays for new 
plant or equipment in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District merchants contacted in late August reported the usual 
back-to-school pickup in sales. Most said the gains for the period 
this year compared to last will be only a few percent in current 
dollars. Retailers' expectations for the fall selling season as a 
whole are varied. While some are optimistic that there will be a 
healthy year-over-year increase, most anticipate just modest gains. 
Some retailers expressed apprehension that women's apparel sales 
will not meet forecasts made earlier this year, and this will limit 
the dollar value of total sales for the fall. Another possible 
limiting factor on sales growth is the more restrictive credit 
standards that several major retailers have begun to implement. In 
general, retailers said their inventories were in line with the 
current sales rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers indicated that the pace of sales has been steady. While 
popular models were selling briskly, dealers have been reducing 
prices to clear out some current model-year cars and sport-utility 
vehicles before they receive new models.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers generally reported slight increases in 
consumer loan volumes in August, which they considered mostly 
seasonal. Bankers said commercial and industrial lending markets 
remain competitive, with credit available from large and small 
banks, nonbank finance companies, and institutional investors. On 
balance, banks contacted for this report have not been able to 
increase their business loan volumes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, bankers expect loan levels to be fairly steady except 
for some seasonal increases. Some bankers reported that their 
commercial and industrial borrowers have indicated that they expect 
their own business to be steady through the end of this year and 
their credit needs to remain at current levels. Bankers do not 
expect much change in consumer lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real Estate and Construction
Commercial real estate brokers generally reported that office 
vacancy rates in the Third District have edged down from the 
beginning of the year. In recently released mid-year surveys, real 
estate firms estimated the vacancy rate for the Philadelphia central 
business district at 13 percent. Estimated vacancy rates for 
suburban office markets were 10 percent in southeastern Pennsylvania 
and 19 percent in southern New Jersey. Office vacancy rates in 
northeastern and central Pennsylvania markets were estimated to be 
lower than in the Philadelphia area. Real estate agents caution that 
some of the drop in vacancy rates is the result of older buildings 
being removed from the market; including space available for 
sublease would raise effective vacancy rates. Real estate agents 
also noted that office rents have been steady so far this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for industrial space remains healthy in the region. 
Industrial rental rates have edged up this year, and vacancy rates 
have remained steady at around 13 percent despite recent 
construction of warehouse and distribution buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity remains below the 1995 pace in 
Third District states. Nonetheless, build-to-suit construction of 
office and industrial buildings has picked up during the first half 
of the year in central and northeastern Pennsylvania and southern 
New Jersey. Most real estate contacts expect the current rate of 
commercial construction to persist through the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction activity varies around the District; some 
markets have seen healthy gains this year compared to last, 
especially in townhouse construction, while others have seen 
declines. Overall, home building has been steady recently. Realtors 
also generally reported steady rates of sales for existing homes.
