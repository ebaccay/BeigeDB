      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District increased slightly in March 
and April. Areas reporting growth included tourism, ports, temporary 
employment agencies, commercial real estate, and state revenues. 
Areas exhibiting little or no growth included services, finance, and 
residential real estate. Growth in consumer spending and 
manufacturing activity was down, and conditions in agriculture were 
somewhat worse than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of retail activity growth generally decreased in April 
from their March levels, according to preliminary results from a 
mail survey of District retailers. Sales, wages, and inventories 
decreased. Employment and big-ticket sales increased, however, and 
shopper traffic was unchanged. Survey respondents indicated that 
retail prices rose 1.1 percent in April. They foresaw decreased 
demand for their products and an increase of 2.0 percent in their 
prices during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service-Producing Firms
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of service-sector activity growth changed little in April 
from their March levels, according to preliminary results from a 
District mail survey. Respondents indicated, however, that 
employment was lower. Service producers reported that prices rose 
0.6 percent in April. They expected a slight decrease in demand for 
their services and an increase of 1.0 percent in their prices during 
the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most indicators of factory activity growth declined in April from 
their March levels, according to preliminary results of a mail 
survey of District manufacturers. The shipments, new orders, and 
employment indexes declined, and the backlog and workweek indexes 
changed little. Manufacturers expected shipments, the workweek, and 
capital expenditures to increase during the next six months. 
Finished goods prices rose at the same rate in April as in March, 
and at a rate slightly below the general inflation rate. Raw 
materials prices rose less in April than in March, and at a rate 
higher than the general inflation rate. Respondents expected prices 
to rise slightly faster during the next six months than they had 
expected in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated that tourist activity in April was above that of 
March and a year ago. Spring bookings at District hotels and motels 
were up compared to a year ago. Contacts expected better-than-normal 
business this summer; one predicted "our biggest summer ever."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports indicated that export and import 
levels in March were higher than those in February and a year ago. 
They expected that, over the next six months, exports would increase 
and imports would change little. One contact attributed this outlook 
to the weak U.S. dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment Agencies
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of temporary employment agencies indicated that 
labor markets were tight throughout the District. Demand for 
temporary workers strengthened and wages rose somewhat in April 
compared to March and a year ago. One contact suggested that there 
were "more jobs than people right now," and another described "a 
bidding war" for workers. Demand was particularly strong from 
manufacturers, warehousers, and distributors, and companies were 
seeking "anyone with computer skills."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions reported that credit conditions were 
mixed during the past seven weeks. Interest rates rose moderately 
for consumer loans, fell for mortgage loans, and were flat for 
commercial loans. Demand for mortgage loans increased sharply; 
demand for commercial loans rose slightly; and demand for consumer 
loans declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a telephone survey of District realtors and builders, 
residential real estate activity was unchanged in March and April. 
Building permits, home sales, and buyer traffic were stable over the 
period. Housing starts were also stable, except in West Virginia, 
where they decreased. Contacts reported that lower- to middle-priced 
homes were selling better than expensive homes. Home prices were 
steady, although building materials prices rose.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported that commercial real estate activity 
increased slightly in late March and April. Leasing activity 
increased somewhat, but contacts reported little new construction. 
Vacancy rates inched downward, except in Maryland and the District 
of Columbia, where they were stable. Commercial rents changed 
little, except in North Carolina and the District of Columbia 
suburbs, where they increased. The availability of prime office 
space tightened in most District cities, and contacts reported 
shortages of such space in Raleigh, N.C., and the District of 
Columbia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State government forecasters said that tax collections grew in 
March. Real revenue growth was strong in Maryland, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, and Virginia; somewhat slower in West Virginia; and 
flat in the District of Columbia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions in April were somewhat worse than a year 
ago, according to farm analysts. Despite some recent rainfall, soil 
moisture levels in most District states were well below normal. 
Winter small-grain crops remained in generally good condition, but 
damage from dry weather was apparent in some areas of the District. 
Spring planting activity generally progressed at a normal pace, 
although in some areas of Virginia, farmers were waiting for rain 
before resuming planting. Dry conditions contributed to forest fires 
in Virginia and West Virginia.
