      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

       March 6, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy remained very sluggish 
            in late January and February, but some small signs of improvement 
            were reported. Manufacturing activity fell further, automobile sales 
            and residential construction activity declined, and commercial real 
            estate activity remained weak. On the positive side, however, retail 
            sales excluding autos edged higher, home sales strengthened, and energy 
            activity stabilized. In the farm economy, dry weather continued to 
            hinder the development of the winter wheat crop. District labor markets 
            remained considerably less tight than a year ago, and wage pressures 
            were largely nonexistent. Retail prices and prices for construction 
            materials were flat, while prices for several manufacturing materials 
            edged lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Consumer Spending
      </b>
      <br/>
      Retail sales edged up in late January and February following a better-than-expected 
              holiday season, and were above year-ago levels in most stores. High-end 
              retailers, however, continued to report sluggish sales. Many retailers 
              in Kansas, Oklahoma, and western Missouri lost sales when they were 
              forced to close due to power outages caused by a late January ice 
              storm. Home furnishing items continued to sell particularly well 
              across the district. Nearly all retailers expect sales to increase 
              in coming months. Inventory levels held steady, and most managers 
              reported they were satisfied with their stocks. Most stores, however, 
              expect to expand stock levels heading into the Easter season. Colorado 
              ski resort operators reported that while activity has been below 
              year-ago levels, it has not been as weak as they feared in the fall. 
              Motor vehicle sales in the district continued to fall from the record 
              sales seen late in 2001 and lot inventories were growing more quickly 
              than some dealers preferred. Still, dealers were cautiously optimistic 
              that sales would rebound by summer.
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing
       </b>
       <br/>
       District factory activity declined again, but optimism about future 
              production continued to build. Production and orders fell farther 
              below year-ago levels, and employment and capital expenditures showed 
              little sign of improvement. Auto plants in the region experienced 
              brief losses of production as a result of the late January ice storm. 
              One plant expects to make up the lost production sometime in March. 
              On the positive side, an increasing percentage of district manufacturers 
              expect a turnaround by mid-year. Inventory levels held steady after 
              falling sharply over the past year, but are expected to resume declining 
              in coming months. Some firms reported difficulties receiving steel 
              shipments, but no other significant shortages of materials were 
              reported or expected for the foreseeable future.
       <p>
        <b>
         Real Estate and Construction
        </b>
        <br/>
        Home sales strengthened in most of the district, but residential 
              construction activity declined in most district states, and commercial 
              real estate markets remained very weak. Residential sales improved 
              in most areas, with the exception of higher-end homes. However, 
              inventories of unsold homes still remain high, and housing starts 
              fell outside of Oklahoma and New Mexico. Most builders expect the 
              sluggish activity to continue for several months. Commercial realtors 
              continued to report weakness in most district office markets, especially 
              in Denver. With absorption remaining slow, vacancies have continued 
              to edge up, and were significantly higher than a year ago in February. 
              Lease concessions such as rent abatement and moving allowances continued 
              to be reported in some markets. However, Realtors reported prices 
              for office space were down only slightly, as most sellers are still 
              in good financial position and expect the market to turn around 
              once the economy recovers.
        <p>
         <b>
          Banking
         </b>
         <br/>
         Bankers report that loans fell and deposits increased since the 
              last survey, reducing loan-deposit ratios. Demand fell for commercial 
              and industrial loans, residential construction loans, and commercial 
              real estate loans. Demand held steady for home mortgages and edged 
              up for home equity loans. Refinancing activity slowed but was described 
              by some bankers as still strong. On the deposit side, demand deposits, 
              NOW accounts, and money market deposit accounts all increased, while 
              large CDs and small time deposits remained unchanged. Bankers attributed 
              the increase in liquid deposit accounts to low market interest rates 
              and a wait-and-see attitude by investors. All respondent banks reduced 
              their prime lending rates, but most banks left their consumer lending 
              rates unchanged. Lending standards were unchanged.
         <p>
          <b>
           Energy
          </b>
          <br/>
          Energy activity in the district remained steady in late January 
              and February. The region's count of active oil and gas drilling 
              rigs stayed near the two-year low reached in late 2001. In Wyoming, 
              higher coal prices have reportedly led to some expansion of mining 
              activity and have intensified efforts to increase rail service from 
              the Powder River Basin to coal markets.
          <p>
           <b>
            Agriculture
           </b>
           <br/>
           Much of the district's winter wheat crop was in below-average condition 
              due to dry weather. The dry weather has also limited grazing on 
              district wheat fields, but other forages have been in ample supply 
              for feeding cattle this winter. District farmers remained concerned 
              about the weak farm economy and were hesitant to take on additional 
              debt. District bankers, however, reported strong farm balance sheets 
              with farmland values holding steady. To date, major problems in 
              district farm loan portfolios have been avoided through government 
              payments to farmers. Small business activity in rural areas remained 
              sluggish and expectations point toward a slow recovery at best.
           <p>
            <b>
             Wages and Prices
            </b>
            <br/>
            District labor markets remained considerably less tight than a year 
              ago, but a slightly higher percentage of firms reported shortages 
              of some kinds of workers than in the previous survey. Occupations 
              experiencing shortages included welders, skilled construction trades, 
              and nurses. There were also some tentative signs of increased demand 
              for entry-level retail and service workers. Some hospitals reported 
              expanding the use of nontraditional hiring incentives, including 
              grocery allowances and housecleaning services, in an effort to attract 
              nurses. Evidence of wage pressures outside the occupations experiencing 
              shortages remained virtually nonexistent. Some firms reported they 
              were delaying annual wage increases for six months or more. Many 
              employers also continued to increase employees' share of health 
              care costs. Retail prices largely held steady and are expected to 
              remain flat in coming months. Prices for most manufacturing materials, 
              including many plastics and paper products, have declined. Meanwhile, 
              steel prices have risen somewhat and are expected to increase further. 
              Prices for construction materials were basically flat, but many 
              builders were concerned that prices for gypsum wallboard would increase 
              in the near future.
