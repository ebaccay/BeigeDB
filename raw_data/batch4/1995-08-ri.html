      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The rate of economic expansion in the Fifth District appears to have 
been steady in late June and July. Retailers and manufacturers 
reported that growth slowed in their industries, but service 
producers reported that growth picked up. Residential and commercial 
real estate contacts and financial industry sources reported little 
change in their sectors. Contacts at area ports and in the tourism 
industry reported increased activity, and temporary employment 
agencies saw stronger demand for temporary workers. Government 
contacts reported mixed trends in state revenue growth. Agricultural 
conditions were good, although adverse weather damaged some crops 
and poultry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of retail activity growth decreased in July from their 
June levels, according to preliminary results from a mail survey of 
District retailers. The indexes of sales, employment inventories, 
big-ticket sales, and shopper traffic were lower. The index of wages 
changed little, however. Survey respondents indicated that retail 
prices rose more slowly in July. They foresaw increased growth in 
the demand for their products, and they expected their prices to 
rise more rapidly during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service Production
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of service-sector activity growth increased in July from 
their June levels, according to preliminary results from a mail 
survey of District service producers. The indexes of revenues and 
wages rose. The employment index changed little. Service producers 
reported that their prices rose more slowly in July. They expected 
the growth in demand for their services to change little during the 
next six months, and they expected their prices to rise more slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of factory growth decreased in July from their June 
levels, according to a mail survey of Fifth District manufacturers. 
The shipments and backlog indexes decreased, and the new orders, 
employment, and workweek indexes changed little. Manufacturers were 
more optimistic about the growth in shipments and employment during 
the next six months, but their expectations about the workweek 
changed little from June. They also anticipated decreased finished 
goods inventories. Finished goods and raw materials prices rose more 
slowly in July than in June, and at rates below the general 
inflation rate. Respondents expected their prices to rise more 
slowly during the next six months than they had expected in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated that tourist activity in June and early July was 
above that of May and a year ago. Summer bookings were up compared 
to a year ago, and contacts expected better-than-normal business and 
unchanged prices during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports indicated that export and import 
levels in June were higher than those in May and a year ago. 
Contacts expected that both exports and imports would increase 
during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of Fifth District temporary employment agencies 
indicated that the demand for temporary workers in June and early 
July was higher than it was a year ago and was little changed from 
its May level. The demand for clerical workers was particularly 
strong. Contacts expected demand during the next six months to be 
greater than usual. Temporary workers' wages rose faster than the 
general price level during the past year, although most contacts 
expected wages to stabilize during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finance
District financial institutions reported that credit conditions were 
mixed during the past seven weeks. Interest rates fell moderately 
for consumer and commercial loans and rose slightly for mortgage 
loans. Demand increased for mortgage and commercial loans but fell 
slightly for consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a telephone survey of District real estate agents and 
homebuilders, residential real estate activity was unchanged in June 
and early July. Building permits, housing starts, and home sales 
were stable over the period, except in North Carolina, where 
building permits and housing starts increased. Buyer traffic 
increased, and most contacts attributed the increase to lower 
mortgage interest rates. Contacts reported that lower- to middle-
priced homes were selling better than expensive homes. Home prices 
were unchanged, except in North Carolina, where they increased. 
District building material prices and subcontractor wages were 
steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported that commercial real estate activity 
changed little in June and early July. Leasing activity was 
unchanged, except in North Carolina, where it increased. Vacancy 
rates declined slightly, and commercial rents changed little. The 
availability of prime office space tightened in most District 
cities, and contacts reported shortages of such space in North 
Carolina and the District of Columbia. Contacts reported little new 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State government contacts reported mixed results in tax collection 
growth in June. Compared with May, real revenue growth was lower in 
the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia; steady in North 
Carolina; and higher in South Carolina and West Virginia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural conditions remained good in recent weeks, 
although adverse weather hurt crops and poultry in some areas, 
according to agricultural analysts. Record or new-record yields were 
reported for small-grain crops. Flooding in Virginia and heavy rain 
in the Carolinas caused only minor damage to small-grain and tobacco 
crops in some localities. A more serious impact of the rains, 
however, was their promotion of blue mold growth on the tobacco 
crops, especially burley tobacco. On the other hand, recent rainfall 
benefited the corn, soybean, and hay crops. Above-normal 
temperatures meanwhile led to higher-than-normal poultry losses, 
especially along Maryland's Eastern Shore.
