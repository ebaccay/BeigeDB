      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 13, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, the district reports point to some further expansion in 
economic activity with no clear change in underlying price pressure. 
Broadly interpreted, the expansion in business activity is seen as 
largely the same as in the previous report with minor modifications. 
Industrial activity appears to have stabilized and in some areas may 
now be strengthening. Many districts also report a pickup in 
construction. In sectors where business conditions are reported to 
be soft, such as retailing and agriculture, the hot, dry summer 
weather is commonly blamed. Only the New York and Dallas districts 
characterized business conditions as having deteriorated since the 
last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There has been little change in price pressures since the last 
report. Industrial materials prices have slowed from their strong 
pace in 1994, although higher costs for some materials (including 
paper, certain plastics, and building materials) continue to trouble 
some manufacturers. Overall, however, industrial cost pressures 
appear to be relatively minimal. Reduced crop yields have boosted 
prices for a range of agricultural commodities, and in some cases, 
such as grains, prices are substantially above levels at this time 
last year. More generally, consumer price increases are somewhat 
restrained, and there is little apparent concern about an 
acceleration in retail price pressures over the immediate term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Few changes in employment conditions are reported. In the New York 
and Cleveland districts, unemployment has risen, although in the 
latter instance, the higher rate of joblessness is tied to model-
year changeovers in the auto industry. Some labor market tightness 
is noted, such as for construction workers in the Richmond and San 
Francisco districts, and in some specific areas of the St. Louis and 
Dallas districts. By and large, however, the demand for labor is 
seen as growing moderately with little unusual pressure on wage 
gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A preponderance of districts report lackluster retail spending in 
August. Exceptions are the San Francisco district, where spending 
has improved after weakening earlier, and the Atlanta region, where 
a strong pace of back-to-school purchases and optimism over holiday 
sales are reported. The Philadelphia district notes a typical 
seasonal increase in retail activity. These reports break from a 
general pattern of a subdued back-to-school shopping season caused 
in large part by unusually hot August weather in much of the 
country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel sales are described as soft in a majority of the district 
reports. August home goods sales were off from July levels in the 
Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago regions, but stronger in the Kansas 
City district. Auto sales were mixed by district, showing little 
propensity to move much in either direction. With a few exceptions 
(many districts report high apparel stockpiles), retail inventories 
are described as being in good shape.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The slowing in manufacturing activity reported in the last district 
summary appears to have leveled off. In some districts, such as 
Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco, manufacturing activity 
appears to have strengthened slightly. Only the New York district 
indicates a continued falloff in overall manufacturing production. 
Most reports echo the Minneapolis district, where manufacturing 
sales are described as "good, but not growing at the pace they were 
a year ago." Continued high levels of production are noted in the 
Cleveland and Kansas City regions, and by sector, demand is strong 
in the areas of computer, fabricated metals, telecommunications, and 
electronics manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Among the more favorable developments since the last district 
summary has been an apparent strengthening in construction activity 
in many regions. The Chicago and St. Louis districts note strong 
home sales, and Cleveland reports an improvement in residential 
construction. The Atlanta district indicates that single-family home 
sales are running "modestly above year-ago levels" and that 
residential construction has improved. Multifamily construction 
activity has picked up in the Kansas City district, and 
nonresidential construction has increased in many parts of the 
Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Of the seven districts reporting on agricultural conditions, the St. 
Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas regions indicate that crops are in 
good shape, although heat and insect problems have affected some 
areas. The Kansas City district sees crops in fairly good condition, 
but their development is two to four weeks behind schedule as a 
result of spring rains. In the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and San 
Francisco districts, dry, harsh weather and other calamities have 
adversely affected crop yields and pushed some prices higher. In 
particular, corn, soybean, cotton, peanut, and tobacco harvests are 
down from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other General Business Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The tourist season appears to have been a bright spot in many 
district economies. The New York district describes tourism as 
brisk, especially from abroad, Philadelphia reports a good season, 
and Minneapolis sees tourism in its eastern region as having 
improved. In addition, Minneapolis reports tourism as "outpacing 
that of last year," as does Richmond, although traffic has 
apparently fallen off slightly in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      In other sectors, business reports are mixed. Service-sector growth 
has decreased in the Richmond district, and drilling activity is 
flat in the Kansas City and Dallas regions. In the Dallas report, 
however, business services demand is seen as having strengthened, 
and the San Francisco district reports continued strong demand in 
service-producing industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity is reported to have held steady, and in some cases, 
such as the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas 
City districts, it has actually grown somewhat further. Consumer 
borrowing has declined "considerably" in the New York district and 
is characterized as "soft" in the Atlanta report, but is growing in 
many other parts of the country. In two districts, Philadelphia and 
Cleveland, revolving credit demands are especially strong. Most 
districts report continued growth in commercial credit demand, while 
mortgage credit extensions are mixed by region. No deteriorations in 
credit quality are noted.
