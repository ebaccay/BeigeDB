      <strong>
       August 8, 2001
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from most Federal Reserve Districts point to slow 
            growth or lateral movement in economic activity in June and July. 
            Retail sales generally were sluggish and frequently below expectations, 
            despite substantial discounting on a wide range of consumer goods. 
            Manufacturing activity in nearly all sectors and regions declined 
            further in recent months as producers adjusted to weak domestic and 
            foreign demand and worked through accumulated inventories. Sustained 
            weakness in the manufacturing sector spilled over to other businesses, 
            with many Districts indicating declines in demand for office space 
            and trucking and shipping services. In contrast, residential real 
            estate markets remained stable and even expanded in some areas, with 
            the relative strength of the sector attributed in part to lower mortgage 
            interest rates. Agricultural producers continued to struggle against 
            low prices, weak exports, higher energy costs, and the weather, although 
            some regions reported improvement in growing conditions since the 
            last survey period. Financial institutions across the country reported 
            reduced demand for a wide variety of loans, tighter credit standards, 
            and stable-to-deteriorating quality of existing loans and leases; 
            residential mortgages were the notable exception to these trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      Continued slow economic growth loosened labor markets 
            and eased wage pressures in most Districts in June and July, but rising 
            benefit costs continued to add to compensation costs. Prices for energy, 
            fuel, and many material inputs fell in most regions. Falling input 
            costs and stiff domestic and foreign competition kept prices of most 
            consumer goods in check.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Consumer Spending
      </b>
      <br/>
      Retail sales generally remained weak in June and July, although there 
            were scattered reports of a pickup in sales. Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, 
            New York, Richmond, and San Francisco reported sales below expectations 
            and well beneath comparable store sales for the same period last year. 
            Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, and St. Louis noted a slight pickup 
            in sales since the last survey period, though sales were flat to down 
            compared to last year. Kansas City and Philadelphia reported flat 
            sales during the last survey period. The weakness in retail sales 
            was broad-based across product lines and types of outlets. Within 
            the sector, sales were strongest at large discount retailers, though 
            many other retailers were offering discounts to promote sales. Auto 
            sales apparently fared better than other areas of consumer spending 
            in some Districts. Districts attributed the better-than-expected sales 
            in part to manufacturer incentives and lower financing charges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Districts reporting on inventories at retail outlets 
            indicated that most businesses were able to keep stocks in balance. 
            Still, there were scattered reports of retailers canceling orders 
            or asking manufacturers to warehouse deliveries until existing inventories 
            are cleared. Contacts noted that orders for back-to-school and Christmas 
            merchandise were running lower than last year in anticipation of slower 
            sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Services and Tourism
      </b>
      <br/>
      Districts reporting on the services sector indicated continued weak 
            demand in June and July. In Dallas, Cleveland, and San Francisco, 
            demand for business services, including advertising, computing and 
            data processing services, and temporary employment agencies, was stagnant 
            or declining in recent months, resulting in employment reductions 
            in some areas. In Cleveland and Dallas, transportation and shipping 
            activity declined further in June and July, as businesses continued 
            to reduce orders in an effort to control inventories. Accounting, 
            insurance, and legal firms also saw demand soften in some Districts, 
            prompting more rigorous monitoring of payroll costs and other expenses. 
            Dallas noted a pickup in demand for legal services related in part 
            to energy market developments and increased bankruptcy filings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Layoffs and slower economic growth reportedly damped tourism 
            in many parts of the country. Many Districts noted that airline bookings, 
            hotel occupancies, and hotel room rates fell in recent months. However, 
            hotels principally struggled with a decline in business travel as 
            companies worked to cut costs in light of slower earnings growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity declined further in recent weeks, as producers 
            responded to ongoing weakness in demand and worked to balance inventories. 
            Reports of reduced work hours, lost overtime, forced furloughs, planned 
            shutdowns, and layoffs were pervasive. Nearly every District reported 
            that new orders and shipments for durable and non-durable manufactured 
            products remained sluggish during the recent survey period, with declines 
            recorded for producers in some sectors. Weakness was especially evident 
            among producers of apparel and textiles, computers, semiconductors, 
            steel, and telecommunications gear. In addition to conditions in the 
            domestic economy, Districts attributed the current malaise in manufacturing 
            to softening international demand for U.S. goods—particularly in 
            Europe and Asia. On the up side, Districts reported that producers 
            were making progress in running down their excess inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </b>
      <br/>
      Conditions in commercial real estate markets softened in several Districts 
            in June and July, in keeping with slow economic growth. Nine Districts 
            reported increased office vacancies in metropolitan areas in the second 
            quarter, with signs of additional weakening in July. A number of Districts 
            noted that the swing in market conditions was due in part to an increase 
            in sublease space. The rise in vacancies reportedly made it a buyer's 
            market in some metropolitan areas. However, most Districts noted little 
            movement in posted lease rates, with landlords opting for one-time 
            inducements such as a free month's rent or property upgrades to attract 
            tenants. In San Francisco, where commercial lease rates have declined, 
            contacts noted that prospective tenants appear to be waiting for rates 
            to fall further. Rising vacancies damped new construction activity 
            in a number of areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Districts indicated that residential real estate markets generally 
            remained stable in recent months, though signs of weakness were apparent 
            in some regions. Atlanta, Cleveland, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond, 
            and St. Louis reported continued brisk demand for low and moderately 
            priced homes; one District reported that homes "priced right" continued 
            to sell quickly, often attracting multiple bidders. In Boston, Chicago, 
            and San Francisco, demand remained stable but weakness in the high-end 
            market was noted. Dallas and Kansas City reported flat to slower growth 
            in home sales, with some concerns about rising inventories. In general, 
            Districts attributed the continued strength of residential real estate 
            in part to lower mortgage interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </b>
      <br/>
      Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed across the Districts. 
            Atlanta, Kansas City and St. Louis highlighted generally good conditions 
            in their regions, with some crop yields coming in better than expected. 
            Dry weather was having an adverse effect on farmers and ranchers in 
            the Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and Richmond Districts. San Francisco 
            reported favorable growing conditions, but ongoing struggles against 
            low prices, weak export demand, and high energy costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Banking and Finance
      </b>
      <br/>
      Loan demand was flat to down in most Districts in recent weeks. However, 
            the composition of the slowdown differed by region. In Kansas City 
            and Philadelphia, commercial and industrial lending picked up, while 
            consumer lending declined. Declines in lending in Atlanta, Chicago, 
            and Richmond were largely in the commercial sector. In St. Louis, 
            all types of loans declined, although the most pronounced reductions 
            were in consumer borrowing. In Cleveland and New York, loan demand 
            remained relatively flat, as both consumers and businesses curtailed 
            borrowing. Several Districts reported increases in home mortgage lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, Districts characterized financial markets as cautious, 
            with both borrowers and lenders pulling back in response to economic 
            uncertainty. There were some reports of deteriorating credit quality, 
            particularly for credits to manufacturing and agricultural businesses. 
            A number of Districts reported that lenders had tightened standards 
            in recent weeks, particularly for business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
      </b>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported that conditions in labor markets remained 
            steady or loosened somewhat in recent weeks. Layoffs in many high-tech 
            manufacturing and service firms boosted the number of highly skilled 
            workers applying for jobs through temporary employment agencies. Employers 
            in a number of Districts noted greater ease in finding and keeping 
            qualified workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looser labor markets in most Districts helped to contain wage 
            pressures in recent months. However, benefit costs rose, particularly 
            for health and other forms of insurance coverage. Rising insurance 
            premiums and the slowing economy reportedly prompted some employers 
            to reevaluate benefit packages. Kansas City reported that firms were 
            working on ways to reduce employee benefits such as free parking and 
            health club memberships.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fuel and energy prices fell in June and July in most 
            Districts, lessening the burden on businesses and easing pressure 
            on consumer budgets. Lower gasoline prices allowed shippers and truckers 
            to reduce or remove fuel surcharges imposed earlier this year. Lower 
            energy costs also contributed to price declines for a number of manufactured 
            goods. However, upward price pressure was reported for pharmaceuticals, 
            various services, and single-family housing in some regions. In addition, 
            retail electricity rates were up sharply in California in June, as 
            previously authorized rate hikes took effect. In general, however, 
            declining input costs and stiff domestic and foreign competition continued 
            to restrain consumer prices.
