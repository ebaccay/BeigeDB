       The Second District's economy has slowed further since the last report, though 

  contacts in a variety of sectors largely view this as a war- and weather-related 

  postponement of activity. Despite some scattered price hikes, most contacts 

  report that prices and costs of finished goods are steady or declining. The 

  labor market has weakened further, though there has been a slight pickup in 

  hiring of temporary help. Most retail contacts report that sales were below 

  plan in March, with war and inclement weather cited as major factors. Inventory 

  levels are generally described as manageable, though most contacts report high 

  stocks of warm-weather merchandise. Consumer confidence has shown signs of modest 

  improvement since the war began. Manufacturing activity has been mixed but generally 

  flat since the last report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing, while still characterized as strong, showed signs of softening in 

  February and March, particularly at the high end of the market, though there 

  are scattered reports of a pickup in early April. Office markets across metropolitan 

  New York City weakened in the first quarter, particularly in some of the suburban 

  areas. Finally, bankers report a pickup in demand for home mortgages, steady-to-lower 

  delinquency rates, and further tightening in credit standards for commercial 

  borrowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most major retail chains report that sales in the District were below plan in 

  March, with a good part of the weakness attributed to the war and unseasonably 

  cold and wet weather. Comparable store sales for March ranged from flat to down 

  11 percent from a year earlier, though the later date for Easter this year was 

  seen shifting some sales from March into April. A few contacts did note some 

  improvement in sales in the first ten days of April. Sales of home furnishings 

  held up relatively well, compared with other categories. In fact, the two chains 

  most concentrated in durables for the home reported that sales were on or above 

  plan. However, sales of apparel continued to be sluggish, in terms of unit volume 

  and especially dollar volume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both selling prices and merchandise costs are described as flat to down moderately, 

  with particularly sharp price declines for apparel and electronics. Inventories 

  are reported to be at manageable levels. Most contacts report heavy stocks of 

  spring merchandise, but these are expected to sell once warm weather arrives. 

  A number of contacts emphasize that the next two weeks will be critical for 

  sales and inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regional surveys of consumer confidence showed some signs of stabilizing in 

  March. Siena College's monthly survey of New York State residents showed a modest 

  recovery in confidence in March, with most of the pickup occurring after the 

  war began. Separately, the Conference Board reports that confidence in the Middle 

  Atlantic states--New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania--held steady at close 

  to a seven-year low in March, though most of the survey was conducted before 

  the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate markets appear to have slowed since the last report. 

  Home construction activity, as measured by housing permits, fell noticeably 

  in the first quarter, hampered by heavy snow accumulations across much of the 

  District. New Jersey homebuilders report that demand for moderately priced homes 

  has remained fairly sturdy, but that the high end of the market has deteriorated 

  further since the last report. Separately, realtors across New York State report 

  that sales of existing single-family homes slowed sharply in January and February--partly 

  reflecting harsh weather--while prices leveled off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manhattan's co-op and condo market has weakened somewhat since the last report, 

  particularly at the high end. Overall, selling prices were said to be down roughly 

  10 percent from a year earlier, with unit volume down 5 percent to 10 percent, 

  though an industry contact notes that early 2002 was an extraordinarily strong 

  period. According to a leading appraisal firm, the inventory of homes on the 

  market is reported to be up about 40 percent from a year ago, with much of this 

  increase concentrated at the high end. More recently, though, a large real estate 

  firm notes that activity has improved somewhat in early April and that there 

  has been a notable pickup in sales in Lower Manhattan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Office markets across most of metropolitan New York City continued to weaken 

  in the first quarter. Westchester's office vacancy rate, which had remained 

  fairly stable throughout 2002, jumped 2 percentage points to 18.4 percent, its 

  highest level in nearly eight years. Vacancy rates also edged up in Midtown 

  Manhattan, Long Island, and central New Jersey but edged down half a point in 

  Fairfield County. Rates were little changed in Lower Manhattan and northern 

  New Jersey. Within northern New Jersey, urban areas are said to be performing 

  noticeably better than suburban markets. In general, asking rents are down 10 

  percent to 20 percent from their 2001 peaks, though industry contacts note that 

  actual rents have slid more sharply.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A major New York City employment agency indicates that the job market has deteriorated 

  further since the last report, though there have been signs of a modest pickup 

  in hiring temporary workers. Hiring activity at law firms, though still stronger 

  than in other industries, has slowed measurably, while the financial services 

  industry is still shedding jobs. This contact attributes at least some of the 

  current hiring slump to war-related uncertainty. Separately, a contact in the 

  financial sector reports that New York City's securities industry appears to 

  have bottomed out in late 2002, at least in terms of profits, but that employment 

  will not likely bottom out until at least this fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manufacturing sector continued to give mixed signals in March and early 

  April, both in terms of business conditions and price pressures. New York City-area 

  purchasing managers report a rebound in manufacturing-sector conditions in March, 

  after some softening in February, but those in other sectors report further 

  weakening. Respondents in both manufacturing and other sectors continue to report 

  steady input prices. Buffalo-area purchasers report steady business conditions 

  in the manufacturing sector in March, with some acceleration in new orders, 

  but a deceleration in production activity; they also indicate continued upward 

  movement in input prices. Finally, our latest monthly survey of New York State 

  manufacturers, conducted in early April, indicates weakening in general business 

  conditions, but expectations of activity over the next six months have strengthened. 

  Respondents note increased upward pressure on input costs but little change 

  in selling prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       New York City bus, subway, and commuter-rail fares will be hiked roughly 25 

  percent, on average, in early May, and there will be more modest increases in 

  some bridge and tunnel tolls. This is expected to boost the metro-area Consumer 

  Price Index no more than half a point. Tokens will no longer be accepted on 

  the subway system, after the fare increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Bankers at small to medium-sized Second District banks report a widespread--and 

  partly seasonal--increase in demand for home mortgages, but steady demand for 

  other types of loans. Specifically, 54 percent of bankers indicated higher demand 

  for residential mortgages, compared with only 11 percent reporting lower demand. 

  Bankers also indicated increased refinancing activity. On the supply side, bankers 

  reported tighter credit standards for most types of loans--in particular, commercial 

  and industrial loans and commercial mortgages. No bankers reported an easing 

  of standards in any category. Widespread declines in both loan and deposit rates 

  were reported across all categories. Lenders reported declining delinquency 

  rates for commercial and industrial loans but stable rates across other categories.
