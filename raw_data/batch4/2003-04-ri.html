      <p>
       Economic growth in the Fifth District continued to be modest in March and early 

  April as inclement weather and uncertainty about the economy and the war in 

  Iraq constrained consumer demand. Services businesses reported generally flat 

  revenues and little change in employment. But retailers said that harsh weather 

  and the war in Iraq decreased customer traffic and lowered sales substantially. 

  District manufacturing activity contracted in March, and manufacturers told 

  us that their hiring and capital investment plans were generally on hold until 

  the economy improves. In real estate, District home sales rose at a robust pace, 

  but commercial leasing and construction was generally flat. In agriculture, 

  excessive rainfall delayed field preparation and crop planting activity in many 

  areas. Price inflation remained modest in most sectors of the District's economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District retailers reported that inclement weather and customers' concerns regarding 

  the war in Iraq contributed to generally lower sales in recent weeks. An Annapolis, 

  Maryland, department store manager said the area was "hammered with snow" in 

  March, leading his store to sharply discount prices to move out seasonal items. 

  A contact at a building supply chain in the District cited poor weather for 

  lower revenues at his store. A central North Carolina bookseller told us sales 

  have dropped since the war in Iraq began but that she has added to her inventory 

  of war-related and social sciences materials in an effort to boost business. 

  On a brighter note, automobile dealers in Martinsburg and Charleston, West Virginia, 

  reported increased sales due in part to manufacturers' incentives. One dealer 

  said, however, that more people have been buying smaller cars since the war 

  began.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District services businesses reported that customer demand was generally flat 

  to slightly higher in March and early April. A contact at a truck rental firm 

  in West Virginia said revenues had fallen, but other contacts at firms in Washington, 

  D.C., and North Carolina reported stable demand. Hospitals and health-care systems 

  throughout the District reported generally unchanged demand for services. Business-to-business 

  services firms also reported little change in demand for services. Fitness centers 

  in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., said people were deferring 

  signing up for summer camp and other programs while the war in Iraq continued. 

  Most contacts said they were not adding new employees but were replacing workers 

  who had left.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity contracted slightly in March. Shipments edged 

  lower and new orders continued to fall, particularly in the food, furniture, 

  and fabricated metal industries. Factory managers indicated that war uncertainty 

  was one factor in limiting customer demand, but they attributed much of the 

  softness in demand to a continued weak economy. A furniture manufacturer in 

  North Carolina told us that sales of both residential and office furniture in 

  March were the slowest since 1982. Several fabricated metal producers said that 

  weak demand and strong price competition were squeezing their profits. In addition, 

  numerous manufacturing contacts indicated that prices of raw materials had increased 

  substantially since our last report. They attributed the increase primarily 

  to higher energy prices and noted that they were unable to pass higher costs 

  on to customers. District manufacturers continued to trim their payrolls, and 

  some tell us that they will not increase hiring or undertake substantial capital 

  investment until the sluggish economy improves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District loan officers said that stronger demand for residential mortgage loans 

  drove overall bank lending higher in recent weeks. A lender in Greenville, South 

  Carolina, said that mortgage applications were "going through the roof" and 

  that his staff was struggling to process the heavy volume. A mortgage lender 

  in Charlottesville, Virginia, also reported robust demand for residential mortgages, 

  which he attributed to improved consumer confidence. Commercial lending remained 

  sluggish; several bankers noted that their clients continued to delay expansion 

  because of the economic uncertainty caused by the war in Iraq. A commercial 

  banker in Richmond said that credit needs had declined and that a number of 

  her clients were paying down debt. Several commercial lenders told us that they 

  had increased marketing efforts to solicit loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate agents reported stronger growth in home sales since 

  our last report. A Richmond realtor said that sales were "great," noting that 

  his office posted record sales in March. A realtor in Fredericksburg, Virginia, 

  said that home sales over the last two months had been exceptionally strong; 

  in her words the brisk activity was "wonderful, but exhausting." Agents in Asheville 

  and Greensboro, North Carolina, also reported solid housing markets. There was 

  some slowing of home sales in West Virginia, however; agents in Parkersburg 

  and Charleston told us markets there had slumped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial realtors reported generally flat leasing and construction activity 

  in recent weeks as international political developments continued to create 

  considerable uncertainty among clients. "Things are pretty much the same, just 

  waiting around for some good news," noted a realtor in Baltimore. Rent levels 

  were down sharply in all commercial sectors. Vacancy rates for office and retail 

  space held steady, but industrial vacancy rates edged higher. The leasing of 

  retail space in Richmond continued to be "very strong for the short and long 

  term," but leasing activity in other commercial sectors remained sluggish. A 

  realtor in Washington, D.C., said companies were "tightening up" and eliminating 

  unnecessary office space.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Tourist activity strengthened somewhat in March and early April. Contacts at 

  mountain resorts in Virginia and West Virginia told us cold weather and substantial 

  snowfall helped make this year's ski season the best in recent memory. Coastal 

  tourism, however, was mixed. A respondent from the Outer Banks of North Carolina 

  said that hotel bookings were higher, in part because of events celebrating 

  the centennial of the Wright Brothers first flight. But contacts in Myrtle Beach, 

  South Carolina, and Virginia Beach, Virginia, told us that wet weather had caused 

  some trip cancellations. Despite cold weather and concerns about the war, attendance 

  at the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, D.C., nearly matched 

  last year's approximately 1 million people.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Temporary Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Temporary employment agencies in the District reported somewhat stronger demand 

  for workers in recent weeks. A contact in Charlotte, North Carolina, said improved 

  economic conditions there had created more demand for workers in automotive 

  industries, and that the mortgage industry was "booming." An agent in Raleigh, 

  North Carolina, said renewed confidence in economic recovery and the decisions 

  of several firms to expand sales forces had resulted in a greater need for her 

  services. However, a Cary, North Carolina, agent reported that the demand for 

  workers was somewhat weaker and noted that her agency was expanding its marketing 

  efforts to solicit business.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Excessive rainfall in recent weeks improved soil moisture, replenished ponds, 

  streams, and reservoirs, and ended the persistent drought in South Carolina. 

  The wet weather, however, delayed spring planting activity in most areas of 

  the District. The planting of cucumbers and cantaloupes in Maryland, corn in 

  South Carolina and West Virginia, and small grains in Virginia was behind schedule. 

  A late March snowfall damaged some peach trees in North Carolina and sent some 

  West Virginia farmers scrambling for hay to feed livestock. Pastures were reported 

  to be in good condition in most areas of the District.
