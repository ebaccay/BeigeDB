      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District continued to grow at a 
moderate rate in December and January. Manufacturers reported 
increases in shipments and orders in January compared with December, 
although there has been a reduction in orders from Asia. Retailers 
generally met expectations for increases in holiday sales of around 
4 percent, in current dollars, from the prior year. Auto sales have 
been steady. Bankers indicated that business and real estate lending 
were growing in January, although consumer lending had eased 
seasonally.
      <p>
       Looking ahead, most of the Third District business contacts surveyed 
for this report expect moderate growth to continue. Manufacturers 
expect the overall pace of business to stay on an upward trend, 
although some firms with Asian customers said orders from that 
region will probably decline further. Retailers expect moderate 
growth in 1998. Bankers said they anticipate continued gains in 
business and real estate lending.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Third District manufacturing firms contacted in early January 
reported improved business, on balance. About one-third said 
shipments and orders were rising, and fewer than one-fourth reported 
declines. Order backlogs, which had been falling since last fall, 
turned up for area firms, on the whole, although the rebound 
appeared to be slight. Employment at area industrial plants 
increased slightly in January compared with December, but work hours 
have been steady. Manufacturers continued to report difficulty 
finding skilled technical workers.
        <p>
         Among the major industrial groups in the region, demand seemed to be 
strongest for lumber, paper products, and nonelectrical machinery. 
Producers of industrial equipment and building materials reported 
declines in orders from Asia, and food processors generally reported 
a seasonal slowdown in their industry. Some area firms that face 
import competition expressed concern that foreign producers will 
increase shipments and reduce prices, but none of the companies 
contacted for this report has seen this occur yet.
         <p>
          Industrial prices have been generally steady, according to local 
firms. Three-fourths of the firms polled in early January said they 
were holding the line on the prices of their products, and around 
nine out of ten said the costs of the goods they purchase have been 
steady as well.
          <p>
           Looking ahead, Third District manufacturers expect moderately 
increased demand for their products, although they do not expect 
order backlogs to grow. On balance, firms in the region plan to add 
workers during the next six months and slightly increase capital 
spending.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Retail
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Retail sales in the region met merchants' expectations for the 
Christmas shopping period overall, although performance varied 
considerably among stores. Most stores specializing in computers and 
other consumer electronic items had good year-over-year increases, 
but some apparel stores and department stores had just marginal 
gains despite heavy discounting. On the whole, according to
reports from store executives, retail sales in the region probably 
increased around 4 percent, in current dollars, from 1996.
            <p>
             Area merchants expect some seasonal slowing in January, but they 
expect sales to move back up quickly and return to a trend of 
moderate growth. Nonetheless, merchants said competition is strong, 
and profit margins remain under pressure.
             <p>
              Third District auto dealers indicated that sales of new cars and 
light trucks have been running at a steady pace in recent weeks, but 
sales of used cars have slipped. With continued incentives from 
manufacturers, most dealers expect sales to remain near the current 
pace, although some dealers anticipate a slowing in sales of sport 
utility vehicles and light trucks.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Finance
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Third District bankers contacted in early January generally said 
that loan volumes were rising at their institutions. Most indicated 
that commercial and industrial lending was moving up moderately, 
with new business coming mainly from middle market companies seeking 
either working capital or short-term financing to facilitate 
acquisitions. Commercial real estate lending was also said to be on 
the rise, with borrowing by well-capitalized developers of office 
and retail properties as well as some residential developments. 
Several bankers noted that residential mortgage lending has moved up 
recently, for both refinancing and home purchases. In contrast, 
consumer lending was described as slow, due mainly to seasonal 
factors. Several bankers noted that deterioration in personal loan 
portfolios, particularly credit card loans, appeared to be leveling 
off.
               <p>
                In their outlook for 1998, Third District bankers see continuing 
growth in commercial lending, but they expect competition among 
lenders to remain strong. They are concerned that loan margins will 
remain under pressure in the wake of the recent general decline in 
interest rates. Bankers expect real estate lending to continue 
moving up also, as construction activity expands and home sales
increase in some parts of the District.
