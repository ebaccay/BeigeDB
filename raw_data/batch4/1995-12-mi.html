     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Moderate growth with few problem. continues as the watchword for the 
Ninth District economy. Construction, which caught a second wind in 
late summer, is busy right into the winter. Most natural resource 
industries have strong output and some firms plan new investment in 
plants or equipment. With the exception of cattle producers. most 
farmers had a reasonably good year in 1995 and are investing 
carefully in machinery. The holiday shopping season began with 
strong Thanksgiving weekend sales, but in general consumer spending 
on automobiles and general merchandise is cautious. The winter 
tourism season is off to a good start. On balance, manufacturing 
orders are slowing somewhat, particularly in firms related to 
vehicle production, but other firms continue to report strong sales. 
Tightness continues in most labor markets, but few increases in 
wages or prices are apparent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction hit its second wind in the fall and 
continued to dash for the finish line as winter approached. 
Minnesota's September building permit numbers outpaced one- and two-
year earlier numbers in all residential categories. Most builders 
reportedly have enough starts to keep them busy through the winter. 
Residential building is similarly strong in cities in North Dakota, 
South Dakota, western Montana and northwestern Wisconsin. "Fargo is 
taking on a boom town atmosphere," according to a Ninth District 
director describing both construction and manufacturing in that 
city. "Building in western Wisconsin is very strong, up about 28 
percent from last year," echoed a colleague.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial building, particularly offices and warehouses in 
Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs and in other regional cities, continues 
active into early winter. Publicly-let heavy construction ends the 
year as it began, slightly ahead of robust year-earlier figures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most natural resource industries are in fine fettle as the winter 
begins. North Dakota's oil boomlet has rig counts nearly double 
those of a year ago and continued seismic exploration and leasing 
hold some promise that development may continue. "Total shipments 
will meet or exceed our projections. It is the best year in a long 
time," is how an iron ore industry spokesman characterizes business 
in 1995. A large Minnesota producer of oriented-strand board, a 
plywood substitute, has applied for permits to double its capacity. 
Paper mills continue to run at capacity, and many are reportedly 
investing in new ancillary equipment to remove bottlenecks, although 
no major plant expansions or paper machine purchases are reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As 1995 ends, most farmers, except for beef producers, are in better 
financial shape than they anticipated in the spring. While wet 
weather dragged out harvesting in several areas, most farmers have 
completed fall work and yields were generally pleasing, although 
somewhat below 1994 levels. Prices for 1996 can be locked in at 
favorable levels for producers. Farmers are responding by cautiously 
investing in machinery. While implement dealers do not report a 
boom, many say sales are stronger than earlier in the year and, in 
some cases, better than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hog producers continue to face prices that are above late 1994 
levels and generally adequate to cover costs. Beef producers, on the 
other hand, continue in their slow financial hemorrhage. For many 
producers, the value of calf sales in 1995 was about half that of 
1993, the last year of good prices. Dairy farmers are being squeezed 
by higher feed costs resulting from increased grain prices, but 
their financial situations are generally reported as stable. Many 
farmers express concern with continuing uncertainty about the 
outcome of the 1995 farm bill, particularly its dairy and 
Conservation Reserve Program provisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "I don't think the economy is as good as some people think," says 
the CEO of a Minnesota industrial equipment manufacturer, who notes 
that sales of some of his firm's lines are below plan and 1994 
levels. A colleague, who heads a manufacturer of components for 
trucks and construction equipment agrees, pointing to shrinking 
sales to truck manufacturers. But other firms, notably farm 
implement and construction equipment manufacturers in North Dakota 
and medical device and electronic equipment builders in Minnesota, 
report continuing strong sales. On balance, manufacturing output 
apparently is slowing mildly. While industrial electrical usage 
growth in Minnesota and South Dakota continues somewhat above trend, 
the margin is narrower than earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Initial reports on Thanksgiving weekend shopping are positive with 
area malls reporting strong traffic. Nevertheless, district 
consumers are repeatedly described as cautious. Many retailers say 
they are having to increase advertising and promotions to maintain 
sales that are below plan. Apparel seems to be one category on which 
consumer spending has dropped. But electronic equipment, including 
home computers, reportedly continues to sell well.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is not that people don't have money, it is just that they are 
being very careful about how they spend it," is how a dealers' 
representative describes auto sales in South Dakota. His description 
is applicable to most areas of the district. Vehicle sales generally 
continue slightly below 1994 levels, with great variation between 
different regions. North Dakota, with good crops, strong 
construction, and oil activity, generally has good sales, 
particularly of pickup trucks. South Dakota, with a poorer crop and 
low cattle prices, reportedly has good sales in its larger cities, 
but slow ones in farm and ranch areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      While the summer season was disappointing at major national parks 
and attractions in the western part of the district, fall and early 
winter tourism and recreation activities appear strong. The pheasant 
hunting season in South Dakota and the deer season in Wisconsin and 
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were excellent and hospitality 
businesses reportedly had robust sales. Snow cover in northern 
regions came earlier than in 1994, and winter recreation, 
principally snowmobiling and cross-country skiing is off to a strong 
start. Some tourist officials in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, 
Wisconsin and northern Minnesota expect a record year for such 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Entry level workers are hard to come by," complains one Minneapolis 
CEO, and he is echoed by colleagues across the district. Labor 
markets are tight as a drum in many areas with unemployment rates 
two percentage points below the national average for most of the 
district. Wage increases apparently remain modest, with employers 
sweetening the benefit pot or extending such benefits to previously 
uncovered workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper continues to head the list of products with price increases. 
Agricultural commodities follow and non-ferrous metal prices 
continue high. But there the list runs out, and reports of price 
decreases continue for some types of steel and other intermediate 
goods.
