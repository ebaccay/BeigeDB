      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Second District economic conditions have weakened somewhat over the 
past two months, despite a modest pickup in job growth. Reports from 
retailers were very mixed in March and April, with year-over-year 
changes ranging from outright declines to double-digit gains; but on 
balance, sales were weaker than in February and a bit below plan. 
Job growth has accelerated somewhat, but a corresponding increase in 
labor force participation has kept unemployment rates from 
declining. Finally, banks' delinquency rates, which had been rising, 
leveled off in the past two months, while demand for commercial and 
industrial loans picked up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      March and April retail sales in the region varied substantially 
among the retailers surveyed but were generally weaker than in 
February. An early Easter distorted monthly sales figures, boosting 
March at the expense of April; for the two months together, year-
over-year changes in same-store sales ranged from a decline of 1 
percent to a double-digit increase-overall gains averaged slightly 
more than 3 percent, down from 6 percent in February. A number of 
contacts reported that sales were below plan, but all reported that 
inventories were close to desired levels by late April.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unseasonably cold weather reportedly had a moderately negative 
impact on sales, particularly in March. One contact attributed 
February's strength-and March-April weakness-to earlier-than-usual 
tax refunds. Apparel, especially women's, generally outperformed 
other merchandise categories considerably stronger for upscale 
apparel than for more moderate lines. Most retailers are holding 
prices steady, though reports suggest somewhat less discounting than 
a year ago. Cost for merchandise and labor are generally flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate markets in the New York metro area were 
stable in March. A dip in leasing activity pushed Midtown 
Manhattan's office vacancy rate back up to 14.2 percent (matching 
December's level), from 13.9 percent in February. But downtown's 
rate edged down for the fifth consecutive month, to 24.6 percent in 
March, versus 24.7 percent in February and 25.7 percent last 
October. In the first quarter, northern New Jersey's office vacancy 
rate fell from 19.2 to 18.7 percent (a six-year low); rates edged up 
in Westchester and Fairfield counties, but are lower than a year 
ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on the residential real estate market were mixed in April. 
Contacts in downstate New York continue to experience a better 
spring selling season than last year-both traffic and sales are up. 
However, builders report no recovery in the Albany area (which has 
been depressed by state government downsizing), and only a moderate 
pickup in the western tier of the state in recent weeks. New home 
sales across upstate New York remain weaker than a year ago; while 
the inventory of new homes is very low, a large supply of existing 
homes for sale is depressing the overall market.
     </p>
     <p>
      New Jersey builders say that sales and traffic have slowed a bit in 
recent weeks, following a first-quarter pickup, and that sales are 
lower than a year ago-one contact described the market as 
"listless", noting that while consumer pessimism has diminished, so 
has the sense of urgency to buy. Apparently, the recent rise in 
mortgage rates has, thus far, not been much of a factor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional surveys of purchasing managers were mixed in April. 
Business conditions in metropolitan New York City's manufacturing 
sector improved in April but were still on the weak side (outside 
the manufacturing sector, local conditions continued to be mildly 
positive). Conversely, purchasing managers in the Buffalo area 
reported that business conditions in the manufacturing sector, which 
had been quite favorable throughout the first quarter, deteriorated 
sharply in April. Apparently, this incipient weakness was not 
directly related to the GM strike, which is estimated to have idled 
6,000 Buffalo-area workers at its peak in mid-March. Purchasing 
managers in New York City report continued declines in prices paid, 
but those in Buffalo cite modest increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's labor market strengthened somewhat in the first 
quarter. Payroll employment growth was above trend in New York and 
New Jersey, both for the month of March and year-to-date. New 
Jersey's unemployment rate has remained fixed at 6.4 percent since 
January, while New York State's rose from 6.0 to 6.5 percent in 
March, after edging down by 0.2 points in February. (New York's rise 
was due to a sharp increase in labor force participation, which was 
accompanied by a more moderate rise in employment). New York City's 
ongoing fiscal difficulties have prompted the mayor to accelerate 
job cuts for the upcoming fiscal year, while a number of large 
corporations-General Public Utilities, Perkin-Elmer, Kraft, and 
Prodigy -announced job cuts totaling about 1,000 in the region. On a 
brighter note, tourism continues to boom, with first-quarter hotel 
occupancy rates in New York City climbing to a 16-year high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      At small and medium-sized banks surveyed in the district, overall 
demand for new loans in April was higher at about 40 percent of the 
surveyed banks and steady at another 40 percent compared to two 
months earlier. According to senior loan officers at the surveyed 
banks, the largest increase was seen in the commercial and 
industrial loan segment, with demand higher at nearly 35 percent of 
the banks and steady at about 45 percent. Growth in demand for 
residential mortgage loans weakened slightly; demand is lower at 
about 30 percent of the banks and steady at another 30 percent. 
Refinancing activity for all types of loans dropped sharply, 
reversing the upward trend that began last November.
     </p>
     <p>
      Average loan rates, which had been trending down, leveled off in 
April--only 35 percent of respondents reported declining loan rates, 
down from 76 percent in February; residential mortgage rates have 
increased, on balance. With average loan rates leveling off, more 
banks than previously reported a widening of spreads between average 
loan and deposit rates. Delinquency rates have decreased or remained 
the same at more than 80 percent of the banks. Banks were more or 
just as willing to lend in April as in February, and credit 
standards have generally remained the same.
