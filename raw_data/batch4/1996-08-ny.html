      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most sectors of the Second District's economy improved in recent 
weeks. Both the commercial and residential real estate markets 
continue to strengthen-vacancy rates are down, construction of 
multi-family units has surged, and sales of both new and existing 
single-family homes are up. Regional purchasing managers report 
continued growth in the manufacturing sector in July. The boom in 
tourism continues, with New York City hotels approaching full 
occupancy. On a weaker note, retail sales, which had been fairly 
brisk in May, slowed in June and July, and were generally below 
plan; also, banks reported a slight rebound in delinquency rates in 
July. Wage and price pressures generally remain subdued, except in 
Manhattan's tight real estate market, where rents on apartments and 
hotel-room rates have risen sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the district were, on balance, below plan in June 
and July, as business slowed from May's brisk pace. On a year-over-
year basis, same-store sales ranged from a 1 percent decline to an 8 
percent gain in June, with gains of 0 to 6 percent in July. Most 
department stores continue to cite women's apparel, and upscale 
apparel more generally, as the top performing categories, and home 
goods as the weakest. Discount chains report that only 
"consumables"-small-ticket, frequently purchased items-have sold 
well in recent weeks. Some of the recent weakness was attributed to 
cooler than usual weather in June and July (especially compared with 
last year), but a number of contacts believe that underlying demand 
has softened a bit. It was noted that June and July are not 
considered critical months for retailing.
     </p>
     <p>
      All of the retailers surveyed reported that inventories were on or 
close to target as of late July. With retailers now starting to 
build inventories for the fall season, most say they are "cautious" 
in their expectations for the second half of the year. Virtually all 
contacts report that their effective selling prices are steady, that 
merchandise costs are flat to declining, and that there are no wage 
pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction &amp; Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's commercial real estate markets are firmer than they 
have been in a number of years. In New York City, office vacancy 
rates, which had blipped up in May, retreated in June-midtown 
Manhattan's rate fell to 14.5 percent, from 14.8 percent in May, 
while downtown's rate edged down to 24.7 percent from 24.9 percent. 
The reduced vacancy rates were due to a lack of new properties 
coming on the market and to existing office space being converted to 
residential use; leasing activity remained steady. In northern and 
central New Jersey, brisk leasing activity has pushed vacancy rates 
down 0.8 points to 17.9 percent in the second quarter--two points 
lower than a year ago, and the lowest level since 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's residential real estate markets were generally strong 
in June, led by the multifamily sector. Manhattan's housing shortage 
and double-digit rent increases continue to make headlines, while 
prices for co-ops and condominiums have reportedly risen more 
modestly. In New York State, building permits for multi-family 
structures surged in both the first and second quarters, and are 
running at more than double last year's level. Virtually all the 
gains were concentrated in New York City and its northern and 
eastern suburbs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors in the district also report fairly brisk demand for 
existing single-family homes. In New York State, second-quarter 
sales surged 16 percent from a year earlier, though gains were more 
moderate in June. While second-quarter data are not yet available 
for New Jersey, most realtors report that the market is strong, 
fueled by first-time buyers. Home prices are rising at about a 4 
percent annual rate in both states. The market for new single-family 
homes is mixed. New York State homebuilders report steady 
improvement-down-state New York remains strong, while upstate 
markets are beginning to snap out of their chronic slump. In New 
Jersey, however, builders report that the housing market remains "in 
the doldrums"--traffic is mediocre, there is no sense of urgency to 
buy, and affordability remains a problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional surveys of purchasing managers suggest continued growth in 
the manufacturing sector and a slight uptick in prices paid in July. 
Purchasing managers in Buffalo reported that production activity 
held steady in July, following brisk growth in the second quarter, 
while new orders continue to expand at a moderate pace. Meanwhile, 
growth in metropolitan New York City's manufacturing sector 
accelerated from its already rapid second-quarter pace, with that 
survey's diffusion index climbing to a new cyclical high in July. (A 
parallel survey of purchasing managers in New York City's non-
manufacturing sectors signals steady, moderate growth). Finally, 
purchasing managers in both Buffalo and New York report a moderate 
rise in prices paid, with both diffusion indices climbing into the 
mid 50's.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets were relatively stable in June. New Jersey's 
unemployment rate held steady at 6.1 percent, after falling a half 
point in May; New York State's edged down to 6.3 percent in June, 
from 6.4 percent in April and May. Employment grew in both states in 
June, but at a slower pace than in prior months. Consumer 
confidence, though still at an exceptionally low level, improved 
noticeably in July. Finally, the boom in tourism shows no signs of 
abating: hotel occupancy rates in New York City climbed to a 17-year 
high in the second quarter, and room rates continued to rise at a 10 
to 15 percent rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a survey of senior loan officers at small and medium 
sized banks in the District, loan demand has softened over the past 
two months. The largest decline in activity occurred in the 
residential mortgage loan segment, with demand lower at nearly 45 
percent of the banks surveyed and steady at over 35 percent. 
Refinancing activity for all types of loans continues to decline, 
though at a diminishing pace. However, demand for commercial and 
industrial loans continued to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks reported modest increases in loan delinquencies in all lending 
categories. Loan officers are generally more willing to lend than 
two months ago, and nearly all have maintained the same credit 
standards. Average loan rates continued to rise-they are higher or 
unchanged at almost all of the participating banks. The spread 
between the average lending and deposit rates is steady at nearly 60 
percent of the banks and narrower at close to 30 percent.
