       The Second District's economy has shown 
                further signs of strengthening in recent weeks. The labor market, 
                in particular, has shown signs of firming, while price pressures 
                have diminished. Retailers report that sales were mixed but generally 
                ahead of plan in September; selling prices are said to be modestly 
                lower than a year ago, on average, and retail inventories at desired 
                levels. Recent business surveys point to some acceleration in 
                manufacturing activity since the last report, as well as a noticeable 
                pickup in employment and steady to declining input prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both residential construction and the market 
                for existing homes have strengthened. Office vacancy rates in 
                and around New York City were generally stable in the third quarter, 
                though Manhattan's market is said to have taken on a firmer tone. 
                Conditions in New York City's financial industry have reportedly 
                improved further since the last report, with brisk growth in revenue, 
                profits and compensation, as well as an upturn in industry employment. 
                On a less positive note, consumer confidence declined in September, 
                to its lowest level since the spring. Also, bankers report weakening 
                demand for consumer loans and especially residential mortgages, 
                a modest upturn in delinquency rates in these same segments, and 
                little change in lending standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report that sales were generally on or above plan in 
                September, with year-over-year same-store sales gains ranging 
                from 2 to 6 percent. A number of contacts indicate that the general 
                firming in sales in recent months largely reflects a pickup in 
                apparel sales, which had been weak in the first half of the year. 
                Demand has remained strong for household furnishings and equipment, 
                as well as jewelry. All of the retailers contacted indicate that 
                inventories are in good shape, and that selling prices are steady 
                to down moderately compared with a year ago. In looking ahead 
                to the upcoming holiday season, retailers are generally planning 
                for sales to be flat to up modestly over comparable 2002 levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer confidence weakened in September, according 
                to two separate surveys. The Conference Board's survey of residents 
                of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA) shows confidence falling 
                to a 6-month low, while Siena College's measure, based on New 
                York State residents, fell to a 5-month low.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate markets showed persistent strength in 
                the third quarter, while commercial markets showed some signs 
                of firming. New York State realtors report that unit sales were 
                lower than a year earlier but that selling prices continued to 
                post double-digit gains from a year ago. Particular strength was 
                reported in the New York City and Albany areas. A large Manhattan 
                real-estate firm and a leading appraisal firm both report brisk 
                co-op and condo sales activity, across all segments of the market, 
                in the third quarter--particularly in September. They also note 
                that the inventory of apartments on the market has fallen steadily 
                since April and observe some upward pressure on selling prices, 
                particularly for smaller units.
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing permits in the district rose in August, 
                led by a sharp rebound in the multi-family segment in New York 
                City. More recently, homebuilders in northern New Jersey report 
                continued strong demand in September but one contact expresses 
                concern that recent increases in property taxes and mortgage rates 
                have crimped affordability. An industry contact notes a steep 
                rise in the cost of plywood and OSB (oriented supply board), but 
                indicates that labor and other material costs remain in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Office vacancy rates in and around New York City 
                were generally stable in the third quarter. In Manhattan, contacts 
                report some firming: although vacancy rates were little changed, 
                the amount of sublease space on the market reportedly declined 
                and a number of large leases are said to be pending. Suburban 
                markets were mixed but, on balance, stable--vacancy rates increased 
                modestly in Westchester County and Long Island, but edged down 
                in Fairfield County, Connecticut.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A major New York City employment agency reports a significant 
                pickup in hiring activity in September, following a summer lull, 
                and describes this strength as more than just seasonal. Much of 
                the hiring is said to be coming from small to medium-sized firms. 
                Separately, a contact in New York City's securities industry reports 
                further improvement in industry conditions, with brisk gains in 
                revenues, profits and compensation, and a recent modest upturn 
                in employment. Manhattan hotels report robust business in August 
                and September, with both occupancy rates and total revenue running 
                ahead of last year's levels. While the business travel segment 
                is still described as sluggish, some pickup is reported in foreign 
                leisure visitors, and more strength in this segment is expected 
                due to the weakening dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manufacturing sector has shown increased 
                strength in recent weeks, which is apparently beginning to boost 
                employment. Our latest survey of New York State manufacturers, 
                conducted in early October, points to continued improvement and 
                strong optimism about the six-month outlook. Similarly, purchasing 
                managers in both the Buffalo and New York City areas report widespread 
                increases in manufacturing activity in September, and those in 
                Buffalo indicate a significant upturn in employment--the most 
                pronounced in five years. Finally, shipping volume through the 
                Port of New York and New Jersey expanded at a double-digit rate 
                in the third quarter, and the volume of activity is said to be 
                well above expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Small to medium-sized banks in the Second District report stable 
                demand for commercial credit but decreased demand for consumer 
                loans and especially residential mortgages, for which nearly three-quarters 
                of bankers indicate lower demand. Also, lower overall refinancing 
                activity is indicated by nearly two-thirds of bankers. On the 
                supply side, credit standards are reported to be steady across 
                all loan categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest rates rose for all loan categories 
                except consumer loans. Most notably, more than half of the bankers 
                surveyed report higher rates for residential mortgages. Average 
                deposit rates were little changed, on balance. Finally, bankers 
                report some increase in delinquency rates on consumer loans and 
                residential mortgages, but little change among commercial borrowers.
