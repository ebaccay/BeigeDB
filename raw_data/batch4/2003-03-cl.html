      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

      <p>
       Economic conditions in the Fourth District remained mixed in January and through 

  the first three weeks of February. On balance, conditions in this report were 

  very similar to the last: Conditions in residential construction were positive. 

  Although trucking and shipping contacts reported a slight seasonal decline, 

  conditions remained generally stable. Manufacturing, banking, and retail reports 

  were mixed. Commercial construction conditions remained poor. Winter weather 

  did have an adverse impact on several businesses in the region. Businesses in 

  retail and construction saw less customer traffic than usual, and many firms 

  across several industries temporarily closed operations because of severe winter 

  weather during the survey period.
      </p>
      <p>
       While hints of future improvement can be found in this report (for example, 

  new orders in manufacturing increased slightly), little suggested conditions 

  would change in the near future. In the current environment, contacts remained 

  reluctant to forecast future economic conditions--most are basing future decisions 

  on the expectation that conditions will remain flat over the next few months. 

  A few firms reported reducing their capital expenditure plans since the first 

  of the year, but most appear to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude before 

  changing their budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labor market conditions have deteriorated since the last report--several manufacturers 

  reported having reduced their labor forces or planning to do so. The few firms 

  that were looking for employees reported no trouble in hiring--one contact reported 

  8,600 applications for 200 jobs at a new facility that would be opening in the 

  near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In manufacturing, most nondurable goods producers reported flat or slightly 

  increasing conditions compared with the end of 2002 and reported year-over-year 

  increases in production and sales for January 2003. Durable goods manufacturers 

  were not so uniform--some reported year-over-year declines in production and 

  sales while others reported flat or improving conditions compared with a year 

  ago. While reports on production and sales varied, reports on other business 

  indicators were more similar. Most contacts reported idle capacity (some as 

  much as 40 percent or 50 percent), curtailed capital expenditures, and labor 

  force reductions. Those that increased production did so using overtime rather 

  than by expanding their labor force. Reports regarding input prices were mixed, 

  with roughly half our contacts noting significant increases, while the other 

  half reported flat or declining prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking forward, most contacts reported flat or slightly increasing new orders, 

  suggesting a slight pickup in production in the coming months, but most firms 

  were making no plans to increase their labor force or capital expenditures in 

  the near future. Most contacts reported that they would be able to respond to 

  a sudden pickup in demand by bringing their idle capacity on line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Severe weather curtailed District auto production during the third week of 

  February, closing several plants in the area for at least one day. Despite these 

  closings, roughly half the District auto plants reported year-to-date production 

  above 2002 levels, and others reported year-to-date figures very near 2002 levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for steel continued to soften in January and during the first three 

  weeks of February. Production and sales were slightly down from December 2002 

  levels but significantly below January 2002 levels. Steel prices remained under 

  downward pressure even as the cost of production increased significantly throughout 

  the winter. Many contacts expect significant reductions in the steel industry's 

  labor force as companies renegotiate labor contracts. Labor reports were mixed 

  among companies that did not have negotiated labor contracts: Some reported 

  that they were planning to hire back some of the many workers they laid off 

  in 2002, while others reported that they would lay off more workers if conditions 

  in the industry did not improve in the next month.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District retail reports remained mixed in January, ranging from slight declines 

  (-1.2 percent) to strong gains (4.0 percent) in year-over-year comparable store 

  sales. Although sales for Valentine's Day were characterized as robust, retailers 

  reported that sales for the month of February were trending downward. Apparel 

  retailers noted that seasonal promotions and clearance events had allowed them 

  to move merchandise and reduce inventories. Most retailers are very carefully 

  managing their inventories, as they expect sales to be flat in the coming months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automobile dealers in the District characterized sales in January as "lethargic" 

  (one contact noted that year-over-year sales were down 10 percent), but February 

  reports were mixed. Most contacts noted a rebound in sales, but a few continued 

  to report declines. Although dealers reported significant cuts in their advertising 

  budgets (some as high as 20 percent), they were optimistic about sales in the 

  coming months as manufacturers continue to offer incentives. As was the case 

  in the last report, inventories remain high (seventy-five- to one hundred-day 

  supplies--a sixty-day supply is preferable), but contacts were not as concerned 

  about climbing inventories as they were in the last report.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District homebuilders reported that sales were steady, at levels slightly higher 

  than at the start of 2002. Despite some slowing in consumer traffic (partially 

  attributed to poor weather), demand remained reasonably strong in a favorable 

  interest rate environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial builders, on the other hand, continued to report weak conditions. 

  Worsening state and local budget crises have had an impact on the availability 

  of public construction projects (a major source of business for some firms in 

  2002). Competition for available projects in all areas of commercial construction 

  has increased. Some contacts noted, however, that architects have been seeing 

  an increase in business, suggesting a pickup will occur in commercial construction 

  in about a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trucking and Shipping
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Trucking and shipping activity slowed again in January, although most of this 

  slowing was seasonal. Compared with one year ago, shipping volume in January 

  was nearly flat--most contacts saw a year-over-year increase of about 0.5 percent. 

  Contacts are expecting February shipping volume to remain flat, but note that 

  the industry will see a seasonal pickup in March with an increase in volumes 

  from auto manufacturers and their affiliated companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first time in many reports, the industry experienced downward price 

  pressure as companies respond to slowing demand (in the last report, contacts 

  reported price increases). Profit margins have been shrinking as input prices, 

  especially labor and energy, continue to rise. Companies are attempting to contain 

  capital spending to replace worn-out equipment--several contacts noted recycling 

  trucks or buying them off the secondary market.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In the banking sector, both commercial and consumer loan demand remained weak. 

  Compared with one year ago, most contacts reported demand was flat or slightly 

  down, but, for the first time in many months, some contacts reported that demand 

  growth for mortgages was "robust" (attributed to both new and refinancing activity). 

  For most banks, however, home equity loans continue to be the only source of 


  growth in lending. The number of loan applications remained flat, and the credit 

  quality of consumer loan applicants remained very poor. Competition for creditworthy 

  borrowers remains intense. Contacts offered conflicting reports regarding loan 

  delinquency behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports regarding core deposit growth were also mixed, with a few contacts 

  reporting declines, but most reporting no change or growth. Those that reported 

  growth attributed it to heavy promotions, including free checking. Most contacts 

  reported a continued squeeze on spreads as loan rates adjust downward and funding 

  rates remain relatively constant.
