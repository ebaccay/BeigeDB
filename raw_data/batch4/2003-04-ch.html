      <p>
       After a modest but abrupt slowdown in late February, economic 
                activity in the Seventh District showed few signs of improvement 
                in March and early April. Many contacts suggested that the February 
                slowdown resulted from heightened uncertainty preceding the war 
                with Iraq. The war itself appeared to have only a limited impact 
                on economic activity and had yet done little to change the overall 
                level of uncertainty in the economy. Auto dealers, some other 
                retailers, and realtors noted that customer traffic slowed in 
                the first few days of the war but quickly rebounded. Manufacturers 
                and bankers said that the war was perhaps the latest reason that 
                many businesses continued to put off capital spending, hiring, 
                and/or borrowing. Progress in the war helped bring down oil prices, 
                though many businesses were still struggling with higher input 
                costs and very little pricing power. Although drought worries 
                have waned, agricultural concerns lingered as farmers' cash flows 
                were hampered by delayed government payments, and dairy operations 
                struggled with low milk prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall consumer spending was weak in March and early April. Retailers 
                indicated that sales results in March generally met their conservative 
                expectations, although they continued to use heavy discounting 
                to move merchandise. Inventories were said to be in line with 
                sales, as merchants remained vigilant in controlling stocks. District 
                auto dealers reported that light vehicle sales improved in March 
                from low February levels and were a little better than expected 
                given the war. However, showroom traffic slowed in early April 
                despite a new round of manufacturers' incentives. Light vehicle 
                inventories were generally high, and most dealers reported that 
                they were ordering fewer units from manufacturers. Tourism-related 
                activities were flat to down in most areas, although one contact 
                indicated that hotel occupancy rates in Chicago were up from a 
                year earlier. One major theater chain noted that ticket sales 
                were off about 10 percent from year-ago levels, which this contact 
                said was "partly a product-driven decline."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Businesses across the region remained very cautious about their 
                spending and hiring plans. Most contacts indicated that there 
                has been no change in economic conditions that would warrant an 
                increase in capital expenditures, and many continued to delay 
                planned upgrades and expansions. However, some businesses were 
                "sitting on cash," which one contact said could boost capital 
                spending quickly once aggregate demand picks up. The hiring environment 
                remained very weak in most areas as well. Though the majority 
                of business contacts suggested that payrolls were relatively unchanged 
                in recent weeks, reports of layoffs continued to outnumber reports 
                of new permanent hires. Demand for temporary help also remained 
                very weak, although one large staffing services firm said that 
                year-over-year growth rates had stabilized in March after several 
                months of steady declines. With margins being squeezed by increasing 
                cost pressures and a lack of pricing power, businesses from across 
                the region continued to focus on cutting costs as a means to improve 
                profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall conditions in real estate and construction softened slightly 
                since our last report. Realtors said that existing home sales 
                were still strong but may have leveled off in recent months, while 
                builders suggested that sales and construction of new homes slowed 
                somewhat in March. However, some of the slowdown was weather related 
                as very cold temperatures in much of the District made it difficult 
                for builders to break ground. One builders group also suggested 
                that potential homebuyers were rushing to lock in historically 
                low mortgage interest rates before they begin to rise, a trend 
                that favored existing and nearly complete spec homes. Nonresidential 
                real estate activity was stagnant in most of the District. Demand 
                for office space remained very weak, and most contacts suggested 
                that vacancy rates continued to rise, albeit slightly. Commercial 
                realtors in a few areas noted some increase in leasing activity, 
                but it was driven by lease renewals and "tenants shuffling around," 
                rather than new demand. However, one contact in the Chicago area 
                reported a sharp increase in the number of office property tours 
                compared with a year ago, though this had not yet led to any net 
                absorption. As a result of continuing weak demand, most contacts 
                have again pushed back their forecasts for a recovery in the office 
                markets. There was little change in light industrial or retail 
                activity, but there were a few reports of a pickup in demand for 
                large-scale projects in the health-care, pharmaceutical, and federal 
                government sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity in the District softened slightly in late 
                February and March, partly due to slower auto production. Nationwide 
                light vehicle sales rebounded modestly in March, from February's 
                low levels. However, inventories remained high, and second-quarter 
                light vehicle production plans were down from both first-quarter 
                and year-ago levels. Demand for heavy equipment was still soft 
                in most segments, although a weaker dollar helped boost demand 
                according to one producer. While conditions in the heavy truck 
                industry generally remained weak, a manufacturer of heavy truck 
                engines noted that demand firmed somewhat in the first quarter, 
                leading the company to boost production. A large manufacturer 
                of home appliances said that shipments in the first quarter were 
                down slightly from a year earlier. Many small manufacturers indicated 
                that production and new orders remained weak. However, a few in 
                the packaging materials and tool and die industries reported steady 
                volumes, and one in paper products even planned to expand its 
                workforce.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall lending activity appeared to slow slightly in March and 
                early April. Household loan demand softened somewhat. Many bankers 
                said that refinancing activity remained robust but had slowed 
                from the torrid pace earlier in the year. Some lenders also noted 
                that credit card volumes and auto loan demand had tapered off. 
                Standards and terms on household loans were largely unchanged, 
                but overall credit quality may have slipped somewhat. There were 
                a few new reports of increases in delinquencies and defaults, 
                particularly on home-equity and mortgage loans. Business loan 
                demand remained weak, with some lenders describing the market 
                as "stagnant" and "lacking energy." Most bankers said that overall 
                commercial loan volumes were flat to down slightly. However, one 
                large bank reported that demand picked up in March, with at least 
                some of the increase due to existing customers expanding their 
                businesses. Standards and terms for commercial loans were largely 
                unchanged. Reports on business loan quality were mixed but generally 
                suggested a slight improvement. One contact noted a rise in charge-offs 
                related to fraud, and several indicated that banks continued to 
                add to their loan-loss reserves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Employment Costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts continued to report increases in some input costs, but 
                an intensely competitive pricing environment helped to keep broad-based 
                price pressures in check. Manufacturers again saw increases in 
                energy, steel, aluminum, and petroleum-based input costs. Agricultural 
                contacts also noted rising fuel and nitrogen costs, though many 
                farmers had previously locked in lower prices. Employment costs, 
                outside of health insurance premiums, remained largely subdued 
                in recent weeks. There were no new reports of upward pressure 
                on wages. In fact, one temporary help contact said that many employers 
                were pushing across-the-board pay cuts to contain costs. Few businesses 
                were able to pass along input cost increases. Rather, many suppliers 
                of goods and services indicated that their customers (including 
                large manufacturers and retailers) continued to exert pressure 
                on them to reduce prices, putting a further squeeze on margins. 
                Contacts suggested that retail competition remained intense, and 
                most were using more and steeper discounts to move merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       With spring planting under way in some areas, drought concerns 
                have been mitigated by recent precipitation across much of the 
                District. However, with soil moisture reserves low, timely rains 
                will be more essential for good yields this year. Cattle prices 
                remained high, while hog prices were lower than a year ago. The 
                adverse impact of dropping milk prices on dairy farmers has spread 
                to their suppliers, as accounts payable were increasing at an 
                "alarming" rate. To generate cash, some dairy farmers were selling 
                their cows and renting their land. In areas that had poor yields 
                last year, there were reports of farmers being unable to pay off 
                their operating lines of credit. Cash flows were also hurting 
                from delayed government payments due to changes in federal programs. 
                All of these factors have resulted in more demand for operating 
                loans. Even so, farmland values have increased because of continued 
                demand from investors and recreational users, in addition to urban 
                pressures and land exchanges for tax purposes.
