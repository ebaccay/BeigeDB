      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District economy continues to grow at a pace similar to our last 
report. Retail sales grew at a moderate pace in recent months, and 
most contacts expect this holiday season to be slightly boner than 
last year's. Many contacts continue to report slow but steady growth 
in their industries and firms. The pace of residential construction 
slowed slightly in the past month, but multifamily construction is 
picking up in some areas. Nonresidential construction continues to 
be a bright spot in many parts of the District. Though overall loan 
demand remains strong, most contacts note some recent softening. A 
survey of small firms in the District reveals that more expect 
business conditions to improve over the next six months than expect 
them to worsen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales grew at a moderate pace in September and October in 
most area of the District, with increases averaging 2 to 6 percent. 
Some contacts in Louisville and Memphis, however, noted declines in 
September and October, especially for women's apparel and other 
"soft" goods. For the holiday season, most contacts expect a 3 to 5 
percent increase in nominal sales over last year, although many 
hedged these expectations with worries of potential downsizings in 
their areas. Although most contacts do not expect to offer unusual 
discounts to move merchandise, one Louisville contact will use 
"severe discounting" this holiday season, especially for apparel, if 
merchandise does not move well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Slightly more than half of District auto dealers contacted report 
fall sales levels below those of last year. Shortages of popular 
trucks and minivans at a number of dealers have dampened sales. 
Rebates and other incentives have been used by about half of the 
respondents to spur sales. Although moat dealers are not expecting 
stronger sales through year-end, they anticipate a pick-up in sales 
in early 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District firms indicate that the pace of economic 
activity has remained relatively unchanged from the previous 
reporting period. Although some major firms announced plant closures 
that will affect the District, many contacts continue to report slow 
but steady growth in sales and do not expect any severe downturns.
     </p>
     <p>
      A contact in the heating and cooling industry reports a record year 
for the industry on the cooling side. Warm weather during the summer 
and a recent increase in residential construction have helped air 
conditioning sales; however, some slowing has occurred recently and 
sales of heating equipment have not yet materialized. A defense 
subcontractor reports business is picking up because of recent 
contracts secured by a major St. Louis-based defense contractor. 
Sales in its home health care division, though, are down about 15 
percent this year over last; much of this decline stems from 
uncertainty about the growth rate of Medicaid and Medicare spending. 
The nation's largest thrift is opening a new processing center in 
St. Louis that will employ more than 200 people. A furniture 
manufacturer reports a recent pick-up in orders. A contact at a wire 
company notes that his firm's decline in domestic demand has been 
offset by a comparable increase in foreign demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's apparel industry is contracting because a national 
manufacturer is closing two District plants and scaling back 
production at a third. A total of 1,265 people will lose their jobs. 
Another apparel firm is also closing three District plants, which 
will affect 700 people. In both cases, slack demand and fierce 
foreign competition are the causes. The southern Illinois mining 
industry will shrink again as three more mines close, eliminating 
about 700 jobs. Depleted reserves and declining demand for high-
sulphur coal are being blamed for the shrinkage. A District shoe 
producer has announced it will leave the production aide of the 
business and focus solely on marketing and sales. This plant 
closure, which affects 195 people, is part of the company's cost-
cutting and reorganization plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Monthly residential construction permits declined somewhat in most 
parts of the District. On a year-to-date basis, only four of the 
District's 12 metropolitan areas report permit levels above last 
year's. Multifamily construction in Little Rock and St. Louis is 
beginning to increase. Nonresidential construction continues to be a 
bright spot for most areas of the District. Among metropolitan 
areas, Columbia, Mo., and Little Rock are experiencing the 
District's strongest year-to-date growth in nonresidential 
construction permits. Tunics County, Miss.--where riverboat casinos 
have fueled much growth in the last few years--has recently seen new 
construction fall off sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although loan demand is still reported to be strong in most parts of 
the District, most respondents note demand has softened somewhat in 
the past several months. Loan competition is still reported as 
brisk, and loan pricing is described as very aggressive by a number 
of respondents. Ax the same time, deposit growth has slowed 
somewhat, putting downward pressure on net interest margins. 
Although most respondents reported some uptick in consumer loan 
delinquencies, current levels are not considered worrisome.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Outlook
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a recent survey of 245 small businesses in the Eighth 
District, nearly two-thirds expect little change in business 
conditions in the next six months, with those who expect an 
improvement slightly outnumbering those who expect conditions to 
deteriorate. This is in stark contrast with three months earlier, 
when those expecting conditions to worsen outnumbered those who 
expected an improvement by nearly two to one.
