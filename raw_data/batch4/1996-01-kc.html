      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 17, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district economy continued to grow at a moderate pace 
during the past month. Retail sales held steady at a level slightly 
above last year's sales, and manufacturers continued to operate at 
high levels of capacity. Homebuilding activity weakened slightly. 
Agriculture's income prospects improved, and energy activity stayed 
sluggish. While manufacturers report rising prices for some 
materials and continued shortages of skilled labor, wages and retail 
prices held steady.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most retailers report sales were unchanged last month 
from the month before but remained slightly above last year's level. 
Sales of home furnishings and electronic products were strong, while 
apparel sales remained weak. Retailers generally expect sales to 
remain unchanged or to rise slightly during the first quarter of 
1996. Most retailers indicate their inventories are in line with 
expected sales, although a few have plans to reduce inventories. 
Automobile dealers report sales last month remained relatively 
sluggish, which is normal for the season. Most dealers expect sales 
to increase modestly during the next few months.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        District manufacturers continued to operate at high 
levels of capacity during the past month. None report production 
bottlenecks due to capacity constraints, although a few continue to 
report shortages of skilled labor. Most manufacturers indicate 
manufacturing materials were readily available, and little change in 
the availability of materials is expected in the next few months. 
While most manufacturers were satisfied with inventory levels, some 
were trimming stocks.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Housing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Most builders report housing starts declined slightly last 
month and remained below last year's level. While construction of 
single-family homes remained sluggish, construction of multifamily 
buildings strengthened. Sales of existing homes remained flat or 
declined slightly in most of the district during the past month and 
about equaled last year's sales. Builders report the unsold 
inventory of new homes declined in recent months, in part because 
winter weather slowed construction activity. Home prices continued 
to rise, especially for low-priced homes that were in the shortest 
supply. Building materials were readily available, and builders 
expect little change in the availability or prices of materials in 
the next few months. Most mortgage lenders expect mortgage demand to 
remain strong in the months ahead
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most banks report loan demand was unchanged last month, 
leaving loan-deposit ratios unchanged from the month before. Some 
banks report gains in commercial and industrial loans, agricultural 
loans, and commercial real estate loans. Consumer loans, home 
mortgage loans, home equity loans, and residential construction 
loans held steady. Security investments also held steady.
          <p>
           Total deposits rose slightly last month, but changes varied among 
different types of deposits. MMDAs increased, while small time and 
savings deposits decreased. Demand deposits, NOW accounts, IRA and 
Keough accounts, and large CDs held steady.
           <p>
            Half of the respondent banks reduced their prime rate last month, 
and most of the others expect to reduce their prime rate in the near 
future. While almost half of the banks also reduced their consumer 
lending rates, most of the others do not plan to lower consumer 
lending rates in the near term. Lending standards were unchanged.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Energy
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Prices for crude oil and natural gas have increased 
recently, but not enough to boost activity in the district's energy 
industry. The average number of drilling rigs operating in the 
district during the first three weeks of December was unchanged from 
the month before and remained well below the year-ago level.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Agriculture
              </strong>
              <br/>
              The district's winter wheat crop remains in fair to 
poor condition, due to unusually dry weather. The wheat crop's 
uncertain yield prospects, combined with tight global inventories 
and strong export demand, have pushed crop prices to the highest 
levels in years. The recent surge in crop prices partially offset 
the financial impact of a disappointing 1995 crop in much of the 
district.
              <p>
               Profits in the district cattle industry remain weak. After heavy 
losses during much of 1995. feedlots now report modest profits due 
to low prices for young feeder cattle and a recent increase in 
prices for fed cattle. The lower feeder cattle prices, however, have 
resulted in continued losses for many district ranchers.
               <p>
                Year-end credit reviews at agricultural banks revealed some decline 
in the quality of farm loan portfolios. The decline was due to heavy 
crop losses in some parts of the district and weak profits in the 
cattle industry. Still, agricultural bankers generally expect farm 
incomes to improve in 1996. Most bankers anticipate little 
improvement in cattle industry profits, due to high feed costs and 
large supplies of beef and other meats. But the bankers expect crop 
producers to receive a boost from higher crop prices.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Wages and Prices
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 Labor markets remain tight in much of the 
district, and some manufacturers report shortages of skilled labor. 
Reports of upward pressure on wages are few and widely scattered, 
however. Manufacturers report rising prices for some materials, 
especially plastics and packaging materials. Prices remain stable at 
the retail level, however, and retailers anticipate no significant 
price increases in the next few months.
