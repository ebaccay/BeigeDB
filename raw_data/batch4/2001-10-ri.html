      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 24, 2001
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifth District economic activity contracted 
            slightly in September and early October, as consumers pulled back 
            in the wake of terrorist attacks on September 11. Services and retail 
            businesses felt the strongest impact. District hotels, airlines, and 
            travel agencies reported sharply lower revenues. Retailers said that 
            big-ticket sales tumbled in September, though they rebounded somewhat 
            in October, as consumers began returning to stores and automobile 
            dealerships. Manufacturing shipments and new orders were generally 
            steady in September. Growth in the housing market slowed modestly 
            in the weeks since our last report, while leasing of commercial properties 
            continued to trend downward. Price increases remained generally modest 
            at District businesses. In agriculture, cool, dry weather was favorable 
            for corn and soybean harvesting, and both were ahead of schedule.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported sharply lower sales in September, particularly 
              in the week following the September 11 terrorist attacks, but a 
              number of contacts noted that their sales rebounded somewhat in 
              early October. Both shopper traffic and big-ticket sales declined 
              in September. Automobile dealers said customer traffic dropped by 
              as much as 50 percent immediately after the attacks. However, customers 
              have returned in the last few weeks, and sales are now running a 
              little above early September levels, boosted by price and financing 
              incentives. Big-box retailers told us that their business was back 
              to normal by the end of September, and some indicated that sales 
              of basic durable goods had picked up in recent weeks. District grocery 
              stores noted stronger sales of canned goods and bottled water. In 
              contrast to rebounding retail activity in many areas, several retailers 
              in the Charlotte, N.C., area said they were continuing to see a 
              reduction in customer traffic as banking and airline layoffs continued 
              in the area. Employment in the retail sector fell moderately in 
              September, while prices were little changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service providers reported somewhat lower revenues in the weeks 
              since our last report. Many hotels and travel firms reported sharp 
              declines in business and vacation travel immediately following last 
              month's terrorist attacks. They said that while travel has rebounded 
              in recent days, bookings are still below pre-September 11 levels. 
              At healthcare organizations in the District, contacts told us that 
              activity has remained normal since our last report, but several 
              noted that they were paying more attention to building security 
              and emergency preparedness. A manager at a trucking firm with operations 
              throughout the District told us that demand facing the company was 
              below expectations, leading the firm to decrease employee hours, 
              although they have avoided layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the manufacturing sector was steady in recent weeks. 
              Shipments edged higher in September, while new orders matched summer 
              levels. Contacts in the textiles, electronics, and plastics industries 
              noted scattered signs of stronger demand for their products. A textile 
              manufacturer in Virginia told us that capacity utilization improved 
              due to new products rolled out for discount retailers, while a counterpart 
              in North Carolina said that his company was encouraged by heightened 
              consumer interest in "Made in the U.S.A." products. Several industries, 
              however, reported weaker sales as a result of the September 11 attacks. 
              A furniture manufacturer in North Carolina, for example, indicated 
              that his business was just beginning to pick up when the attacks 
              occurred, but then orders fell dramatically. Prices for manufactured 
              goods were little changed from our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District loan officers said that while residential mortgage lending 
              continued to be bolstered by declining mortgage rates, commercial 
              lending activity slowed in recent weeks. Growth in residential mortgage 
              lending continued to be fueled by refinancing--a Greenville, S.C., 
              lender said that homeowners were jumping to lock in mortgage rates 
              below 7 percent. In contrast, several commercial lenders reported 
              that business borrowers had trimmed expansion plans in September. 
              A lender in Greenville, SC, described local businesses as having 
              "hunkered-down" and noted that he did not expect to see a pickup 
              in commercial loan demand in the next few months. A banker in Charleston, 
              W.V., also reported weak commercial loan demand and expected lending 
              in the retail and hospitality sectors to be particularly sluggish 
              for a while.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential realtors and homebuilders reported generally slower 
              growth in home sales in September and early October. The uncertainty 
              created by events of September 11 reduced buyer enthusiasm in some 
              markets. Realtors in Bel Air, Md., and Beckley, WV, for example, 
              said that "everything stopped" on September 11, while a realtor 
              in Greenville, SC, said that his agency had 19 home sales "fall 
              through" after the attacks. But home sales in many areas continued 
              to hold or even rise, in part because of lower mortgage rates. A 
              homebuilder in Landover, Md., said that her agency had been very 
              busy, while a Realtor in Asheville, NC, told us that sales contracts 
              had been steady, and that lower mortgage rates had "kept them alive." 
              Respondents from several areas stated that sales of expensive homes 
              had virtually halted. They said buyers appeared to have downsized 
              their expectations, and that lower and mid priced homes continued 
              to sell well. Most builders reported little change in subcontractor 
              costs or wage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial Realtors across the District reported 
              that leasing activity was almost "non-existent" during the week 
              after the attacks. Since then, leasing activity has gradually regained 
              momentum, but remains below early September levels. The District's 
              industrial sector remained sluggish and industrial leasing activity 
              continued to soften--a Northern Virginia Realtor noted that many 
              firms utilizing industrial space were "belt-tightening" and trying 
              to "right-size." The office and retail sectors, meanwhile, have 
              shown resilience in recent weeks. A contact in Columbia, SC, reported 
              that despite a "depressed" attitude within the business community, 
              business firms continued to move forward with their office leasing 
              plans. The demand for Class A office space was generally flat across 
              the District. In Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia, however, 
              office space was being acquired for displaced Pentagon employees 
              and for other federal government workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism in the District declined sharply in the wake of the terrorist 
              attacks of September 11, but by early October signs of a rebound 
              had emerged in most areas. Contacts throughout the District reported 
              widespread cancellations of conventions in September, in part because 
              of airport shutdowns and flight cancellations. A contact at a hotel 
              in Myrtle Beach, SC, told us that his business had lost about $40-45 
              million since the attacks, primarily because of the cancellation 
              of 30 large conventions. He noted, however, that two-thirds of the 
              parties that canceled subsequently rebooked and that business was 
              almost "back to normal." Respondents in Washington, DC, said that 
              area's tourism and hospitality businesses lost about $10 million 
              a day in revenues in September and that they expected below par 
              revenues in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts at temporary employment agencies reported that the demand 
              for workers had weakened somewhat in recent weeks. While several 
              employment agents were optimistic that hiring would strengthen over 
              the next few months, others were skeptical. A contact in Rockville, 
              Md., stated that greater economic uncertainty in light of terrorist 
              attacks and fears of recession led him to expect lower demand for 
              his agency's services in the coming months. However, a contact in 
              Raleigh, NC, said he was seeing a "ready to get back to work" attitude 
              at many firms in his area and he expected the demand for workers 
              to strengthen soon. Wages for temporary workers were generally steady 
              throughout the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dry weather and cooler-than-normal temperatures provided ideal conditions 
              for crop harvesting in recent weeks. Corn harvesting was ahead of 
              schedule in Maryland, North Carolina, and West Virginia, and was 
              drawing to a close in South Carolina and Virginia, where better-than-expected 
              yields were reported. The soybean harvest was ahead of schedule 
              in Maryland but behind schedule in West Virginia. District agricultural 
              analysts reported that continued dry conditions were stressing pastures 
              in Virginia, resulting in an earlier-than-normal feeding of hay 
              to livestock in some counties.
