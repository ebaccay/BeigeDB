      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 28, 2004
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Reports from business contacts in the First District are somewhat more mixed 

  in early July than they were six weeks earlier. Some contacted retailers and 

  manufacturers are less upbeat this time around, although most respondent firms 

  continue to make gains. Many contacts mention rising prices for selected commodities, 

  with some indicating it is becoming easier to pass these cost increases--at 

  least partially--along to customers via slightly higher prices. Residential 

  real estate continues to be a positive factor in the New England economy.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail
        </strong>
        <br/>
        First District retailers cite mixed sales results in the second quarter. According 

  to contacts, home improvement and building product sales continue to increase 

  by double digits, while furniture sales are mostly flat compared to this period 

  last year. Consumer spending on small-ticket items, such as art supplies and 

  apparel, is stronger than spending on big-ticket items, such as electronic equipment 

  and flooring. A state auto dealers' association reports weak sales across the 

  board in the second quarter; manufacturers' incentives continue to be popular 

  but are not spurring sales as much as they did earlier.
        <p>
         Inventory levels are up slightly according to most respondents. A number of 

  contacts report cost increases for wood, steel, fabric, and paper goods, which 

  have resulted in slight increases in selling prices. Some respondents indicate 

  that customers are willing to absorb these increases, particularly for paper 

  goods. Employment levels are mostly steady, with some slight increases, although 

  one contact is considering cutbacks. Capital spending is generally in line with 

  plans, some of which call for minimal spending.
         <p>
          Most contacted retailers anticipate that sales will improve slowly in the next 

  six months, while some expect no change or a slowdown. Respondents also express 

  some uncertainty and caution about rising health-care costs, geopolitical instability, 

  and rising interest rates.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing and Related Services
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most First District contacts in manufacturing and related services report that 

  sales and orders in the second quarter of 2004 were slightly to well above year-earlier 

  levels. Makers of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment cite particularly large 

  gains. With some exceptions, companies in technology and office equipment businesses 

  did not see as much growth in Q2 as they had hoped. Manufacturers of a wide 

  range of consumer products report new signs of weakness, especially with respect 

  to their chain-store customers.
           <p>
            Manufacturers report that they have been able to pass along steel price increases 

  but that they have been only partly successful in recouping higher costs for 

  raw materials derived from petroleum and natural gas. Transportation costs are 

  increasing as a result of fuel surcharges and regulation-induced declines in 

  trucking capacity. Paper prices are up, generally slightly. Some companies are 

  lowering their costs by sourcing more inputs from Asia, while currency movements 

  have served to raise the cost of European inputs.
            <p>
             Most manufacturers are holding their U.S. headcounts flat or reducing them 

  slightly. Some firms are adding to their sales and product design and engineering 

  workforces. Pay increases are generally running in the 3 percent to 4 percent 

  range, while increases in health-care costs are much higher. However, biotech 

  employment is expanding, and industry contacts report that labor markets have 

  tightened and salary increases are somewhat above the norm in other industries. 

  There are also scattered reports of delays in filling accounting positions.
             <p>
              Capital spending plans for 2004 tend not to be ambitious. Several companies 

  report that they plan to reduce expenditures this year or next after completing 

  major projects. Others are choosing to continue to "hold the line."
              <p>
               The outlook is more mixed than in recent reports. Although many contacts continue 

  to be optimistic about their business prospects in the coming six to twelve 

  months, others are concerned about signs of slowdown in consumer and technology 

  spending.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Residential Real Estate
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Residential real estate markets in New England remain strong. Most contacts 

  report high activity levels, although some have observed slightly fewer potential 

  buyers in the last two weeks, which they attribute to vacations. In May, Massachusetts 

  again logged record monthly sales for both single-family homes and condominiums, 

  while the median selling price reportedly increased about 15 percent from a 

  year earlier. Home sales in the state have exceeded the year-earlier month in 

  almost every month during the past year.
                <p>
                 Contacts in Vermont and New Hampshire also report double-digit price increases, 

  but contacts in the rest of New England report either stable prices or more 

  modest price increases. Sales remain robust throughout the region and inventory 

  continues to be low. In particular, the lack of affordable housing persists, 

  although higher-priced homes are staying on the market longer in most areas. 

  Contacts do not expect any changes in the next few months.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Insurance
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  New England-based insurance companies report that their revenues grew moderately 

  in the second quarter, despite a slowing pace of price increases. Sales of life 

  insurance exhibit the strongest growth, and disability insurance providers are 

  seeing a boost from a declining number and duration of disability claims. Sales 

  of annuities are improving, while reports from property and casualty contacts 

  are mixed. Demand from outside the United States, especially Asia, is said to 

  be strong.
                  <p>
                   Employment is flat or slightly down for most companies, but spending on capital 

  is somewhat healthier, as some companies seek to keep costs in check while attempting 

  to boost profitability. Respondents do not expect the second half of 2004 to 

  be significantly different from the first. Contacts are encouraged by recent 

  economic news, including the rise in interest rates. Price pressures and the 

  looming threat of terrorism are ongoing sources of concern.
