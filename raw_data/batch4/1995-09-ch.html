       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Extended hot, humid weather weighed on District economic activity 
during August, but the underlying momentum remained positive and 
expectations seemed generally improved in recent weeks. The effects 
of the weather on retail sales were pervasive and negative on 
balance, but retailing contacts generally expected stronger sales 
over the balance of the year. Reports from realtors suggested that 
home sales continued to rise, while homebuilder optimism improved 
further. Manufacturing output stabilized, but production has yet to 
rebound significantly from a weak second quarter, partly due to the 
extreme summer heat. Employer hiring plans were little changed from 
the second quarter, and labor markets in the region remain 
relatively tight. Extremely warm temperatures and limited rainfall 
have probably trimmed the prospective corn and soybean harvest from 
earlier estimates. Industrial input price increases generally 
continued to ebb.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hot, humid weather dampened District retail sales growth in August, 
but the underlying momentum remained positive, and most retailing 
contacts remained optimistic about the balance of 1995. In late 
August, one large apparel retailer stated that "we're expecting a 
pretty good pop when this clears up;" hot weather delayed sales of 
newly arriving fall merchandise, but boosted summer clearance. A 
large general merchandise chain characterized its overall inventory 
as "in extremely good shape," partly due to favorable clearance 
sales. This contact reported that sales gains over the Labor Day 
weekend, while mixed by merchandise category, were generally in line 
with the growth pace during August. Reports from home improvement 
and building material store chains suggested that hot weather slowed 
construction and demand for lumber in the region in August, 
constraining a rebound from a weak second quarter. Most of these 
retailers remained optimistic about sales over the balance of 1995; 
one stated at the end of August that "our order files are full, and 
the trend is real strong right now." A used car auction observer 
noted that prices have risen in recent months, and stated that "we 
are expecting the balance of the third quarter to be real strong." A 
survey of Michigan retailers suggested that sales growth increased 
in recent months, while inventory plans rose further. This survey's 
organizer stated that "optimism has reached its highest level since 
March."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from realtors indicated that existing home sales continued 
to strengthen. A survey showed further improvement in homebuilders' 
sales expectations during August, continuing a rebound that began in 
May. A 'parade of homes' recently conducted in one large 
metropolitan area experienced lower traffic and sales than expected, 
although the homebuilder association involved ascribed most of the 
shortfall to the weather. This contact expected sales and traffic to 
strengthen over the balance of the year on a seasonally adjusted 
basis; "no great upswing, mind you, just some improvement." A large 
homebuilder focused on entry-level homes reported sharply higher 
sales gains in July and August, however, and boosted construction 
plans for the balance of the year. A homebuilder supply store chain 
stated that "most of our customers are expecting a big finish to 
1995."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing output stabilized in July and August, but has 
yet to rebound significantly following a decline in the second 
quarter. District purchasing managers' surveys showed little 
significant change in orders or output in recent months, but 
inventories leveled off while employment firmed up. District steel 
production strengthened from July to August, in contrast to its 
monthly decline in the previous four years. Part of the recent 
increase reflected the resumption of output at several large 
facilities taken down for repairs in July, but output remained above 
year-earlier levels in both July and August. Several auto suppliers 
reported that purchasing delays were running longer than "normal" 
for the early stages of the third quarter, and while the automotive 
component of the Detroit purchasing managers' survey improved in 
August, it remained relatively weak. In late August, however, a 
steelmaker said that "after a slow start-up, auto output is now 
running about as expected," and auto suppliers' responses to Western 
Michigan purchasing managers' surveys also strengthened 
significantly in late August. Reports from capital goods producers 
grew increasingly mixed, after their output remained relatively 
strong in the first half of the year. Current build plans point to a 
modest decline in heavy-duty truck assemblies in the third quarter, 
and again in the fourth quarter. One large heavy-duty truck 
manufacturer stated that while net orders have fallen sharply with 
higher order cancellations, new order volumes have simply been 
"moderating." A large machine tool manufacturer stated that demand 
from automakers remained robust, but "seems to have lost some of its 
earlier urgency."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent survey suggested that Midwest employers' hiring plans were 
little changed in the third quarter. These plans remained high by 
historical standards, consistent with continued positive employment 
growth in the region, and stronger among manufacturers than the 
overall average. Another survey showed the share of Midwest 
employers planning to add mid-management and professional staff was 
little changed following a sharp increase in the first half of the 
year, and this indicator remained at one of its highest levels since 
the late 1970s. A large temporary help company reported that demand 
from manufacturing firms strengthened in August to a greater extent 
than expected for the time of year. This contact stated that growth 
in demand for temporary help, while slower than in 1994, was still 
consistent with positive growth in overall employment in its region. 
A permanent placement firm concentrating on manufacturing 
occupations stated that placements rose significantly in August, 
primarily in occupations closely tied to current trends in 
production. A number of construction and manufacturing contacts 
stated that hot weather reduced production hours in July and August, 
however. Discussions with help-wanted advertising managers in the 
region revealed little significant change in space or rates in the 
last month, with advertising remaining at high levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions remain quite variable around the District. However, 
extremely warm temperatures and limited rainfall have probably 
trimmed the prospective corn and soybean harvest from earlier 
estimates. Recent reports also suggest that the Great Lakes region 
had a smaller than expected harvest for vegetables-- mostly for 
processing--due to the extreme summer heat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial input price increases generally continued to abate. 
District purchasing managers' surveys suggested that industrial 
input prices flattened out in June, July, and August. Packaging 
materials price increases have dissipated, after exploding in 1994 
and early 1995. While varying by grade, paper prices paid by 
packaging firms have generally leveled out following their 
substantial gains over the past year. One packaging company stated 
that "the latest annual paper price hike letter seems to be delayed; 
over the past year, I've been getting one of these every two 
months." One packaging company saw little sign of any new decline in 
prices among a wide variety of paper grades, except for corrugated 
scrap, where prices have fallen by 50 percent over the past two 
months. Commodity thermoplastic resin prices continued to decline in 
August, and an industry analyst expected further declines in the 
balance of 1995. Prices for stretch film plastic purchased by area 
packaging companies have fallen roughly 20 percent in the past few 
months, according to one contact, but still remain about 40 percent 
above year-earlier levels. Building materials price increases have 
gained greater headway, however.
