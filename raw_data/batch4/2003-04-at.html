      <p>
       District economic activity remained sluggish in most sectors during February 

  and March, according to contacts. Labor market conditions were largely unchanged 

  in March compared with February, with firms reluctant to hire new full-time 

  workers. Retail sales continued to be around last year's level, whereas auto 

  sales slipped below their year-earlier pace. The District's travel industry 

  had a mixed report, with domestic travel increasing but fewer international 

  visitors. Although home sales continued to be strong, market imbalances persisted 

  in the commercial sector. Weakness in most manufacturing industries continued, 

  with the strongest reports coming from defense contractors. Higher oil and natural 

  gas prices negatively affected most sectors of the District's economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from retail contacts suggested that retail sales in March were near 

  year-ago levels, although several contacts reported lower sales caused by the 

  late Easter holiday. Some retailers also noted that while sales declined at 

  the outset of the war in Iraq, they rebounded relatively quickly. A number of 

  merchants engaged in aggressive discounting and promotional activity, whereas 

  discount retailers indicated that their performance remained relatively strong. 

  Most retail contacts reported that inventories were balanced and anticipate 

  that sales in the second quarter will be near last year's level. According to 

  domestic automobile industry contacts, new vehicle sales were below year-ago 

  levels in March, reversing gains posted earlier in the year. Some dealers attributed 

  weak SUV and high-performance car sales to lower consumer expectations and higher 

  fuel prices. Import dealers continued to gain market share in the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District housing markets were still being driven by low mortgage rates in February 

  and March. Most contacts reported that home sales during February mirrored year-ago 

  levels, but the responses were more varied during March, with some areas reporting 

  a softening in market conditions. High-end homes remained difficult to sell 

  in most parts of the District. Wet weather hampered construction in some parts 

  of the region. Most metropolitan commercial real estate markets continued to 

  suffer from an excess of office and industrial space. Government-related work 

  continued; however, some new projects have been scaled back or postponed because 

  of tight state government finances.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The manufacturing sector remained sluggish in February and March, with the main 

  exception being defense-related production. Reports indicated that overall hiring 

  and investment spending by manufacturers was down from a year earlier, and some 

  apparel and electrical equipment manufacturers were cutting production in response 

  to lower orders. Nonetheless, some reports suggested there had been a modest 

  pickup in the use of temporary workers in the light industrial sector. Shipbuilders 

  along the Gulf Coast reported a large backlog of military orders. Also, the 

  new auto plant projects and expansions in the District were proceeding on schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism and Business Travel
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from the District's hospitality and tourism sector were mixed in February 

  and March. Reports from south Florida indicated a successful spring break season 

  helped offset continued weakness in international travel. Hotel occupancy rates 

  were up from 2002 levels but still lagged those of 2001. Significant discounting 

  and late bookings remained the norm in the cruise industry, and some central 

  Florida tourist attractions continued to struggle with lower attendance. Gaming 

  industry contacts along the Gulf Coast reported that they were maintaining a 

  "reasonable customer flow," whereas smaller-than-expected crowds attended Mardi 

  Gras in New Orleans this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Responses from the banking sector were mostly positive in February and March. 

  Bankers reported moderate deposit growth, and refinancing activity remained 

  strong. However, commercial lending remained slow, and venture capital deals 

  were infrequent. A major concern among banking contacts was the lack of loan 

  demand in the business sector. By most accounts, bank asset quality remained 

  under control.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Hiring remained slow in February and March as most firms remained reluctant 

  to commit to adding full-time employees. Instead, businesses continued to stretch 

  existing labor pools, using part-time workers and overtime when necessary. Reports 

  indicated little change in most output prices but increases in prices for several 

  inputs. High natural gas prices in March caused several chemical and fertilizer 

  producers to suspend operations, while higher diesel costs adversely affected 

  transportation firms. According to reports, prices for the petroleum-based products 

  such as roofing, fertilizer, and PVC increased.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District farmers enjoyed mostly favorable early spring weather. With a few exceptions, 

  crop and livestock pasture areas were reported in good condition. Favorable 

  yields and stable prices were welcome news for Florida's sugar cane and vegetable 

  growers. However, grapefruit growers in Florida reported lower prices, and industry 

  contacts suggested that producers in the Indian River region are likely to register 

  a loss this year. Meanwhile, higher fuel and fertilizer prices significantly 

  increased operating costs for farmers throughout the District.
