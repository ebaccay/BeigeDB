       Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicate continued sluggish economic 

  growth in much of the region during January and early February. While prices 

  remained stable for most consumer goods and services, prices for energy and 

  health care increased substantially. In labor markets, firms faced limited upward 

  pressure on wages and salaries but noted continued rapid increases in costs 

  for employee benefits. Many respondents pointed to uncertainties, due in part 

  to geopolitical risks, as having negatively affected both consumer and business 

  spending. Consumers appeared more cautious concerning expenditures on vehicles 

  and travel. Conditions in District manufacturing generally remained weak with 

  limited signs of improvement. The agricultural sector benefited from improved 

  exports and oil and natural gas producers operated at high levels of capacity. 

  Contacts reported continued strength in residential real estate, while commercial 

  real estate remained weak. Bank lending continued recent patterns of rapid growth 

  in residential mortgage loans and weak demand for business credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Wages
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Respondents in the District reported that consumer prices generally remained 

  stable in recent weeks. Notable exceptions were energy prices, reflecting jumps 

  in fuel costs, and rapid increases in health-care prices. Contacts noted that 

  retailers had very little pricing power in the face of the slow economy, extensive 

  discounting was common among retailers and automakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Persistent weak demand and ample supply in labor markets continued to damp 

  wage and salary pressures in the District in recent weeks. Contacts characterized 

  wages as flat or up modestly. However, health care and other benefits expenses 

  continued to increase rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District respondents reported that the generally sluggish economy and uncertainties 

  related to possible military action in Iraq contributed to lackluster performance 

  in the retail sector during the most recent survey period. Sales of new and 

  used vehicles slowed in January and early February, both relative to December 

  and to a year earlier. Automobile dealers noted that, with the rise in gasoline 

  prices, inventories of SUVs and light trucks rose in several markets. Indicative 

  of more general weakness in retail, sales of apparel reportedly were flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       District respondents reported continued weak demand for many services in January 

  and early February. Demand for accounting and legal services remained soft in 

  parts of the District; in California, a large law firm catering to the technology 

  sector closed. Transportation providers faced higher costs from rising fuel 

  prices and uncertain future demand associated with a potential war in Iraq. 

  Conditions in District travel and tourism were mixed. In Hawaii, for example, 

  both domestic and international tourism continued to improve; however, the improvement 

  was below expectations and the level of international tourism still has not 

  recovered fully after slumping in 2001. Looking forward, District travel and 

  hospitality industry contacts indicated that adverse effects on tourism from 

  a potential war would more than offset any positive effects associated with 

  the weakening value of the dollar in the foreign exchange market.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Conditions in manufacturing generally remain weak in the District, with respondents 

  noting limited improvement in January and early February. Demand conditions 

  remained relatively stable in biotech industries, while weakness persisted in 

  telecommunications. Respondents noted that semiconductor sales were flat to 

  up modestly and inventories rose slightly. Capacity utilization in parts of 

  the high-tech sector improved; utilization rates reportedly were high and, in 

  some cases, capacity is being expanded for cutting edge technologies. Overall, 

  however, District firms remain cautious about spending. District contacts reported 

  that manufacturers, especially those facing rising energy costs and uncertainties 

  related to a potential war, have postponed spending and investment decisions. 

  Contacts also cited disruptions to businesses from the call-up of military reservists. 

  However, several contacts noted that defense contractors in Southern California 

  and other areas of the District would benefit from the federal government's 

  increased spending on defense and homeland security. Several respondents reported 

  that the fall in the value of the dollar over the past year has positioned District 

  manufacturers to compete more effectively against foreign firms in the months 

  ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The agricultural sector, on balance, benefited from increased exports, while 

  the oil and natural gas extraction sector was marked by high capacity utilization 

  and rising prices. Prices for specialty farm products have been mixed in recent 

  weeks. Prices for raisin grapes fell considerably, while prices for certain 

  nut crops were higher than they were a year ago. Respondents noted that the 

  depreciation of the dollar contributed to higher export volumes for a variety 

  of agricultural products, notably nut crops and beef. High levels of capacity 

  utilization and reduced inventories in oil and natural gas production continued 

  to put upward pressure on energy prices. Ongoing and potential disruptions of 

  foreign energy supplies also affected energy prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall conditions in District real estate remained mixed, with commercial real 

  estate markets still in a serious slump and residential markets still showing 

  strength in recent weeks. Commercial office vacancy rates remained high and 

  continued to edge up as leases expired. Rental rates fell, most notably in the 

  San Francisco Bay Area, and new office construction is not expected to pick 

  up for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, contacts indicated that residential housing markets across much 

  of the District remained robust in January and early February. Sales of low-to-median 

  priced homes remained high in most of the District, especially in Southern California 

  and Hawaii, although the pace of sales and of price appreciation has moderated 

  in some areas. Throughout the District, contacts noted that markets for high-end 

  homes had cooled off. Respondents attributed continued strength in overall home 

  sales primarily to low mortgage interest rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District banking industry respondents noted strong performance among community 

  banks in January and early February, with most depicting asset quality as remaining 

  good. Residential mortgage loan growth rates continued to climb. Home mortgage 

  refinancing activity was very brisk, though some lenders reported the pace of 

  applications fell short of the pace of loan closings. Business lending remained 

  weak.
