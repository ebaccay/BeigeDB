      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the past six weeks, Eleventh District economic activity grew at 
about the same pace as or a little slower than reported in the last 
Beige Book. Prices of most manufactured products were flat to down 
while service and construction-related industries continued to 
report upward price pressures. Manufacturers saw slightly slower 
sales growth, but retailers reported stronger than expected sales. 
Consumer borrowing increased with new home purchases, but wet 
weather slowed construction starts. Service industries reported 
growth was steady, but constrained by a shortage of labor. Energy 
activity remained strong but showed some hints of softening. 
Agricultural conditions remained favorable.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Goods-producing contacts reported more price declines than in the 
previous Beige Book, but some construction materials and service 
producers reported increases. A number of contacts reported 
commodity price decreases because of the Asian crisis, but some 
contacts indicated the decreases were not as large as previously 
anticipated. Excess capacity weakened prices for some manufactured 
goods.
       <p>
        Prices were lower for some petroleum products, memory chips, 
telecommunications products, and some metals. Crude oil and gasoline 
prices continued to decline and are lower than last year's levels. 
Although natural gas prices are higher than a year ago, they have 
fallen recently, and some contacts expect further declines. 
Respondents reported that excess domestic capacity for ethylene and 
propylene, increased imports of polyethylene bottle plastic from 
Asia, and increased domestic supplies of plastic resins like 
acrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride and butadiene resulting from 
reduced exports to Asia have combined to reduce prices for many 
petrochemicals. Prices for telecommunications equipment continued a 
steady downward trend, but most respondents reported an accelerated 
decline in the price of memory chips as a result of the combined 
effects of overcapacity and the Asian crisis. Contacts also reported 
that increased imports from Asia lowered scrap metal prices by 2%, 
and have put downward price pressure on raw materials such as nickel 
and ferro-moly alloys.
        <p>
         Prices for retail goods, forest products, and heating oil were flat. 
Retailers reported that prices of goods imported from Asia did not 
decline as much as they had expected a few weeks ago, but some 
retailers expect further price declines in the third and fourth 
quarters. Apparel industry contacts reported that Asian apparel 
manufacturers and textile producers have not been able to move 
swiftly into the United States because they lack the reputations and 
distribution networks necessary to do so. Paper manufacturers 
reported limited effects from the Asian markets because Asian-
produced paper includes more recycled content than does U.S.-made 
paper. Heating oil prices were unchanged but
well below year-earlier levels.
         <p>
          Strong construction activity translated into a 5% increase in high-
grade steel prices, a 2.5% increase in brick prices, and a slight 
increase in cement prices. As the weather improves, contacts expect 
cement prices to rise another 5% and soft lumber prices to increase 
10% to 15%.
          <p>
           Service fees increased, but at a slower rate than service wages and 
salaries. Salaries for engineering and software design were up. 
Construction wages were also up, but contacts reported that tight 
margins for builders limited wage increases. Lumber producers 
reported 10% wage increases. Conversely, the rise in the minimum 
wage was binding for retailers and apparel manufacturers.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Manufacturing
            </strong>
            <br/>
            The growth of sales for manufactured products was slightly weaker in 
the past six weeks, particularly in the telecommunications and 
petrochemicals industries. While sales of cellular telephones and 
Internet products continued to grow, a decline in sales of switching 
equipment left overall sales of telecommunications equipment flat. 
Domestic sales of petrochemicals were reported to be very strong, 
but sales to Asian markets were weak. Petrochemical producers said 
problems with rail shipping may have worsened. Contacts had 
difficulty shipping petrochemicals westward from the Gulf Coast, and 
said that several customers have temporarily shut down plants 
because petrochemicals were undelivered. Refiners reported that the 
demand for oil products was weak and inventories of crude and 
heating oil are large and growing. Prices for refined products have 
fallen as fast as crude prices, and contacts reported that margins 
have stagnated at levels that are considered mediocre to poor. 
Respondents indicated that they are responding to high inventories 
and low margins by extending and increasing the maintenance normally 
done in the turnaround season, when they switch the product mix. 
Sales of some construction-related products-such as cement and 
lumber-were slowed by the drop in construction that resulted from a 
wetter than usual February, and are expected to grow strongly with 
drier conditions. Most electronic equipment manufacturers said that 
sales continued to grow at the slower pace that was established over 
the past three or four months. One respondent reported that he had 
to seek out new suppliers because capital constraints had reduced 
the output of his Korean suppliers. Scrap metal and paper sales were 
steady at high levels, but scrap metal inventories were high due to 
rail shipping delays. Sales of brick and high grade metal increased 
over the last 30 days.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Services
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Demand for business services, including temporary staffing, 
accounting, consulting and legal services, continued to increase, 
but all respondents reported difficulty meeting demand due to a 
dearth of workers from clerical to executive. Respondents also noted 
a decline in demand for accounting services in Houston as the result 
of oil price declines. Overall, respondents had a very positive 
outlook for business service conditions in 1998. Demand for 
transportation services continued at high levels, both for cargo 
shipments and passenger air traffic. Contacts reported that Union 
Pacific tie-ups have not improved.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Retail Sales
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Retailers reported that sales growth was stronger than expected in 
February, with particularly strong growth at stores along the Texas-
Mexico border. Contacts were optimistic about the outlook for sales 
in the coming year. Auto sales slowed in February after surging 
"phenomenally" in January.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Financial Services
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Credit quality remained steady and competition for commercial loans 
remained strong with many customers receiving several loan offers. 
Contacts also reported increased consumer borrowing for home 
purchases, brisk refinancing activity and seasonally soft auto loan 
demand.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Construction and Real Estate
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Real estate activity continued at a hectic pace, but construction 
was slowed by unusually wet weather. Respondents expect a surge in 
construction in the second quarter-possibly sufficient to create a 
shortage of skilled workers, project supervisors and estimators. 
Home sales were up strongly across the District, including areas 
which had been weak such as the Texas-Mexico border, and inventories 
were lean. New home prices rose at a faster rate, but builders' 
margins continued to be squeezed. Office rents "inched up" at the 
same rate, and industrial rents rose at a faster pace as office 
market demand spilled over into flex space. Land prices continued to 
rise sharply.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Energy
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 Energy activity remained strong in February, with some hints of 
softening. The outlook has weakened substantially since the last 
Beige Book. Crude oil inventories are large and growing, thanks to a 
very mild winter in the United States and Europe, reduced demand 
from Asia, and increased production from OPEC. Still, oil service 
and machinery companies continued to report very strong demand and 
very long lead times, and contacts said that they expect orders to 
remain strong for several months. Natural gas production remained 
flat compared to last year, with contacts expressing concern that 
companies may be having trouble bringing new capacity on line 
because of a shortage of oil field services. Nonetheless, there were 
some reports that it was becoming easier to schedule services and 
that some oil service price increases had been rescinded. There were 
also reports that some oil companies are paring back on their 
projected office space needs for 1998.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Agriculture
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  Agricultural conditions are reported as generally good across the 
District, with mild temperatures and good rains. Wet conditions 
temporarily halted land preparations and early planting activity. 
Livestock conditions remained good, but wet pastures caused problems 
in grazing and feeding.
