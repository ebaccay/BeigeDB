      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 18, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic expansion remained vibrant around much of the nation in 
recent months, and conditions seem to have grown more uniform among 
the Districts. The underlying momentum in consumer spending growth 
remained quite strong. Manufacturers continued to offer some of the 
brightest reports within the Districts, although the overall pace of 
expansion in industrial output may have eased somewhat. Assessments 
of auto industry conditions remained upbeat. Higher mortgage 
interest rates appear to have slowed single-family housing activity, 
but multifamily residential and commercial construction remained 
relatively strong. Expansion in bank loans slowed, led by weaker 
demand for home mortgage, home equity, and residential construction 
loans. Production responses to livestock price declines are 
anticipated to bolster farm income in the current year. Labor 
markets continued to strengthen, with most reports indicating 
unchanged to somewhat higher wage increases. Price increases seemed 
somewhat more widespread than were reported in early December, while 
higher inflationary expectations were apparent in business surveys.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales increased at a moderate pace in the holiday season. 
Sales gains may have fallen mostly below expectations formed just 
after the Thanksgiving weekend, but weather effects and other 
factors point to stronger underlying momentum in spending growth. 
Nearly every District reported continued strength in sales gains for 
hard goods and/or big-ticket items, including personal computers, 
other consumer electronics items, home furnishings and appliances. 
Assessments of auto sales remained quite positive in most of the 
nation. Apparel sales were weaker in normally cold Districts that 
experienced relatively warm winter weather, and many apparel 
retailers reported heavier-than-anticipated discounting. However, 
there were signs of underlying strength even in the apparel 
category. Several Districts in the northern part of the country 
noted that apparel sales weakness was concentrated in outerwear, 
while retailers in the Atlanta District noted that warmer-than-usual 
weather held back overall holiday sales gains, except for apparel, 
which showed relatively strong gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers continued to provide some of the strongest reports 
within the Districts, although the overall growth rate may have 
slowed modestly. Philadelphia's survey of manufacturers showed 
output continuing to grow in the fourth quarter, although somewhat 
more slowly than a strong year-earlier period; looking ahead, about 
twice as many respondents expected order increases than decreases 
during the first half of 1995. Richmond's mail survey also suggested 
that most manufacturers expect further gains in output, with little 
change in the pace of current growth reported since the last survey. 
Purchasing managers' surveys in the Chicago region pointed to 
vigorous gains in industrial output as 1994 came to a close, 
although expansion was not quite so strong as earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production and orders trends in durable goods industries continued 
to lead growth within the overall manufacturing sector. Cleveland's 
industrial contacts indicated that orders growth remains solid, with 
particular strength in capital goods industries. Automotive contacts 
reported some of the strongest sales gains within Boston's 
manufacturing sector. Cleveland and Chicago reported strength in 
demand for steel, with Chicago noting that steel output plans for 
the first quarter were recently increased in response to stronger 
automotive orders. Auto parts suppliers continued to announce 
construction of new production facilities in the Atlanta region. 
Increased exports to Europe boosted recent results among Cleveland's 
manufacturing contacts. Uncertainty over Mexican developments 
clouded expectations in several regions, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Higher mortgage interest rates appear to have slowed homebuilding 
and residential real estate activity around much of the nation. 
Seasonal patterns account for some of the recent weakness, but home 
sales weakened in normally cold regions that enjoyed relatively warm 
and favorable weather. Multifamily and commercial construction were 
stronger than single-family homebuilding in nearly every District. 
For example, Dallas reported that overall demand for construction-
related products edged up; lumber producers reported lower sales for 
residential building but increased orders for commercial 
construction, and glass producers reported record sales partly for 
the same reason. Declining commercial vacancy rates were widely 
reported, and continued growth in commercial and multifamily 
development was generally anticipated in 1995. However, a wider
group of contacts expressed concern about the future impact of 
higher interest rates on real estate and commercial construction 
activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Expansion in bank loans slowed, led by weaker demand for home 
mortgage, home equity, and residential construction loans. Most 
Districts indicated that commercial and industrial loan demand 
remains relatively strong. "Outside of housing," San Francisco 
noted, "bank lending activity is reported to be brisk." A number of 
Districts reported slower growth or declines in business loan 
demand, however. After a relatively strong group of reports in 
December, assessments of trends in consumer loan demand were mixed, 
with some new slowing apparent even in Districts with relatively 
strong retail sales gains. Wherever noted, delinquency rates 
continued to decline. Philadelphia characterized loan officers' 
outlooks as "positive but cautious," with overall loan growth 
expected to ease as the year progresses. Reports of tighter lending 
margins were noted in several Districts, and Philadelphia stated 
that officers may review future lending plans as a result. 
Agricultural banks in the Kansas City District reported that crop 
loans were in better condition than a year ago, while a slump in hog 
and cattle prices weighed on livestock loan quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production responses to livestock price declines are anticipated to 
help bring some recovery in farm income in the current year. Kansas 
City reported that bankers generally expect farm income to improve 
slightly in its region during 1995, assuming normal crop yields, as 
livestock prices are anticipated to return to break-even levels. 
Chicago noted that hog production was up only marginally from last 
year and well short of expectations. Producers in the Chicago region 
account for a substantial share of national output, and they have 
made sizable cuts in planned production. Minneapolis noted that 
modest recent improvement in livestock prices have improved producer 
outlooks for 1995, and there are signs of increased farmer 
willingness to invest in new machinery.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Continued strengthening and/or increasingly tight labor markets were 
widely noted, although a minority of Districts suggested that wage 
pressures may have eased in some occupations. Minneapolis stated 
that "evidence of tight labor markets abounds." Retailers in the St. 
Louis and Chicago Districts reported difficulty meeting holiday 
seasonal labor needs, and St. Louis found that retailers were 
actively recruiting personnel from other stores. Strong demand for 
temporary workers was reported in the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas 
Districts, with Dallas also noting increasing wage pressures for 
temporary labor. Chicago reported that shortages of machine tool 
operators caused some production bottlenecks, and prompted some 
capital spending delays because workers were not available to 
operate new machinery. Reports on permanent manufacturing employment 
trends were mixed; growth was noted by contacts in Cleveland, 
Chicago and Richmond, while employment seemed to remain relatively 
flat among manufacturers contacted by Boston and Philadelphia. At 
the same time, Boston reported a tighter market for clerical 
workers, with increased opportunities for permanent employment. New 
York reported significant job cut announcements in the financial 
services sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increasing wage pressures were reported more frequently in the 
Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco 
Districts, while Kansas City stated that tightness in markets for 
skilled manufacturing and construction labor had eased. Surveys by 
compensation consulting companies in the Chicago region suggest that 
salary increases for exempt salaried employees of large firms will 
remain in line with 1994, while pay varying with sales growth, 
profitability, customer service, or other organizational goals will 
continue to take an increased share of total compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of price increases seemed steady to somewhat higher since 
reports in early December, while higher inflationary expectations 
were apparent in business surveys conducted in San Francisco and 
Chicago. District reports continued to emphasize shortages and 
increasing input prices in manufacturing and construction, coupled 
with stability in most retail prices. Price discounting during the 
holiday season ran heavier than many retailers had anticipated, 
particularly in apparel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers continued to report strong (but perhaps diminishing) 
pressure against output price increases. Boston stated that long-
term agreements with suppliers, low labor cost increases, pressure 
from customers and greater operating efficiency continue to limit 
many manufacturers' needs for output price increases. Reports from a 
minority of Districts included a growing set of exceptions to this 
rule, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in Dallas and San Francisco noted higher price pressures 
from rising packaging costs. Labor shortages and strong demand 
increased price pressures among service firms in the Dallas region. 
Agricultural businesses in the San Francisco region expressed 
concern about rising labor, transportation, packaging, and raw 
materials costs.
