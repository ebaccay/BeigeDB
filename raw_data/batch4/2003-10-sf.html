       Reports from Twelfth District contacts 
                indicated some further pickup in economic growth in September. 
                Despite continued increases in demand, many respondents indicated 
                that strong competitive pressures continued to hold down prices 
                and that productivity gains continued to keep hiring at bay. Retailers 
                reported that sales continued to improve and service providers 
                noted a further pickup in the demand for travel, software, and 
                media services. Reports indicated that overall manufacturing activity 
                continued to rise; orders strengthened for manufacturers of semiconductors, 
                apparel, and lumber and wood products. Conditions for District 
                agricultural and resource-related products were robust in recent 
                weeks. Respondents indicated that the demand for homes remained 
                strong, while the demand for commercial real estate remained sluggish. 
                Banking contacts reported an increase in business loan originations 
                in several District markets; however, mortgage refinancing activity 
                continued to contract in recent weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Prices and Wages
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most District respondents reported very little upward movement 
                in prices. However, there were some exceptions. Energy prices 
                were mixed, with gasoline prices falling but with residential 
                electricity and natural gas prices increasing modestly. Several 
                contacts noted that prices for lumber and other housing materials 
                have shot up in response to strong demand from the Iraqi rebuilding 
                efforts. Finally, health care costs appear to be rising rapidly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although demand for many goods and services 
                have increased in the District, employment conditions have continued 
                to languish. A majority of District respondents reported no immediate 
                plans to increase hiring, although some are optimistic that they 
                will start hiring in a couple of quarters. For instance, District 
                retailers, service providers, and banks have relied heavily on 
                employee overtime and improved efficiency to meet increased demand. 
                District manufacturers have used productivity gains and increased 
                outsourcing to meet demand. In agriculture, producers have replaced 
                some workers with machines for harvesting.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail Trade and Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        District retailers generally reported improved sales in September 
                and early October. Back-to-school sales reportedly were strong, 
                and department stores placed new orders to manufacturers after 
                working off inventories of old merchandise in recent weeks. Automobile 
                sales slipped some in September but remain at a high level; demand 
                for some domestic brands came in below expectations given the 
                generous financing available, but demand for foreign brands appeared 
                to remain strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand in the District for other services strengthened 
                further in September, particularly for IT and media services. 
                Respondents indicated that this could be explained partly by a 
                pickup in demand for efficiency-enhancing technologies. Also, 
                contacts reported a pickup in demand in food and restaurant industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conditions in the District's travel and tourism 
                sectors improved further in September and early October. In Hawaii, 
                international visitor counts have begun to increase after having 
                been battered by fear of SARS and the war. Domestic visitor counts 
                continued to be strong. Hotel occupancy rates have inched up in 
                several District markets. On the down side, convention bookings 
                have yet to pick up in Utah, and several airlines continue to 
                face excess capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturing activity strengthened overall in September. Semiconductor 
                producers reported a further pickup in demand for microprocessors, 
                DRAM, and flash memory. As a result, capacity utilization in high-end 
                fabrication plants is high and inventories are well balanced. 
                Contacts also noted an increase in demand for storage devices. 
                Demand conditions remained stable in biotech industries, and a 
                rise in venture capital investment bodes well for biotech startups. 
                Consistent with the pickup in apparel sales, clothing manufacturers 
                reported a more positive demand outlook, although there continues 
                to be a shift from producing apparel domestically to overseas. 
                Demand for lumber and particleboard has increased, reflecting 
                a surge in demand for projects in Iraq and continued strength 
                in housing markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the downside, makers of telecommunications 
                equipment and commercial aircraft continued to face overcapacity 
                and weak orders and sales. Demand for machine tools and basic 
                metals softened slightly relative to robust activity during the 
                last survey period.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Demand for most agricultural and resource-related products grew 
                in the most recent survey period. Yields of fruits, vegetables, 
                and nuts were high and inventories were near desired levels. Demand 
                for District livestock, notably cattle, was strong, partly as 
                a result of diverted demand from potentially diseased Canadian 
                beef. Overproduction in the wine industry has led to excess inventories 
                and downward pressure on prices. Prices for other agricultural 
                goods remained stable and export activity continued to show strength 
                for most markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Real Estate and Construction
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Conditions in District real estate remained mixed, with commercial 
                real estate markets still in a slump and residential markets still 
                solid. Sales of new and existing homes remained robust, especially 
                in Hawaii, Southern California, and some parts of Arizona. Elsewhere, 
                there were some reports of moderation in home sales, although 
                sales and prices generally were up from a year ago. On the commercial 
                side, vacancy rates remained high but little-changed from the 
                last survey period or from a year-ago. Respondents indicated that 
                rental rates probably will stay at low levels for the time being, 
                as landlords make concessions to increase occupancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Financial Institutions
          </strong>
          <br/>
          District financial institutions generally experienced increased 
                demand in the most recent survey period. Demand for business loans 
                strengthened in recent weeks, while fierce competition for quality 
                loans continued to put pressure on margins. Several bank contacts 
                noted an acceleration of deposit inflows from businesses, which 
                may signal improvements in general economic conditions. Loan growth 
                was particularly strong in Southern California and Hawaii, consistent 
                with robust economic activity there.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mortgage refinance activity declined further 
                across the District, with no signs of pickup despite a slight 
                decrease in interest rates during the survey period. Origination 
                of new mortgages for home purchases remained strong, although 
                District bank contacts observed signs of moderation in some markets.
