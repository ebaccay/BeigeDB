      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts around the Sixth District suggest that economic

activity continues its moderate rate of growth on net, with signs of slowing apparent in

some sectors.  Retail sales continued to exceed year-ago levels in both October and early

November, although retailers noted weaker sales in the latter period.  District

manufacturers indicate that production has recently weakened slightly, while their outlook

has improved somewhat.  Reports on tourism within the region remain overwhelmingly

positive.  Real estate contacts report that home sales and construction activity slowed in

October.  However, the single-family market continues to operate at a healthy level, and

commercial real estate markets continue to improve throughout the District, with falling

vacancy rates and robust levels of construction in many areas.  Overall loan demand is

characterized as moderate.  Labor shortages persist in many areas of the District, but wage

pressures reportedly remain subdued.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       According to District retailers, sales in October and

early November exceeded year-ago levels.  Sales increases were stronger in October than

in early November on a year-over-year basis.  More than half of the retailers contacted

said that recent sales had met their expectations, and most retailers report that inventories

are on target.  Apparel, cosmetics, shoes, and home-related products are among the top

sellers within the region.  Looking toward holiday sales, most retailers anticipate a slight

increase over last year, while the remainder expect a more significant increase.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Since the last Beige Book, an increasing number of

factories are reporting decreasing production and shipments.   However, more reported

expectations for improved future business activity, and most manufacturers expect to

maintain current employment levels for at least the next few months.   Contacts in the

food, paper, and lumber and wood industries report slowing  activity.  Although weakness

persists for the region?s apparel producers, one contact says that there have been fewer

reports of shrinking employment rolls in the  industry, perhaps  indicating that a large

portion of weaker firms have been culled out.  More positively, orders for industrial

machinery and electronic equipment have recently picked up at regional plants, and some

Louisiana chemical plants are reportedly running at 100 percent capacity and are

announcing expansions.  Recently announced additions to Tennessee?s automotive

industry are expected to further industrial growth in the state.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Tourism and Business Travel
         </strong>
         <br/>
         New attractions, expanded airline service,

and strong international traffic are resulting in filled theme parks and high hotel

occupancies in central Florida.   Resorts on Florida?s Gulf Coast and in south Florida

report strong winter bookings, and spokesmen are confident that the trend will carry over

into next year.  Recently renovated hotels  and recognition of the trendy South Beach area

are boosting tourism to the southern part of the state; European and South American

tourism is up from a year ago in Miami.  Strong 1997 booking numbers show that

Atlanta?s convention business will bounce back from a pre-Olympic slowdown.  Although

the end of the year is traditionally slow for  the Gulf Coast?s casino business, spokesmen

expect 1997 to usher in the fruits of large construction projects and new jet services.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction
          </strong>
          <br/>
          According to real estate contacts, the single-family housing

market slowed in October from the previous month.  On a year-over-year basis,  home

sales were mixed within the District in both October and early November, while

construction was generally characterized as flat.  Despite the overall slowdown in the

market, home sales and construction remain relatively high.  Inventories of new and

existing homes are said to be adequate for expected sales throughout most of the District.

Most builders anticipate no change in the level of construction through the end of the

year, while Realtors? expectations are more mixed.
          <p>
           Contacts from across the District generally report that commercial real

estate markets continue to improve.  Declining vacancy rates and higher rental rates

continue to propel new industrial, office, and retail development.  Although most

commercial projects continue to be build-to-suits, several speculative projects are

underway, and more are anticipated this year and next.  Overall, the multifamily sector

remains healthy; however, some markets have weakened.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Financial
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Most contacts in the banking industry report a moderate level

of loan demand.  Consumer lending remains subdued with some strength in automobile

financing reported.  Commercial lending remains mixed throughout the District.

Mortgage lending is said to be flat.  There are also continuing reports of some softness

in loan quality.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Wages and Prices
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Reports of increasing wages are infrequent in the

region at this time.  However, reports of labor shortages in parts of the District remain

common.  Workers from overseas are being recruited and imported into some parts of the

region to fill job vacancies.  Craftsmen are in especially short supply.  Contacts continue

to report that strong demand for management talent is being met with benefits and fringes instead of

higher salaries.  Materials prices have increased slightly recently and are expected to

continue to escalate moderately, but most contacts expect prices received for finished

products to weaken or be unchanged over the next few months.
