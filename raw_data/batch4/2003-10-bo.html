      According to business contacts 
                in the retail and manufacturing sectors, economic activity in 
                the First District is largely stagnant. Most merchants report 
                sales in September about level with a year ago, while the majority 
                of contacted manufacturers indicate that third-quarter revenues 
                were below year-earlier levels. Insurance contacts say revenues 
                are level, except for some property and casualty insurers who 
                indicate their business continues to grow. Demand for residential 
                real estate throughout the region is still strong. Respondents 
                are not increasing employment levels; retailers are holding headcounts 
                steady while most manufacturers continue layoffs. The outlook 
                remains cautious.
      <div>
       <strong>
        Retail and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers in New England report sales in September are mostly 
                flat compared to year earlier, with some pockets of strength. 
                Contacts in the lumber and home-builder sector indicate residential 
                construction and home improvements continue to positively affect 
                their business. A furniture retailer reports that sales continued 
                to be strong through September, slightly exceeding expectations. 
                An entertainment equipment retailer notes a slowdown in September 
                following an up-tick in August. A major department store indicates 
                sales are mostly flat, with some increases in women's apparel 
                but softening sales of home products.
      </div>
      <p>
       According to travel and tourism 
                contacts, the hospitality industry remains sluggish. Respondents 
                in the Boston area report some slight improvements, including 
                a modest pick-up in business travelers. Contacts indicate leisure 
                travelers continue to favor drive-to destinations for day or weekend 
                trips. Prices remain extremely competitive, with many travelers 
                choosing to book reservations online for the lowest prices. One 
                contact notes future bookings in northern New England are particularly 
                weak, with higher-than-usual vacancy rates for the upcoming Columbus 
                Day weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most retail respondents indicate 
                they are maintaining lean inventory levels and modest capital 
                spending plans. Employment is said to be stable and any wage increases 
                are minimal. Vendor prices are reportedly mixed, with notable 
                increases in plywood and lumber prices. Many retail contacts note 
                slight decreases in selling prices, particularly in the travel 
                and tourism sector, but others say their price changes are mixed. 
                Overall, most retail respondents expect slow growth over the next 
                six months.
      </p>
      <div>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related 
                Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A majority of First District manufacturing contacts say that their 
                third quarter revenues were below year-earlier levels. Demand 
                for aerospace products reportedly continues to weaken, apart from 
                items used by the military. Sales of metal products also are down 
                from a year earlier. A textile manufacturer indicates that sales 
                have been falling because of inventory reductions at retail. By 
                contrast with the general trend, a publishing firm reports spotty 
                improvement, a computer hardware firm indicates continued gains 
                relative to 2002 sales, and some other contacts are experiencing 
                rising sales of home and automotive products.
      </div>
      <p>
       Manufacturers report that they 
                are paying more for energy, insurance, and euro-denominated inputs. 
                Other materials costs remain under control. Most contacts indicate 
                that they have little if any scope for increasing their selling 
                prices, with the possible exception of new product introductions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the contacted manufacturers 
                are continuing to pare back employment through selective layoffs. 
                Pay increases for 2003 are mostly in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent. 
                A couple of firms report that their overall capital spending will 
                be up this year, but most are holding the line. Some companies 
                are undertaking significant IT projects, but simultaneously cutting 
                other investments.
      </p>
      <p>
       In discussing the outlook for 2004, 
                manufacturing contacts indicate that their customers are likely 
                to remain cautious. To the extent that they foresee improvements 
                in their business, manufacturers expect them to be due largely 
                to their success in increasing market share through cost cutting 
                or product innovation.
      </p>
      <div>
       <strong>
        Residential Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate markets in New England remain active. 
                Contacts continue to report low inventory levels, although high-priced 
                houses are staying on the market longer. Lower- and mid-priced 
                houses sell very quickly in all parts of the region. Demand remains 
                strong, spurred by low interest rates. One contact reports that 
                the number of single-family homes sold in Massachusetts in August 
                was 17 percent higher than a year earlier, and the number of condominiums 
                sold increased by 27 percent. The average sale prices rose as 
                well, with the average price for condominiums reaching a record 
                high level in August. Contacts expect housing markets to remain 
                steady, with lower activity levels in the winter. Most anticipate 
                the markets will become busy again in the spring, as long as interest 
                rates stay low.
      </div>
      <p>
       <div>
        <strong>
         Insurance
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Contacts from the property and casualty insurance industry report 
                positive or flat top line growth, while annuity and traditional 
                life insurance sales have stayed level with little potential for 
                change. Respondents observe that revenue growth rates have moderated, 
                in part because of increased price competition and in part because 
                equity markets have stabilized somewhat, allowing companies to 
                generate more operating capital. Most contacts are optimistic 
                about the current state of the industry and think that pricing 
                in the property and casualty market has largely equilibrated.
       </div>
       <p>
        While generating many small claims, 
                the power outage in August did not have a large financial impact 
                on contacted insurance firms. Some companies, however, report 
                extending the workweek to 70 hours to meet client needs after 
                the outage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment and capital budgets remain 
                largely flat, although one company plans to expand substantially 
                its capital budget for 2004. The majority of insurance contacts 
                is optimistic and expects a continuation of gradual improvements.
