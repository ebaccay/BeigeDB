     <h1>
      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity advanced at a moderate pace in March and April, 
according to reports from the Federal Reserve Banks. All the 
districts with the exception of New York indicated that economic 
activity expanded, and several noted that the pace of expansion had 
quickened recently. Both retail sales and manufacturing activity 
picked up somewhat. In addition, manufacturers' inventories appeared 
to be at or near expected levels in several districts. Activity also 
picked up in nonfinancial services, commercial and consumer lending, 
and real estate. Mortgage loan activity slowed, as did tourism in 
several districts, and agriculture suffered from adverse weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases remained generally subdued and there were only 
scattered reports of wage pressures despite continued tight labor 
markets and somewhat stronger economic growth. Several District 
banks noted the sharp increases that had occurred in oil and grain 
prices, but Dallas observed that oil price futures pointed to a 
near-term decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts reported gains in retail sales, but the Boston and 
New York districts indicated that retail sales were mixed and San 
Francisco said that sales were stable. Six districts noted that 
apparel sales were up from the previous year and several attributed 
the uptick to warmer weather. Retailers in several districts 
expected a moderate increase in sales over the next few months. The 
Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts reported strong auto 
sales, while the Philadelphia and Chicago districts reported that 
auto sales were sluggish. Most districts said that retail 
inventories were near desired levels and were consistent with their 
contacts' expectations of increased sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output strengthened by varying degrees in nine of the 
twelve districts. The growth rate picked up in Boston, Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis; Chicago, Kansas 
City, and San Francisco reported that plants in their districts were 
operating at moderate to high levels of capacity. However, 
manufacturing conditions were mixed in New York and weakened 
somewhat in Atlanta. Dallas said activity was below the level of a 
year ago but that April manufacturing orders rebounded from March. 
The Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Minneapolis districts indicated 
that manufacturers' inventories were at or near desired levels; 
Kansas City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco reported that 
inventories were edging down; and Atlanta said that inventories were 
increasing moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      District banks reported varying pockets of strength and weakness in 
manufacturing. Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis noted increased 
demand for auto and auto-related products. Boston, Atlanta, and 
Minneapolis all reported stronger demand for electronic and 
computer-related equipment. Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas 
indicated that the market for building materials showed gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, Philadelphia noted that some of their firms which 
produce homebuilding products and materials saw declining demand. 
Dallas indicated that the growth in demand for semiconductors and 
telecommunications equipment had weakened in recent months. Boston, 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis reported excess capacity and 
rising inventories of paper products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that the 
service sector was generally healthy in their districts. 
Philadelphia reported strong demand for computer-oriented 
businesses, while San Francisco noted an increase in demand for both 
computer and telephone communication services.
     </p>
     <p>
      An earlier Easter and colder-than-normal temperatures hampered beach 
tourism activity in the Richmond and Atlanta districts. Minneapolis 
indicated that the long winter was damping tourism activity in 
February and March. In contrast, Philadelphia reported that tourism 
was healthy in their district, with increased bookings for 
conferences and business meetings in the Pocono Mountain region of 
Pennsylvania. Spring bookings were also higher in the Richmond and 
Atlanta districts, and Minneapolis said that business owners were 
optimistic about bookings for the spring and summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported that residential real estate activity 
increased; some contacts characterized the activity as "brisk." 
Housing sales strengthened in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. The 
Richmond and Kansas City districts indicated that housing starts 
were steady. Kansas City reported that the stock of unsold homes was 
lean, while Atlanta said that home inventories were "in good shape." 
Pockets of strength in western and southern New York were 
overshadowed by sluggish markets in northern New Jersey and upstate 
New York; one New Jersey contact described the market there as 
"listless."
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity also increased in most districts. 
Dallas, Richmond, and Atlanta reported strong leasing activity with 
low vacancy rates and high rental rates. The Dallas, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts noted strong growth in 
construction activity; Atlanta reported that several speculative 
projects were under way and more were anticipated. Boston indicated 
that its commercial real estate market improved somewhat, and New 
York reported a stable commercial real estate market. San Francisco, 
however, indicated that the market was soft in the Los Angeles area, 
and Chicago noted that commercial development remained slow, despite 
positive absorption rates and firming rents in office and retail 
space.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent uptick in mortgage rates had mixed effects on real estate 
and construction activity. Chicago and Richmond reported that the 
rise may have spurred potential homebuyers to take action. The New 
York district reported that the increased rates had no apparent 
effects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall lending activity increased slightly in most districts with 
moderate gains in commercial and consumer lending activity 
offsetting weaker residential mortgage and home refinancing 
activity. The demand for consumer loans was mixed across districts-
increasing in Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Dallas but decreasing in 
Chicago and St. Louis. In the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City 
Districts, the demand for consumer loans remained steady. New York 
and Cleveland reported that loan delinquency rates were unchanged. 
However, Chicago reported that loan delinquency rates rose, although 
overall credit quality was unchanged. St. Louis reported a slight 
increase in nonperforming consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture was adversely affected by the weather and high feed 
costs in March and April, according to district bank reports. Kansas 
City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that severe drought 
conditions had damaged the winter wheat crop; Richmond and St. Louis 
said that crops there suffered from the lingering effects of 
winter's severe temperatures. In contrast, Minneapolis indicated 
that the wheat crop held up well. Several banks cited the small 
wheat crop and tight carryover stocks as reasons for soaring grain 
prices. Dallas, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted 
that high livestock feed costs combined with low livestock prices 
were leading to financial stress among ranchers and some feedlot 
operators. San Francisco and Richmond reported that fruit trees were 
in worse than normal condition, and St. Louis indicated that an 
early spring freeze resulted in the loss of 75 percent of the 
Arkansas peach crop. Kansas City noted that spring planting activity 
may be delayed by the drought; Minneapolis reported that planting 
delays have resulted from unseasonably wet weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported tight labor markets but only scattered 
upward pressure on wages. Tighter markets for manufacturing workers 
were noted by St. Louis and Kansas City. Chicago said that labor 
shortages were the main concern of businesses there, although demand 
for manufacturing workers had softened. Boston indicated that some 
manufacturers experienced difficulty in filling software and 
telecommunication positions. The Atlanta and Kansas City districts 
reported shortages of retail workers. While Dallas reported fewer 
labor shortages overall, a short supply of skilled workers had 
caused delays in the construction of warehouses and office 
buildings. Cleveland indicated that labor shortages were occurring 
less frequently than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Districts generally reported only modest wage pressures, although 
St. Louis said several industries experienced increased labor costs 
and Minneapolis reported wage increases of 4 to 5 percent. Kansas 
City said that wages rose for skilled workers such as welders and 
machinists.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts reported little upward pressure on prices other than 
sharply higher prices for grains and energy-related items. Boston, 
New York, and Atlanta reported that prices in their districts 
changed little. Price increases in the San Francisco district 
continued to be moderate overall. Retail prices were steady in 
Kansas City and increased slightly in Richmond. Materials prices 
rose in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts but declined 
slightly in Richmond. Richmond indicated that service-sector and 
finished goods prices increased slightly. Atlanta reported some 
pockets of price deflation in lumber and paper, and Dallas reported 
that oil prices were likely to decline soon. Contacts in the 
Philadelphia district expected increases in the prices of purchased 
supplies and materials over the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San 
Francisco reported sharp increases in grain prices; however, the 
Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts noted lower livestock 
prices. St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated prices 
for fuels rose, and Dallas and Minneapolis reported price hikes in 
plastics.
