      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 13, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The rate of expansion in the Fifth District appears to have changed 
little in late July and August. Retailers and service producers 
reported that growth slowed in their sectors, but manufacturers and 
financial industry contacts reported that growth picked up. 
Residential and commercial real estate contacts reported little 
change in their sectors. Contacts at area ports reported increased 
activity, and employment agencies saw stronger demand for temporary 
workers. Tourism industry sources reported that business was down 
from July. Government contacts reported slower state revenue growth. 
Agricultural conditions deteriorated somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of retail activity growth decreased slightly in August 
from their July levels, according to preliminary results from a mail 
survey of District retailers. Survey respondents reported that their 
sales, including those of big-ticket items, changed little. They 
indicated that employment decreased slightly; wages grew more 
slowly; shopper traffic decreased; and inventories were higher. 
Survey respondents reported that retail prices rose somewhat faster 
in August than in July. They foresaw decreased demand for their 
products, and they expected their prices to be unchanged during the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service Production
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of service-sector activity growth decreased in August 
from their July levels, according to preliminary results from a mail 
survey of District service producers. Survey respondents indicated 
that employment and wage growth slowed and that revenues changed 
little. They reported that their prices rose faster in August than 
in July. They expected the growth in demand for their services to 
fall during the next six months, and they expected their prices to 
rise faster.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Indicators of factory growth increased in August from their July 
levels, according to preliminary results from a mail survey of Fifth 
District manufacturers; this was the first such increase since 
March. Survey respondents reported that shipments, new orders, and 
the workweek increased; order backlogs and employment changed 
little. They were more optimistic about growth in the workweek and 
wages during the next six months, but their expectations about 
shipments and employment changed little from July. Manufacturers 
indicated that finished goods and raw materials prices rose more 
slowly in August than in July, and at rates below the general 
inflation rate. Respondents expected their prices to rise somewhat 
more slowly during the next six months than they had expected in 
July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts throughout the 
District indicated that tourist activity in August was below that of 
July but above that of a year ago. At coastal areas, visitors were 
driven away by Hurricane Felix and other tropical storms. Fall 
bookings were up compared to a year ago, and contacts expected 
better-than-normal business and unchanged prices during the next six 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports indicated that import levels in 
July were higher than those in June and a year ago. Export levels in 
July were unchanged from June but were higher than those a year ago. 
Contacts expected that both exports and imports would increase 
during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of Fifth District temporary employment agencies 
indicated that the demand for temporary workers was higher in August 
than in July or a year ago. Contacts expected demand during the next 
six months to be greater than usual. Temporary workers' wages rose 
faster than the general price level during the past year, although 
most contacts continued to expect wages to stabilize during the next 
six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District financial institutions reported that credit market activity 
increased somewhat during the past six weeks. Interest rates fell 
slightly for consumer, commercial, and  mortgage loans. Demand 
increased for consumer and commercial loans and fell slightly for 
mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a telephone survey of District real estate agents and 
homebuilders, residential real estate activity was unchanged in late 
July and August. Housing starts, building permits, and buyer traffic 
were stable over the period. Home sales were steady, but contacts 
indicated that lower- to middle-priced homes continued to sell 
better than expensive homes. Lumber prices rose, but other building 
material prices changed little. One contact in North Carolina 
reported that skilled labor was in short supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported that commercial real estate activity 
changed little in late July and August. Leasing activity was 
unchanged, although vacancy rates declined. Commercial rents were 
unchanged, except in South Carolina and Virginia, where they 
increased. The availability of prime office space tightened in most 
District cities, and contacts reported shortages of such space in 
North Carolina. Contacts continued to report little new 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State government contacts reported lower tax revenue growth in July. 
Compared with June, real revenue growth was lower in the District of 
Columbia and West Virginia and was unchanged in the other Fifth 
District states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural conditions worsened in recent weeks according 
to agricultural analysts. Near-record temperatures and below-normal 
rainfall reduced soybean, cotton, and peanut yield prospects, 
although analysts expected near-record corn yields. Tobacco poundage 
and quality were below average, especially in the Carolinas. 
Pastures were in poor condition in some areas of the District. In 
South Carolina, recent heavy rains caused flooding and minor crop 
damage; the state also suffered the worst outbreak of southern pine 
beetle on record, causing the loss of $70 million of pine timber.
