      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       April 21, 2004
      </b>
      <p>
       Business activity in the Sixth District expanded at a moderate 
              pace during February and March. Reports of hiring remained mixed, 
              but declines in some of the weaker sectors abated. Retail reports 
              indicated that sales exceeded year-ago levels, whereas auto sales 
              were described as uneven. Tourism reports were distinctly upbeat. 
              Single-family housing markets remained robust and small improvements 
              were noted in some commercial real estate segments. Manufacturing 
              output increased from low levels and transportation contacts continued 
              to report increasing demand. Banking activity was described as mixed. 
              Rising prices for some key transportation, manufacturing, and construction 
              inputs were widespread, although instances where these increases 
              were being passed on to final users remained limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Consumer Spending
       </b>
       <br/>
       District retail contacts reported that February sales were up

strongly compared with a year-ago, followed by moderate increases in March.

Most merchants indicated that inventories were balanced. Women's and children's

apparel, and shoes sold well in March. Home-related sales were mixed.

Retailers remained upbeat and anticipate that second-quarter sales will also

exceed year-ago levels. Demand for light trucks and SUVs continued strong, and

contrasted with the weaknesses noted in most car segments even with strong

marketing incentives.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Real Estate
       </b>
       <br/>
       District single-family housing

markets remained robust overall in February and March. The majority of Realtor

contacts noted that sales exceeded year-ago levels, and most builders reported

that new home construction during March met or exceeded the prior year's

level. The strong demand for mid-priced homes continued, with some improvement

in demand for high-end homes. Demand continued to outstrip supply in several Florida markets. Housing inventories were mostly described as balanced elsewhere.

Contacts anticipate continued strength in the second quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports

indicated there were modest improvements in commercial real estate markets in

February and March. Several retail expansions were underway, and although most

large-scale construction plans have remained on hold in other sectors, some

small to mid-size projects have moved forward. Concern that escalating steel

prices could hold up some projects was noted. Office markets remained

generally weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing
       </b>
       <br/>
       Activity improved in several manufacturing industries. Strong sales in

February and March were reported from lumber, plywood, metal piping, heavy

trucks and trailers, and supply boats for the offshore drilling industry.

Carpet production was described as steady, but other areas of the textile

industry remained weak. The pulp and paper industry also continued to struggle

with overcapacity problems. Some manufacturers reported increased steel

product inventories as a hedge against additional price increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Transportation
       </b>
       <br/>
       District transportation contacts reported

continued strong demand for air, truck and rail transportation services.

Inter-modal centers in Atlanta and Huntsville reported record volumes of rail

cargo processed. Several District trucking companies reported very strong

demand for both industrial and consumer shipments.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Tourism and Business Travel
       </b>
       <br/>
       Contacts in the

District's tourism and hospitality industry reported high levels of activity in

several markets. South Florida recorded near record numbers of visitors, and

hotel occupancy rates in central Florida were up from last year. Passenger

traffic and fares were said to be increasing in the cruise industry. Gaming

revenues along Mississippi's Gulf Coast increased strongly from a year earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Financial
       </b>
       <br/>
       Responses indicated that banking sector

activity was mixed in February and March. Residential mortgage activity slowed

somewhat, but there were some reports of new rounds of refinancing. Reports

also noted increased use of adjustable rate mortgages. Demand for new

commercial and industrial bank loans remained flat. Past dues and loan losses continued

at low levels and competition for deposits was vigorous. One report noted a

modest increase in venture capital activity in the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Employment and Prices
       </b>
       <br/>
       Most reports indicated that

hiring remained limited in March. Despite increased output, there were only

scattered reports of new hiring in the manufacturing sector. There was a pickup

in hiring because of new contracts in the defense industry. Contacts noted that

the use of temporary workers was increasing in some sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       More instances of higher input prices were noted in

March. One building contractor reported that the price of building materials

was "going through the roof." In some cases, rising building costs

were being reflected in new home prices. Sharply higher raw steel prices had

increased costs for metal fabricators in the District. Some transportation

firms indicated that they were able to pass on recent fuel costs increases. A

large paper producer announced price increases for several consumer products.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Agriculture
       </b>
       <br/>
       Dry weather conditions were the main factor affecting District farmers 
              during late March and early April. Recent market conditions for 
              regional crops such as cotton and soybeans were bright. Vegetable 
              prices were also firm. Overproduction of sugar was noted as a concern 
              of District sugar cane growers.
