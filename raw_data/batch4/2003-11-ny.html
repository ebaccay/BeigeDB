      Beige Book Report: New York

     <p>
      <p>
       The Second District's economy has given generally 
                  positive signals since the last report, despite some signs of 
                  slowing in consumer spending. There has been a further pickup 
                  in hiring activity in a number of sectors. Recent business surveys 
                  point to further gains in manufacturing activity in recent weeks. 
                  Consumer confidence rebounded in October, after declining for 
                  a number of months. On the other hand, most retailers report 
                  that sales were somewhat below plan in October and early November, 
                  partly due to weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both residential construction and the market 
                  for existing homes have remained robust. Manhattan office vacancy 
                  rates were mixed in October, with some improvement Downtown 
                  but an uptick in Midtown. Strong profits and revenues in New 
                  York City's financial industry are reportedly driving up bonuses 
                  and prompting a pickup in hiring. Finally, bankers report some 
                  weakening in demand for consumer and especially home-mortgage 
                  loans, but across-the-board declines in delinquency rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report mixed but generally soft sales results for 
                  October and early November. While a majority of contacts report 
                  that sales were below plan, two chains indicate that they were 
                  slightly ahead of plan; year-over-year same-store sales changes 
                  ranged from a decline of 4 percent to a gain of 4 percent. All 
                  contacts, even those running ahead of plan, say that unseasonably 
                  mild weather hurt sales of winter apparel. Sales of household 
                  furnishings, as well as jewelry, have remained persistently 
                  strong. Most retailers indicate that inventories are in good 
                  shape; two chains report that stocks are a bit on the high side 
                  but note that the bulk of the season's sales come after Thanksgiving. 
                  Retailers report that selling prices are steady to down 3 percent 
                  from a year ago. In looking ahead to the upcoming holiday season, 
                  retailers are generally planning for sales to be flat to up 
                  modestly over comparable 2002 levels and are looking to hire 
                  roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer confidence rebounded in October, based on two separate 
                  surveys. Siena College's monthly survey of New York State residents 
                  shows confidence jumping to its highest level in more than a 
                  year, led by the New York City metro area, while the Conference 
                  Board's confidence index for the Middle Atlantic states (NY, 
                  NJ, PA) posted a more moderate rebound.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate markets continued to show strength since 
                  the last report, while commercial markets were steady, on balance. 
                  Realtors in both New York State and New Jersey report that median 
                  selling prices were up more than 10 percent from a year earlier 
                  in the third quarter, while unit sales were up moderately. A 
                  large Manhattan real-estate firm and a leading appraisal firm 
                  both report that sales were brisk across the board in October 
                  and early November, and that prices were steady at the high 
                  end of the market and up moderately for smaller units. They 
                  also report lean inventories of homes on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing permits rose in the third quarter, with a pickup in the 
                  single-family segment overshadowing a dip in multifamily permits. 
                  Still, year-to-date, multifamily permits are running more than 
                  10 percent ahead of 2002 levels and are on track for the strongest 
                  annual performance since 1987. More recently, homebuilders in 
                  northern New Jersey report persistent strength in the market 
                  through mid-November, with prices continuing to rise, though 
                  at a more subdued pace than earlier in the year. One industry 
                  contact reports a noticeable pickup in bridge loans, which is 
                  attributed to homes taking longer than expected to sell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manhattan's office market was mixed in October. 
                  Data from a major brokerage show Midtown's vacancy rate rising 
                  from 11 to 11.9 percent, but Lower Manhattan's rate edging down 
                  from 12.9 to 12.4 percent. However, asking rents, though still 
                  well below a year earlier, rose in both areas. An industry contact 
                  notes that Lower Manhattan's market has been helped by soon-to-expire 
                  tax incentives for new leases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A major New York City employment agency, specializing in office 
                  jobs, reports that hiring activity remained generally brisk 
                  in October and the first half of November, and that there seem 
                  to be fewer people looking for work. Separately, a contact in 
                  New York City's securities industry reports that this year's 
                  strong improvement in industry revenues and profits has begun 
                  to drive a moderate pickup in hiring and expects variable compensation 
                  (bonuses) to rise nearly 20 percent from a year earlier. Manhattan 
                  hotels report strong results for October-typically the busiest 
                  month of the year-with room rates about on par with a year earlier 
                  and occupancy rates up noticeably. One major hotel reports that 
                  it is completely booked up for every weekend until Christmas. 
                  In contrast hotel occupancy rates in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls 
                  area were moderately lower than a year ago in September.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manufacturing sector has continued to give 
                  positive signals in October and early November, even in terms 
                  of employment. Our latest Empire State Manufacturing Survey, 
                  conducted in the first half of November, points to further widespread 
                  improvement in business conditions, increased employment and 
                  little change in input costs or selling prices. Similarly, New 
                  York City area purchasing managers report further widespread 
                  improvement in the manufacturing sector in October, as well 
                  as a pickup in other sectors. Buffalo-area purchasers also report 
                  that manufacturing-sector conditions continued to improve in 
                  October, with accelerating production activity, steady growth 
                  in new orders and modest increases in employment. On the other 
                  hand Rochester-area purchasing managers report some softening 
                  in manufacturing sector conditions. Reports on input prices 
                  were mixed: some escalation was reported from Buffalo, but declines 
                  were indicated in Rochester, and little change in the New York 
                  City area.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Small to medium-sized banks in the Second District report decreased 
                  demand for household loans over the past two months, but steady 
                  demand for commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial 
                  loans. As in the last survey, residential mortgages saw the 
                  largest decrease, with more than two in three bankers reporting 
                  lower demand. A sizable 40 percent of respondents also report 
                  weakening demand for consumer loans. Lower refinancing activity 
                  was reported by more than three-quarters of bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the supply side, almost all respondents report 
                  that credit standards did not change for any type of lending. 
                  Interest rates rose for residential and commercial mortgages, 
                  but did not change for other loan categories. Most bankers also 
                  indicate that average deposit rates remained constant. Finally, 
                  delinquency rates decreased noticeably for all categories of 
                  loans, with roughly five times as many bankers indicating an 
                  overall decrease as an increase.
