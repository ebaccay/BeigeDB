      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District continued its vigorous economic expansion, 
though with indications of moderation in some areas. The pace of 
retail sales was moderate. Both the manufacturing and service 
sectors experienced continued strong growth, although the 
restraining effect of the East Asian economic turmoil was evident in 
several sectors. The District banking and real estate sectors 
remained healthy overall, with the reports being more positive for 
California than for other parts of the District. Many respondents 
noted difficulties finding skilled and entry-level workers, and some 
reported larger wage increases than in the recent past.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Sentiment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Respondents remain optimistic regarding prospects for the national 
economy and their respective local economies. More than sixty 
percent of them expect national GDP to expand at its long-run trend 
and the current rates of unemployment and inflation to remain 
unchanged over the next year. Nearly three-quarters of the 
respondents expect more rapid growth in their regions than in the 
nation, although this percentage has declined during the last six 
months. Despite respondents' generally optimistic views, the 
percentage expecting deterioration in their region's foreign trade 
balance increased sharply, to nearly three-fourths, over the past 
six months.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail Trade and Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The pace of retail sales was moderate in recent weeks. A respondent 
from a large supermarket chain reported flat sales in Idaho, Nevada, 
and Utah. Sales were somewhat slow at department stores in Southern 
California and other areas, and several respondents noted weak 
demand and rising inventories for apparel. An automobile dealer in 
Utah reported that vehicle sales were weak during February.
        <p>
         Demand for most services, however, continued to expand very rapidly. 
Sales were particularly brisk for providers of telecommunications 
and cable television services. Respondents also noted rising demand 
for business and professional services up and down the West Coast. 
Deterioration in the trade balance with East Asia was reflected in 
reduced exports and increased imports through the ports of Los 
Angeles, Seattle, and Portland, with some decline in the total flow. 
Reports from Utah and Oregon indicated reduced tourist activity, and 
Hawaii's tourism sector has been hit hard by a drop in the number of 
visitors from East Asia. Southern California contacts reported that 
tourist business there has been affected somewhat by heavy rains but 
remains strong overall. Respondents in most areas noted ongoing 
shortages of information technology workers.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Production and employment expanded further among manufacturing 
establishments, particularly those producing durable goods. The 
strongest demand conditions were reported for aluminum, for which 
market prices have risen about 20 percent recently. Orders for some 
types of machine tools rose, though the extent of backlogs varied 
substantially across companies in this sector. Boeing expanded its 
aircraft production further. The company still faces order backlogs, 
although order delays by East Asian airlines have grown. Respondents 
in many areas- particularly the Pacific Northwest-reported that the 
East Asian economic turmoil reduced District sales of metals, 
lumber, pulp and paper, processed food, athletic shoes, and some 
high-tech products. Although production bottlenecks were limited 
overall, many respondents noted difficulties finding and retaining 
skilled computer and craft workers.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The usual seasonal lull in the agricultural sector was exacerbated 
by adverse weather conditions and reduced demand from East Asia. 
Persistent severe rainstorms caused early crop problems in 
California, although their impact on the complete growing cycle 
remains uncertain. Declining demand from East Asian customers has 
reduced sales of District resource and agricultural products, 
particularly those from the Pacific Northwest. For example, both 
Alaskan salmon exports and Washington apple exports were down 
substantially compared to last year, and District wheat exports and 
prices were low. District beef and pork exports to East Asia also 
were down substantially, although this was partially offset by 
increased sales to Mexico.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Real Estate and Construction
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Respondents reported enhanced real estate market and construction 
activity in California but reduced activity in some other areas. In 
California, construction activity and prices rose both in the 
residential and nonresidential sectors. In contrast, housing starts 
declined and expansion in nonresidential construction contracts 
reportedly slowed in Oregon. Housing starts also slowed in Utah, 
where most sales prices reportedly fell short of list prices. 
Nonetheless, the level of building activity in the District remained 
high, and respondents noted shortages of skilled construction 
workers in many areas, particularly Oregon, Nevada, and Utah.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Financial Institutions
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Conditions at District banks were healthy overall, although industry 
trends appear to be more positive in California than elsewhere in 
the District. Loan activity remained high in most areas. Several 
respondents from the Pacific Northwest noted erosion of credit 
quality and use of less stringent underwriting standards. Loan 
demand and availability reportedly were high throughout California, 
with one respondent noting an easing of underwriting standards in 
the San Francisco Bay Area. Due to ongoing economic slack, two major 
Hawaiian banks announced large layoffs. Banks in most other areas 
reported hiring and retention problems, both for skilled categories 
such as loan officers and entry-level positions such as tellers.
