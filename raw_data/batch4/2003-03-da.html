      <p>
       From early January through mid-February, overall Eleventh District economic 

  activity exhibited signs of inertia. Manufacturing activity remained lackluster. 

  Service sector activity was mixed, with signs of a pickup in some industries 

  and severe financial problems in others. Retail sales remain weak, and there 

  is still little change in the financial services industry. Construction and 

  real estate markets continued to decline. Energy activity picked up only mildly, 

  despite a sharp increase in prices. Overall agricultural conditions were good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geopolitical uncertainties still dampen consumer and business confidence. High 

  energy prices also weigh heavily on the outlook for some industries. Hiring 

  is minimal, according to contacts who say investments are on hold until questions 

  surrounding the war are resolved. Contacts report that concerns about terrorism 

  seem to be distracting attention from normal business.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Oil prices climbed sharply in recent weeks, pushed up by continued global uncertainties 

  in Iraq and Venezuela, along with freezing cold weather in the midwestern and 

  northeastern United States. The prices of heating oil and gasoline have followed 

  crude oil upward. Gasoline prices at the pump reached the highest February level 

  on record. High gasoline prices are expected to persist into the summer; refiners 

  would normally be building inventories of gasoline now but currently do not 

  have the crude available to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cold weather and rising crude oil prices also pushed natural gas prices upward. 

  Several waves of bitter weather have pulled natural gas inventories down 20 

  percent below year-earlier levels, and raised concerns about their adequacy 

  to deal with a late winter blast of cold weather. Propane prices have risen 

  along with natural gas--reaching the highest level in 13 years. Higher energy 

  prices have pushed up chemical and plastic prices. Healthy demand for housing 

  is driving price increases for chlorine and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rising cost pressures--particularly from energy, shipping, and insurance--were 

  noted by most industries. A few firms were able to pass along price increases, 

  but international competition and overcapacity is making that difficult for 

  most manufacturers and retailers. Some contacts suggest that energy price increases 

  will be passed onto consumers if they persist. A few firms expressed concern 

  about how long they could operate if energy costs remain elevated.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity remained lackluster overall. While there were some signs 

  of pickup in the high-tech industry, demand for construction-related materials 

  is waning. Import competition is reducing sales for some manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for fabricated metals was flat in January and February, and producers 

  were guarded about the outlook for activity over the next year. Sales of primary 

  metals picked up in January but then fell in February. Producers say that sales 

  are slower than a year ago. Metals producers reported some increases in selling 

  prices, partially passing along rising costs for scrap metal and reinforcing 

  steel. Producers of stone, clay, and glass were surprised by better-than-expected 

  demand over the past two months, but expressed increased uncertainty about the 

  outlook. Paper and lumber producers report soft sales during the same period, 

  partly because of import competition. Paper producers expect little change in 

  sales growth because international competitors are absorbing market share, especially 

  China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for apparel products is up. Production of private label apparel is increasing, 

  according to contacts who say that selling prices continue to decline, even 

  as energy prices are pushing up production costs of petroleum based fabrics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The high-tech industry reported a slight pickup in sales since the last survey. 

  One source of moderate improvement has been increasing orders from businesses 

  for replacement hardware such as routers, computers, and monitors. One respondent 

  noted that this might be the beginning of a replacement cycle; businesses remain 

  conservative, but after so little spending in the past couple of years, feel 

  the need to replace old equipment. Consumers continue to buy video and computer 

  gaming systems and products, and there has been a pickup in demand for high-definition 

  TVs and flash memory. Inventories remain very low. There is still too much capacity 

  in the telecommunications industry, although there has been some pickup in demand 

  for mobile phones and other consumer products. Contacts say the recent FCC decision 

  has delayed a potential stimulus for capital investment in the industry, dampening 

  the outlook for telecommunication equipment firms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refinery utilization on the Gulf Coast, which was running at about 95 percent 

  in early December, fell to the mid-80 percent level as Venezuelan crude oil 

  shipments were disrupted. Utilization improved slowly in early February. There 

  have been sharp reductions in both crude and product inventories, with crude 

  inventories 25 percent below last year and near critical levels needed to maintain 

  normal operation of the refinery system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for petrochemicals has been generally weak over the past two months, 

  but is still up 5 percent to 6 percent above last year. One exception is PVC, 

  where demand has been very strong to supply the housing market and Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Some service firms report a pickup in activity while others fight for survival. 

  Temporary staffing firms reported a pickup in demand over the last two months. 

  Activity is strongest to supply administrative support, light industrial, and 

  some professional and technical areas. Salaries are down from the levels of 

  a year ago. Rail shipments are up over last year, with substantial increases 

  in the shipments of metallic ores and metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for legal services remains steady, particularly for litigation, bankruptcy, 

  labor, and regulatory work. Real estate and lending activity are still quiet, 

  but there are some signs of a pickup for transactional and venture capital activity. 

  Legal contacts say activity will remain flat to moderate until corporate confidence 

  improves. Demand for accounting and consulting activity remains solid, partly 

  because firms continue to benefit from the Anderson fallout. The Sarbanes-Oxley 

  bill is boosting demand for risk management and audit work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many small businesses are struggling, particularly those that supply the high-tech 

  industry, and contacts say there is a huge shake out going on. One company is 

  requiring cash up front for new business because they have depleted all reserves. 

  This firm said they are reinventing their company regularly to find new ways 

  to support their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The airline industry remains in a tailspin. Demand for air travel continues 

  to be extremely price sensitive, and already strapped carriers are having difficulty 

  passing higher fuel costs on to passengers. The snowstorm on the East Coast 

  added another financial blow. A significant drop in aircraft values has tightened 

  the availability of credit for airlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales continued to be weak. Although the District did not have the weather-related 

  disruptions that occurred in other parts of the country, retailers were still 

  generally disappointed with sales. Consumer confidence remains low, they say, 

  and retailers are being cautious about the outlook. Contacts said that retailers 

  are not increasing inventories and are looking for other cost-cutting measures 

  to keep as much cash--and as much flexibility--as possible moving forward. Auto 

  sales are down from a year ago. Dealers say that many potential buyers do not 

  have good credit and others are waiting to buy due to geopolitical and economic 

  uncertainty. Large rebates and low interest rate offers seem to be having less 

  of an impact than they once did.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall lending activity continues to be stable. Real estate lending remains 

  the strongest category, mostly for refinancing. Auto lending has dropped off 

  since January. A few contacts reported that the quality of new loan applications 

  has declined a bit, and there were some indications of tighter credit standards 

  in the C&amp;I; area. Deposit growth remains strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Construction and real estate conditions continued to decline. Commercial markets 

  are weak. Building acquisitions continue, but leasing activity is very soft, 

  and rents are falling. Office landlords are offering numerous incentives to 

  keep tenants and to get them to take more space. Vacancies are rising, and one 

  contact noted that owners are obtaining reappraisals when vacancies occur, reducing 

  their tax liability. Single family activity remains soft, with numerous foreclosures, 

  particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Although activity is still moderately 

  strong in the market's low end, several contacts mentioned a lack of "urgency" 

  among buyers. Builders report an increase in incentives and downward pressure 

  on home prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The domestic rig count moved over 900 for the first time since late 2001, which 

  contacts say is a nice increase but not a discernable trend. The energy industry 

  is not responding to much stronger prices because they view the increases as 

  temporary and lack the trained workers to respond right away. The additional 

  domestic projects are not very complex--oil-directed, vertical wells and on-shore. 

  Oil service and equipment companies report that these simple drilling projects 

  have not yet resulted in a perceptible increase in orders. The pickup in domestic 

  activity is not offsetting a decline in international drilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Regular precipitation across the District has helped conditions overall. The 

  livestock market conditions remain favorable. Grain prices are still low, and 

  cattle prices are up 37 percent from last fall. Texas reported record cotton 

  yields for 2002, up 10 percent over 2001. Rice production continues to decline, 

  however, and contacts say "even the most efficient" dairies are doing poorly.
