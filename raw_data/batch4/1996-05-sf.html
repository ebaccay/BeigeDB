      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from 12th District survey respondents indicate a healthy 
pace of economic activity throughout most sectors and areas in the 
District. Retail sales reportedly have firmed slightly since earlier 
in the year, and services continue to expand at a brisk pace. 
Manufacturing activity appears mostly solid. The District banking 
and real estate markets are very active, although the real estate 
sector in Los Angeles has not fully recovered from its lengthy 
slump. Price and wage increases continue to be moderate overall, 
with the notable exception of gasoline prices in California. 
However, respondents expect higher national inflation in the near 
term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District respondents remain very optimistic regarding their 
respective regional economies, and their expectations regarding 
national economic growth improved markedly since the last survey. 
Among respondents, 70-80 percent see stable or improved prospects 
for national GDP growth and unemployment, up from 40-50 percent 
earlier this year. However, their outlook on national inflation 
deteriorated; nearly 50 percent expect higher inflation in the near 
term, up from 15-20 percent earlier this year. Approximately 80 
percent of District respondents expect more rapid growth in their 
region than in the U.S. as a whole, with large majorities expecting 
stable or improved business investment, housing starts, consumer 
spending, and trade balances in their respective regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales are mostly stable in the District, and services 
continue to expand rapidly. Sales of clothing and other consumer 
goods improved somewhat relative to their pace earlier in the year, 
and inventories have been reduced for many retail goods. Grocery 
prices currently are stable but may soon increase due to continued 
high grain prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among services, demand for communications services continues to rise 
rapidly; this includes both telephone and computer communication. 
Transportation demand also is robust. Both volume and prices are 
increasing on flights to and from Portland, and shipping port 
expansion is planned there. Shipping activity also is vigorous in 
Southern California, although a recent sharp rise in gasoline prices 
is affecting the costs of land transportation in the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity is solid overall, although with 
variability across sectors and states. In Nevada and Utah, 
respondents noted strong demand for heavy equipment and machine 
tools; order backlogs for the latter have persisted despite 
accelerating shipments. A Southern California manufacturer reports 
rising prices and reduced inventories for aluminum ingots, and 
substantial delivery lags on new trucks were reported in Oregon. In 
contrast, declining truck demand is prompting consolidation by a 
major truck manufacturer in Washington, and aluminum producers are 
operating well below capacity in that state. Also in the Pacific 
Northwest, prices for wood pulp and paper products have stabilized 
after substantial declines earlier in 1996, but slowed growth and 
reduced investment spending were reported for Oregon's food 
processing industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the District's key high-tech electronics sector, respondents 
noted that growth has decelerated in recent months, and prices of 
semiconductors (particularly computer memory chips) remain at low 
levels. However, inventories of semiconductors and personal 
computers are coming down at rates characterized as "acceptable," 
and substantial expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity is 
planned in the Portland area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports regarding western agricultural production are mixed, but 
respondents note that it is too early in the growing season to 
assess overall prospects for 1996. Demand is strong and prices are 
high for several crops, notably wheat and corn. Continuing high feed 
prices and drought conditions in the Southwest are leading cattle 
ranchers to ship large quantities of beef to market earlier than 
preferred. Production of tree fruit and grape crops in Central 
California are down from normal; although better than last year, 
farm earnings are somewhat low there, which reportedly is limiting 
investment and expansion plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate sales and construction activity remain strong in most of 
the District. Brisk home construction activity and sales along with 
significant price increases over last year were reported for 
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah. Commercial construction 
and sales also are strong in those states. In contrast, the 
commercial real estate market in Los Angeles remains soft, with high 
vacancies and limited new construction. Conditions appear slightly 
improved for residential real estate in the Los Angeles area; 
although sales are limited, prices are no longer declining. 
Elsewhere in the state, residential and commercial real estate 
markets are very tight in the San Francisco Bay Area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banks report good earnings and loan quality in 1996. The 
one exception is Southern California, where consumer loan demand is 
still sluggish and real estate loan delinquencies are up, despite 
some signs of improved credit quality overall. Loan demand is very 
strong in most other areas of the District, although intense 
competition is holding margins down in fast-growth states. District 
banks continue to invest in computer equipment and other hardware at 
rapid rates, largely to facilitate increased reliance on electronic 
banking.
