      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms in the major business sectors of the Third District gave 
varied reports on activity for July. Most of the manufacturers 
surveyed noted increases in shipments and orders; however, producers 
of building products and industrial equipment were experiencing 
slower business. Most of the retailers contacted said sales were 
healthy but the year-over-year gains in June and July were below 
those achieved in the early spring; some merchants even noted slight 
declines. Auto dealers generally said sales have been steady. Most 
of the bankers polled for this report 3said loan volumes outstanding 
were flat, and they continued to describe competition for commercial 
lending as strong. Some also said that, while consumer loans 
remained level, delinquencies were on the rise. Recent comments from 
employment agencies in the Philadelphia area indicated that demand 
for clerical workers remained healthy and that there has been some 
increase in the demand for manufacturing workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued to expand in 
July, according to reports from area firms. Half of those polled 
indicated they had stepped up shipments since June while only one in 
ten noted declines. Half of the manufacturers contacted also 
reported increases in new orders, and only one in five said orders 
had slipped from the prior month. The improvement in business was 
reported from nearly all the major industrial sectors in the region; 
however, manufacturers of building products and industrial equipment 
said that an increase in interest rates earlier this spring 
adversely affected demand for their products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area manufacturers extended working hours slightly and hired more 
workers in July, and they are planning some further increases in 
staffing levels during the second half of the year. While the 
balance of opinion among area manufacturers is that business will 
continue to improve during the third and fourth quarters, several 
noted that both domestic and foreign competition appears to be 
keeping prices in check.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers contacted in late July gave mixed reports. 
While most said sales were continuing at a healthy rate, many noted 
that year-over-year gains in June and July were below the gains in 
earlier months, and several merchants indicated that their sales 
were just even with or slightly below the levels of a year ago. In 
particular, apparel sales appeared to be slowing and growth in 
housewares and electronics sales was easing. Discount stores, which 
sell more hard goods, were achieving better results than department 
stores, which are largely dependent on clothing sales. Despite the 
apparent slowing of sales, most of the retailers surveyed for this 
report did not indicate that inventories were excessive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers reported that sales were running at a steady pace, 
modestly above the rate for last summer. Light truck sales were up 
more than car sales on a year-over-year basis. Most dealers expect 
sales to continue at the current rate, although some are 
apprehensive that growing consumer debt burdens could lead to a 
downturn later in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District bankers contacted for this report said 
total loan volumes outstanding at their banks had been level in 
recent weeks. They continued to describe competition for new 
commercial loans as strong and net interest margins as tight. 
Bankers also said consumer lending was flat, and they generally do 
not expect this category of credit to increase in the near term. 
Some bankers said they expect a combination of slower consumer 
spending and more restrictive credit standards to limit or reduce 
consumer lending in the second half. Some also expect the rate of 
consumer loan delinquencies to rise further this year until tighter 
credit standards become more prevalent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment agencies and personnel contracting firms in the 
Philadelphia area reported continued demand for clerical and data-
entry workers from banks, law firms, and television-shopping 
companies. Recently, employment agencies have also seen increased 
demand for temporary workers from manufacturers. Additionally, 
business at employment contractors has increased as a result of the 
outsourcing of certain business functions by major firms in the 
region.
     </p>
     <p>
      In several instances, according to both temporary employment 
agencies and contractors, the back-office staffs that these firms 
eliminated have become employees of the agencies and contractors 
supplying services to these firms, but many of the former employees 
have taken some reductions in pay and benefits.
