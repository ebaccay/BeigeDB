      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      As the summer has progressed, the Ninth District continues to 
experience favorable economic conditions in most sectors. All types 
of construction are strong. Crop conditions are good, though delayed 
development may expose corn and soybeans to frost damage. Farmers 
are responding to high grain prices and favorable crop expectations 
by increasing capital spending. Oil, gas, iron and nonferrous mining 
output continues strong. Manufacturing is generally robust, and 
inventories are described as normal. Vehicle sales continue moderate 
to strong, while other retailers report good sales. Tourism is 
somewhat slow, especially in western areas. Despite some indications 
of wage pressure, most compensation increases appear modest. 
Commodity prices have fallen, and intermediate and final goods 
prices are largely stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Phone company unable to keep up with growth" headed a recent 
newspaper report on Sioux Falls, S.D., where the telephone company 
has been issuing cellular phones to homeowners in some new 
developments because it is falling behind laying cable to newly 
constructed houses. The pace of building is somewhat less fervid 
elsewhere.
     </p>
     <p>
      All types of construction are brisk. Single-family permits in 
Minnesota are running 4 percent above year-earlier and two year-
earlier levels. Housing construction is also brisk in west central 
Wisconsin, eastern North Dakota and some Montana cities. A very low 
4.3 percent vacancy rate for industrial property in Minneapolis-St. 
Paul has boosted light industrial building. And publicly let bids 
for highway and heavy construction in Minnesota and the Dakotas are 
13 percent above 1995 for the year through July, the fourth 
consecutive year of strong increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      "July and August have been very good for us," comments an officer of 
a large Minnesota realty company. Strong sales of existing housing 
are making headlines in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and reportedly are 
also strong in the Eau Claire, Wis., area. Commercial rentals in the 
same area also are described as good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There is little change in the natural resource sector from earlier 
in the summer. North Dakota oil continues as the boom sector, and 
iron mine output is the highest in several years. Nonferrous output 
is reportedly stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumber and oriented-strand board production is somewhat above summer 
1995 levels. Paper prices have stabilized and sales of some types 
are reportedly good. Overall output, however, remains down from a 
year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and technology
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "It has slowed a little in August, but overall we are having a very 
good year," commented a representative of one Minnesota electronics 
manufacturer. "First and second quarters were below plan and below 
last year," says a North Dakota CEO, "but halfway through third 
quarter, we are doing very well and I expect fourth quarter to be 
well above plan also." Manufacturing continues to be a sector that 
is generally solid, but not spectacular. Medical device and 
nonconsumer electronics manufacturers remain the strongest. 
Manufacturers contacted report no delays in raw material deliveries 
and describe their own inventories as normal
     </p>
     .
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crops across the Ninth District continue in good shape, but behind 
usual levels in development and maturation. Corn and soybeans, in 
particular, will be vulnerable to early frosts. Wheat harvesting is 
under way in several areas, but behind normal levels. Cash prices 
and futures for the 1996 crop have retreated from highs set in late 
spring, but continue at levels that will ensure the highest net 
returns so far this decade, barring disastrous frost.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cattle and hog slaughter prices are slightly higher than in early 
summer, with cattle slaughter numbers somewhat ahead of year-ago 
levels. Market sources report that cows as a percentage of total 
slaughter is about 4 percentage points higher than last year, an 
indication that herd liquidations are taking place. Hog slaughter 
numbers, weights and percent sows show little change from summer 
1995 levels. Milk prices are at new nominal highs, and some 20 
percent above year-earlier levels. Production continues down and 
industry officials expect it to remain low in response to high feed 
costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm spending is reportedly on the increase in many crop areas, 
particularly for machinery. "It's been an exceptional year," says a 
Grand Forks, N. D., implement dealer. Overall, dealers in that state 
are having the strongest sales in five years and their counterparts 
in Minnesota and eastern South Dakota also report brisk business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "July was a little slow, but for the year to date, we are about 3 
percent ahead of 1995," comments a South Dakota automobile 
registrations official. "Business is pretty good," says an auto 
dealers' association official in North Dakota, where favorable 
conditions in oil and grain sectors have boosted incomes and 
confidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Retail sales seem to be a little bit above our projections," 
reports a South Dakota revenue official. "Traffic in our stores is 
excellent," according to a Fargo, N.D., mall manager. On balance, 
retail sales seem moderate to strong, with consumers reportedly very 
selective and value-oriented in their purchases. Retailers complain 
that stiff competition stemming from recent growth in retail 
capacity is cutting into margins. "We have to advertise much more 
than two years ago to keep same-store sales marginally above what we 
were selling then," says a spokesperson of one Minnesota-based 
electronics and appliance retailer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Though it started out slow, the rest of the summer has been real 
good," remarked one western Wisconsin tourism representative. "Still 
a little slow," is the report from a counterpart in South Dakota. 
Business is slowest in Montana, where sources report drops of 5 
percent to 20 percent at major attractions. On balance, 1996 seems 
to be a weak, but not disastrous year for the tourism industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There has been little change in labor markets from earlier in the 
summer. Unemployment rates remain well below national levels in most 
areas. Posted offers of entry-level jobs in food service and retail 
sales are widespread. Skilled electronics technicians, CAD/CAM 
machinists, printers and other skilled workers are also highly 
sought after. Several sources report upward pressure on entry-level 
wages. Hourly earnings in manufacturing in Minneapolis-St. Paul are 
about 3.3 percent above year-earlier rates compared to a 1.9 percent 
increase from 1994 to 1995. But other employers report only modest 
increases in pay and benefits. Many commodity prices are lower than 
earlier in the year. Few prices increases are reported for either 
intermediate or final goods, except milk.
