      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Inflation indicators from the District reports were varied and 
generally inconclusive, although there appears to be greater upward 
pressure on wages than on prices. Business activity in most 
Districts is reported to be generally good and expanding moderately.
      <strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </strong>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of substantial price increases were notably absent from many 
  District summaries. Several Districts indicated that consumer prices 
  are either stable or rising only slightly (Boston, New York, 
  Cleveland, and Kansas City). Price increases were cited for a wide 
  variety of industrial commodities, but these appear to be confined 
  to a small set of markets, such as lumber (Boston, Richmond, 
  Chicago, and Dallas), steel (Cleveland and Chicago), and various 
  agricultural commodities including grains and dairy products. 
  Several Districts also noted price declines in a few areas, 
  especially memory chips (Boston and Dallas).Wage gains have tended to outstrip price increases, however. The 
  Richmond District sees "widespread" upward pressure on wages, and 
  rising labor costs were also noted in the San Francisco District. 
  The Boston District's wage and salary increases are in the 2% to 4% 
  range. In Cleveland, wage growth is reportedly 2% to 3%, although 
"the cost of new hires is accelerating." This is consistent with the 
  Minneapolis report, in which several sources observed "upward 
  pressure on entry-level wages." The Chicago District notes that 
  small retailers in Michigan were "raising their starting wages to 
  attract qualified workers," but most contacts reported no 
  discernible acceleration in wages. In the remaining regions, upward 
  wage pressures were characterized as either "subdued" (as in the New 
  York and Chicago Districts), or "scattered" (Atlanta, Kansas City, 
  and Dallas).None of the Districts indicated inflationary pressures are subsiding 
  and at least one report noted that price increases are expected to 
  intensify. According to the San Francisco District, although about 
  55% of respondents see inflation remaining constant over the next 12 
  months, "nearly 40% expect [inflation] to accelerate."
      <strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </strong>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many District reports indicated pockets of labor market tightness, 
    and in a few regions, this tightness appears to be broadly based. In 
    the Richmond District, tight labor markets are "widespread," labor 
    markets "remained tight in much of the [Kansas City] District," the 
    Chicago District's labor markets are "tighter than the nation as a 
    whole," and tight labor markets "continue to be a concern for most 
    contacts" in the St. Louis District. Elsewhere, "some reports of 
    labor shortages" were noted in the San Francisco District, and a 
    number of District summaries contained scattered indications of 
    labor shortages in entry-level positions, retailing, and some 
    skilled occupations. Low unemployment rates were noted in the 
    Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, the District reports reveal a moderately expanding economy, 
      with only a few exceptions: Growth in the San Francisco District is 
      characterized as "strong," and the St. Louis region has "continued 
      to moderate slightly."
      <strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most Districts, industrial activity is either expanding or 
      holding steady at a high level. Richmond reports "substantially 
      faster" manufacturing growth. Although a moderation in industrial 
      production growth is seen in the Cleveland and Kansas City 
      Districts, both report continued high levels of production. Orders 
      growth is indicated by many Districts (Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
      Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas). Notable exceptions include continued 
      cutbacks or closings in apparel and textiles (Atlanta and St. Louis) 
      and drop-offs in heavy truck production (Cleveland and San 
      Francisco). Only a few constraints on industrial capacity are 
      reported, and capacity increases are occurring in the Boston and 
      Atlanta Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The back-to-school shopping season got off to a good start, and 
        several Districts indicated that sales are meeting--or exceeding--
        expectations. A good number of Districts reported strong apparel 
        sales (Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City), 
        although these vary by type and outlet. Household appliances and 
        other "big-ticket" items are a noted weakness in two reports 
        (Cleveland and Chicago).Overall, inventories are considered "in line with sales," and the 
        Boston District reported that some retailers are "cautiously 
        building inventories." While auto sales are generally described as 
        flat or declining slightly, thin car stocks are seen as a 
        contributing factor (Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Building activity remains strong in most parts of the country. The 
          Chicago District reports "robust" construction, Minneapolis sees all 
          types of construction as "brisk," and Kansas City indicates "solid" 
          home building activity. The San Francisco District reports "tight" residential and commercial real estate markets in most areas, and 
          office vacancy rates are low in parts of the New York, Philadelphia, 
          Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. Construction and sales vary more 
          for residential properties than for commercial ones. Boston reports 
          the residential real estate market to be in good shape across much 
          of New England. Residential real estate has improved in the New York 
          District, and inventory problems are noted in downstate New York and 
          Massachusetts. However, softer residential markets are reported in 
          the Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas regions.
      <strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Banking and Financial Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to be holding steady at a generally high level. 
          Exceptions to this trend include the Richmond District, where 
          overall lending has slowed slightly, the Atlanta District, where 
          demand is "moderate," and the St. Louis District, which saw slight 
          declines in total loans between mid-June and mid-August. Borrowing 
          activity is mixed by category. Several Districts indicate a 
          moderation in commercial lending (New York, Richmond, and St. 
          Louis), but some also see relatively strong commercial lending 
          growth (Chicago and San Francisco). Consumer borrowing reports are 
          equally varied. While some deterioration in credit quality and 
          increases in delinquency rates were noted, no concerns about overall 
          debt quality were expressed.
      <strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Seasonal Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions vary widely by District, but most regions 
          report better crop conditions today than earlier in the summer. 
          Still, a delayed planting season has resulted in underdeveloped 
          crops in many areas, and there is concern that crops could be 
          threatened in the event of an early frost (Chicago and Minneapolis). 
          The Richmond and Kansas City Districts report very good corn and 
          soybean crops. High feed costs are contributing to livestock 
          liquidations, and milk production is down substantially from last 
          year (Chicago and Minneapolis).
     </p>
     <p>
      Districts with a significant tourist trade reported mixed results 
for the summer season. "Ticket revenues for the Olympics, overall, 
exceeded projections," according to Atlanta. That District also 
notes that while tourism in central Florida remains strong, its 
other, non-Olympic venues have been disappointing. In New York, 
hotel occupancy rates are near record highs, and the San Francisco 
District indicates strong hotel occupancy and other tourism trade in 
several states. The Richmond region had "below average" tourism 
revenues in the Atlantic coastal areas, and a "weak, but not 
disastrous year" for tourism was reported in the Minneapolis 
District.
