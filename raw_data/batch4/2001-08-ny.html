      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 8, 2001
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's economy has been generally sluggish since the 
            last report, with the notable exception of housing. Overall business 
            costs remain subdued, aside from sharp increases in utility and medical 
            costs, and prices of final goods and services appear to have decelerated. 
            Labor markets have eased, especially in manufacturing and financial 
            services; however, hiring activity remains fairly brisk in a number 
            of other service industries. Retail business remained soft in June 
            and July, with general merchandise chains reporting year-over-year 
            declines in comparable-store sales. A number of contacts say they 
            are making a concerted effort to reduce inventories. Retail prices 
            are said to be down slightly.
      <p>
       Housing markets throughout the District continue to 
            show considerable strength, with second-quarter selling prices in 
            most areas running well ahead of a year ago. In contrast, commercial 
            real estate markets slackened substantially in the second quarter 
            -- particularly in New York City, where availability rates have risen 
            sharply and asking rents have fallen. Similarly, Manhattan's hotel 
            occupancy rate fell to a six-year low in the second quarter, while 
            room rates registered their steepest decline in nearly ten years. 
            Finally, bankers report an increase in consumer delinquency rates, 
            steady loan demand, and some tightening in credit standards, except 
            on home mortgages.
       <p>
        <b>
         Consumer Spending
        </b>
        <br/>
        General merchandise retailers indicate that sales were below plan 
            in both June and July, and that same-store sales were generally lower 
            than a year earlier; however, within the group, discounters tended 
            to fare somewhat better. Apparel sales were mixed but generally weak, 
            with women's apparel a bit stronger than other categories. One large 
            discount chain notes that more customers seemed to be opting for private-label 
            and lowest-priced merchandise lines. Both furniture and soft-goods 
            for the home were described as particularly sluggish. A major home-improvement 
            retailer notes some improvement in the tone of business in June and 
            July -- with particular strength in sales of energy-efficient products 
            -- though sales were still described as anemic. Another contact noted 
            a weather-related pickup in sales of air-conditioners and lawn and 
            garden merchandise.
        <p>
         One large retail chain reports a moderate but noticeable 
            pickup in sales from customers who have received their tax rebate, 
            based on a preliminary survey of shoppers. However, most retail contacts 
            expect the current round of tax rebates to have only a modest effect 
            on sales.
         <p>
          While a few contacts report that inventories are a 
            little high, most describe current levels as satisfactory -- largely 
            due to steep markdowns. A number of retailers indicate a concerted 
            effort to reduce inventories in response to diminished sales expectations, 
            and most major chains are scaling back orders for the upcoming back-to-school 
            and Christmas seasons. Both prices and merchandise costs were reported 
            to be flat to down modestly, led by declines in apparel prices. A 
            number of retailers say they are encountering rising costs of labor 
            (especially medical insurance) and utilities.
          <p>
           <b>
            Construction and Real Estate
           </b>
           <br/>
           Housing markets across the District continue to show vigor, though 
            residential construction activity slowed somewhat in the second quarter. 
            Multi-family housing permits fell substantially in June on a seasonally 
            adjusted basis; for the second quarter overall multi-family permits 
            fell by about a third from first-quarter levels and were more than 
            20 percent lower than a year ago. Most of the decline reflects a return 
            to more normal levels of activity in New York City, following two 
            boom years. Single-family housing permits also declined in June, and 
            were down 5 percent in the quarter -- compared with both the first 
            quarter and a year earlier. A homebuilder in upstate New York indicates 
            that business has been strong and that it is increasing production. 
            In contrast, homebuilders in northern New Jersey also say that demand 
            remains strong but that construction activity is being limited by 
            high costs and a shortage of available land.
           <p>
            The market for existing homes has continued to be quite 
            firm since the last report. According to separate reports from a leading 
            New York City appraisal firm and a local real estate board, prices 
            of prime Manhattan co-ops and condos continued to edge up in the second 
            quarter. Compared with a year earlier, selling prices were up considerably, 
            although the number of transactions was down sharply. The market may 
            have strengthened as the quarter went on, as a major Manhattan real 
            estate firm reports that they sold more apartments in May and June 
            than a year earlier, following sluggish activity in April; they also 
            note that prices remained well above a year ago.
            <p>
             Single-family home sales across New York State were 
            mixed but generally strong in the second quarter. The Albany and Buffalo 
            areas, New York City and Long Island showed particular strength, with 
            both unit sales and selling prices up substantially from a year earlier. 
            In contrast, in the Rochester area, both unit sales and average selling 
            prices were down from a year ago. There were signs of cooling in high-priced 
            Westchester County -- unit sales were down sharply and price appreciation 
            slowed from last year's double-digit rate. More generally, across 
            the District, Realtors indicate that while the high end of the housing 
            market has shown some softening, the market for starter homes is particularly 
            strong.
             <p>
              In sharp contrast with the residential sector, commercial 
            real estate markets softened further in the second quarter. Manhattan's 
            office market has slackened substantially: availability rates jumped 
            by nearly two percentage points in the last three months and asking 
            rents declined at a nearly 10 percent annual rate. The most dramatic 
            weakening has occurred in the Midtown South area, where strong leasing 
            demand from dot-coms had driven up prices in recent years.
              <p>
               Office markets in adjacent suburban areas have converged 
            over the past year, with the slackest areas strengthening and the 
            tightest areas weakening. For example, Westchester County's office 
            vacancy rate fell from 15 percent in mid-2000 to 12 percent at the 
            end of June. Over the same period, neighboring Fairfield County's 
            rate jumped from 7 percent to 12 percent. In Long Island and northern 
            New Jersey, vacancy rates have risen by about 2 percentage points 
            over the past year, while asking rents were flat to up moderately. 
            In northern New Jersey, a substantial volume of office space is expected 
            to come onto the market in the year ahead, reflecting downsizing in 
            the telecommunications industry.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Other Business Activity
                </b>
                <br/>
                A major New York City employment agency says that the local job market 
            for mid-level office workers is still fairly strong; however, there 
            is less of a sense of urgency to hire than earlier this year and salaries, 
            which had been rising at a double-digit rate, have leveled off. This 
            contact also reports that financial services firms have scaled back 
            recruiting substantially, but that hiring remains fairly brisk at 
            a variety of other service industry firms -- especially law firms.
                <p>
                 Manhattan's hotel occupancy rate (seasonally-adjusted), 
            fell to a six-year low of 80 percent in the second quarter, down from 
            84 percent in the first quarter and 89 percent a year ago. The average 
            room rate was little changed on a quarterly basis but has fallen by 
            about 5 percent over the past year. Although both occupancy rates 
            and room rates are still considered to be at high levels, the declines 
            over the past year are the steepest since 1991.
                 <p>
                  A number of New York State manufacturers indicate that 
            weak export demand and increased import competition (mainly from Asia) 
            are hurting overall sales. In addition, some firms are being hurt 
            by a falloff in demand from customers in the telecommunications, high-tech, 
            and steel industries.
                  <p>
                   <b>

                   </b>
                   <br/>
                   Loan demand was little changed since the last report, according to 
            the latest survey of Second District banks. Demand for refinancing 
            also leveled off, following widespread increases in the past few surveys. 
            On the supply side, bankers continued to report tightening standards 
            for all types of loans except residential mortgages. Both loan rates 
            and deposit rates continued to fall across all categories since the 
            last report. Delinquency rates increased noticeably on consumer loans 
            and moderately on nonresidential mortgages; however, there was a moderate 
            decline in delinquencies on home-mortgages.
