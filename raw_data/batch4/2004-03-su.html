       March 3, 2004
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continued to expand in January and February, 
              according to information received by Federal Reserve District Banks. 
              Growth was variously described as moderate in Boston, Philadelphia, 
              Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, firm in 
              Minneapolis, sound in San Francisco, and showing signs of accelerating 
              in New York, Richmond, and Dallas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending rose in most Districts. There were gains in sales 
              of general merchandise in January and February in all Districts 
              except St. Louis, which reported a slight decline. In contrast to 
              the general improvement in merchandise sales, motor vehicle sales 
              slowed in most Districts. Tourism activity increased compared to 
              last winter. Service sector activity has been expanding. Manufacturing 
              output continued to rise in all Districts except Cleveland, where 
              it has been steady. Real estate market conditions showed little 
              change: commercial markets generally remain soft and demand for 
              housing continues to be strong. Agricultural conditions were mixed: 
              demand for beef appears to be recovering from the effects of mad 
              cow disease but exports of poultry products have been curtailed 
              by the outbreak of avian influenza. Oil and gas production remain 
              at high levels and iron ore processing has increased. Bank lending 
              has been growing moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment has been growing slowly in most Federal Reserve Districts. 
              Wages and salaries have increased slightly, but employers report 
              substantial increases for employee health-care costs. Most Reserve 
              Banks reported level or modestly increasing retail prices, but information 
              received from manufacturers and other businesses indicates that 
              commodity prices have moved up more noticeably. The largest increases 
              have been for steel and for lumber and other building materials. 
              Shipping charges have also risen recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales of general merchandise rose in most Federal Reserve 
              Districts in January and February. Strong or strengthening sales 
              were reported in New York, Richmond, and Dallas. Sales growth was 
              moderate in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, 
              and San Francisco. Retailers in Cleveland said sales met or exceeded 
              their expectations. Retail sales in Atlanta moderated slightly in 
              February but remained above the level set in February last year. 
              St. Louis retailers said sales declined slightly relative to a year 
              ago. Spring apparel was said to be selling well in New York, Philadelphia, 
              Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Sales 
              of electronics, appliances, and home furnishings were relatively 
              strong in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City. 
              Jewelry was selling well in Atlanta and St. Louis. Reports on retailers' 
              inventories across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated that 
              store stocks were mostly in line with sales. Stores were still receiving 
              spring merchandise, but retailers were generally maintaining conservative 
              inventory plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly all Districts reported that auto sales slowed during January 
              and February and compared to a year ago. The exceptions were Boston, 
              where sales picked up in February after falling in January, and 
              Philadelphia, where sales were about steady. Auto dealers in several 
              Districts attributed the falloff in sales to cold or stormy weather 
              that kept shoppers off the lots. With the slowdown in sales, dealers' 
              inventories increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity has improved. Bountiful snowfalls in mountain 
              areas gave a boost to ski resorts, according to Richmond, Chicago, 
              Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Richmond and Atlanta 
              reported good business at beach resorts, and in New York and San 
              Francisco hotel occupancy increased compared to last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service industry activity moved up in the Districts reporting on 
              this sector. Boston and St. Louis noted increased demand for information 
              technology services. St. Louis also indicated that demand for insurance 
              and health-care services increased, but financial services and transportation 
              activity eased. In the Dallas District, accounting and consulting 
              firms were seeing increased activity compared with the final quarter 
              of last year. In San Francisco, demand has strengthened for media, 
              high-technology, and health-care services. In Richmond service sector 
              business was steady to somewhat improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transportation activity has increased in most parts of the country. 
              National freight companies based in Richmond indicated their business 
              has improved and trucking companies have seen increased activity 
              in Cleveland and Atlanta. Trucking was said to have slowed seasonally 
              in Dallas, but railroads in the Dallas District noted robust activity. 
              Trucking companies reported increased costs for fuel and they said 
              labor costs have increased as a result of recent regulations limiting 
              drivers' hours. Nonetheless, Chicago and Cleveland indicated that 
              sales of heavy trucks have increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity rose during January and February in 11 of 
              the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. The exception was Cleveland, where 
              factory production rates were said to be steady. There were notable 
              increases for electronic and electrical equipment in Philadelphia, 
              St. Louis, and Dallas, and semiconductors in Boston and San Francisco. 
              Cleveland and Chicago indicated that steel production had increased, 
              and Philadelphia and St. Louis indicated that output of metal products 
              had risen. Production of heavy trucks increased in Chicago, and 
              auto and auto parts production increased in Cleveland and St. Louis, 
              although the increase was said to be seasonal. Atlanta and Dallas 
              noted increased output of lumber, and Richmond and St. Louis reported 
              gains in furniture production. Other manufacturing industries in 
              which expanding activity was noted were biopharmaceuticals (Boston), 
              machine tools (Chicago), aerospace (St. Louis), and chemicals (Cleveland 
              and Chicago). In a few industries reports were mixed. Food processors 
              posted gains in Dallas but declines in St. Louis. Richmond District 
              textile producers were gaining business but there were textile plant 
              closings in the Atlanta District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate market conditions have shown little change 
              in most Districts. Continuing high vacancy rates, slowing leasing 
              activity, and downward pressures on rents were reported by Boston, 
              Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City. Conditions in 
              major commercial real estate markets were mixed in the St. Louis 
              and Minneapolis Districts. Despite the generally slack and unchanged 
              market situation in most parts of the country, a few Districts noted 
              some signs of improvement. In New York and San Francisco vacancies 
              have moved down slightly and rents have begun to recover. Leasing 
              activity has picked up in the Washington, DC area of the Richmond 
              District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate markets continued to be strong in the 
              majority of Districts. Although cold temperatures and winter storms 
              interrupted home building in some areas in January, housing demand 
              generally remained high. Recent gains in home sales and building 
              activity were noted in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, 
              and San Francisco. In Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas 
              City residential real estate activity continued at high levels. 
              In Richmond the housing market was said to have slowed recently, 
              but builders expect activity to pick up. Overall, builders and real 
              estate agents in most Districts expect home sales in 2004 to be 
              close to the 2003 sales record. Home price appreciation was characterized 
              as steady in most Districts with the exception of San Francisco 
              where the rate of increase was said to have slowed somewhat recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions have been mixed. Good citrus crops were 
              reported in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, although there was 
              some concern in Atlanta that world supplies might exceed demand 
              at current prices. Beef prices were still declining in Chicago and 
              St. Louis while San Francisco reported that they have firmed and 
              Dallas noted that prices and demand had not been affected as much 
              as expected. Chicago reported increased prices for corn, soybeans, 
              and milk. Dry weather in the Kansas City District has adversely 
              affected winter wheat and led some cattle producers to postpone 
              expanding their herds, and ice and snow in the Richmond District 
              has limited grazing there. The outbreak of avian influenza has curtailed 
              exports of poultry from the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis 
              Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Federal Reserve Districts reporting on the energy sector noted generally 
              strong, steady conditions in January and February. Drilling activity 
              has been fairly level in recent months in the Kansas City and Dallas 
              Districts, but Minneapolis noted a slight decrease in exploration 
              activity. San Francisco indicated that natural gas producers were 
              operating close to full capacity. Rising worldwide demand for steel 
              has stimulated increased iron ore production. Minneapolis reported 
              that iron ore producers in that District were operating at full 
              capacity and ore prices were rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most Federal Reserve Districts lending by commercial banks grew 
              moderately in January and February. Lending to business firms was 
              rising in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco. In 
              Chicago, lending to small businesses was on the rise while overall 
              business lending was described as flat. Commercial bankers in Richmond 
              and Atlanta said demand for business loans has been restrained as 
              firms are reluctant to increase capital spending. Demand for personal 
              loans, including credit cards, appeared to have eased in New York 
              and Philadelphia, remained steady in Dallas, and increased in Chicago. 
              Mortgage lending declined in Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco, 
              and increased slightly in Richmond and Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Changes in deposits have been mixed. Banks in the Atlanta District 
              have generally had steady growth, but growth has slowed in Cleveland 
              and Dallas where bankers think investors are moving money out of 
              bank deposits and into debt and equity market instruments. Banks 
              in the Kansas City District indicated that their deposit levels 
              have been steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Federal Reserve Districts reporting on employment generally noted 
              modest increases in January and February. Boston indicated that 
              temporary help agencies were placing more workers in manufacturing, 
              software development, and government. There has been increased demand 
              for temporary help workers in customer service and sales positions 
              in the Richmond District, in office and health-care jobs in the 
              Dallas District, and for a variety of jobs in the Chicago District. 
              Employment agencies in New York indicated that they have been experiencing 
              gradual increases in demand, and professional employment agencies 
              in the Washington, DC area of the Richmond District have boosted 
              their own staffs in response to increased business from their clients. 
              San Francisco District employers in the retail, construction, and 
              agricultural sectors have been increasing their hiring moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on wages indicated that increases continue to be moderate. 
              However, the rate of increase in benefit costs continues to exceed 
              that of wages. Medical insurance and workers' compensation insurance 
              fees remain on the rise in most Districts, although the rate of 
              increase does not appear to be accelerating.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Reserve Banks reported fairly stable or slowly rising retail 
              prices in January and February, but accelerating increases in some 
              industrial commodity prices. Steel prices have increased, and prices 
              of iron ore and scrap metals have risen as well. Prices of lumber 
              and other materials used in home building were on the rise in most 
              Districts. Energy prices, especially natural gas, remained high 
              in most Districts and Atlanta noted price increases for petrochemicals. 
              Cleveland noted rising rates for shipping by truck and Chicago reported 
              rising costs for overseas shipping, primarily due to increased costs 
              for ocean transport.
