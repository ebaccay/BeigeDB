      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 24, 2002
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic 
              activity in the District has picked up considerably. In particular, 
              many firms in the manufacturing sector have experienced increased 
              sales and orders and, as a result, are expanding production and 
              employment. Retail and auto sales have remained steady, while residential 
              real estate sales have been strong throughout the District. Although 
              commercial real estate markets continue to be weak, commercial construction 
              has been strong. Total loans outstanding at small- and medium-sized 
              banks have risen, as have deposits. Unfavorable weather has hampered 
              spring planting in the southern part of the District, although the 
              mild winter has led to a good-to-excellent winter wheat crop in 
              most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business 
                Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District manufacturing sector has been gaining strength. Contacts 
                report an increase in sales and orders, which has led many firms 
                to expand employment and hire back employees who previously had 
                been laid off. Manufacturers reporting increased orders include 
                those in the furniture, boats, airplanes, steel, food and drug, 
                apparel, and auto parts industries. Several contacts note that 
                some of the increase in activity stems from contracts with the 
                U.S. Defense Department for items including camouflage clothing 
                and military aircraft parts. While the manufacturing sector is 
                still seeing closings and bankruptcies, there has been more good 
                news than bad.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales held steady in the Eighth District. 
                A few contacts report that sales have been higher at discount 
                stores than at department stores and malls, although mall traffic 
                is noted to be relatively normal for this time of year. Auto sales 
                have been mixed, with reported sales levels ranging between good 
                and flat. Additionally, while some dealers report increased sales 
                of used vehicles, others report that it has been new vehicles 
                that have been selling well. Several dealers report that their 
                inventories of new vehicles are a little lower than usual as they 
                take a "wait and see" approach to ordering.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from each of the District's metropolitan areas indicate 
                that residential real estate sales have been strong since the 
                beginning of the year. Sales volumes in Memphis and Little Rock 
                were higher in January and February than a year earlier. Realtors 
                in several northern Mississippi markets report improved sales 
                are correcting the oversupply of homes in those markets. Sales 
                of new homes in Louisville are higher than normal for this time 
                of the year. Nonetheless, slow sales in homes valued over $250,000 
                reflects caution among District homebuyers. The Memphis market 
                for industrial space recorded lower absorption for 2001 than for 
                2000, leading to lower lease rates in 2002. The lease rate for 
                commercial space in Little Rock remains steady. Net absorption 
                and construction of office space in St. Louis continued to decline 
                in the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential and commercial construction has 
                been strong in the District, despite the slump in the markets 
                for office space. In all District metropolitan areas the number 
                of building permits issued in February was higher than that for 
                February 2001. Commercial construction in Arkansas has picked 
                up, with large projects concentrated in central and northwest 
                Arkansas. Public construction projects and work on dams have kept 
                commercial construction steady in western Kentucky. Commercial 
                contractors in Memphis expect a delay in new projects until they 
                see lower vacancy rates for industrial space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans outstanding at a sample of small- and medium-sized 
                District banks were up slightly by 0.5 percent between late January 
                and late March this year. Loans to individuals and to other commercial 
                banks in the country have decreased significantly: 7.4 percent 
                and 7.2 percent, respectively. Over the same period, the decrease 
                in real estate loans was a milder 2 percent, while commercial 
                and industrial loans increased by a relatively small 1.3 percent. 
                Some contacts attributed the slowing of loan growth to more-stringent 
                underwriting. Total deposits at these banks increased by 1.6 percent 
                during the period. Contacts in northeast Mississippi, west Tennessee, 
                and Arkansas report high levels of bankruptcy filings and foreclosures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The weather across the District included abnormally cool temperatures 
                and considerable rainfall in March and early April, leading many 
                farmers in the southern part of the District to fall behind modestly 
                in field preparation and planting. After a relatively mild winter, 
                the District's winter wheat crop is in good-to-excellent condition 
                in many areas. Exceptions to this are northern Mississippi and 
                Arkansas, where contacts report that heavy rains have damaged 
                some of the crop. One contact reports that as much as 10 percent 
                of Arkansas's crop will not be harvested due to flooding and that 
                another 15 percent of the crop was severely damaged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farmers in the northern portion of the 
                District expect to plant slightly more corn acreage this year, 
                which will be offset by slightly reduced soybean plantings. Mississippi 
                farmers, however, intend to increase soybean acreage. Contacts 
                report that the unresolved federal farm bill has led to uncertainty 
                about loan rates for soybeans. This may contribute to a decline 
                in planting intentions and affect producers' ability to obtain 
                financing. Cotton farmers in the southern portion of the District 
                expect to plant about 11 percent fewer acres this spring, substituting 
                corn and rice for cotton on some acreage. This follows the significant 
                drop in cotton and cottonseed meal prices. Partly as a result 
                of a Russian ban on U.S. poultry imports, the quantity of poultry 
                on the market increased over the last month and poultry prices 
                have declined modestly. Meanwhile, cattle prices have also declined 
                modestly, while hog prices have declined substantially.
