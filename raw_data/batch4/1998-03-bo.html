      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The First District economy continues to expand. Retail activity has 
picked up recently in many sectors. Manufacturers' results are 
mixed, with some contacts experiencing accelerating revenue growth 
and about half seeing no increase in sales or orders from a year 
ago. Many respondents report hiring difficulties, and contacts in 
the temporary employment industry say their revenues are
expanding at double-digit rates. Prices are said to be generally 
steady. Residential real estate markets are doing well.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most retail contacts report that sales are growing at a healthy 
pace, with the growth rate higher now than in the second half of 
1997. This unexpected strength in sales is not causing upward 
revisions of 1998 growth projections, already strong at 4 to 7 
percent. Faster-growing sectors are office and graphics supplies, 
tourism, consumer electronics, home furnishings, building materials, 
and health and beauty aids. Areas of weakness are hardware, 
automotive parts, and apparel.
       <p>
        Employment is said to be either increasing moderately or holding 
steady. Half the contacts report tightness in labor markets and 
corresponding difficulty finding, attracting, and retaining 
employees. Shortages are reportedly concentrated in high-skill 
areas; low-skill retail help is ample except in selected small 
geographic pockets. In most sectors, wage growth has picked up 
somewhat and is now running at a 4 to 6 percent annual rate. By 
contrast, in sectors growing only moderately, wages are said to be 
increasing only 2 to 3 percent.
        <p>
         With one exception, respondents say that prices are holding steady. 
The exception is tourism, where a continuing shortage of hotel rooms 
in the Boston area is causing room rates to rise. Vendor prices are 
also holding steady or, in some cases (lumber and fuel), declining 
dramatically. Profit margins are increasing slightly. Except for 
"aggressive expansion" in the tourism sector, contacts indicate they 
plan to expand capital budgets modestly in 1998.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          About one-half of First District manufacturing contacts report that 
recent business is up from a year ago, with strong and/or 
accelerating growth for aircraft and heavy truck parts, furniture, 
and equipment servicing. The remaining firms mostly report that 
overall sales or orders are steady from a year ago. Some exporters 
report sharp declines in Asian revenues, while others expect that a 
slowdown will become noticeable by mid-year. Several respondents 
express concern that the strong dollar is impeding export growth 
generally, even beyond Asia.
          <p>
           Manufacturers indicate that most materials costs are flat to down 
compared to a year ago. They cite reduced prices for copper and oil 
in particular, as well as greater bargains on components from Asia. 
Contacts mention that furniture materials costs are rising, however, 
along with travel costs. Selling prices are largely stable because 
of flat to declining supply prices, improved production 
efficiencies, competitive pressures, and retailer resistance. One 
maker of machine tools recently implemented a price increase, 
although another lamented that industry prices are far below normal 
levels because of intense global competition. Computer prices are 
falling sharply.
           <p>
            Employment trends vary widely among the manufacturers contacted, 
with roughly one-third implementing layoffs, one-third hiring at 
double-digit annual rates, and the remaining one-third somewhere in 
between. Almost all respondents report some hiring difficulties, 
usually for selected high-skill jobs. Most contacts indicate that 
average pay is rising 3 to 5 percent. Firms differ in the degree to 
which they are adjusting compensation packages to deal with labor 
shortages. In addition, one-half of those facing labor shortages are 
outsourcing more work and one-quarter report passing up some 
business opportunities.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Temporary Employment Firms
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Temporary employment firms in the First District continue to expand 
at a brisk pace. Labor markets are said to be extremely tight across 
all client industries and First District locations; wage growth for 
temps has reportedly risen to 15 percent annually. Demand continues 
to far outpace supply for more highly skilled workers, from computer 
programmers to clerical workers with knowledge of multiple software 
packages. Contacts foresee continued double-digit growth in revenues 
over the next year.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Residential Real Estate
              </strong>
              <br/>
              The residential real estate market in New England is strong. Most 
contacts report active markets and more sales than last year. 
Activity has risen most markedly in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
The number of sales increased also in Connecticut and Rhode Island, 
while the number of sales in Maine was stable until February, when 
it rose markedly. Increased activity has not generated price 
increases except in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where high 
demand and extremely low inventory levels have caused prices to rise 
4 to 9 percent from a year ago. Mild winter weather has allowed 
Massachusetts builders to work at full capacity during the past few 
months, and some spec construction is being undertaken. Contacts in 
other states report that it is still a "buyers' market,"
although the level of inventory is shrinking and price increases are 
expected later this year. Contacts are optimistic, however, and 
stated that unless interest rates go up, the market will remain 
strong for the next few months.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Nonbank Financial Institutions
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Nationwide cash flows into stock and bond mutual funds were 23 
percent higher in January 1998 than in December of 1997. Stock funds 
experienced moderate outflows which were more than offset by the 
doubling of inflows into bond funds. The largest inflows were into 
high yield bond funds, while international stock funds experienced 
their fourth consecutive month of outflows.
               <p>
                Respondents at investment management firms indicate that they have 
increased employment in recent months and plan to increase 
employment further, although these increases have been hampered by 
labor shortages. All respondents report significant difficulty 
hiring and retaining information technology personnel. Most contacts 
are implementing targeted wage increases and hiring bonuses for 
workers in short supply; many are also broadening their recruitment 
techniques.
