      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in the Ninth District continues to quicken in late 
spring. Construction is strong in virtually all parts of the 
district. Natural resource industries, except for paper, are robust. 
Vehicle sales reportedly have improved from earlier in the year and 
general merchandise retailers report satisfactory business. 
Agricultural producers are generally optimistic in spite of late 
planting caused by adverse weather. Similarly, tourism got off to a 
late start due to cold, wet weather, but business owners and state 
tourism officials anticipate a good season. Manufacturing continues 
mixed, but on balance shows some invigoration. Except for products 
derived from grains or petroleum, there are few reports of price 
increases. Difficulty in securing needed workers is the most common 
complaint voiced in regard to labor markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Home buyers find a lot to look at, housing prices up over 95's 
market" is a Sioux Falls, S.D., newspaper's characterization of 
residential real estate that could apply equally well to most other 
urban areas of the district. Construction is up from year-earlier 
levels and sales of new and existing homes are brisk in most areas. 
New permit applications in Sioux Falls for the four months through 
April were up some 75 percent from the same months in 1995. For the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area the increase was 25 percent in the 
same period. Sales of new and existing housing are also lively in 
western Montana, especially Missoula. A report from Bismarck, N. D., 
describes "commercial construction at a blistering pace." Contracts 
for large projects continue to run slightly ahead of 1995 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "More taconite, more jobs," was the headline of an article 
describing one firm's plans to reopen a processing plant at a 
Minnesota iron mine. Idled in 1980, the plant would add about 100 
jobs and 1.3 million tons of annual output. "All seven Iron Range 
taconite plants are turning out pellets at near record levels," the 
article continues. In a similar vein, oil and gas drilling in North 
Dakota and Montana continues well above 1995 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      In forest product industries, lumber mills and oriented-strand board 
plants are busy, but paper production continues down from a year ago 
and well below capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "The outlook is good if the crop materializes," reports one North 
Dakota banker responding to the Minneapolis Fed quarterly survey of 
agricultural credit conditions. That view is shared in all states of 
the district. Planting lagged two to four weeks behind long-term 
averages, but moisture conditions are generally favorable except in 
eastern North Dakota where many areas are too wet. While most crops 
were planted in time to allow maturation before fall frosts, some 
potential yield has been lost and weather conditions will need to be 
ideal for the crop to be much above average.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hog prices are higher than anticipated, shielding producers somewhat 
from the effects of sharply higher feed costs. Conditions for beef 
producers remain grim, and bankers report that they expect the 
number of ranch liquidations to rise perceptibly this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Interest rates on farm loans rose slightly in the second quarter, 
and bankers' expectations of loan repayment, farm income and capital 
spending continue to improve in most areas except where cattle 
ranching predominates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Business is quite good, especially on exports," says a purchasing 
manager at a large Minneapolis food processor. "I'd say things are a 
little slow," reports the CEO of one N. D., manufacturing firm, "but 
we expect it to pick up pretty soon." Such comments illustrate the 
mixed conditions faced by Ninth District manufacturers. None report 
delays in receiving raw materials or any other evidence of rapid 
growth in their sector. Inventories are generally reported as 
normal. Reports for publicly traded manufacturers generally show 
good sales and earnings growth over year-earlier levels, 
particularly for food processors and farm and construction machinery 
manufacturers. On balance, indications of growth appear to 
predominate, and those firms reporting slow sales now expect some 
improvement in the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "First quarter retail sales tax is coming in a bit above projections 
and about 4 percent above last year," reports a North Dakota state 
tax official. That seems typical of retail sales in many areas not 
booming but up from a year ago and strengthening. Mall managers and 
regional retailers report good business, though few use superlatives 
in their descriptions. Auto sales are reportedly "stable" in 
Montana, "pretty good" in Minnesota, and "still good" in South 
Dakota. New vehicle registrations in these states are slightly ahead 
of 1995 levels for the year to date, with most of the improvement in 
April and May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Tourist season off to damp start," headlined a description of slow 
business for South Dakota tourism firms as snow fell at Mt. Rushmore 
on the Memorial Day weekend. But in spite of a slow start, some are 
optimistic. "We're looking for our best year ever, our reservations 
are up about 20 percent above last year," said one park manager. The 
situation seems very similar in the rest of district states, a late 
start due to cold, wet weather, but optimism about the coming 
season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Perhaps we should call them 'discouraged employers,"' said a 
Minnesota state official describing the growing phenomenon of firms 
that want to hire additional skilled workers, but stop advertising 
because no candidates are forthcoming. Printers and computer-aided 
design and manufacturing technicians were cited as in especially 
short supply. One Minnesota firm offered a drawing for a free Las 
Vegas vacation to employees who brought in a new hire. A Minnesota 
economic development official said that labor availability has 
displaced incentives, taxes and other business climate issues as the 
primary concern of firms seeking to establish plants. This parallels 
the dilemma that eastern South Dakota has faced for some time; it is 
difficult to attract new industry when labor seems short.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have the person who posts price changes doing filing," says a 
Minnesota plumbing supply wholesaler who describes a few increases 
in copper and polyvinyl chloride pipe as offset by declines in 
prices of furnaces and other manufactured items. While fuel prices 
have received much attention, the average pump price for gasoline in 
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area at the end of May was only 6 percent 
above year-earlier levels. Grain prices remain at historic levels in 
nominal terms, and flour price increases now roughly parallel those 
of wheat after lagging somewhat earlier in the year. But there is 
little evidence of price pressure at the supermarket. Beef is 
frequently on sale and aggressive promotions of breakfast cereals 
and some other processed foods have helped minimize food price 
increases.
