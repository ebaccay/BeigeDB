      Beige Book Report: New York

      <b>
       September 11, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the 
                Second District has remained sluggish since the last report, except 
                in the housing sector, which continued to show strength. Prices 
                of goods and services generally remain stable. Hiring remains 
                lethargic, though some signs of a pickup were noted in late August. 
                Retail sales were on or below plan in August, though some improvement 
                was noted in the second half of the month. Most retailers describe 
                inventory levels as favorable and report somewhat less discounting 
                than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers indicate tepid business conditions, 
                  with weakness in July followed by a mild rebound in August; 
                  business contacts remain optimistic about the near-term outlook, 
                  though somewhat less so than in the second quarter. Housing 
                  markets have remained strong, with both construction and resale 
                  activity described as brisk. Office markets in and around New 
                  York City remain slack but have stabilized somewhat. Robust 
                  demand for industrial and warehouse space is reported in northern 
                  New Jersey. Finally, bankers report a pickup in demand for residential 
                  and commercial mortgages but weakening demand for consumer loans; 
                  they also report continued tightening in lending standards and 
                  stable delinquency rates.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report that sales were on or below plan in August, 
                  though the second half of the month was said to be better than 
                  the first half. Major chains report that comparable-store sales 
                  in the region ranged from an 8 percent decline to a 5 percent 
                  gain, compared with a year earlier. Two contacts noted that 
                  sales in the year-earlier period were boosted by tax rebates. 
                  As in the last report, sales of home furnishings and appliances 
                  were said to be relatively strong, while apparel sales were 
                  particularly sluggish. Hot weather was seen, by most contacts, 
                  as a modest negative factor, hampering sales of Fall seasonal 
                  merchandise. In general, most chains say there is less discounting 
                  than a year ago, leading to a modest increase in effective selling 
                  prices. While one chain reports that it is about to slash prices 
                  to clear out excess inventories, other retailers say that inventory 
                  levels are favorable, and lower than a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       A major regional discount chain, already in 
                  bankruptcy, recently announced that it will liquidate its inventory 
                  and close all 85 of its stores in New York and four in northern 
                  New Jersey; these stores reportedly employ approximately 5,000 
                  sales associates. Separately, a leading wholesaler of women's 
                  apparel reports that the business climate is increasingly difficult, 
                  with sales volume and merchandise costs holding steady but declining 
                  prices hurting margins and forcing some staff reductions. This 
                  contact attributed this to weakening consumer demand for clothing 
                  and consolidation in the retail industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regional surveys of consumer confidence gave 
                  mixed but generally weak readings in August. According to the 
                  Conference Board, confidence in the Middle Atlantic region fell 
                  to a cyclical low in August, mainly reflecting a steep drop 
                  in consumers' assessment of current conditions. Separately, 
                  a survey of New York State residents, conducted by Siena College, 
                  indicates that confidence rebounded modestly in August, following 
                  a steep decline in July, though it remained at a relatively 
                  low level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourism was fairly lively this past summer. 
                  Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates were steady in 
                  July and roughly the same as a year earlier, though average 
                  room rates were down 10 percent from a year earlier. There were 
                  said to be more leisure visitors this year but fewer business 
                  travelers. Separately, resort areas north of Albany report that 
                  business was relatively good over the summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Housing markets have remained vigorous since the last report, 
                  particularly in the New York City area. Homebuilders in northern 
                  New Jersey report that demand remained strong during the summer, 
                  while a shortage of available land has continued to drive up 
                  prices, limit new construction, and lead to long order backlogs. 
                  Active-adult communities have seen particularly strong demand 
                  and account for an increasing share of new construction. In 
                  the New York-New Jersey region more generally, permits to build 
                  single-family homes edged up in July and were 9 percent higher 
                  than a year earlier. Multi-family permits posted a sturdy gain 
                  and were up more than 24 percent from a year earlier; based 
                  on the first seven months, 2002 is on track to be the strongest 
                  year for apartment construction since 1987. Much of this strength 
                  is concentrated in New York City.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the resale market across metropolitan 
                  New York City continues to be robust. In the second quarter, 
                  prices of single-family homes were up 10-15 percent from a year 
                  earlier, based on a repeat-sales index, and real estate contacts 
                  indicate that this strength appears to have followed through 
                  into the third quarter. Sales of Manhattan co-ops and condos 
                  are also described as strong, though the rate of price appreciation 
                  has been more subdued. A leading appraisal firm reports that 
                  August was its busiest month ever, reflecting both a large number 
                  of sales transactions and a flood of refinancing activity. Contacts 
                  indicate that New York City's apartment rental market has stabilized, 
                  but that rents remain considerably lower than a year ago. Rising 
                  vacancy rates and falling rents are also reported along northern 
                  New Jersey's "Gold Coast", which is across the river from Manhattan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate markets have been mixed. 
                  New York City's office market continued to slacken since the 
                  last report, though the pace has moderated noticeably. Availability 
                  rates edged up in July, while asking rents were steady in Midtown 
                  but continued to decline in Lower Manhattan. Overall, asking 
                  rents are down roughly 10 percent from a year ago, though actual 
                  contract rents are reported to be down by at least 20 percent. 
                  In contrast, northern New Jersey's industrial market has shown 
                  signs of strengthening, buoyed by robust demand for warehouse 
                  space. Brisk activity at Port Newark and Port Elizabeth is seen 
                  as a major force underpinning this market.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A major New York City employment agency reports that hiring 
                  activity was unusually slow in July and August, though activity 
                  picked up in the final week of August. However, this contact 
                  reports that businesses are not yet confident enough to hire 
                  and that even the market for temps has shown no signs of rebounding. 
                  Based on data through late August, initial claims for unemployment 
                  insurance have receded in New York City, and were down from 
                  a year earlier. However, in the rest of the state, as well as 
                  New Jersey, claims continued to run slightly higher than a year 
                  earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent surveys of purchasing managers and 
                  manufacturers suggest a moderate rebound in the manufacturing 
                  sector in August. Buffalo-area purchasers report a slight improvement 
                  in business conditions in August--while production activity 
                  weakened, new orders rebounded following a slump in July. Purchasing 
                  managers in the New York City area report widespread strength 
                  in the manufacturing sector in August, but continued sluggish 
                  conditions in other sectors; they also expressed less optimism 
                  about the near-term outlook than in recent months. Purchasers 
                  in both areas report little change in input prices. Separately, 
                  our latest monthly survey of New York State manufacturers indicates 
                  a moderate rebound in business activity in August, following 
                  a dip in activity in July, though improvement was a good deal 
                  less widespread than in the second quarter. However, respondents 
                  remain overwhelmingly optimistic about the near-term business 
                  outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, a trucking-industry expert notes 
                  that the recently announced bankruptcy of a major national carrier 
                  is not expected to have a dramatic effect on the industry overall. 
                  This contact notes that, aside from substantial escalation in 
                  insurance costs, the industry has not had major problems and 
                  that the firm's business and most of its drivers will likely 
                  move to other companies.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In our latest survey of small to medium-sized Second District 
                  banks, respondents report mixed demand for loans. Demand increased 
                  for both residential and nonresidential mortgages, but continued 
                  to weaken for consumer loans, with twice as many bankers reporting 
                  weakening as strengthening. Little change was reported in the 
                  commercial and industrial segment. Widespread increases were 
                  reported in refinancing activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the supply side, bankers continue to report 
                  tightening credit standards for commercial and industrial loans 
                  and nonresidential mortgages, but little change in credit standards 
                  for consumer lending and residential mortgages. Both loan and 
                  deposit rates continued to decrease across all categories. Declining 
                  rates were particularly widespread on home mortgages. Lenders 
                  report stable delinquency rates for all types of loans.
