      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Beige Book contacts indicate favorable economic conditions 
              among 12th District states in the final months of 1997 and suggest 
              a positive, although more tempered, outlook among respondents for 
              1998. Retailers reported that holiday sales, though stronger than 
              last year, were lower than expected, prompting considerable post-season 
              discounting. Respondents throughout the service sector reported 
              healthy gains in recent weeks, and shipping and trucking contacts 
              noted easing of recent bottlenecks associated with the Union Pacific 
              Railroad merger. Manufacturers reported healthy activity, but noted 
              declines in exports to East Asian countries. Developments in East 
              Asia also have reduced demand
      <br/>
      for many District agricultural products. Steady demand for
      <br/>
      commercial real estate kept construction activity strong in most 
              of the District, despite a slowdown in many housing markets. District 
              financial conditions remained healthy, and competition for quality 
              borrowers continued to be intense.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District respondents expect solid performance of the national
      <br/>
      economy and their respective regional economies. Most respondents 
              expect national GDP growth to slow to its long-run average pace, 
              leaving the national unemployment rate near its current level. A 
              majority of respondents expect inflation to remain constant over 
              the next 12 months, although a growing fraction anticipate a slight 
              decline in inflation. With regard to regional conditions, over three-quarters 
              of the respondents expect growth in their area to outpace national 
              growth in the coming year. Recent disruptions in East Asia have 
              affected export expectations in the District-more 
              than 80 percent of District respondents expect a decline in foreign 
              exports from their regions.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in most areas of the District characterized holiday 
              retail sales as better than last year but lower than expected. High- 
              end gifts, such as jewelry and branded apparel, reportedly posted 
              the strongest sales, requiring little pre-Christmas discounting 
              to attract buyers. In contrast, retail contacts reported disappointing 
              sales of inexpensive and moderately priced clothing and personal 
              electronic items, despite early heavy discounting. Overall, slower 
              than expected holiday sales, particularly at department stores and 
             
              discount chains, reportedly have left many retailers with unwanted 
              inventories that are being cleared away through deep price cuts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Service industry respondents in most of the District reported good 
              gains during the recent survey period. Respondents from Northern 
              California and the Pacific Northwest reported healthy demand for 
              business services, including consulting and advertising. Tourism- 
              related airport traffic and hotel occupancy rates increased in several 
              areas of the District. In Portland, air passenger traffic reportedly 
              was at record levels. In San Diego, hotel occupancy rates reportedly 
              reached a decade high over the past few months. The news was not 
              as good in Utah and Hawaii. In Utah, a lack of snow has 
              slowed the flow of ski-bound tourists; in Hawaii, recent 
              developments in East Asia have significantly depressed East-bound 
              visitor traffic, prompting many airlines to reduce the number of 
              scheduled flights to the state. Port traffic throughout the District 
              reportedly was strong. Inbound traffic from East Asia has offset 
              declines in outbound vessels carrying products to East Asia. Respondents 
              in the shipping industry also indicated that the bottlenecks associated 
              with the Union Pacific Railroad have subsided slightly in recent 
              weeks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing reports generally were positive, although 
              contacts noted that developments in East Asia have reduced exports 
              and tempered growth in some areas and industries. In the Pacific 
              Northwest, food processors and lumber and wood product manufacturers 
              reportedly have experienced substantial declines in exports to East 
              Asia, prompting some companies to postpone expansion plans until 
              the region stabilizes. Boeing also has felt the effects of East 
              Asia; public statements from Boeing indicate a slowdown in the growth 
              of aircraft orders and requests for delivery delays from East Asian 
              countries. However, given the backlog of orders at Boeing, no decline 
              in production is expected this year. In other areas of the District, 
              contacts reported declines in shipments of primary and secondary 
              metals to East Asian countries and slowing of orders for telecommunications 
              equipment.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on District agricultural conditions and resource-related 
          
              industries were mixed. Falling gold prices resulted in the recent 
           
              shut down of operations at a number of District mines. The cattle 
              industry was beset by herd losses due to unfavorable weather and 
              grazing conditions, particularly in the Intermountain states. Demand 
              for many agricultural commodities slowed in recent weeks as East 
              Asian countries either cancelled orders or failed to secure appropriate 
              lines of credit for purchase. On the bright side, reports indicate 
              that the Union Pacific railway problems have begun to ease, clearing 
              the way for delivery of inputs that are necessary 
              for the next growing cycle.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate activity continued to increase in most areas 
              of the District, keeping District construction activity at high 
              levels despite a slowdown in many housing markets. Respondents in 
              many areas of the District outside of California noted declines 
              in new housing starts and slowing sales of both new and existing 
              homes. However, commercial real estate and construction activity 
              in these areas remains strong and has kept demand high for contractors, 
              subcontractors, and materials.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District banking conditions continued to be healthy.
              Respondents reported that bank capital and liquidity were in ample 
              supply and competition for loans remained intense, with quality 
              borrowers receiving excellent terms and rates. Respondents noted 
              that low interest rates are boosting loan demand and encouraging 
              refinancing on all types of real estate. Throughout the industry, 
              shortages of qualified workers continued to be a primary concern, 
              and wage and salary pressures remained high.
