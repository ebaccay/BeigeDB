      The upward trend in business 
                activity in the Third District that has been building since the 
                beginning of the year appeared to ease in August. Manufacturers 
                reported steady shipments and orders after several months of growth. 
                Retail sales of general merchandise moved down from July to August, 
                although there were scanty year-over-year gains in both months. 
                Auto sales have been steady. Tourism activity fell in July and 
                August after a strong June. Bank loan volumes have edged down, 
                as gains in residential mortgages have been offset by declines 
                in other types of loans. Commercial real estate markets continued 
                to ease. Home sales have slipped since spring, although they continue 
                at a fairly strong pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District businesses contacted in August 
                  have positive outlooks, although many feel that prospects for 
                  the immediate future have become more uncertain. A significant 
                  number of those surveyed for this report said business and consumer 
                  confidence has become more fragile recently. Manufacturers forecast 
                  increases in shipments and orders during the next six months, 
                  but their capital spending plans are not as strong as they were 
                  earlier this year. Retailers expect slight gains in sales this 
                  fall, but they are also looking for ways to cut costs in order 
                  to maintain profitability. Bankers generally expect overall 
                  loan demand to remain flat, unless business confidence improves 
                  and firms step up borrowing. Real estate contacts anticipate 
                  steady residential sales, but they do not foresee improvement 
                  in commercial markets until next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District was virtually steady 
                  in August. New orders and shipments were flat during the month 
                  for around half of the firms contacted, and the number of firms 
                  seeing declines from July offset the number posting increases. 
                  Conditions were mixed among the region's major manufacturing 
                  sectors. Firms that manufacture building materials and components 
                  continued to see strong demand for their products. Demand was 
                  also strong for industrial plastics. In contrast, primary metals 
                  producers, metal fabricating companies, and electrical equipment 
                  makers generally reported declining orders. Area manufacturers 
                  added slightly to inventories in August, on balance, although 
                  half of those contacted for this report said they were maintaining 
                  steady inventories. More than three out of four manufacturers 
                  in the region indicated that prices for both the inputs they 
                  use and the goods they manufacture were steady in May, but the 
                  number reporting higher prices for both has increased since 
                  spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      The region's manufacturers forecast improving 
                  business conditions over the next six months, although their 
                  level of optimism has slipped somewhat since the first half 
                  of the year. Half of the firms surveyed in August expect increases 
                  in orders and shipments during the next six months, while just 
                  under one in 10 anticipate decreases. In line with their positive, 
                  but more modest, outlook, area manufacturers' capital spending 
                  plans call for increases, on balance, but the number of firms 
                  that have scheduled stepped-up expenditures has declined in 
                  recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally reported very slight gains, 
                  at best, in sales in August compared to a year ago, and most 
                  said sales declined from July. Although the back-to-school shopping 
                  period was well underway, many stores reported a falloff in 
                  customer traffic and sales during August. Store executives said 
                  the hotter than normal weather was damping sales of fall apparel. 
                  Slipping consumer confidence was another factor some merchants 
                  cited for lackluster sales. Some stores were implementing more 
                  aggressive discounts than they had planned in an effort to spur 
                  sales. Many stores have initiated cost cutting efforts to preserve 
                  profitability in a slow growth environment. Auto sales continued 
                  at a fairly strong pace, as manufacturers continued to offer 
                  incentives on 2002 models.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers said the outlook was uncertain, 
                  but they expect some improvement, especially in apparel sales, 
                  once cooler weather takes hold. Auto sales showed no signs of 
                  weakening seriously, according to dealers, but price increases 
                  and fewer incentives on 2003 models could result in a drop in 
                  the sales rate during the fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Travel and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The strong start to the vacation season that began in June has 
                  faltered. Tourism activity in July and August was below last 
                  year's levels in most of the region's major summer recreation 
                  venues. Hotel occupancy has generally been off from last year 
                  throughout most of the region. Campground attendance has been 
                  good, but vacation home rentals have been mixed, with some areas 
                  matching last year's occupancy rates, but many falling below. 
                  Tourism officials in nearly all parts of the region indicated 
                  that day-trip numbers have been matching or exceeding last year's 
                  levels, but spending per trip appeared to be down. Less business 
                  at resort area restaurants, retail establishments, and amusement 
                  parks could lead to the closing of some establishments, according 
                  to tourism officials. Amid the overall decline in activity, 
                  a few areas reported increased activity compared with a year 
                  ago, and attendance at museums and some urban tourist sites 
                  has increased compared with last year. Business travel remains 
                  at low levels, adversely affecting airline traffic and hotel 
                  occupancy in the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks has been flat 
                  to down slightly in recent weeks. Almost all of the banks contacted 
                  for this report said business loan totals have edged down as 
                  payoffs continue at a steady rate and requests for new loans 
                  decline. Several bankers noted some slippage in commercial loan 
                  quality recently. Bank lending officers indicated that a growing 
                  number of firms across a wide variety of manufacturing and service 
                  industries were still experiencing falling revenues and profits. 
                  Consumer lending at area banks has been weak. Although a few 
                  banks have posted slight gains recently, most of those surveyed 
                  in August reported steady or slightly declining consumer loan 
                  volume outstanding. In contrast to business and consumer lending, 
                  most banks reported continuing strong growth in residential 
                  mortgages, for both refinancing and purchases. Strong residential 
                  markets have also been boosting bank lending to homebuilders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the Third District expect overall 
                  lending to remain flat in the absence of a pickup in commercial 
                  and industrial lending, which they say is unlikely until business 
                  confidence improves or firms are faced with pressing needs to 
                  increase capital spending. Bankers see no signs that mortgage 
                  demand is softening, although many express concern that the 
                  current pace of real estate activity cannot persist if overall 
                  economic growth in the region slows down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District commercial real estate markets have continued 
                  to ease. The most recent surveys by area real estate firms indicated 
                  that vacancy rates have increased 1 to 2 percentage points since 
                  spring in most markets. The office vacancy rate in the Philadelphia 
                  central business district is estimated at around 14 percent. 
                  The vacancy rate in most suburban markets is estimated to be 
                  higher, at around 20 percent. Effective rental rates have eased 
                  as building owners have expanded capital commitments, such as 
                  building improvements and free rent periods, for tenants. Contacts 
                  in commercial real estate believe markets will improve slightly, 
                  but probably not until some time in 2003, after a number of 
                  buildings currently under construction are completed and lease 
                  up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate agents generally reported 
                  an easing in the rate of sales of both new and existing homes 
                  in July and August, although the number of sales in those months 
                  was still said to be relatively high by recent standards. Price 
                  appreciation remains rapid in many parts of the region. Builders 
                  and real estate agents said supply and demand for homes in the 
                  region appear to be coming into balance, however. They expect 
                  some reduction in the rate of price increases and a steady pace 
                  of sales.
