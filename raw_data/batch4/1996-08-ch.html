      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy continued to expand through 
June and July at a slightly slower rate than in our last report. 
Retail sales growth was positive but continued to lag that of the 
nation. Residential housing activity lost some momentum, but overall 
construction activity continued to increase. The manufacturing 
sector, bolstered by strong demand for durable goods, expanded in 
June and July but showed some signs of slowing toward the end of the 
period. Banking activity remained strong, while several financial 
institutions noted a continued rise in delinquency rates. Despite 
tight labor markets and continued strength in the economy, there was 
little evidence of accelerating increases in wages or other input 
costs. Grain prices fell as crop conditions improved and cuts in 
livestock production eased concerns about tight grain supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales continued to increase in year-over-year 
comparisons, but the growth rate slowed slightly from June to July. 
Several large retailers noted that sales growth in the District 
remained below their national averages. Slower-than-expected sales 
gains resulted in some unintended inventory buildup, most notably in 
electronics and seasonal items, such as air conditioners and lawn 
and garden equipment. One retailer described demand for summer goods 
as "nonexistent". Most retailers, however, reported that inventories 
were in good shape and much better than at the same time last year. 
Auto dealers reported that sales were strong and that showroom 
traffic remained high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing/Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in the housing industry lost some of 
its momentum in June and July but most contacts noted that the 
market remained very strong. Several home builders and realtors 
reported that activity had picked up from May's weather-induced 
slump, but not as much as anticipated. Shortages of skilled labor 
and some building materials hindered contractors' efforts to make up 
lost time in many areas. A few metro areas were reporting inventory 
buildup, but most contacts noted that builders were not concerned 
and were not using incentives to clear inventories. Most builders 
and realtors reported that the first-time buyer segment remained 
robust. Contacts in some of the District's largest metro areas 
reported that office vacancy rates continue to fall and may be at a 
level that could spur new construction. A realtor in one of these 
areas noted that several large projects were already underway and 
that "this is the best office market (he's) seen in 5 1/2 years".
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District manufacturers reported strong demand 
and lean inventories heading into the third quarter, while upward 
pressure on costs remained constrained. Purchasing managers' surveys 
indicated modest expansion through June and early survey returns 
showed that the expansion continued in July--but at a slightly 
slower rate: Survey results from one major metropolitan area 
indicated slowing production growth from June to July with some 
inventory building; new orders, however, remained quite strong. 
Appliance and machinery producers reported that demand was being 
buoyed by the continued strength in housing and construction 
activity. Auto suppliers noted that production was at capacity and a 
shortage of parts was hindering light truck assemblies. Several 
steel analysts indicated that orders were still strong and 
inventories remained lean at every level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the continued increase in activity, there was little 
evidence of acceleration in price increases. While costs of some 
inputs continued to drift upward, several producers indicated that 
they were unable to pass along these increases to final goods 
purchasers. However, steel producers reported some success in 
getting their July price increases to stick.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking activity remained strong through much of July, 
although several financial institutions reported a continued rise in 
delinquencies. Most District contacts noted that business lending 
was the most vigorous segment of the banking market. One major bank 
reported its strongest business lending month of the year in June 
and indicated that this strength had continued into July. Several 
banks noted a modest scaling back in consumer and mortgage lending, 
but one large bank could find no let up in demand from its "high 
quality" customers. Many contacts expressed concern about rising 
delinquency rates for consumer and retailer loans, but viewed the 
increases to be within normal credit performance standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained tighter in the District than 
in the nation as a whole despite relatively slower job growth. The 
rebound in manufacturing employment noted in our last report was 
short-lived. Contacts from around the region and purchasing 
managers' surveys suggested flat to slightly reduced manufacturing 
payrolls in June and July. Shortages in professional and technical 
occupations persisted; shortages were particularly severe in the 
construction industry, where inclement weather in May and early June 
delayed many projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage pressures remained subdued despite the very tight labor 
markets. However, some employers reported enhancing benefits 
packages to attract and keep workers, especially in the construction 
industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Corn and soybean prices fell sharply after hitting new 
highs in mid-July. Crop conditions across District states were 
mixed, but overall were rated slightly below normal as of the end of 
July. Late plantings and subnormal temperatures have increased the 
risk of damage from an early frost this year. Nevertheless, recent 
rains and forecasts of favorable weather through early August--a 
critical period for plant development--have buoyed District crop 
prospects. Updated reports showing surprisingly large cuts in 
livestock and dairy production--especially in District states--have 
added to the decline in crop prices. Sudden sluggishness in grain 
exports also eased earlier concerns about tight grain supplies this 
summer.
