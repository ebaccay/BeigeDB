      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity continued to expand at the 
slower pace established in January and February. Retail sales 
remained sluggish in March and April and sales along the border 
continued to be very weak. Manufacturing orders were up although 
more contacts reported reduced sales to Mexican customers. Demand 
for business services remained strong, however, and construction 
activity was reported to be at good levels because of increased 
demand for nonresidential space. Bankers said loan demand grew 
steadily. Rising energy prices boosted respondents' outlooks, but 
domestic drilling activity remained below last year's levels. 
Agricultural producers said that dry weather hampered production 
slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing and service contacts said that price and wage 
pressures remained in some industries, much the same as reported in 
the last Beige Book. Rising prices for packaging and shipping 
materials continued to boost costs for most manufacturers. Apparel 
producers said that higher prices for cotton and some chemicals were 
adding to their costs, but that they had not increased selling 
prices. Capacity constraints in the semiconductor industry pushed up 
costs for some electronics manufacturers. In the services industry, 
fees and wages continued to rise at temporary help firms. Rising 
competition had reduced fees at trucking firms, but a shortage of 
drivers continued to push up wages. Retailers said their selling 
prices were lower than expected. Energy prices rose, but natural gas 
prices were still at very low levels. Weakening livestock prices led 
to a decline in agricultural prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District manufacturing orders rose in March and early 
April. Demand for electronics and petrochemicals remained very 
strong, but orders for paper softened slightly. Although paper 
contacts noted a slowdown in demand, they said it was a welcome 
relief compared to the tight condition of the past few months. A 
notable exception was corrugated box distributors who said that 
demand had increased, likely a result of businesses trying to hedge 
another price increase. The demand for most construction-related 
products rose, although orders from residential builders were well 
below last year's levels. Brick producers said demand increased over 
the last six weeks, but sales were off 20 percent from year-ago 
levels. Glass respondents said orders remained strong despite rising 
competition from Mexican producers. Primary and fabricated metals 
producers said orders continued to rise due to strength in the 
nonresidential construction sector. Lumber producers said that 
demand had leveled off because of fewer housing starts. Orders 
remained strong for electronic equipment, and competition continued 
to drive down prices. Apparel sales rose, but some respondents noted 
increasing cautiousness in orders from retailers. Orders for food 
products increased, and contacts in the frozen food industry said 
the California floods stimulated orders for frozen produce. Domestic 
and international orders for chemicals were very strong, and 
contacts reported healthy profits. After an extremely weak first 
quarter, refiners said margins improved slightly in April as 
gasoline prices rose more quickly than crude prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business services continued to rise at a strong pace. 
Temporary employment firms reported rising demand, and labor market 
tightness continued to drive up wages and fees for skilled workers. 
Accounting and legal respondents reported growth in business 
activity such as mergers and acquisitions. The outlook for business 
services firms was positive, with no slowdown anticipated in coming 
months. Hotel contacts said business was up over last year, but that 
Easter season was disappointing because fewer Mexican families 
vacationed in Texas. Respondents in the transportation services 
industry said that demand was up slightly since the last Beige Book, 
but trucking contacts said that increased competition had reduced 
business and fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales remained sluggish in March and April, and most contacts 
said that sales were slower than expected. Larger than desired 
inventories at some stores was leading to a brief period of 
discounting. In general, selling prices were reported to be the same 
or slightly higher than last year. Most retailers said that selling 
prices have not increased as much as they expected this year, and 
indicated that they are resisting higher prices from manufacturers. 
Sales along the Mexican border continued to be very weak. Auto sales 
improved in March and April but were below last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      District bankers reported steady loan demand. There was strong 
demand for construction loans despite fewer residential mortgage 
loans. Bankers reported increased liquidity because higher interest 
rates had reduced the relative attractiveness of non-bank 
investments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity remained strong as nonresidential construction 
increased. Industrial construction picked up, especially near the 
Texas/Mexico border where manufacturing expansions boosted the 
demand for warehouse space. Apartment construction continued to 
increase at a rapid pace, but some contacts were concerned that the 
market would not be able to absorb all the new space. New home sales 
were weak, but contacts said that buyer traffic had picked up with 
the decline in mortgage rates. Most were expecting some improvement 
in sales in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy respondents reported that drilling activity in the Gulf of 
Mexico seemed to have bottomed out in recent weeks, after declining 
about 10 percent during the first quarter. Although domestic 
drilling activity remained weak, contacts working in international 
markets said activity there had increased, more than offsetting the 
domestic losses. Crude oil prices increased from about $18 in early 
March to over $20 in April, raising optimism among contacts, even 
though the futures market suggests that $20 oil prices will not be 
maintained. Natural gas prices remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District agricultural producers said dry conditions in west 
Texas were hampering production slightly. Strong demand for cotton 
worldwide had increased prices and prospective cotton acreage. 
Despite higher crop prices, lower prices for livestock caused the 
Texas All Farm Products Index to fall 2.9 percent below the March 
1994 level.
