      The Fifth District economy expanded at a somewhat faster clip in 
recent weeks despite weather-related slowdowns in some sectors. 
Consumers continued to spend freely, with retail sales growth out 
pacing that of a year ago. In addition, manufacturers reported that 
orders and shipments rebounded sharply from an early winter slumber. 
Real estate activity, both in the residential and commercial 
sectors, picked up considerably, although residential builders noted 
that excessive rainfall reduced housing starts somewhat. Unusually 
wet weather also kept tourists away from coastal resorts and farmers 
out of their fields. In the service sector, growth remained healthy, 
even though the overall pace was held back by a reduction in 
utilities' sales. Shortages of both skilled and entry-level workers 
worsened, and reports of higher wages were more widespread. Prices, 
especially in the service sector, increased at a somewhat faster 
rate.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Since the beginning of the year, the retail sector has hardly missed 
a beat. January sales held up better than in past years, and most 
merchants told us they were pleasantly surprised by the strength of 
consumer spending in February. Mild temperatures hurt winter apparel 
sales, but got spring clothing off to a fast start. Consumers' 
purchases of durable goods strengthened. Sales of both new and used 
automobiles exceeded dealers' expectations, and furniture retailers 
reported that their businesses were finally benefiting from buoyant 
housing markets. While maintaining sales growth remained a priority, 
many merchants told us that their biggest concern was finding and 
retaining workers. One said that the lack of available workers "was 
keeping [him] awake at night." Reports of wage increases were more 
prominent than in our last report. Retailers indicated that prices 
generally increased at a faster rate in recent weeks. Restauranteurs 
and general merchandisers reported the largest price increases; 
apparel retailers, however, continued to report widespread price 
discounting.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        District service producers experienced healthy growth in recent 
weeks. Businesses associated with real estate--including mortgage 
insurance companies, real estate brokers, and appraisers--noted 
particularly strong revenue growth, as did both passenger and 
freight airlines. Electric utilities and natural gas suppliers, on 
the other hand, reported decreased revenues as unseasonably mild 
temperatures reduced energy demand. Service sector employment growth 
slowed amid widespread complaints of shortages of qualified workers. 
Service contacts reported faster price growth since our last report; 
the pick-up was most evident in the business services, finance, real 
estate, and lodging sectors.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Since our last report, District manufacturers witnessed a resurgence 
in activity. Overall shipments and new orders rebounded sharply, 
even though producers of transportation equipment and industrial 
machinery reported disappointing growth. Most manufacturers 
continued to indicate that their sales had not been impacted by the 
financial crisis in Asia. An exception was a textile producer who 
suggested that a recent "flood" of Asian imports had hurt his 
industry. While a Virginia port representative stated that Asian 
difficulties had "hindered textile exports," contacts at other ports 
noted little impact on either exports or imports. Manufacturers 
continued to add employees, but many expressed growing concern over 
the quality of their job applicants. Wages grew somewhat faster than 
in our last report.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Lending activity increased in January and February. Mortgage 
lending--both new originations and refinancings--was particularly 
brisk; a Charlottesville, Virginia banker said that "January was 
pandemonium" in her office because interest rates were so low. 
Commercial lending also rose, boosted in part by increased business 
merger and acquisition activity. Banks' credit standards changed 
little since our last report.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Real Estate
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Low interest rates and higher consumer confidence sparked real 
estate sales in recent weeks, but wet weather hampered homebuilding 
activity. A Virginia contact reported "booming" home sales while a 
South Carolina realtor said that it was the "best January and 
February ever" in his area. A number of realtors attributed higher 
sales to an influx of new businesses coming to their areas. Frequent 
rains across most of the District, however, thwarted contractors' 
efforts to keep apace of demand. Nevertheless, builders reported 
that the rains didn't diminish their optimism or affect the number 
of building permits being sought.
           <p>
            Commercial real estate activity picked up dramatically, with one 
contact noting that "floods of tenants were looking for space." The 
continued strength surprised some contractors who had "expected the
market to hit saturation by now." Projects underway in the District 
included small office buildings and larger industrial warehouses as 
well as retail establishments, a growing portion of which were 
speculative buildings.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Tourism
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Contacts reported that the unseasonably warm, wet weather of recent 
weeks had a mixed impact on District tourist activity. Despite mild 
temperatures which hindered snowmaking, attendance at ski resorts 
was near all-time highs. One contact said that the addition of a 
snow tubing park had increased his resort's customer base by 
appealing to those who do not ski. The warmer temperatures, however, 
caused ardent skiers to travel further in search of natural snow, 
benefiting West Virginia ski resorts. Frequent rains dashed hopes of 
a second year of record-breaking winter tourist activity at coastal 
resorts.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Labor Markets
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Employers continued to experience difficulties finding qualified 
workers to fill vacant positions. A number of temporary agencies 
said that their greatest challenge was finding "trainable" people 
for entry-level production and customer service positions. One 
contact said that, increasingly, businesses were hiring two or more 
college students on a part-time basis to fill each full-time 
vacancy. While overall wage increases remained modest, workers with 
highly sought skills were "calling the shots" in their wage 
negotiations.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Agriculture
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Near-record rainfall in many areas had mixed impacts on small grain 
crops. Wet and muddy fields barred farmers from applying fertilizer 
to the winter wheat and barley crops and from starting their pre-
planting tillage. Standing water in low-lying fields was common, and 
one agricultural analyst said that flooded fields could reduce 
winter wheat yields in his area by as much as 20 percent. Elsewhere, 
the rains and milder-than-normal temperatures apparently benefited 
small grain crops. Analysts said that fruit trees budded early, 
increasing the risk of spring frost damage to peach and apple crops.
