      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eighth District economy

continues to grow at a steady pace.  District

retailers report that sales were up about 4

percent in September and October over one

year ago, and most are expecting a strong

holiday season.  Auto sales were mixed over

the same two-month period, but most

contacts expect a pickup through year?s end.

Most other contacts report continued growth

in their industries, although some have

noted a slowing in this growth.  Labor

markets remain tight around the District.

Materials prices are generally stable to up

slightly.  Real estate markets are strong in

most parts of the District.  Loan demand,

particularly for business loans, remains

relatively strong.  Farmers appear to have

had a good crop year, with prices and yields

generally above average.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail contacts report that September

and October sales were up about 4 percent

from one year ago.  Toys, home

improvement products and women?s

apparel were the biggest sellers.  Contacts

also report that their inventories are at

desired levels.  Most are expecting a strong

holiday season, with electronic products,

toys and jewelry leading the way.  Moreover,

most believe that the first quarter of 1997

will yield better sales than a year earlier.
       <p>
        Car dealers were split in their sales

reports for September and October.  While

about half saw sales increase about 8

percent over the year before, the rest saw

sales decline about 10 percent.  Rebates have

not been used any more than usual to move

product.  Most dealers are optimistic about

sales prospects through year?s end, and are

even more upbeat about the first quarter of

1997.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Most District contacts continue to

report growth at their firms and in their

industries.  Hiring and keeping qualified

workers because of tight labor markets

remains a big concern for many companies.

One contact remarked that firms are having

particular difficulty finding qualified

workers because the skills needed today are

much more specialized than they were in the

early 1970s, when similar unemployment

rates existed.
         <p>
          Providers of transportation and

delivery services are growing in the District,

with both railroads and trucking firms

adding workers.  Trucking companies

report that there is currently a severe

shortage of drivers.  The food and beverage

industries also report sales and employment

growth, with poultry processing firms

adding workers and a beverage firm

reporting sales increases over last year.
          <p>
           Other firms, while still reporting

growth, have recently noted a slowing in this

growth.  A chemicals company reports that

sales are still above last year?s, but they are

not as robust as they were a few months ago.

Die cast producers have also seen a slowing

in their volumes.  A contact in the scrap

metal industry has noted a slowdown in the

steel industry?s rate of inventory increase,

perhaps portending a downturn in that

industry.  The District?s apparel industry is

still contracting, with two more plants

closing because of foreign competition.

About 750 jobs will be lost in total.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Prices
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Most firms report that materials

prices have been stable to up somewhat, but

any increases have generally not been

passed along to customers.  Lumber,

aluminum and natural gas prices, in

particular, are reportedly higher, while

scrap steel prices have recently fallen.

Contacts also report nominal wage increases

of between 3 percent and 4 percent for the

coming year.  One contact mentioned that

some large customers are requesting rebates

from suppliers in lieu of lower prices for

large contracts.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Real Estate and Construction
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Residential real estate markets are

strong in most parts of the District.  Prices

for both new and resale houses are rising.

Monthly residential construction permits in

September were up in only five of the

District?s 12 metropolitan areas.  On a

year-to-date basis, permits were up in nine metro

areas.  The three areas that were below last

year?s levels are all in the southern part of

the District.  Nonresidential construction is

particularly strong in the southern part of

the District, especially in northwest

Mississippi.  Parts of southern Illinois and

western Kentucky are also seeing strong

commercial construction.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Banking and Finance
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Bankers across the District report

continued strength in loan demand,

especially on the commercial side.  Credit is

described as plentiful by most District

contacts.  Bankers in St. Louis and central

Kentucky report aggressive competition for

business loan customers.  Some bankers

have noted a softening of consumer loan

demand and report being much more

cautious in extending consumer credit in

response to rising personal bankruptcies

and consumer debt loads.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Agriculture and Natural Resources
               </strong>
               <br/>
               With the fall harvest winding down,

substantial rainfall during early- to mid-

November in several parts of the District

slowed the pace of activity to a near

standstill.  Initial reports suggest that yields

were generally above average and, in some

instances, outstanding for most crops.  For

example, Arkansas rice farmers expect

yields to surpass the all-time high set just

two years ago.  Southern pine lumber mills

report that orders on a year-to-date basis

continue to outstrip last year?s pace by a

little more than 7 percent.
