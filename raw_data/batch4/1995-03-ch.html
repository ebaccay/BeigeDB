      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Seventh District economic activity generally remained brisk in early 
1995. Signs of slower growth were concentrated in housing activity 
and the auto industry, but realtors, retailers and auto dealers 
generally remained optimistic about future sales growth. Overall 
manufacturing output continued to expand at a moderate to vigorous 
pace. Conditions in the agricultural sector held up better than 
expected, and land values posted the greatest annual increase in 
1994 in the past six years. Surveys and reports from staffing 
services firms indicate that District labor markets remained tight, 
with little evidence of any significant change in employment growth 
since the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity generally remained vigorous in early 
1995, after closing out 1994 on a high note. The composite index of 
production components in purchasing managers surveys for Chicago, 
Detroit, and Milwaukee showed continued robust expansion in output 
in January and February, in contrast to the slower growth indicated 
in the national data. Responses from auto suppliers and other 
cyclically-sensitive industries contributed to a slower (but still 
substantial) growth rate indicated in surveys in Western Michigan. 
At the same time, however, the production component of auto industry 
responses to the Detroit purchasing managers' survey actually 
increased in January and February. A large distributor of industrial 
materials stated that its own sales growth shows no sign of slowing. 
"If you asked me two months ago," this contact observed, "I would 
have expected a slowdown in the second half of this year. No 
longer." New capacity expansion projects by manufacturers have 
boosted this firm's growth in sales to construction contractors, 
while direct sales to manufacturers remained strong. An industry 
analyst reported that construction machinery sales remain robust in 
the face of higher interest rates, with greater strengthening in 
nonresidential construction spending expected to bolster industry 
sales growth further in coming months. A manufacturer of industrial 
equipment stated that demand has held up very well in recent months, 
although a higher share of customers choose to rent (rather than 
buy) equipment. A manufacturer of products linked to housing 
activity stated that orders slowed in early 1995; "our backlog is 
still huge, but at current order rates we can probably say good-bye 
to seven day workweeks."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity showed continued signs of slowing, but activity 
remained at relatively high levels and most realtors remained 
upbeat. An association of realtors in Wisconsin reported new year-
over-year declines in transaction volume, but stated that "these 
figures are still pretty strong." One large realtor stated that 
sales normally pick up substantially in February compared to 
January, but did not do so this year, and this contact stated that 
"the last two rate increases seem to have put a damper on things." 
Nonetheless, "prices are still appreciating, we have plenty of 
buyers calling, and underlying demand remains strong." One of the 
largest realtors in the District reported that transactions 
strengthened somewhat in recent weeks, after rising interest rates 
and uncertainty about their future direction curtailed sales in the 
fourth quarter. "We've been a little surprised, and salespeople 
actually seem to be getting a little bullish again."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Surveys and reports from large chains revealed little change in the 
pace of retail sales growth in the District. A large retailer 
reported that its underlying sales momentum was slightly stronger in 
recent months on a seasonally adjusted basis, led by continued 
strength in home furniture sales and new strengthening in women's 
apparel. This contact stated that consumers "are still shopping 
closely to need, as opposed to impulse." A major retail chain stated 
that its durable goods sales growth moderated in recent months, 
despite increased promotional activity. This contact stated that 
inventories have risen above plan in some product categories 
(including appliances), but the company has not yet reduced its 
orders below previous plans. A large manufacturer of durable goods 
stated that orders from dealers and retailers remained "amazingly 
strong" in recent weeks, with no sign of any change in momentum 
since late 1994. The majority of Michigan retailers anticipating 
future sales growth in a monthly survey reached its widest margin 
since last October, although some modest slowing in current sales 
momentum was also indicated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discussions with auto dealers were mixed, with the majority 
indicating some slowing in sales momentum in early 1995. One of the 
largest auto dealers in the District reported that traffic and sales 
turned busier in the latter half of February and early March, 
however, after slowing significantly in January and early February. 
This contact has not pulled back on orders from its earlier plans; 
"we've been able to get some extra vehicles, unlike last year when 
things were really tight and we're taking everything we can get." 
This dealer expected sales to improve in coming months. Commenting 
on a competitor's financing promotion, this contact stated that "if 
we did that, we just couldn't get enough vehicles to sell." Another 
large auto dealer also reported weak sales in early 1995, partly due 
to vehicle price increases. This contact stated that sales would 
likely increase from 1994 to 1995, if interest rate changes 
stabilize or become less prominent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's farm sector are holding up better than 
had been expected. Hog prices have improved considerably from the 
inordinately low levels of last fall, permitting the most efficient 
producers to scratch out marginally positive returns. Moreover, 
unexpected trade developments with respect to China have 
strengthened crop exports and prices. Our survey of District 
agricultural bankers found farmland values continued to trend upward 
last fall, with the increase for all of 1994 the largest annual rise 
in six years. The average loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of 1994 
was the highest for any year since 1979.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continued to strengthen in early 1995. 
Payroll employment estimates for District states were recently 
revised upward in the annual benchmarking process, and currently 
depict significantly faster employment growth in 1994 than in 1993. 
A recent survey by a large temporary help company showed further 
strengthening in Midwest employers' hiring plans in the first 
quarter of 1995, after this index climbed in 1994 to the highest 
annual average in the survey's 18-year history. This survey showed 
stronger hiring plans among manufacturers than the overall regional 
average, as has been the case since 1991, and purchasing managers' 
surveys also depicted stronger manufacturing employment growth in 
recent months. A survey by a large executive recruiting firm 
indicated that planned hiring of middle managers and professionals 
climbed in early 1995 to the strongest pace since 1984, with the 
North Central region showing the strongest hiring plans in the 
nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large staffing services firm saw "no sign of a slowdown" in its 
own temporary placements growth in early 1995. Another staffing firm 
stated that "there's more business than we can handle, and a 
tremendous shortage of applicants." This firm expected somewhat 
greater upward wage pressure in coming months. A staffing firm 
specializing in professional services reported that robust billings 
growth continued in recent months. "Clients are more than willing to 
ante up" if a good candidate is successfully recruited. The manager 
of recruitment advertising for a newspaper stated that "right now, 
we couldn't kick the business out of here with a stick." Help-wanted 
advertising in an industrial materials newsmagazine climbed to 
record levels in recent weeks. A regional analyst stated that labor 
shortages in Western Michigan continued to intensify, and noted 
increasing reports of business expansion plans being constrained by 
worker shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing input price increases showed little sign of ebbing, 
while a growing number of industrial contacts suggested that output 
price increases grew more feasible. Large retailers continued to 
stress intense competition, however, with little if any room for 
price increases. The price components of the District purchasing 
managers' surveys remained high or increased further in early 1995. 
The Chicago price component climbed in February to its highest level 
since July 1988 and its second highest level since early 1980. A 
distributor of industrial materials stated that its prices continue 
to escalate, and perhaps at a higher rate; hikes in base metal 
prices continue, while product shortages have grown more frequent. A 
plastics industry analyst stated that resin prices were still 
climbing, with prices for some products reaching all-time highs. 
Several large manufacturers stated that the strengthening recovery 
in Europe may have eased pricing constraints facing manufacturers, 
as import supplies become increasingly light. Commercial rents in 
the region have been on the rise as vacancy rates decline, according 
to realtors, with particularly strong rent increases noted for 
industrial space. A distributor stated that lumber prices have eased 
in recent months, however, citing slower demand from housing 
construction contractors.
