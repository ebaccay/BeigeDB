      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 19, 2000
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In December, Eleventh District economic 
              activity remained strong. The service sector reported strong demand, 
              and most retailers said sales were strong. The energy industry continued 
              to rebound, but there were signs of cooling for refining and petrochemicals. 
              Construction and real estate activity also was quite strong, with 
              the exception of home building, which was "slower than usual." Manufacturers 
              reported activity at roughly the same level reported in the last 
              Beige Book, but there were signs of weakening for some construction-related 
              products. Lending activity was unchanged, and deposit growth was 
              up. Agricultural conditions remained dry.
      <p>
       <b>
        Prices
       </b>
       <br/>
       Price pressures were mostly neutral, with some upward pressure from 
              higher oil prices but downward pressure from petrochemicals and 
              some construction inputs. The construction industry reported a significant 
              easing in price pressures for sheet rock, cement, and concrete, 
              which were in short supply a year ago. Lumber selling prices have 
              increased slightly but are lower than a year ago because dry weather 
              has made logging easier. As Y2K concerns eased, petrochemical producers 
              reduced inventories, which ended price increases begun last summer 
              and reduced the price of polyethylene. Margins for major product--such 
              as ethylene, propylene and styrene--are all below the level of a 
              year ago. Oil prices increased from $23 to $26 per barrel in the 
              past few weeks. Transportation firms have used hedging to mitigate 
              fuel price increases, but their margins are down, and contacts are 
              concerned about higher fuel prices. Some have instituted fuel surcharges, 
              and others are considering surcharges. Refiners say they have been 
              unable to increase product prices enough to make up for rising crude 
              prices, leading to very poor refining margins. Contacts say prices 
              for oil field equipment and services remain very competitive, with 
              no significant increases. Day rates for offshore rigs and supply 
              boats have bottomed out, however, and have begun to turn around 
              slightly.
       <p>
        Labor markets have eased in some areas but continue 
              to be very tight in parts of the District, particularly in Austin 
              and the Rio Grande Valley, where contacts say it is difficult to 
              find skilled labor and wages are up. Auto dealers reported difficulty 
              finding workers, and legal and trucking firms say they have raised 
              salaries. Temporary service firms also reported very tight labor 
              markets, but wage increases have been only "minor," which one contact 
              called "surprising." Construction contractors, such as framers, 
              were looking for work in December after being in very high demand 
              for the past few years.
        <p>
         <b>
          Manufacturing
         </b>
         <br/>
         Manufacturing activity remained strong in December, but some industries 
              saw signs of weakening. Demand continues to be fairly strong for 
              electronics and electrical equipment, particularly for communications 
              devices. Food manufacturers reported little change in demand, with 
              the exception a canned goods producer who noted a slight Y2K-related 
              increase. All food manufacturers said they were happy that inventories 
              were quite low. Paper producers said demand was up for all types 
              of products. Demand was boosted by customers double-ordering toilet 
              paper and napkins for Y2K stockpilers. Demand for construction-related 
              manufactured products was mixed--with some reporting continued strong 
              sales and others weakening sales. Lumber producers say unusually 
              warm weather and anticipation of increasing interest rates has kept 
              demand strong and up slightly from last year. Demand for metal, 
              glass and brick has also been strong. One brick company said they 
              had the "largest number of deliveries and backlog ever at the end 
              of the year," which led to low inventories. Demand for cement and 
              concrete in residential building has softened slightly in the last 
              few weeks, however, down roughly 5 percent from last year. Refining 
              is also seeing some signs of weakening. Weaker-than-expected demand 
              and warmer-than-hoped-for weather has resulted in high inventories 
              of petroleum products. Holiday travel was below normal levels according 
              to contacts, and homeowners seemed to have stocked up on fuel oil 
              in November, which led to disappointing demand and poor margins 
              in December. Gulf Coast capacity utilization held steady, but cuts 
              in production are likely in coming weeks. Demand for petrochemicals 
              remained strong in December, with domestic demand at very high levels 
              and foreign demand continuing to improve.
         <p>
          <b>
           Services
          </b>
          <br/>
          Temporary firms reported very strong demand for their services in 
              December. One firm said it has been the "best December in ten years" 
              and the "best quarter in recent memory." Demand from retail and 
              manufacturing firms was unusually strong according to contacts. 
              Manufacturing activity usually slows for a week or so in December, 
              they said, but only slowed for 2-3 days this year. Rising oil prices 
              boosted demand for temporary workers in parts of the energy sector, 
              particularly in Houston. Workers with technical and computer skills 
              continued to be in high demand, but contacts reported fewer IT-related 
              jobs, which they attributed to Y2K activities wrapping up. Legal 
              firms also saw continued strong demand for their services, despite 
              a typical December slowdown in litigation activity. Transaction 
              activity was good, especially mergers and acquisitions. Real estate 
              activity was also strong, but contacts expressed concern that higher 
              interest rates could slow activity. Transportation services reported 
              weak passenger demand in December--with airlines reporting a greater 
              than usual number of cancellations, which they attributed, in part, 
              to Y2K concerns. Rail and trucking firms said that cargo shipments 
              were unusually strong, which trucking firms attributed to firms 
              filling their inventories for Y2K. Transportation firms reported 
              unusually high uncertainty about the outlook for the coming weeks, 
              in part, because they are unsure if people were stocking up for 
              possible Y2K disruptions, which would result in fewer shipments 
              in the first quarter.
          <p>
           <b>
            Retail Sales
           </b>
           <br/>
           Retailers reported strong sales, with some reporting "phenomenal" 
              sales, but others were disappointed by demand. Internet sales were 
              explosive. Retailers said inventories are in very good shape, but 
              some with Internet sites continue to hold a lot of inventory because 
              they intentionally brought in huge amounts of product prior to Christmas 
              to ensure they would be able to fill orders. They said there was 
              little risk in pre-holiday inventory building because the industry 
              is fast growing, and they expect to work off the excess inventory 
              as more consumers turn to the web. Auto dealers reported a strong 
              December, with strong demand for all aspects of the business, including 
              new and used vehicles, service and parts, with particularly strong 
              sales of SUVs and trucks.
           <p>
            <b>
             Financial Services
            </b>
            <br/>
            Financial institutions saw no significant changes in lending activity. 
              Deposit growth was up, which contacts believe is partly because 
              of year-end bonuses, partly because of rising interest rates, and 
              partly because money that was withdrawn for Y2K is returning to 
              the banking system. Bankers reported strong profits for the year, 
              although contacts expressed concern that further interest rates 
              increases would cut into profits.
            <p>
             <b>
              Construction and Real Estate
             </b>
             <br/>
             Construction activity remained quite strong, with the exception 
              of home building, which was "slower than usual" in December but 
              showed signs of picking up some in the first week of January. Builders 
              attributed slower new home sales to higher mortgage rates and possibly 
              Y2K preoccupation or concerns. The inventory of homes remains very 
              tight. Contacts said warehouse activity was particularly hot, but 
              office, commercial, and industrial activity also was quite strong. 
              Multifamily building has pretty much dried up according to contacts, 
              who say that banks have cut off all financing. Developers note there 
              is a lot of money looking for deals, but they aren't building without 
              a buyer.
             <p>
              <b>
               Energy
              </b>
              <br/>
              The energy industry continued to rebound, with the rig count up 
              60 percent from the trough last April. The gains have been in drilling 
              for natural gas, which has reached near peak levels. Oil drilling 
              has not yet rebounded, however, which a contact attributed to distrust 
              that OPEC will sustain prices. Until recently, drilling has been 
              mostly shallow, onshore, and vertical, which has not demanded many 
              resources. Recently, however, drilling has picked up in the Gulf 
              of Mexico and gone deeper. In addition, international drilling may 
              be set for a rebound.

                Agriculture
               </b>
               <br/>
               Conditions remained dry, although snow and rain helped improve wheat 
              growth and pastures in some areas. Harvest of citrus, vegetables 
              and the remaining summer crops continued, as well as land preparation 
              for 2000 crops. Livestock conditions continued to decline, and herd 
              reduction became more widespread. Ranchers are hauling water to 
              livestock and increasing supplemental feeding--including burning 
              the stickers off prickly pear cacti so livestock can eat them.
