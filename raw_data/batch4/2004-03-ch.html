      Beige Book Report: Chicago

       March 3, 2004
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports indicated that the pace of expansion in the Seventh District economy picked up somewhat in January and early February, largely reflecting improvements in manufacturing. A broader array of manufacturers said that new orders and shipments were up during the period, and inventories remained lean. Contacts suggested that both consumer and business spending picked up, though hiring was again subdued. Construction and real estate activity also rose somewhat. Loan volumes increased slightly and overall credit quality improved. Retail price increases remained subdued, though costs and prices were reportedly increasing for many manufacturers. Reports from agricultural contacts were more upbeat, in part reflecting the higher prices being received for corn, soybeans, and milk.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contact reports were mixed, but generally suggested that consumer 
              spending rose slightly in January and February. However, some national 
              retailers said that sales gains in the Midwest were still weaker 
              than their national averages. Merchants reported that sales were 
              strongest for deeply discounted items. Contacts in casual dining 
              indicated that sales picked up across restaurant segments in January 
              and February. By contrast, District auto dealers reported that light 
              vehicle sales slowed from December to January and remained soft 
              into February. Light vehicle inventories were said to be on the 
              "high side" and many dealers remained cautious in placing new orders. 
              However, some dealers said that wintry weather contributed to higher 
              service and body shop revenues. Heavier snowfalls also helped boost 
              tourism in parts of the region. Looking ahead, most retail contacts 
              expressed optimism that consumer fundamentals are in place for stronger 
              sales growth later in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending picked up modestly again in January and early 
              February. However, firms remained somewhat cautious regarding their 
              capital spending and hiring plans. Many firms reported that capital 
              spending increases would be modest during the first quarter. A contact 
              with one large IT firm said that many CIOs were planning to increase 
              spending on storage, sales automation, and security software. Staffing 
              firms reported that new orders for temporary workers continued to 
              trend up modestly. Moreover, one large temporary help firm indicated 
              that the average number of hours per assignment had surpassed its 
              previous record high and was still rising. On balance, permanent 
              hiring remained relatively subdued. There were some new reports 
              of hiring by manufacturers, but the gains were largely offset by 
              new layoff announcements. There were, however, more frequent reports 
              of small businesses adding one or two workers to their permanent 
              payrolls. With regard to both capital spending and hiring, much 
              of the activity was geared toward replacement, rather than expansion. 
              Contacts reiterated that competition remains intense and, as a result, 
              many firms are focused on maintaining margins and market share, 
              rather than "growing the business."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction/real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports indicated that overall construction and real estate activity 
              edged up in January and early February. Sales of both new and existing 
              homes were said to be strengthening somewhat as long-term mortgage 
              interest rates declined. Some contacts suggested that the potential 
              for higher mortgage interest rates later in the year prompted some 
              "fence-sitters" to jump into the market in recent weeks. Homebuilders 
              indicated that model traffic was strong, providing them with "high-quality 
              leads." Inventories of existing homes for sale remained low, and 
              home price appreciation was described as still healthy in most areas. 
              Conditions in most nonresidential markets changed little from our 
              previous report as vacancies remained elevated and asking rents 
              were still under downward pressure. A few contacts noted a seasonal 
              uptick in office property showings and inquiries, but it had yet 
              to lead to a discernible increase in leasing activity. One contact 
              reported that lease-termination deals had subsided modestly since 
              the fourth quarter of 2003, suggesting that a recovery in office 
              markets may be drawing nearer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers reported solid gains in activity since the 
              beginning of the year. A wide array of manufacturers said that shipments 
              were up, new orders were strong, and inventories were still lean. 
              One steel contact said that the industry was experiencing the strongest 
              boom in 30 years as domestic demand for steel products remained 
              robust and demand from foreigners picked up. Orders and shipments 
              of heavy trucks strengthened further early this year, due in large 
              part to increasing freight shipments and an aging tractor fleet. 
              New orders for agricultural equipment were up sharply in January, 
              according to industry contacts, while demand for heavy construction 
              equipment remained strong. Machine toolmakers, primarily smaller 
              niche producers, noted that new orders continued to rise, leading 
              some to boost workers' hours or hire more temporary workers. One 
              toolmaker said that the volume of price inquiries was "amazing," 
              a phenomenon he attributed to a weaker dollar. After several years 
              of strong sales, automakers were expecting light vehicle demand 
              to be relatively flat in 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking/finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On balance, overall lending activity increased slightly in January 
              and early February. On the household side, a large bank reported 
              that credit card volumes were up slightly. Many bankers said that 
              mortgage applications also rose somewhat from relatively soft levels 
              toward the end of 2003. Lenders noted that declining mortgage interest 
              rates spurred some new refinancing activity and helped keep new 
              originations strong. One banker said that mortgage loan margins 
              continued to narrow with a "huge mortgage underwriting infrastructure" 
              competing for a dwindling pool of potential borrowers. Overall consumer 
              credit quality was said to be improving, and some banks were reportedly 
              loosening up on their standards. On balance, business loan volumes 
              were still flat, although demand for small business loans continued 
              to edge up. A few lenders pointed out that a good deal of the demand 
              from commercial borrowers appeared to be for funding acquisitions, 
              rather than for net expansion. Some contacts indicated that more 
              firms were applying for lines of credit, but those lines were going 
              largely unused. Business credit quality improved further from our 
              previous report, while some lenders were loosening standards on 
              business loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices/costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail price increases generally remained subdued, but input and 
              output prices appeared to be rising in manufacturing. Overall, retailers 
              continued to rely heavily on promotions, although some were said 
              to be cutting back on price discounts. Manufacturers in a variety 
              of industries reported modest price gains or less discounting for 
              their products. One steel producer said that prices for a wide range 
              of steel products, which have been rising rapidly since the second 
              quarter of 2003, will continue to increase sharply in the near term. 
              The price increases are being driven by higher demand, notably from 
              China. This also had led to some materials shortages (for scrap, 
              coke, and iron ore) and industry capacity constraints. More generally, 
              many manufacturers continued to express concern over rising natural 
              gas and materials costs. Overseas shipping costs were also reported 
              to be under pressure due to a shortage of ocean freight capacity. 
              Wage gains remained relatively subdued while benefits costs, particularly 
              for health insurance, continued to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural contacts generally reported improved conditions in 
              January and early February, with one noting that "coffee shop talk 
              is definitely upbeat." Higher corn and soybean prices have boosted 
              income from crops in most areas of the District. Many farmers continued 
              to store crops in anticipation of future price increases. Dairy 
              farmers' prospects also improved, as lower national production started 
              to push up milk prices. The livestock sector, however, continued 
              to deal with the fallout from the "mad cow" incident. Beef prices 
              have drifted lower, in large part due to some nations' continued 
              ban on beef imports from the U.S. Furthermore, feed costs were rising 
              due to new regulations for cattle feed and higher crop prices. Land 
              values and cash rents of agricultural land moved higher once again. 
              Eastern portions of the District were reported to have excellent 
              moisture levels for planting, while western portions needed considerably 
              more moisture.
