      Reports of Seventh District economic activity 
            through mid-to-late February were mixed, but the overall tone was 
            more positive than earlier in the year. Consumer spending remained 
            mostly soft in the region, though there were some signs of strength 
            in a few sectors. Real estate and construction activities were again 
            mixed, with continuing vigor on the residential side and softness 
            on the business side. Manufacturing activity was generally weak, but 
            there were more frequent reports of increasing production and new 
            orders. Lending activity appeared to increase modestly, with firming 
            loan demand from businesses. Labor markets slackened modestly, with 
            most contacts saying that the worst of the region's job losses had 
            passed. There were no new indications of intensifying pressure on 
            wages or prices at the retail level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on consumer spending through mid-February were mixed, but 
              generally indicated relatively weak spending. Several contacts reported 
              that sales results in the Midwest were softer than in other regions. 
              One discount retailer noted that sales of staples and discounted 
              items remained strong, but sales of discretionary merchandise were 
              softer. Entertainment spending was mixed. With favorable weather 
              said to be helping consumers get out and about, theater revenues 
              were reported to be up between 5 percent and 10 percent so far in 
              2002. But sales results at casual dining restaurants remained generally 
              soft, with one industry contact saying that conditions were "hard 
              to read." Regional auto sales also were said to be mixed, but generally 
              weaker than late last year. Reports on tourism and travel varied. 
              A contact with one airline reported strong load factors, and said 
              the company was planning to add 7 percent or 8 percent to its flight 
              capacity, mainly through increased domestic flights. At the same 
              time, United Airlines announced publicly that on April 1 it would 
              be calling back 1,200 of its recently furloughed flight attendants, 
              over one-third of whom are based in Chicago. Other contacts, however, 
              suggested that tourism and travel in the region was softer than 
              they had expected. Signs of intensifying pressure on retail prices 
              were virtually nonexistent, as most contacts said that customers 
              remained very value conscious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from real estate and construction contacts were also mixed; 
              residential activities generally remained brisk, while nonresidential 
              activities were slower. Low mortgage interest rates continued to 
              buoy existing home sales in the region. A contact with one of the 
              largest independent real estate companies in the District said that 
              January home sales were a record for the month and remained strong 
              in February. Home price appreciation was said to be slowing somewhat 
              from the very strong rates realized over the last few years. New 
              home sales and starts were down modestly from a year earlier, but 
              builders remained busy according to most contacts. Both realtors 
              and builders indicated that first-time buyer and trade-up homes 
              sold well, while high-end sales remained weak. Apart from some over-building 
              in the downtown Chicago condo market, contacts reported that inventories 
              of new residential units were normal to slightly low for this time 
              of year. Nonresidential building and leasing activities were again 
              soft. Office vacancies continued to increase in most metro areas, 
              though there were some isolated reports of decreases. Landlords 
              were more proactive in securing leases by offering more generous 
              incentives and lowering rental rates. Light industrial vacancy rates 
              were also increasing in most areas, albeit at very modest rates. 
              Development of new retail space remained fairly strong in some areas, 
              but contacts noted that the number of projects in pipelines was 
              falling, as a generally softer economy led some retailers to postpone 
              or cancel expansion plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained generally weak, but reports of increased 
              production and new orders became more frequent. Many contacts said 
              that with inventories very lean, the worst for the manufacturing 
              sector was over. Light vehicle sales nationwide were robust again 
              in January and through mid-February, exceeding most analysts' expectations. 
              With continued strong sales and lean inventories, General Motors 
              recently announced increases in both its production estimates for 
              the first quarter and its sales forecast for the year. Domestic 
              production of steel increased in January from very low levels. Steel 
              inventories continued to fall, according to one industry analyst, 
              and prices strengthened from very weak levels. New orders for construction 
              and consumer equipment decreased considerably in the first quarter 
              of 2002, but industry contacts noted that dealer sales were stronger 
              than expected in January and February. Pending changes in environmental 
              standards likely prompted the surge in new orders for heavy trucks 
              in January. Several contacts indicated that more restrictive emission 
              standards and heavy fines for noncompliance, scheduled to take effect 
              October 1, would pull new orders ahead into the first three quarters 
              of this year. One contact with a large producer of telecommunications 
              equipment suggested that there were more signs that the industry 
              was "in the initial stages of a recovery," and noted that inventories 
              were so low that restocking will take place even before a pickup 
              in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall lending activity appeared to pick up modestly in January 
              and February, with a few reports of firming demand for business 
              loans. Buoyed by favorable mortgage interest rates, residential 
              refinancing activity remained brisk, and contacts in some markets 
              indicated that demand for new originations was picking up. Applications 
              for home-equity loans and lines of credit were said to be increasing 
              in some areas as well. Most contacts indicated that consumer delinquency 
              rates were stable, and there was no discernible change in standards 
              and terms for household loans. Reports of business loan demand were 
              mixed, in contrast to the negative anecdotes of the past several 
              months. Some bankers noted a "real pickup" in overall demand in 
              January, while others said it remained soft. Even within the same 
              major metro area, one contact reported a pickup in commercial real 
              estate borrowing, as another said it was weaker. Industrial lending 
              generally remained weak, but a contact with one large bank in central 
              Indiana reported an increase in lending to manufacturers, who were 
              investing in both inventories and capital equipment. Most lenders 
              indicated that business loan quality stabilized somewhat in January 
              and February, and banks that had been building their loan loss reserves 
              were doing so at a slower rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to slacken in the Seventh District, but 
              most contacts indicated that the demand for labor was stabilizing. 
              One industry analyst said that the number of mass layoffs had slowed, 
              but idled workers were finding it more difficult to secure work. 
              A contact with a large staffing agency said that total billable 
              hours and revenues rose early in 2002, after sinking throughout 
              2001. This contact also noted that most of the company's regional 
              managers, who at this time last year "saw no end in sight" to the 
              industry's doldrums, expressed confidence in a rebound in the second 
              half of this year. Contacts in some industries have said that the 
              general economic slowdown has helped improve worker productivity 
              as turnover rates have decreased and managers were learning to "manage 
              better" during lean economic times. There were no new reports of 
              intensifying pressure on wages, but contacts continued to express 
              concern over rising health insurance costs.
