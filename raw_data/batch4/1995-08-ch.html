      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1995
      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic growth increased in June and early July. Consumer 
spending and housing activity remained on the higher growth path 
that developed late in the second quarter. Manufacturing output 
flattened out on a seasonally adjusted basis, following a 
significant deceleration centered in consumer durable goods 
production earlier in the year. Manufacturing inventory contraction 
abated, but many producers remain wary about inventory levels. 
District employment growth has slowed during 1995, but labor 
shortages have been partly responsible. Labor markets remain tight 
in many areas of the region. Crop prices have risen sharply, as 
yield concerns for the 1995 harvest added to earlier pressures from 
strong consumption and a cut in seeded grain acreage. Industrial 
input price increases continued to moderate, however, and prices 
have actually declined for some important industrial materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from retailing contacts suggest that District consumption 
growth remained on the higher plane that developed late in the 
second quarter. A survey of retailers in Michigan suggested that 
sales growth increased on a seasonally adjusted basis in May and 
June, led by sales of durable goods, while optimism about future 
sales gains remained high. Two large department store chains 
reported stronger apparel sales growth than earlier in the year. One 
large retailer stated that sales growth in June was boosted by an 
easier year-over-year comparison, but the gain was still stronger 
than earlier in the year, and durable goods sales continued to lead 
overall gains in early July. A large bank stated that revolving 
credit rose quite strongly in recent months, with particularly 
strong gains noted in spending on home electronics. Appliance and 
electronic firms agreed that computers and communications equipment 
continued to take a growing share of consumption spending. A large 
consumer goods manufacturer reported that sales of traditional 
television sets have remained relatively flat this year, but sales 
of large-screen TVs are "still going gangbusters," with unit sales 
growth in excess of 30 percent. An auto industry  analyst estimated 
that the net effect of rising lease expirations on new vehicle  
sales has been increasingly positive in 1994 and 1995. Most surveyed 
auto dealers stated that the leasing option continued to promote new 
vehicle sales, on balance, thus far this year. Lease renewal rates 
have been holding steady during 1995, according to one large 
automaker.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Existing home sales in the region strengthened significantly during 
June and July on a seasonally adjusted basis. Residential 
construction remained relatively flat, but homebuilder optimism 
continued to improve. A number of realtors' associations noted that 
sales gains improved in June and July, after weakening in the 
spring. One of the largest realtors in the region
characterized existing home sales market as "very active" in June, 
with transactions "unusually strong." Another large realtor stated 
that "up until May, things were kind of slow. Since May 1, however, 
we've seen a dramatic turn upward." This firm posted sales records 
in May and June, and stated that "at this point in July, things look 
very, very strong." Banks reported that residential mortgage 
applications increased considerably in recent weeks, both for new 
mortgages and refinancing, and one bank stated that it had a large 
backlog of unprocessed applications. Industrial construction 
activity continued to grow at a brisk pace, and a number of contacts 
stated that contractors in the Chicago area were "fully booked" for 
1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing output stabilized in June and July on a 
seasonally adjusted basis. The composite index for purchasing 
managers' surveys in Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee pointed to a 
significant slowdown in District industrial output in the second 
quarter. This index remained stronger than the national average, 
however, and both the Chicago and Milwaukee survey indexes firmed up 
in July. District steel production tended down along a normal 
seasonal pastern in the first three weeks of July, after declining 
on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months ended in June. An 
industry analyst reported that order books for the third quarter 
have been filling up in recent weeks, and output in July is expected 
to be the low for the third quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. 
However, this contact expected industry inventory to continue to 
decline in the third quarter. Most of the recent inventory trimming 
was concentrated in sheet products related to auto and appliance 
production. Demand for structural and plate steel used in 
construction applications and heavy equipment remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto and appliance output firmed up on a seasonally adjusted basis, 
but have yet to post any significant rebound in spite of reports of 
great retail sales growth. Light vehicle deliveries strengthened in 
June and early July, and some industry analysts even expected auto 
output to increase slightly in the third quarter. Heavy-duty truck 
order cancellations rose considerably in recent months however, and 
build plans imply a decline in assemblies by the end of the year. 
Factory shipments of major appliances weakened slightly on a 
seasonally adjusted basis during late June and the first two weeks 
of July, after strengthening in May and early June. Factory 
inventories of appliances fell sharply in June, and then flattened 
out in recent weeks. Reports from heavy machinery manufacturers 
remained relatively upbeat. For example, a construction industry 
analyst reported that unit sales of new equipment rose sharply in 
the latest reporting period (May). Year-to-date, this contact 
reported that sales in the Midwest posted the largest year-over-year 
increase in the nation, despite especially adverse weather earlier 
in the year. An air cargo firm focused on construction equipment and 
parts stated that "we had a huge June, and expect July and August to 
be just as strong."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment growth has slowed along with the overall District 
economy, but labor markets remain relatively tight and shortages 
continue to constrain growth in pans of the region. The employment 
component of purchasing managers surveys firmed up in recent months, 
after falling with the production indexes earlier in the year. A 
large daily newspaper reported that year-over-year gains in help-
wanted advertising inches have been narrowing in recent months, but 
they remain high and showed a significantly stronger year-over-year 
gain in late July than  for the year-to-date. Summarizing the 
results of a survey of Wisconsin employers, a regional analyst 
stated that labor shortages were likely to constrain growth in that 
state over the next five years. Manufacturing and services firms 
have reported continuing increases in entry-level salaries this 
year. One large bark has raised entry-level wages three times thus 
far in 1995, and has increased benefits paid to part-time workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop prices have risen sharply this summer as yield concerns for the 
1995 harvest have added to earlier pressures from strong consumption 
and a cut in seeded grain acreage. Crop conditions vary across 
District states, with ratings better-than-normal in northern areas 
and lower-than-normal in southern areas. However, compared to the 
extraordinarily high per-acre yields of last year, even normal 
yields in 1995 will translate into a sizable decline. Crops 
weathered a mid-July heat wave reasonably well, but abnormally high 
livestock losses were reported in a few localized areas. Overall, 
livestock marketings and milk production continue above the record 
pace of a year ago but a downturn in pork production is likely this 
fall. The scaling back in pork production is more evident in 
District states as production continues to expand in a few other 
fast-growing areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industrial input price increases continued to decelerate. The price 
component of the Chicago purchasing managers survey dropped 
significantly in July, to a level consistent with only modest 
increases in industrial input prices. Spot steel prices have been 
declining, mainly for sheet products, and an industry analyst stated 
that a scheduled July 1 price increase failed to materialize (in 
fact, there was a decline). Plastic resin prices stabilized in July, 
after weakening in June. Although prices charged by resin producers 
were largely unchanged in June, an industry analyst stated that 
prices charged by distributors fell, and producers turned away sales 
at lower prices and suggested customers contact distributors. A 
large air cargo firm stated that emergency orders and premium 
pricing associated with shortages have fallen off this year, even as 
orders strengthened overall in June and July.
