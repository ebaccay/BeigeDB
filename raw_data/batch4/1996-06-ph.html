      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District was increasing moderately in 
late May and early June, according to reports from various industry 
sectors. Manufacturers were continuing to see some gains in new 
orders and shipments. Retailers indicated that sales had picked up 
seasonally and were running a bit above the year-ago pace. Auto and 
light truck sales remained healthy, according to dealers, but sales 
of heavy-duty trucks have been slow. Bankers generally described 
lending as just steady overall. Residential realtors and home 
builders have seen increased sales in recent weeks. Commercial real 
estate markets were improving also, according to property managers. 
They reported a slight decline in office vacancy rates and some 
firming of rental rates since the beginning of the year, and they 
said that demand for warehouse space remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District manufacturers in early June suggested 
that industrial activity was moving up modestly. Just over one-half 
of the firms contacted said their business was steady while one-
third noted improvement. Gains were fairly widespread among the 
major manufacturing sectors in the region although lumber producers 
were seeing declining orders and instrument makers' shipments were 
falling. Overall, however, both new orders and shipments were moving 
up for area manufacturers. Area firms were also increasing 
employment, but gains appeared to be slight. On balance, 
manufacturers were trimming inventories, but there were few reports 
that stock levels were inordinately high, some firms in the paper 
and apparel industries noted higher than desired inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most area manufacturing firms reported that the prices they were 
paying for inputs and the prices they were charging for their 
products had been steady. Firms purchasing agricultural commodities 
continued to note that they were facing higher costs for raw 
materials, but most have not passed on these higher costs in the 
prices of their own products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers said that above-normal temperatures in 
early May prompted sales of seasonal merchandise, such as air 
conditioners and summer apparel, but cooler weather in late May 
limited the gains. Nonetheless, in general, merchants contacted in 
early June said they were posting year-over-year dollar increases of 
a few percent. Most also said they were limiting promotional efforts 
and keeping inventories under control.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers said sales of cars and light trucks have been good in 
recent weeks, in part because of the availability of manufacturers' 
rebates and price reductions to clear out end-of-model-year 
vehicles. Dealers continued to indicate that sales of used autos 
have been strong. A less positive trend characterizes the market for 
heavy-duty trucks, where sales have been flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers generally described loan demand as steady in 
early June. Demand for business credit has not been strong, and 
nonbank lenders have been competing for loans to middle market and 
small business firms. Bankers contacted for this report also said 
their consumer loan volumes have been essentially flat, partly 
because of slower growth in demand and partly because they were 
implementing somewhat stricter credit standards, especially for 
credit cards. Overall, Third District banks reported they were not 
adding to real estate loan volumes; however, there were reports that 
insurance companies have stepped up real estate lending in the 
region recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate agents generally reported some improvement in 
conditions in major office markets of the Third District. According 
to commercial property companies that have conducted recent surveys, 
vacancy rates have edged down since the beginning of the year in the 
Philadelphia central business district to around 15 percent, and in 
most suburban areas in Pennsylvania to a range of 10 to 14 percent. 
The vacancy rate for office buildings in southern New Jersey has 
been flat at around 21 percent. Effective rents have been firming, 
according to commercial realtors, and there were fewer large blocks 
of space available. Realtors said this could prompt some build-to-
suit or speculative office construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for industrial space, especially warehouses, has remained 
strong in the region, according to realtors. Although the vacancy 
rate for industrial space has shown little change since the 
beginning of the year, commercial real estate agents said many 
currently unoccupied buildings are obsolete and were not attracting 
occupants. Instead, companies requiring space were contracting for 
new buildings, and there was some speculative construction as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate sales have picked up in the region this 
spring, and housing construction has increased. Realtors said demand 
for new homes was relatively stronger than demand for existing homes 
and this was limiting price appreciation for existing homes that 
were being sold. Builders and realtors reported that purchases by 
first-time home buyers were underpinning sales of townhouses and 
homes at the lower end of the price range. Realtors said recent 
increases in mortgage rates did not appear to have had a significant 
effect on prospective home buyers' willingness to buy.
