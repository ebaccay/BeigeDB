      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district economy grew at a moderate pace during the 
past month. Manufacturing and construction remained strong but 
showed signs of slowing from the brisk pace of previous months. 
Retail sales improved modestly, and energy activity slowed. In the 
farm economy, income prospects improved for crop producers while 
losses continued to mount for many cattle producers. Labor markets 
remained tight in much of the district, although reports of rising 
wages remain scattered and confined mainly to retailers. Retail 
prices held steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report sales improved modestly during the 
past month and remained above last year's level. Sales of men's and 
children's apparel were particularly strong and most retailers 
expect sales in general to increase over the remainder of the year. 
Most retailers were satisfied with inventory levels, although some 
expect to expand inventories as they gear up for the holiday season. 
Automobile dealers report sales slowed somewhat from the brisk pace 
of recent months. The slowdown was due mainly to a lack of inventory 
during the changeover to new models. Demand reportedly remains 
strong, especially for light trucks and sport utility vehicles, and 
dealers expect sales to pick up after inventories of new models are 
in place.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most manufacturers continued to operate at high 
levels of capacity last month, although signs of slowing were 
evident. Manufacturing materials were generally available, with some 
recent improvement in lead times. Manufacturers were trimming 
inventories, and some expect to continue trimming over the next few 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most builders report housing starts leveled off last month 
to about last year's level. While single-family homes accounted for 
most of the construction activity, multifamily building picked up. 
Builders expect homebuilding activity to remain solid in the coming 
months with a normal seasonal slowdown toward the end of the year. 
Sales of new homes weakened during the month but remained above last 
year's pace. Inventories of unsold homes were reported at normal 
levels. Many builders report tight markets for construction labor, 
although materials were readily available. Mortgage lenders report a 
slight increase in mortgage demand over the past month and expect 
demand to remain strong in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at district banks held steady last month. 
Consumer, construction, home mortgage, and commercial and industrial 
loans remained unchanged. Commercial real estate loans showed solid 
gains, while home equity loans increased slightly and agricultural 
loans decreased. A decrease in total deposits at district banks 
resulted in slightly higher loan-deposit ratios. Large CDs slipped, 
while demand deposits, NOW accounts, IRA and Keogh accounts, and 
small time and savings deposits held roughly constant. MMDAs 
increased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      One respondent bank increased its prime rate last month. None of the 
other banks expect to change their prime rate soon. Most of the 
respondents held their consumer lending rates steady and plan to 
keep them unchanged in the near term. Almost a third of the 
respondent banks tightened their lending standards last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lower oil and natural gas prices damped activity in the 
district energy industry in recent weeks. The district rig count 
fell slightly in August but remained 5.6 percent above year-ago 
levels. In contrast, coal production in Wyoming continued to record 
strong gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's corn and soybean crops remained in 
excellent condition during the past month. The crops are maturing on 
schedule and the chances of widespread damage from an early frost 
this fall are small. With corn and soybean prices strong, district 
crop farmers should enjoy a significant income boost this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Income prospects for district livestock producers are not so bright. 
Cattle feeders have returned to thin profits recently, while 
ranchers continue to post substantial losses. In response to ongoing 
losses, many district ranchers have trimmed their herds 
significantly this summer. Industry participants report contraction 
in the cattle numbers could end this fall due to improved pasture 
conditions, ample hay supplies, and expectations that corn prices 
will drop as the harvest gets under way. Having sustained losses 
earlier in the year, most cattle feedlots in the district operated 
well below capacity during the past month. The cutback in cattle on 
feed has reduced beef supplies enough to push prices slightly above 
break-even levels. Nevertheless, many bankers expect a heavy inflow 
of calves into district feedlots this fall, which could renew 
downward pressure on cattle prices and erode profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      District bankers report stronger crop loan portfolios and weaker 
livestock loan portfolios than a year ago. Bankers in wheat-growing 
areas in the district report that high wheat prices have generally 
offset a disappointing wheat harvest, leaving the quality of loan 
portfolios unchanged. Bankers in areas growing corn and soybeans 
expect their loan quality to improve this year. In contrast, bankers 
report some continued erosion in the quality of ranching loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Entry-level and skilled workers remain in short 
supply in much of the district, and reports of rising wages among 
retailers have increased somewhat. Wages in the manufacturing and 
construction sectors, however, remained generally stable despite the 
tight labor markets. Prices continued to hold steady at the retail 
level, with retailers expecting little change in the months ahead. 
District manufacturers also report stable input prices.
