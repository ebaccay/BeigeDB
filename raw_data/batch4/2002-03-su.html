       March 6, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of Federal Reserve districts 
              report some signs of improvement in economic conditions in January 
              and early February. The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, 
              Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts note some pickup in activity, 
              Chicago cites a more positive tone, and Kansas City and St. Louis 
              say that economic activity is weak, but there are some bright spots. 
              Cleveland indicates that although some positive signs continue to 
              emerge, overall business conditions in the district have neither 
              improved nor deteriorated compared with the end of last year. New 
              York reports mixed signals, and Dallas notes continued weak activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts say that manufacturing 
              activity is generally weak, but selected industries in some areas 
              are showing more positive results. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
              Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco report 
              modest improvements in retail sales recently compared with the end 
              of last year. Retail results were more mixed in the other districts. 
              Districts indicate that residential real estate markets are generally 
              stronger than commercial markets. Reports on demand for bank loans 
              are mixed across the districts. Warm, dry weather figures prominently 
              in agricultural reports. Warm weather and the slow global economy 
              have contributed to weaker energy demand.
      <p>
       Labor markets continue to be slack 
              in most districts, with many citing business contacts who have suspended 
              bonuses, frozen wages, or skipped annual salary increases. However, 
              contacts at temporary employment firms in several districts suggest 
              employment is bottoming out, and new hires in selected occupations 
              are said to be in short supply. While wage and price pressures are 
              described as "subdued" to "largely nonexistent," business contacts 
              in many districts mentioned rising health insurance costs. Firms 
              in most districts indicate that their purchase and selling prices 
              are generally stable, but Dallas reports upward pressure on services 
              prices and declining prices for chemicals and paper, while Cleveland 
              notes an increase in spot market prices for steel.
       <p>
        <b>
         Retail
        </b>
        <br/>
        Most districts report that retail sales during January and February 
              were unchanged from a year earlier, but several noted improvement 
              in early 2002 compared with late 2001. In addition, the Philadelphia, 
              Atlanta, and Kansas City districts say that sales were higher in 
              early 2002 than a year earlier. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas 
              City, and San Francisco indicate that while tourism continues to 
              be weak, it has improved since the second half of 2001. Home furnishings 
              and appliances were reported to be growing strongly in the Cleveland, 
              Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts. Philadelphia, 
              St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco note that motor vehicle sales 
              remain solid, but are down from the rapid pace set in the fourth 
              quarter of 2001 because price promotions have ended; Dallas also 
              reports that automobile dealer profit margins are lower.
        <p>
         Wage and price pressures in the retail 
              sector are virtually nonexistent. Retail employment is said to be 
              stable in Boston, but down in the Richmond and San Francisco districts. 
              Most districts indicate that retail contacts expect flat to slightly 
              increasing sales during the first half of 2002; only retailers in 
              the St. Louis and Philadelphia districts expect somewhat stronger 
              sales growth during this period. The Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas 
              City districts say that retailers expect sales growth to resume 
              at a modest pace during the second half of 2002.
         <p>
          <b>
           Manufacturing
          </b>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing activity is reported to be generally weak but showing 
              signs of improvement in at least some industries. The most positive 
              reports come from Philadelphia and Richmond, indicating "moderate" 
              or "solid" growth in manufacturing shipments and orders during January 
              and February. Many districts report that recent manufacturing activity 
              has been "mixed." By contrast, Kansas City says manufacturing production 
              "fell further below year-ago levels," while Dallas says it "remained 
              weak." Among districts commenting on expectations for this year, 
              all signal that either a majority or a growing fraction of manufacturers 
              expect higher production by the second half of the year.
          <p>
           Cleveland and Chicago report a pickup 
              in automotive production in response to higher demand; decreases 
              in other districts were said to be due partly to winter storm conditions. 
              Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco note stabilization or 
              slight improvement in demand for high-tech products, which their 
              contacts attributed largely to lean finished goods inventories in 
              these sectors. St. Louis and Dallas indicate that petrochemical 
              and oil refinery production has been sluggish. Reports on most other 
              industries are mixed, with increased production in some parts of 
              the country and decreased production in others.
           <p>
            Throughout the nation, manufacturers 
              are said to be experiencing flat or declining costs for materials 
              and energy. Selling prices are reported to be mostly flat, but several 
              districts mention modest increases in steel prices from low levels.
            <p>
             Some districts comment that manufacturers are 
              no longer cutting back on labor to the same degree they did in 2001. 
              For example, Cleveland mentions that manufacturing employment has 
              fallen but that widespread layoffs in steel and aerospace appear 
              to have subsided. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia and Richmond 
              districts also are said to be reducing regular employment but holding 
              steady or increasing the length of the workweek.
             <p>
              <b>
               Nonfinancial Services
              </b>
              <br/>
              Although services industries were mostly sluggish or flat in recent 
              months, selected industries reported improvements. Boston notes 
              rising demand for software products and related services. In the 
              Cleveland district, for the first time in more than a year, significant 
              numbers of contacts in the trucking and shipping industry noted 
              improvement. Dallas reports that law firms and accounting firms 
              note strengthening demand for work on litigation, bankruptcy, auditing, 
              and taxes. Demand for communication services improved in the San 
              Francisco district.
              <p>
               Conditions in the temporary labor 
              market continue to be slack in most reporting districts, but the 
              worst seems to be over. District reports suggest that widespread 
              layoffs have subsided and demand for workers appears to be stabilizing. 
              The Richmond district is the most upbeat, with reports of strengthening 
              demand for temporary workers in recent weeks. Atlanta notes improvement 
              in outplacement activity, even though labor market conditions remain 
              weak. Other districts indicate that ample supplies of labor are 
              still readily available, although certain areas of employment in 
              some districts bucked the sluggish trend. The legal industry in 
              New York exhibited strong demand for temps; employers in the Richmond 
              district are seeking light industry workers and customer service 
              representatives; and, in Dallas, demand was strong for administrative 
              and clerical positions, and in the banking and retail industries 
              and some professional services.
               <p>

                <br/>
                Loan demand is generally mixed in the reporting districts. Dallas, 
              Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco report falling overall 
              demand while Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond report 
              mixed results. Overall lending activity is picking up in St. Louis 
              and Chicago. Demand for consumer loans is down or continues to be 
              soft in the Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia districts, but 
              Atlanta is experiencing growth in demand. Commercial and industrial 
              loan demand is similarly mixed, with Philadelphia and St. Louis 
              reporting increasing demand, Cleveland and Kansas City showing lower 
              demand, and the Chicago, Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts 
              all indicating stable or mixed demand. Mortgage and refinancing 
              loan volumes are steady to strong in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas 
              City, and Richmond districts, with only New York and Philadelphia 
              reporting slowing demand. New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco 
              all report stricter loan requirements, while the requirements in 
              Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and Richmond are reportedly unchanged. 
              Delinquency rates are stable in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and 
              New York. Cleveland and Philadelphia report some decline in loan 
              applicant quality. Richmond reports that stock market investors 
              are "in a holding pattern," and Atlanta's contacts note that there 
              is little new money entering the venture capital industry.

                 </b>
                 <br/>
                 Real estate markets are mixed, with commercial markets almost universally 
              said to be weak while the residential segment remains strong. Increased 
              office vacancy rates are reported in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
              Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and 
              San Francisco districts. The rise in available commercial space 
              has been exacerbated by active sublease markets and additional construction 
              in some areas. Office rents have declined moderately compared with 
              a year earlier. Consequently, commercial construction activity has 
              slowed in most reporting districts.
                 <p>
                  Residential markets remained steady 
              or strengthened during the last two months. Home sales and demand 
              for houses are reported to be strong in the New York, Philadelphia, 
              Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco 
              districts. Lower-priced home sales are especially strong, while 
              demand for the high-end segment of the market has weakened in a 
              few districts. New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis 
              note increased home sale prices compared with a year earlier. New 
              home construction was unchanged or increased in Cleveland, St. Louis, 
              and Minneapolis, but was lower than a year ago in Kansas City.

                   <br/>
                   The unusually warm, dry weather in much of the country dominates 
              news from the agricultural sector. The dry spell has resulted in 
              poor conditions for the winter wheat crop or has reduced winter 
              pasturage in the Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas 
              districts. As a result, Dallas district ranchers are reducing their 
              herds. But in San Francisco, where farmers have already cut their 
              inventories of cattle and field crops, they now report improved 
              prices. Despite producer concerns about the farm economy, Kansas 
              City district bankers indicate that farmers' balance sheets remain 
              strong, thanks to steady land values and government support. St. 
              Louis contacts also report a slight rise in land values. Looking 
              ahead, Dallas notes that preparation for the corn and cotton crop 
              is on schedule, and that, despite a cotton surplus and low prices, 
              farmers are planning to plant as normal. In the St. Louis district, 
              farmers expect to plant less wheat and cotton than last year; however, 
              they are waiting for passage of the federal farm bill before finalizing 
              their plans.
                   <p>
                    According to the Atlanta and Dallas 
              districts, the second warmest U.S. weather on record for November 
              through January plus global economic weakness have damped demand 
              for heating oil and natural gas and have kept prices low. Minneapolis 
              reports that drilling activity has fallen slightly in recent weeks, 
              while Kansas City notes that the district's count of active oil 
              and gas drilling rigs remains near the two-year low hit in late 
              2001. In the Dallas district, energy activity shows signs of bottoming 
              out and stocks of crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas are all 
              well above last year's levels. Because firms storing natural gas 
              will not want to hold it over the summer, many Dallas contacts expect 
              significant downward pressure on natural gas prices this spring. 
              In the case of mining, Minneapolis iron ore production is up slightly 
              from late 2001 levels and is nearing more normal levels. In Kansas 
              City, higher coal prices have encouraged increased activity.
