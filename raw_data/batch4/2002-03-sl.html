      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 6, 2002
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite some bright spots, economic activity 
            in the District continues to be weak. Retail sales in December and 
            January were generally at or just below their level from a year earlier, 
            although retailers are mildly optimistic about the upcoming months. 
            The manufacturing sector has been mixed, with some industries continuing 
            to face reduced orders while others have begun to recover. The residential 
            real estate sector has picked up and remains relatively strong throughout 
            most of the District. New housing permits continue to be issued at 
            a higher level than a year earlier. Commercial real estate markets 
            have continued to be stagnant throughout the District, with rising 
            delinquencies in at least one area. Driven by rising real estate loans 
            and loans to banks outside of the District, total loans outstanding 
            at small- and medium-sized banks have risen significantly. Agricultural 
            producers in the District anticipate reduced planted acreage for wheat 
            and cotton in the upcoming year, although there is a great deal of 
            uncertainty as farmers await the passage of the new farm bill.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts report that retail sales in December and January were, 
              on average, at or just below their year-earlier levels, and just 
              under one-half noted that sales had been lower than expected while 
              nearly as many noted that sales were higher than expected. Apparel, 
              shoes, home entertainment and dcor, health and beauty products, 
              and seasonal items were strong sellers while jewelry, gift items, 
              and collectibles moved more slowly. Despite a slow season, most 
              contacts noted that inventories were at desired levels, while only 
              20 percent reported excess inventory. Contacts remain mildly optimistic 
              about the next few months, with about one-half expecting slightly 
              higher sales compared with the same period last year, while most 
              of the rest expect the same level of sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District report that sales 
              in December were higher, on average, but have tapered off since 
              the end of the year. Almost all contacts attribute this pattern 
              to financing incentives and rebates offered by manufacturers on 
              new cars, the most aggressive of which have ended recently. Several 
              dealers reported that, because of ongoing rebate offers, new cars 
              continue to sell better than used cars, causing new-car inventories 
              to be okay-to-low and used-car inventories to be okay-to-high. About 
              one-half of the contacts noted higher rejection rates for finance 
              applications, while the other half have seen no change. Although 
              individual responses about car sales in the next few months varied 
              from very optimistic to very pessimistic, the average dealer was 
              neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's manufacturing sector continues to be weak. Steel, 
              fabric, apparel, paper, auto, oil and gas, and building supplies 
              are among the industries facing reduced orders. Most manufacturers 
              do not expect a turnaround until the second half of 2002. Despite 
              the overall slowdown, a few District firms in the food, coal, energy, 
              and ink industries have been expanding. Districtwide, contacts in 
              the service sector continue to report business as being flat-to-slow 
              compared with the same period last year. In order to cut costs, 
              many firms have decreased advertising expenditures, although a few 
              contacts in the advertising industry noted recovery in television 
              advertising revenues. Contacts in the telecommunications industry 
              are taking a "wait and see" attitude, expecting earnings to rise 
              in the second half of 2002. The tourism industry continues to slow, 
              as contacts in the hotel industry have been reporting a drop in 
              occupancy rates, resulting in reduced profits and layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate sales have picked up across most of the 
              District, with the exception of northern Mississippi, where the 
              number of homes for sale has risen to a historically high level. 
              December 2001 year-to-date sales in northern Arkansas and Memphis 
              improved over year-earlier levels. Residential sales in central 
              Kentucky continue to do well given the time of the year. A contact 
              in St. Louis reports that a rising quantity of bulk warehouse and 
              general office space, falling rents, and falling absorption rates 
              indicate a buyer's market for commercial real estate. Similarly, 
              Memphis and Louisville finished the year with an excess of office 
              and sublease space due to the failure of Internet businesses. Office-rent 
              delinquencies for Class B and Class C properties in northern Arkansas 
              are slightly higher than normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction opportunities continue 
              to grow, as December year-to-date permit levels were higher than 
              year-earlier levels in most of the District's metropolitan areas. 
              Government-sponsored construction opportunities remain strong in 
              the Kentucky and Indiana portions of the District with the approval 
              of projects for highway and bridge construction as well as projects 
              for public facilities such as libraries and jails. Commercial contractors 
              in Arkansas and western Tennessee report commercial building has 
              been slow over the past few months, but they remain optimistic for 
              2002.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans outstanding at a sample of small- and medium-sized District 
              banks rose by 15.7 percent between late November last year and late 
              January this year. This significant increase stems from an increase 
              in real estate loans, which rose by 22.5 percent over the same period, 
              and loans to other commercial banks in the rest of the country, 
              which rose by 26.2 percent. Commercial and industrial loans and 
              loans to individuals have also increased over the period, growing 
              by 3.5 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Total deposits at these 
              banks were 15 percent higher over the same period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in central and northeastern Arkansas, 
              and western Tennessee have reported strong loan demand, particularly 
              for residential lending. Bankers in northeast Mississippi and western 
              Tennessee reported high past-due loan ratios and high bankruptcy 
              filings. Nonetheless, they consider themselves in a good position 
              with high liquidity and loan loss reserves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although crop prices generally remain below last year's levels, 
              one contact reported that District agricultural land values rose 
              by about 5.5 percent last year, with faster appreciation in the 
              District's northern states. Despite more favorable planting weather 
              last fall, District winter wheat producers reduced planted acreage 
              by 7 percent, down 20 percent since 2000. A major survey of U.S. 
              cotton farmers' 2002 planting intentions shows a modest decrease 
              (-6.7%) in acreage from a year earlier. Based on survey results, 
              farmers in the Mid-South region plan to decrease planted acreage 
              by almost 20 percent. Cotton industry contacts report that large 
              domestic and international supplies of cotton in the United States 
              are expected to keep cotton prices relatively low in the foreseeable 
              future. As the 2002 planting season fast approaches, contacts reported 
              that they were uncertain about their crop plans for the year as 
              farmers anxiously await the passage of the new farm bill in Washington.
