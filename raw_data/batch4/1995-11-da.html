      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace 
in September and early October. Demand for most manufactured 
products was unchanged or slower, and retail sales remained weak. 
Financial institutions reported steady loan demand, and energy and 
agricultural conditions were unchanged since the last Beige Book. On 
a more positive note, demand for most types of real estate continued 
to edge up, cargo shipments were up slightly and demand for business 
services continued to rise strongly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, there were few reports of price or wage pressures. 
Scattered wage pressures were reported by service firms who 
continued to have problems finding skilled workers. Several 
manufacturers also reported a lack of skilled laborers but had not 
raised wages. Natural gas prices rose and were slightly higher than 
last year, but oil prices held steady. Transportation fees continued 
to fall because of rising competition. Retailers reported that 
discounting was heavier than last year. Agricultural prices were up 
slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, orders were soft for Eleventh District manufacturers. The 
notable exception was the electronics industry where contacts 
reported rising demand for semiconductors and computer products. 
Orders for most construction-related products held steady, but 
several contacts expected sales to improve as a result of rising 
housing starts and robust commercial construction activity. Demand 
for corrugated boxes was unchanged since the last Beige Book but 
contacts said they were trying to work down a recent inventory 
buildup. Although the outlook for the paper industry is not as 
strong as it was earlier in the year, respondents said they expect 
demand to pick up in 1996. Orders for food products weakened 
slightly, but contacts were still pleased with the levels of demand. 
Apparel orders fell because of weak retail sales, and several 
apparel contacts said they were laying off employees or initiating 
hiring freezes. Demand for chemicals continued to weaken and 
respondents said inventories were beginning to build up. Although 
prices were weaker than earlier this year, Gulf Coast firms remained 
profitable and were proceeding with expansion plans. Refiners 
reported seasonal weakness, with demand for oil products slack as 
the summer driving season ended. Despite a slight decline in 
domestic drilling activity, international activity and strong 
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico kept demand steady for oil services 
and machinery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business services continued to increase at a healthy 
pace. Litigation remained strong, but business transactions 
services-such as initial public offerings, real estate and banking- 
were even stronger. Although contacts said they were still very 
cost-conscious, hiring was up slightly. Overall, fees remained 
competitive, but some firms were able to raise prices as a result of 
increasing demand. Respondents were bullish about the next six 
months, with only one cloud on the horizon: finding enough resources 
to handle all the work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transportation services firms reported mixed changes in demand: 
passenger airlines reported a slight decline, while cargo 
transportation demand was flat to slightly higher. Contacts in the 
cargo industry said that demand had increased from firms that 
produce paper, building products, electronics and food products. 
Trucking firms reported heightened efforts to recruit and retain 
qualified drivers. Heavy competition resulted in discounting at 
trucking firms, but prices for passenger transportation increased 
slightly. Cautious optimism characterized the outlook for both cargo 
and air passenger transportation industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to respondents, district retail sales remained weak in 
September, growing more slowly than the national average. Several 
contacts said that inventories were rising but had not reached 
alarming levels. Contacts said that sales along the Texas/Mexico 
border continued to decline, and most expected Christmas sales to be 
below last year's levels. Automobile sales were down slightly from 
the last Beige Book, but were above year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District financial Institutions reported steady loan demand 
and competition for loans remained strong. Respondents were 
cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the next six to twelve 
months. Contacts said talks of mergers and acquisitions in the 
Eleventh District have heightened in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate activity improved slightly. Although 
apartment construction declined because of overbuilding concerns, 
rental demand remained strong. Single-family construction picked up 
as buyers took advantage of lower mortgage rates. Demand for 
industrial space was very strong and several contacts were 
considering speculative projects. Demand for suburban office space 
remained strong and rents continued to edge upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in energy markets have not changed much in the past two 
months. A series of hurricanes that threatened production and 
refining along the Gulf Coast provided the only excitement. The 
price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil remained firmly fixed 
between $17 and $18 per barrel, except for a brief period of $18 
prices when hurricane Marilyn visited the Caribbean in late 
September. Natural gas prices have been volatile, as hot weather 
boosted demand and hurricanes curtailed production. At $1.70-$1.75 
per thousand cubic feet, October gas prices were reported to be 
above last years levels. While overall domestic drilling activity 
was down slightly, activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been unchanged 
since spring 1994 and international activity is ahead of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural conditions were unchanged. Although September rains 
slowed planting and harvesting progress (for some crops, most 
contacts said they expected corn, peanut, citrus and pecan 
production to be up this year. Parts of South Texas continued to 
suffer from very dry conditions, and the cotton crop was reduced by 
severe insect problems. A price index of Texas farm products 
increased slightly in August and again in September, with higher 
crop prices offsetting lower cattle and calf prices.
