      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from contacts provided a mixed but positive 
picture of the District economy through mid-July. While retail sales 
generally have been above year-ago levels, they have been below 
merchants' expectations for this summer. Manufacturers slowed 
production seasonally in July, and many revised downward their 
expectations for growth through the end of the year. While tourism 
generally has been strong in most of the District, several popular 
regional travel destinations have reported year-over-year declines 
in business. Home sales and construction continue to outpace year-
ago levels, but Realtors and builders have become more cautious 
about their prospects for the remainder of the year. Commercial and 
multifamily real estate markets continue to improve, and Realtors 
report that the number of speculative developments underway in the 
District is increasing. Bankers noted that overall loan demand 
improved slightly during the last month, with commercial lending 
growing more rapidly than consumer lending. Although several local 
area labor markets continue to be tight, wage pressures remain 
muted. Factory and retail contacts reported little change in the 
prices they are receiving for goods and services rendered.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A majority of District retailers reported year-
over-year increases in sales through mid-July, although many also 
commented that sales have been below their expectations. While sales 
of apparel have improved over this period, sales of durable goods, 
particularly home products, have slowed. Retailers generally say 
that they expect flat to modest increases in fall sales compared to 
year-ago levels. Inventories were characterized as on target 
throughout the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory activity slowed seasonally in July, with 
contacts reporting decreases in production and shipments in most 
industries. Inventories of finished goods increased, and contacts 
reported that they were less optimistic than before about the near-
term outlook for their businesses. An increasing number of firms 
expect new orders to slow in the next few months, with production 
remaining relatively flat over the period. Apparel producers 
continue to report declines in overall business along with plant 
consolidations and closings. By contrast, producers of home 
furniture and appliances expect to see modest improvement through 
the end of the year, as recent home buyers furnish their new 
domiciles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism and business travel continues 
to be strong in most of the District through mid-July. Approximately 
two million visitors are expected to visit Atlanta and other 
District cities during the Summer Olympic Games. However, while many 
local sites have seen significant gains in tourism prior to and 
during the first week of the Olympics, in Atlanta contacts 
characterized the situation as "feast or famine." Generally, heavy 
spending near Olympic venues has provided a notable contrast to the 
disappointingly light traffic recorded at some of the District's 
other traditional tourist destinations, and a large suburban sports-
related festival was prematurely closed after very light attendance. 
As of this writing, the tragedy in Centennial Olympic Park has had 
no negative impact on event attendance, and is unlikely to have any 
notable economic consequence. Outside of the Olympic spotlight, many 
cities in Florida have benefited from a surge in tourism and 
business travel, much of which has been fueled by the large number 
of Atlantans who are vacationing and doing business outside of the 
city for the duration of the Games.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most real estate contacts reported that single-family 
home sales were above year-ago levels in June and early July. 
However, builders said that by mid-July the pace of home 
construction had slowed from the rapid pace recorded earlier in the 
year. Contacts in much of Georgia reported year-over-year declines 
in homebuilding in the last two months, although gains were reported 
in northern Alabama and Nashville. Most Realtors characterized 
current home inventory levels as adequate, although supplies remain 
tight in some local areas. Realtors generally said that their 
outlook had become more cautious in the last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Multifamily homebuilding and commercial construction continue to 
improve in most areas. Low vacancy rates and rising rents continue 
to support new industrial and office development, although the pace 
of retail construction has moderated. While most commercial projects 
continue to be build-to-suit, several speculative developments are 
underway, and more are expected to be announced in the next six 
months. Most real estate agents anticipate moderate-to-strong growth 
in commercial and multifamily construction through the end of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts in the banking industry, overall 
loan demand rose in July compared with June, although it was flat 
when compared with year-ago levels. While mortgage lending generally 
has held steady, auto lending slowed during the month. Commercial 
lending improved moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts generally said that wages were stable 
over the last month, with fewer complaints of labor shortages being 
reported. While service and retail sector employers continue to note 
a lack of applications for entry-level positions, a majority of 
contacts in the skilled professions characterized labor supplies as 
adequate. Fewer contacts expect to hire new employees than was the 
case in early summer. Manufacturers and retailers both indicated 
that prices remain subject to intense competitive pressures, both 
from international firms seeking to increase their share of U.S. 
markets, as well as from domestic consumers who remain vigilant in 
their search for bargain-basement prices.
