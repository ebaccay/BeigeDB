      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports from contacts in the District suggest that the 
Southeast economy grew moderately in January and February, despite 
the adverse effects of some locally harsh winter weather. Retail 
sales in January were damped throughout much of the District by 
weather conditions which forced stores to close or cut hours; 
however, some retailers report a rebound in February. Manufacturing 
performance edged up, halting a slowdown reported previously, but 
near-term expectations became more restrained. Tourism and business 
travel continued to grow vigorously throughout the District. 
Although bad weather slowed construction in many areas of the 
District, single-family home sales picked up in January and February 
after slowing at the end of last year. Commercial and multifamily 
markets continued to improve. Bankers characterized overall loan 
demand as mixed. Most contacts reported that wages and prices 
remained steady.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
        <br/>
       </strong>
       District retailers report that January sales were 
weak around the region; February sales results continued to be weak 
in the northern part of the District but rebounded in the south. 
Merchants in the north, an area hit by harsh winter weather, 
reported disappointing sales in February. Many stores operated on 
restricted hours or closed their doors because of icy conditions 
early in the month. As a result, inventories are a little heavy. 
These retailers noted that sales picked up at the end of February as 
the weather warmed up. Merchants in warmer climates reported a year-
over-year rise in sales in February--a rebound from January--and 
describe current inventories as on target. Retailers throughout the 
District are optimistic that spring sales will exceed year-ago 
levels.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
         <br/>
        </strong>
        Factory performance improved in late January and 
February after two weak months, with modest gains in shipments and 
production, according to most industry spokespersons. The volume of 
new orders also picked up, and more employers added to their 
payrolls. Most contacts said inventories declined moderately. 
Expectations of future improvements in manufacturing conditions 
generally declined, despite the recent pickup in activity. Contacts 
generally expect production, new orders, employment, and the 
workweek to wane over the next six months; however, they expect 
capital spending to continue to increase as manufacturers seek to 
become more competitive in domestic and international markets. A 
regional producer of industrial machinery reports that strong 
foreign markets have increased his firm's order backlogs. Electrical 
and electronic equipment producers across the District also report 
increasing business. Regional chemical producers continue to operate 
at full capacity. By contrast, suppliers to the auto industry 
describe conditions within the District as sluggish. Some apparel 
producers report continued weakness in their industry, with the 
factory workweek and volume of new orders remaining below year-ago 
levels. Orders are declining for a paper manufacturer, and packagers 
note slowing production and sales.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Tourism and Business Travel
          <br/>
         </strong>
         The tourism, convention, and business 
travel industry continues to lift the region's economy. 
Representatives for Atlanta's tourist industry say the area's 
convention attendance is surging and is not expected to decline this 
year over last, even though the Olympics will engage major 
facilities in a portion of the summer. Officials for South Florida's 
tourism industry report that hotel and motel bookings hit a peak in 
February with Northerners escaping the miserable weather. The number 
of domestic, European, and Brazilian tourists has increased 
significantly in Florida, but Mexican tourists have stayed away. 
Tourism officials expect that hotel occupancies in New Orleans will 
be greater in 1996 than in 1995 because of a series of large 
meetings booked there and a continued strong flow of visitors to the 
city's attractions.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction
           <br/>
          </strong>
          Most real estate contacts reported that single-family 
home sales rebounded in January and February after slowing at the 
end of last year. Home sales in January and February generally 
surpassed last year's disappointing levels. However, construction 
was slow in many areas because of extreme cold. Inventories of new 
and existing homes continue to run low in several markets. Most 
Realtors and builders expect a strong spring housing market.
          <p>
           Contacts from across the District report that commercial and 
multifamily real estate markets continue to improve. Low vacancy 
rates and higher rents continue to propel new apartment and office 
development. While most commercial projects continue to be build-to-
suit, several speculative developments are underway and more are 
anticipated this year. The retail market remains strong in most 
areas, but several contacts report an increase in vacancy rates 
after some stores went out of business following the holiday season. 
Most real estate professionals continue to anticipate that new 
commercial and multifamily construction will grow this year.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Financial Services
             <br/>
            </strong>
            Contacts in the banking industry described 
overall loan demand as mixed. As in previous reports, contacts in 
most areas report that commercial lending is stronger than consumer 
lending. Mortgage refinancing continues to increase, but several 
contacts noted that auto lending remains weak and credit card 
delinquencies are on the rise.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Wages and Prices
              <br/>
             </strong>
             Wages generally remain stable in the region since 
the previous Beigebook, even with scattered reports of labor 
shortages. Most contacts say that prices paid for materials and 
finished goods have remained essentially unchanged. Fewer contacts 
than in our previous survey anticipate that prices paid for 
materials or finished goods will increase over the next few months.
