      Economic activity remained mixed in the Fourth 
                District during April and May, with some industries reporting 
                improvements and others reporting deterioration over this period. 
                On the positive side, most manufacturing contacts noted steady 
                or improving production and sales, with the expectation that conditions 
                would continue to improve in the near future. Residential homebuilders 
                reported strong year-over-year gains in April and May (2002 was 
                a record-sales year). Banking, for the second consecutive report, 
                noted some improvement in commercial loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Still, some signs of weakness persisted in the 
                economy. Retailers continued to characterize the retail environment 
                as soft. Auto dealers reported slowing sales. Commercial builders 
                continued to report depressed economic activity. Trucking and 
                shipping contacts noted a downturn in activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts in manufacturing and residential 
                construction expect conditions to continue improving within the 
                next six months, although contacts in retail, trucking and shipping, 
                and commercial construction all seemed pessimistic about prospects 
                for the last half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The labor supply remains plentiful, and those firms that are 
                hiring reported no difficulty in finding qualified labor. Although 
                most firms indicated plans to maintain or augment their current 
                workforces, a few firms did report that they planned layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, prices remained stable in this reporting 
                period. The exception appeared to be both rolled and specialty 
                steel--prices continued to fall for these commodities in April 
                and May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      As was the case in the last report, most manufacturers noted that 
                production and sales in May were steady or improving on both a 
                monthly and year-over-year basis. Finished goods inventories are 
                still lower than year-ago levels for most producers, and the level 
                of idle capacity appears to have decreased from the last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Roughly one-third of our contacts noted that they 
                were hiring, one-third noted keeping their workforce steady, and 
                the remaining one-third reported staff reductions. Roughly half 
                our contacts noted overtime in recent weeks. Regarding the outlook, 
                more than half our contacts expect production and sales to increase 
                in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto production fell at most plants in the District in April 
                and May, with Districtwide production roughly 10 percent below 
                2002 levels, adjusting for models that moved production or were 
                discontinued. Four of the five major auto producers in the District 
                reported a decline in production from April to May--the declines 
                ranged from 15 percent to 25 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for rolled steel softened in May, with contacts 
                reporting production roughly 5 percent to 10 percent below April 
                levels. Prices continued to fall, and are roughly 10 percent to 
                15 percent below their level at the close of 2002. Many contacts 
                noted that they would lay-off workers if they were not constrained 
                by labor contracts--others noted either a planned workforce reduction 
                negotiated into next year's labor contract or temporary two-week 
                layoffs. Contacts do not expect conditions to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specialty steel producers, however, have seen an 
                increase in demand, and sales have increased roughly 5 percent 
                to 10 percent from one month ago, but they are still below 2002 
                levels. Unlike firms in the rolled-steel industry, specialty steel 
                producers reported either calling back laid-off employees or expanding 
                their workforces.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers continued to characterize the retail environment as 
                soft in April and May, with many contacts reporting below-plan 
                sales and either flat or year-over-year decreases in comparable 
                store sales. Mall traffic continues to be down, and apparel sales 
                have been poor, in part due to the cool weather. Some contacts 
                noted that they had hoped for a pickup in sales with the resolution 
                of the military campaign in Iraq, but this pickup did not materialize.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices remained stable in May, and contacts continued 
                to manage inventories very conservatively. Although labor is plentiful, 
                very few contacts are hiring. Most of our contacts expected flat 
                sales in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers also noted sluggish activity. 
                Despite some improvement in sales in early March, sales for March 
                and April were below expectations--one contact noted sales had 
                dropped off as much as 25 percent from the previous year. In terms 
                of the aggressive incentives being offered, consumers do not appear 
                to be as responsive to the current offers as automakers and dealers 
                had hoped. Inventories at dealerships have been rising: Contacts 
                reported inventories from near seventy-day to ninety-day supplies, 
                well over the sixty-day supply that most dealers try to maintain. 
                Contacts did not expect conditions to improve--most expect sales 
                growth to remain flat through the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders reported strong sales in April and May, with many 
                builders reporting sales increases of more than 10 percent over 
                the high level of sales one year ago (2002 was a record-sales 
                year for most of our builders)--one contact reported that April 
                was his best month on record. The strength in homebuilding does 
                not appear to be attributable to one or two specific housing markets; 
                rather, it appears to be spread across the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial builders, on the other hand, continued 
                to report poor conditions. One contact noted that the work his 
                firm currently has is not new business, but, rather, projects 
                that were postponed last year. Another contact noted that lending 
                activity appears to be constraining demand: Although some clients 
                are interested in pursuing new building projects, the narrowing 
                spread for lenders appears to leave them reluctant to lend money 
                for projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although activity from health-care projects has 
                slowed some in recent months (most contacts believe it is due 
                to consolidation in the industry), the health-care industry continues 
                to be one of the few sources of new activity among commercial 
                builders. School construction, which has been steady over the 
                past two months, remains the other source of new activity in commercial 
                construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trucking and Shipping
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for trucking and shipping was flat in May compared with 
                April, and slightly lower than one year ago. Prices in the industry 
                have remained stable over the least year, but some contacts speculate 
                a price increase may be attempted by carriers sometime during 
                the summer if excess capacity in the industry continues to fall 
                at the pace it has fallen the last couple of months. The drop 
                in excess capacity is due in part to a decision by firms to delay 
                purchasing new engines. Many firms remain reluctant to invest 
                large sums of money in new, unproven engines that meet the EPA 
                regulations that took effect last October. Rather than invest 
                in new engines, firms are making expenditures on technology to 
                improve efficiency.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For the second consecutive report, a growing number of bankers 
                reported slight improvement in commercial loan demand--for this 
                report, more than half our contacts reported commercial loan demand 
                had increased both year-over-year and year-to-date. Consumer loan 
                conditions remained mixed: Half our contacts reported demand was 
                slightly up, while the rest reported demand was flat or slightly 
                down compared with one year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most bankers continued to report that growth in 
                core deposits was either flat or slightly up. Credit standards 
                had not changed, and the number of loan applications remained 
                roughly the same compared with one month ago, but a few contacts 
                did note deteriorating credit quality among applicants. Most bankers 
                reported mortgage, installment, and business loan delinquencies 
                were flat or very slightly increased compared with a year ago.
