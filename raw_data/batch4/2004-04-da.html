      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       April 21, 2004
      </b>
      <p>
       Eleventh District economic activity continued to accelerate from 
              mid-February to mid-April. Retail sales growth was surprisingly 
              strong, according to contacts, but there has been little change 
              in demand for business services. Manufacturing respondents report 
              that they are experiencing stronger sales that are partly the result 
              of growing demand and partly the result of previous reductions in 
              industry capacity. Construction and real estate activity is showing 
              scattered signs of picking up. Residential activity remains quite 
              strong but is softening. Contacts expressed concern that there will 
              need to be a pickup in relocations or job growth for residential 
              activity to remain strong and for nonresidential activity to strengthen. 
              Agricultural conditions are favorable. In general, contacts are 
              optimistic about the outlook for activity, but remain cautious, 
              noting concerns that the upcoming presidential election will likely 
              result in a lot of negative press about the economy that could dampen 
              activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Prices
       </b>
       <br/>
       Contacts report rising input costs

in many industries, particularly manufacturing, with notably sharp increases

for fuel, shipping, aluminum, natural gas, coke, coal, metals and food

products. The lower value of the dollar was pushing up input costs for some

companies. Some cost increases are working their way through to selling prices.

Contacts say they are absorbing a lot of the cost and are still finding ways to

increase productivity to lower production costs. Even so, contacts say they

will have to pass more along to the consumer very soon, and many expect to be

able to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Producers of cement, glass, tile and

brick reported improved ability to pass cost increases forward to their

customers. Lumber and paper producers also reported higher input and selling

prices, and paper producers expect further gains in selling prices in the third

quarter. Fabricated metals producers say heavy demand from China has drawn down their suppliers' inventories and led to shortages of several inputs,

such as galvanized metal and steel. The removal of steel tariffs has not done

much to alleviate price increases, they say, because supply lines that were

directed away from the U.S. when the tariffs were in place have yet to be

redirected back, leaving the industry dependent on domestic suppliers of steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strong U.S. demand for gasoline

lowered inventories and pushed up retail prices to record highs (in nominal

dollars). Oil prices have been boosted by strong global demand (especially in Asia), threats of terror attacks, a lower dollar, low inventories, and the announcement of

OPEC production cuts. Crude inventories have risen five of the last six weeks,

and are now just above the lower range of five-year averages. Heating oil

prices declined seasonally throughout the period from 94 to 84 cents per

gallon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural gas prices remain

high despite inventories that are only slightly below normal for this time of

year, pushed up by rising oil prices and expectations that future sources of

natural gas will be more expensive. Petrochemical price increases are being

seen in a long list of base chemicals and plastics, including ethylene,

propylene, polypropylene, styrene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and PET bottle

plastic. Capacity shortages are reported for ethylene, chlorine, styrene, but

styrene pricing may fall back some as the turnaround season ends, and ethylene

will soon face increased supply from a new facility that is just starting up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Restaurant prices are up 1 to 2

percent. Legal fees are up 5 to 10 percent. Railroads continue to operate at or

near capacity. Strengthening demand has enabled firms to raise prices and pass

higher fuel costs on to customers. Trucking firms plan to increase prices to

pass higher fuel costs on to clients.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers say they are beginning to

have some pricing authority. Input prices are higher for many products, largely

because of the weaker dollar. Still contacts say they find ways to redesign

products to lower the cost of production. Contacts also said that, in response

to the antidumping concerns with Chinese products, they have been able to find

furniture production in other countries at a similar quality and production

cost. Retail inventories are in good shape, but retailers commented that they

have remained conservative in their purchases for the rest of the year,

preferring to be surprised by stronger demand that will allow pricing power

rather than being left with excess inventory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some high-tech manufacturers reported

significant price pressures, and bookings four months out suggest some moderate

price increases. Telecommunication equipment prices remain low due mostly to an

increasingly competitive market. Selling prices are also lower for apparel

producers, and they see no signs of upward pressure in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Airline passengers remain price

sensitive and firms continue to offer discounts to stimulate demand. Industry

capacity is outstripping GDP growth, and surging fuel prices are keeping profit

margins slim. Carriers are having difficulty in pushing fuel surcharges

through. Competition for new homes has put a lid on price increases despite

higher steel and lumber costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Labor Market
       </b>
       <br/>
       Hiring is picking up for some types

of workers, such as for production workers in high tech, apparel and lumber

manufacturing. There is still a large pool of unskilled laborers seeking

employment, according to contacts. Some companies in both services and

manufacturing are continuing to outsource both domestically and internationally.

Overall there continues to be very little pressure on wages, but most contacts

reported continued health care pressures. Some respondents have suggested that

this has been a main impediment to hiring full time workers. There has been a

growing trend in some of these increases in health costs being passed along to

the employee. One contact noted that, as a consequence, some workers had

reduced or declined coverage and that there had been a sharp rise in workers'

compensation claims and costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing
       </b>
       <br/>
       Demand is up for apparel, food

products, lumber and paper. Paper producers credit an increase in orders for

packaging from retailers and the closing down of some competitors. Demand for

some construction-related materials, such as cement, glass, tile and brick, was

up markedly from January and up moderately from March 2003. One contact

reported importing cement to meet demand within the District. Demand for

primary metals is stronger than a year ago but has slowed some in recent weeks.

Producers of fabricated metals say there has been little change in demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       High-tech manufacturers report that

growth in orders has increased slightly since the last survey. One contact said

that growth is coming from increased demand for existing products and that,

with the exception of high-definition TV and wireless communication, most

manufacturers have not increased their research and development into new

products. Telecommunications manufacturers have seen slow improvement in the

last few months. Telecommunications service providers have seen a slight

improvement in business spending, which is usually a promising signal of an

improving market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for petrochemicals has been

strong and the industry continues to improve, with only a few areas having a

serious overcapacity problem, such as polystyrene. The overcapacity has been

cured in some areas like chlorine and ethylene by a slump that lasted long

enough to permanently close some plants. Competition from imports has been

limited by a weak dollar and heavy demand from China. Strong demand for

gasoline has boosted profit margins for refineries. Capacity utilization has

been a little low, in part because of seasonal maintenance that is now ending.

Inventories of gasoline are at a five-year low for this time of year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Services
       </b>
       <br/>
       Legal contacts say activity

continues at roughly the same pace. There has been a sporadic increase in

merger and acquisition activity and a drop in work to support bankruptcies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transportation activity is mixed.

Rail demand is strong across a range of categories and shipments are up

significantly over last year. Contacts plan to hire additional employees and

increase the size of their locomotive fleet. Demand for air travel is also up

over the past month. Trucking activity is still soft, but contacts are

optimistic that demand will improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Retail Sales
       </b>
       <br/>
       Most retailers reported

surprisingly strong sales growth--even after adjusting for Easter sales

occurring earlier this year than last year. In general, sales at higher end

stores were better than of discount stores. Contacts say that consumers are

happy and are showing "classic signs" that they have money to spend.

Still many retailers are remaining cautious, planning their inventories for

weaker sales than they hope materializes. Slow sales of automobiles continue to

push down prices and cut into profit margins, according to dealers. Inventories

at most dealers remain high.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </b>
       <br/>
       New home sales continue to rise at

a good pace but are very competitive. Contacts say that demand is being driven

by low mortgage interest rates rather than a pickup in employment growth or

relocations. Some builders are reducing their inventory of homes because of

less-than-predicted relocations. Existing home sales remain strong as well, but

continued increases in home inventories have kept a damper on prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apartment leasing picked up in Dallas

and Houston over the past six weeks, according to respondents. Concessions are

still rampant, particularly in Dallas, and effective rents continued to decline,

but at a slower pace. Contacts are concerned about the amount of apartment

construction and fear it may slow the sector's recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas' largest office markets were

mostly unchanged over the past six weeks. The amount of space available edged

up slightly in Dallas, and rents fell, although the rate of decline has slowed

compared with last year. Despite the large amount of space available, Dallas remains a hotbed of investor activity, according to respondents. Houston's weak

downtown market is still dealing with repercussions related to the fallout in

energy trading. Contacts say a recent announcement to relocate 2,000 employees

into downtown is a promising sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Financial Services
       </b>
       <br/>
       Lending continues to pick

up, particularly for commercial and industrial projects. Consumer lending is

also reported to be stronger than earlier this year or last year. Contacts say

that activity is improving but not yet robust. Deposit growth is flat, which

respondents attribute to money flowing back into financial markets. Continued

competition, especially in the Dallas and Houston markets, remains fierce

keeping rates down and fees/fee structures under pressure. Recent announcements

by out of state banks to enter these markets and aggressive expansion by banks

already in these markets are putting downward pressure on rates and fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Energy
       </b>
       <br/>
       Onshore drilling continues to

respond to higher energy prices. Drilling activity is mostly simple, low risk,

low cost rigs that add little to the demand for services, however. Although

some respondents made hopeful statements that some areas of the oil service

business might tighten soon, there remains considerable excess capacity in all

lines of business. Offshore drilling in the U.S. continues to decline, and

there is no indication it will pick up soon. Oil producers continue to claim

there are no good prospects left in the region. International drilling remains

strong. Only the largest companies are active in this part of the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Agriculture
       </b>
       <br/>
       Farmers continue to prepare land for

planting. Contacts report that the outbreak of the avian influenza reported in

early 2004 in Gonzalez County has been officially declared eradicated,

benefiting poultry producers in the District. Demand for beef strengthened and

prices edged up. Mexico opened its markets to beef from the U.S., and contacts report shipping beef in large numbers. No new cases of BSE have been

found.
