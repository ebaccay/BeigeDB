      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy continued to expand in June and July, though in some 
areas the pace of growth has moderated since the last report. A 
number of districts report tight labor markets, especially for 
entry-level workers; however, wage pressures remained subdued. 
Retail sales slowed in most districts, particularly for non-auto 
durables. Many districts report continued expansion in the 
manufacturing sector, and a number have seen a pickup in hiring. 
Most manufacturers and retailers report that inventories were 
roughly on target. Housing markets remained fairly strong in most 
districts, though a few areas report a slowdown; a number of 
districts note particular strength in the multi-family segment. 
Commercial and industrial real estate markets continued to firm in 
almost all districts. A number of districts note brisk tourism 
activity-especially on the east and west coasts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop conditions have generally improved since the last report, 
although late plantings across the Midwest raise the potential for 
damage in the event of an early frost. While there are scattered 
reports of rising commodity prices, most districts report that input 
prices, as well as prices for finished goods, were essentially flat. 
Most districts report increased demand for commercial and industrial 
loans, but softer demand for consumer and mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales softened in most districts, though sales were generally 
up from a year-ago. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas note some weakening since the 
last report. However, contacts in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San 
Francisco say that sales remained strong. Retail inventories were 
generally on target.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for non-auto big ticket durables-such as home furnishings, 
appliances and electronics-was particularly soft in several 
districts (New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, and Kansas City). Auto sales were mixed; most districts 
report steady sales, but Kansas City reports a pickup, while Dallas 
notes some softening. New York and Chicago report that unusually 
cool weather may have contributed to weakness in seasonal items, 
such as fans and air conditioners. Apparel sales were fairly good in 
the New York, Atlanta, Kansas City and San Francisco districts, but 
were weak in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most districts. 
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San 
Francisco report that conditions firmed. However, Richmond, Atlanta, 
and Dallas note some softening. Cleveland and Chicago also report 
some recent moderation in growth, but add that the sector is still 
strong. Most districts report that inventory levels were in line, 
although they were a bit high in Richmond. However, auto-industry 
suppliers in the St. Louis and Chicago districts report lean 
inventories, and this has hindered light truck assemblies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in high-tech industries are very strong in Minneapolis 
but weak in Dallas; San Francisco notes increased activity in 
research and development, but some moderation in growth of computer 
manufacturing. Dallas reports increased demand for energy-related 
products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate markets remain fairly strong in most 
districts. Some slowing was observed in the Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago and St. Louis districts. However, Boston, New York, 
Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco 
report continued improvement. Boston, New York and Atlanta noted 
particular strength in the multi-family housing market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate continued to firm in almost all areas. Tight 
markets and declining vacancy rates are cited in Boston, New York, 
Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. St. Louis 
and Atlanta report mixed conditions, with the latter mentioning 
strong demand for office and industrial space, but softening demand 
for retail space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service activity continued to expand in districts that report on 
this sector. A monthly survey of service sector firms in the 
Richmond district shows increased activity in July. Temporary 
employment firms and contractors in the Philadelphia and Richmond 
districts report brisk business. San Francisco reports a pickup in 
software development activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism has been notably brisk in the seaboard regions-Boston, New 
York, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Minneapolis reports that 
tourism is below expectations, but roughly on par with last year. 
The Olympics have clearly attracted large numbers of tourists to the 
Atlanta area, and other parts of the district have benefited as 
well-large numbers of Atlanta residents reportedly visited Florida 
during the games. However, some of the district's other traditional 
destinations report disappointing traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks in virtually all districts report that demand has softened for 
consumer and mortgage loans but strengthened for commercial and 
industrial loans. The New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts report increased 
demand for business loans, while Philadelphia and Kansas City report 
steady demand. However, consumer and mortgage loan activity weakened 
in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City. 
Banks in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago indicate some increase 
in loan delinquencies, while Cleveland reports that delinquency 
rates have leveled off. Insurance companies in the Boston district 
report mixed sales of insurance products but increased mutual funds 
sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions were mixed but generally improved since the last 
report. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City report 
that crops were generally in good condition; conditions were below 
normal but improving in Cleveland and Chicago. Late crop plantings 
in the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts 
raise the potential for crop damage in the event of an early frost. 
A severe drought in the Dallas district-and parts of the St. Louis 
district-has caused extensive damage to corn and other crops, 
although recent rainfalls have helped somewhat. Hurricane Bertha 
caused some moderate crop damage in the Richmond district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The energy industry has picked up in the Minneapolis, Kansas City 
and Dallas districts, with contacts reporting increased drilling 
activity. The strength is largely attributed to high crude oil and 
natural gas prices, while Minneapolis also cites new seismic and 
drilling technologies as a factor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment &amp; Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remain tight, but there has been no widespread 
increase in wage pressures. Contacts in virtually all districts 
outside the Northeast cite tight labor markets and scattered 
shortages of both skilled and entry-level workers; most report that 
wage pressures remain subdued, though San Francisco reports that 
"wage inflation pressures are evident in some areas". Businesses in 
Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas mention limited availability of 
entry-level workers; contacts in Philadelphia and Richmond report 
increased demand for temporary workers; Chicago reports shortages of 
construction workers and professionals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite scattered reports of rising commodity prices, most districts 
report that both input prices and costs of finished goods were, on 
balance, flat. Manufacturers in Boston and Richmond report stable to 
declining input prices; those in New York, Chicago and Kansas City 
report some rise in materials costs. Other districts report mixed 
trends in raw materials costs; steel prices reportedly increased in 
Chicago and Kansas City but declined in Cleveland and Dallas. Prices 
for finished goods were generally flat in the New York, Atlanta, 
Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts, and up 
slightly in Boston and Richmond. Contacts in Philadelphia and 
Atlanta attribute the difficulty of raising prices to intense 
competition. Cattle farmers have been pinched by weak cattle prices 
and rising feed prices. Corn and soybean prices fell sharply in late 
July, after surging in preceding weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some areas report an escalation in real estate costs. Contacts in 
Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas note upward pressure 
on commercial rents. Boston and New York also report some firming of 
residential rents. St. Louis mentions a pickup in new home prices, 
driven by rising costs of both land and construction materials.
