      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       March 17, 1999
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Seventh District economy continued to expand modestly in early 
1999, despite weakness in some of the region's mainstay industries. 
Consumer spending remained strong, exceeding many merchants' 
expectations. Home sales slowed somewhat from December's torrid 
pace, but overall construction activity remained brisk. 
Manufacturing activity was mixed as strength persisted in some key 
industry segments, such as motor vehicles, while softness continued 
in others, particularly steel and agricultural equipment. Lenders 
indicated that loan demand remained strong even as mortgage 
refinancing activity fell off somewhat. Worker shortages persisted 
in the District and there were a few new reports of increasing wages 
in entry-level positions. Low commodity prices and a poor farm 
income outlook helped push farmland values down in Illinois and Iowa 
during the last three months of 1998.
      <p>
       <b>
        Consumer Spending
       </b>
       <br/>
       Retail sales in January and February met or exceeded most contacts' 
expectations, led by strength in sales of home-related items and 
light vehicles. Exceptionally strong home sales in late 1998 
continued to boost sales of big-ticket items, such as furniture and 
appliances, as well as home improvement goods, such as tools and 
paint. Strength in apparel sales was broad-based, although one 
contact indicated that discounting had been planned to generate 
sales instead of profits. Inventories were generally reported to be 
in line with sales expectations heading into the spring. 
Discounters, again, fared better than general merchandise stores. A 
contact at one national general merchandiser suggested that the 
increasingly price-driven retail industry was forcing the company to 
rethink its pricing strategy. District auto dealers reported that 
sales mirrored the strength in the nation, reflecting high consumer 
confidence and increased affordability. Despite strong consumer 
demand, price pressures at the retail level, for the most part, 
remained subdued.
       <p>
        <b>
         Construction and Real Estate
        </b>
        <br/>
        Overall construction activity remained robust in the District even 
as December's hot housing market cooled off somewhat early in 1999. 
Existing home sales in the Midwest were down only slightly from 
December, according to a national report, but a leading real estate 
firm in one of the District's largest metro areas reported their
second best January sales results ever, down less than 1 percent 
from last January's record level. Most homebuilders contacted noted 
that once seasonal factors are considered, the market for new homes 
appeared to be strong and steady. Builders of entry-level homes 
noted they were struggling with "razor" thin margins resulting from 
intense competition, leading to some consolidation in the industry. 
Commercial construction activity generally remained strong, but 
reports were mixed. Contacts in some metro areas reported a 
resurgence in downtown retail building activity, particularly in 
Milwaukee. On the other hand, another contact noted that some office 
projects already underway in downtown Chicago had been put on hold. 
Apartment vacancy rates remained very low and rents were reported to 
be up about 5 percent from a year ago in the Chicago area, where two 
new downtown high-rise apartment projects were announced in the last 
month. Activity on public projects and infrastructure remained 
strong in most areas and may have picked up in February, according 
to contacts.
        <p>
         <b>
          Manufacturing
         </b>
         <br/>
         District manufacturing activity remained mixed in January and 
February, as some key industry segments continued to be adversely 
affected by economic turmoil abroad. Light vehicle production 
remained exceptionally strong in the region as manufacturers 
benefitted from February sales results that exceeded virtually all 
expectations. As a result, most auto analysts have already increased 
their sales forecasts for 1999. Despite strong sales, as well as 
lean inventories, most industry analysts expected auto prices to 
remain soft. Demand for heavy trucks also remained very strong, as 
low fuel prices have made truck transportation more competitive and 
profitable. Production of most construction-related equipment was 
"going gangbusters" according to contacts, but demand for other 
heavy equipment remained lackluster as a result of soft export 
markets and problems in the farm sector. Agricultural equipment 
continued to be the weakest performer in the heavy equipment sector, 
with industry analysts expecting sales losses to exceed 20 percent 
in 1999. Pricing for heavy equipment remained soft, even for most 
construction-related products that were selling well. The region's 
steel industry, while still struggling, showed some slight 
improvement early in 1999 as domestic consumption remained strong 
and imports fell off in December and January. Prices 
for some steel products increased modestly in February, but remained 
well below year ago levels.
         <p>
          <b>
           Banking and Finance
          </b>
          <br/>
          Contacts in the financial services industry indicated that demand for both consumer and business loans remained strong. Consumer lending activity generally remained brisk, although reports of mortgage lending became mixed. Bankers in some areas indicated that mortgage originations and refinancing applications peaked in the 
fourth quarter of 1998 and had fallen off somewhat early in 1999 as interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages trended up. One banker, however, suggested that rising interest rates hadn't necessarily dampened overall demand, but shifted it from fixed-rate to variable-rate or balloon mortgages. Credit quality continued to improve as consumers paid down their credit card debts with retailers, and used more cash and debit cards for purchases. Some analysts suggested that consumer credit quality typically improves with a surge in refinancing activity. Business lending activity generally remained 
strong as well. Competition for quality middle-market customers remained intense and continued to squeeze margins for most institutions. A few bankers reported that margins on syndicated loans had improved as a result of Japanese banks pulling out of the market. With few exceptions, the quality of commercial loan portfolios was reported to be good as borrowers remained diligent in containing costs and improving profits.
          <p>
           <b>
            Labor Markets
           </b>
           <br/>
           District labor markets remained much tighter than in the rest of the 
nation during January and February, and most contacts continued to 
report difficulties finding and retaining workers. The average 
unemployment rate for District states was 3.6 percent in January, 
down slightly from December, and well below the national average of
4.3 percent. There was no evidence suggesting that any slack 
developed in February and early March. Long-running shortages in 
information technology and skilled trade occupations persisted 
throughout most of the District. Contacts with casual dining 
establishments indicated that staffing problems were hampering 
expansion plans as well as hours of operation at some locations. 
Shortages of truck drivers were also noted by contacts, with one 
firm adding that they were continually upgrading trucks and 
equipment as part of the overall package to attract and 
retain drivers. An accounting firm in one large metro area reported 
difficulty in finding accounting professionals, and the firm was 
turning to more temporary help. Wage pressures continued in those
occupations where severe shortages have persisted, but there were 
also new reports of wage increases for entry-level positions. 
Several contacts, citing significant resistance to price increases, 
insisted that increased wages would have to be offset by 
productivity gains or other cost-cutting measures.
           <p>
            <b>
             Agriculture
            </b>
            <br/>
            A survey of agricultural bankers indicated that farmland values 
declined over the last three months of 1998 in Illinois and Iowa, 
but rose in Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The survey also showed 
that farm loan repayment rates were down from a year earlier due to 
low grain and livestock prices. The situation was relatively worse 
in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa because of their greater dependence 
on hog, corn, and soybean enterprises. Bankers also noted that 
credit standards for agricultural loans had been raised. The impact 
of low commodity prices continued to haunt District farmers, as corn 
and soybean prices decreased through February while hog prices 
stabilized. Milk prices paid to farmers, which had increased 
throughout the second half of 1998, fell in January and February, 
but remained above a year earlier.
