      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      As 1998 opens, the Ninth District economy is like a marathoner - 
maintaining a strong, steady stride, but not sprinting. Business 
people are optimistic about prospects for the new year. 
Construction, manufacturing and energy development are all robust. 
Retail sales were strong at the end of 1997, and merchandisers are 
generally optimistic about 1998. Banks enjoyed a very good year and 
anticipate another.
      <p>
       Agriculture varies somewhat by crop and location, but farm finances 
are generally strong. Due to lack of snow, tourism is weak in some 
areas. Difficulty in securing employees is the most widespread 
economic complaint. Despite reports of rising wages for many 
specific skills, output prices are quiescent.
       <p>
        <strong>
         General Business Conditions
        </strong>
        <br/>
        "Solid growth predicted for all states," headlined the report of a 
December regional survey of purchasing managers. This sentiment was 
echoed by business leaders responding to a year-end Ninth District 
poll. Nearly 60 percent expect business investment to be up in their 
communities versus 8 percent predicting a drop. Over 54 percent 
expect employment to rise compared to 5 percent anticipating a drop. 
In terms of their own firms, 59 percent look for higher sales and 46 
percent anticipate making increased investments.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Some 61 percent of Ninth District manufacturers polled in late 1997 
expect 1998 sales to be up, only 4 percent expect them to slump. 
Over one-third anticipate increased investment by their own firm. 
These figures reflect a manufacturing sector that continues to enjoy 
robust business with continued growth in orders. Only a few firms 
report slackening export orders from Asia that will significantly 
affect their business. However, a December multi-state regional 
purchasing managers' survey did note some slowing of growth for the 
Dakotas and widespread reports of slower export orders. Computer 
networking products and services remain very strong, as do medical 
electronics and devices.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Construction has been strong for so long in the district that a fast 
pace has become the norm. Moreover, unusually warm weather favored 
strong activity into January. Publicly let awards in Minnesota and 
the Dakotas for all 1997 ended up 11 percent above 1996. Industry 
sources expect similar strength in the new year. A report on 
commercial real estate in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area detailed low 
vacancy rates and plans for increased construction in downtowns and 
suburbs.
          <p>
           Housing construction is strong in most urban areas. Many sources 
report that low interest rates are heating up buyer interest in both 
new and existing housing, and lenders are bracing for a spate of 
refinancing.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Natural Resource Industries
            </strong>
            <br/>
            The mild winter has fostered energy development, with a record 35 
rigs drilling for oil or gas in North Dakota and Montana at the new 
year. North Dakota oil production is up 11 percent over year-earlier 
levels. After registering strong or moderate growth in the last two 
years, iron ore mining officials expect essentially stable output in 
1998. Output is similarly stable for most forest product producers. 
One small Wisconsin paper plant may be closed as a result of post-
merger restructuring.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Agriculture
             </strong>
             <br/>
             "Due to good yields we should see debt reduction for most farmers in 
first quarter 1998," reports a southern Minnesota banker. "Many 
farmers and ranchers are leaving the area due to poor prices and 
weather conditions," says a southwest North Dakota counterpart. 
These comments illustrate the mixed financial conditions in 
agriculture. Corn, soybean and hog farmers in eastern South Dakota, 
southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin are enjoying good 
profitability and favorable weather. Cattle ranchers and feedlot 
operators generally report moderate profitability after 21/2 years 
of losses.
             <p>
              Wheat and dairy producers are squeezed by prices that do not allow 
them to cover all costs. North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota 
farmers continue to suffer poor cash flows due to 1997's excess 
moisture, plant disease and insect infestations that cut yields 
dramatically in many areas. Despite these problems, farm finances 
are described as strong by most district bankers.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Consumer Spending and Tourism
               </strong>
               <br/>
               "Late rally helps retailers in holiday season," headlined a 
newspaper story on sales by Minnesota-based national firms. A 
general retailer and a music and video chain reported same-store 
increases of 6.4 percent and 8.7 percent respectively over the 1996 
holiday season. A consumer electronics and appliance chain reported 
12.6 percent year-over-year same-store gains for December. Regional 
firms, mall managers and individual store owners are generally 
upbeat on both the holidays and prospects for first quarter 1998.
               <p>
                Vehicle sales are mixed. Dealers and association representatives in 
Montana and the Dakotas describe sluggish to average sales in many 
areas. But sources in urban areas of Minnesota, western Wisconsin 
and the eastern fringes of North Dakota and South Dakota are 
somewhat more optimistic, reporting good, but not booming, sales.
                <p>
                 "No white means no green," is a headline that applies to most winter 
recreation or tourism businesses. A tourism official reports that 
the lack of snow has hit some counties hard in the Upper Peninsula 
of Michigan, especially during the holidays. "It will take a lot to 
bail out the winter," he says. While snow cover is light on the 
lower elevations in South Dakota and Montana, there are good 
conditions at higher elevations. A ski resort in Montana reports a 
solid holiday season and projects a season on par with last year.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Banking and Financial Services
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  While 1997 was a very profitable year for many banks, a variety of 
sources describe demand for bank loans as softening, reportedly 
because of strong internal cash generation on the part of many 
businesses. Stiff competition to make loans has reportedly led to 
reductions in loan pricing. Bankers reportedly expect a good year in 
1998, but some express concern about how long the "good times" can 
last.
                  <p>
                   <strong>
                    Employment, Wages and Prices
                   </strong>
                   <br/>
                   Tight labor markets continue as a major problem for employers in 
most areas of the district. Nearly 83 percent of firms polled in a 
Ninth District survey report securing workers to be a challenge. 
Reported compensation increases continue to be mixed: Many firms 
report having to up their bids significantly to secure skilled 
specialists, but firmwide pay increases of 2 percent to 3 percent 
are also common. Several sources report that health insurance costs 
will be up markedly in 1998 after a three-year hiatus.
                   <p>
                    Gasoline and heating oil prices are at their lowest levels in this 
decade. Spot natural gas prices declined from December into the new 
year. The combination of lower prices and warm weather has 
significantly reduced heating costs for most homeowners. 
Manufacturers of intermediate goods continue to describe pressure 
from customers to lower prices. Reports of price increases for 
intermediate or final goods are extremely rare.
