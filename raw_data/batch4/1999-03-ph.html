      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 17, 1999
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Third District generally improved during 
February. Manufacturing shipments and orders increased. Retail sales 
exceeded year-ago and prior month results. Auto sales have also 
increased. Bank real estate lending moved up slightly, but business 
and consumer lending has been steady. Sales of both new and existing 
homes have been rising strongly. Commercial real estate vacancies 
have been falling and rents have been rising.
      <p>
       Third District business contacts have positive outlooks. 
Manufacturers expect demand for their products to continue on an 
upward trend, and they plan to increase employment. Retailers 
anticipate further growth in sales as the spring season gets under 
way. Auto dealers expect sales to remain healthy. Home builders 
forecast construction at or above the current pace into the summer, 
and real estate agents expect sales of existing homes to remain 
strong. Commercial real estate contacts anticipate a balanced market 
and a steady pace of construction for the rest of the year.
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        Third District manufacturing activity increased in February, 
according to industrial firms in the region. One-third of the 
companies contacted said shipments and orders during February 
exceeded January levels, although about half said business was 
steady. Increases were reported from most major industrial sectors 
in the District. Producers of lumber and machinery had relatively 
strong gains; in contrast, makers of food products and textiles 
indicated that demand for their products had slipped. Overall, order 
backlogs at area plants remained steady in February and inventories 
edged down; however, some firms in textile industries indicated that 
inventories were too high relative to sales.
        <p>
         Manufacturers in the District generally expect business to increase 
during the next six months. They forecast increases in orders and 
output, and they plan to add workers and lengthen the workweek. 
On balance, area manufacturers expect prices of both inputs and 
products sold to rise only modestly.
         <p>
          <b>
           Retail
          </b>
          <br/>
          Retailers in the region indicated that sales increased by a 
substantial amount in February from January and from a year ago. 
Several merchants noted that a significant portion of February sales 
was attributable to clearance of winter merchandise at substantially 
discounted prices. Nonetheless, store executives said sales of 
spring goods, especially women's and children's apparel, were 
healthy. If the current trend continues, merchants expect sales in 
March of this year to exceed sales in March of last year. Store 
officials generally described inventories as satisfactory, as 
reduced prices have helped clear out winter goods and consumers have 
started buying spring merchandise.
          <p>
           Sales of new motor vehicles have been on the rise. Dealers reported 
that manufacturers' shipments of popular models have increased 
recently, facilitating a better sales rate with less use of 
incentives. Dealers expect sales to remain at a strong pace, even if 
there is some slippage from the current rate.
           <p>
            <b>
             Finance
            </b>
            <br/>
            Most of the bankers contacted for this report said loan volume was 
steady during February. Although a few indicated that they were 
increasing business loans slightly, mainly to firms that were 
purchasing equipment or expanding facilities, most bank lending 
officers described commercial and industrial loan demand as flat.
Bankers also said there has been virtually no growth in consumer 
lending. Real estate lending activity has been high in the region, 
but net growth in real estate loans outstanding has been slight. 
Much of the new mortgage loans booked replace mortgages paid off, 
and refinancings do not boost total real estate credit outstanding.
            <p>
             <b>
              Real Estate and Construction
             </b>
             <br/>
             Commercial real estate markets remain healthy, according to recent 
reports from brokers and property managers. The estimated vacancy 
rate for the central business district of Philadelphia was 14 
percent, unchanged from the fall of last year. Vacancy rates in 
suburban markets have been declining and are currently estimated in 
a range of 6 to 12 percent, depending on location. Rents have risen 
up to 10 percent from a year ago in both the suburbs and the central 
business district. Demand for industrial space remains strong, but a 
steady supply of new buildings has kept vacancy rates steady. Rental 
rates, however, have moved up, reflecting an increasing need for 
more technologically advanced buildings. Commercial real estate 
contacts forecast continued construction of build-to-suit office and 
industrial buildings in markets outside central Philadelphia and 
some limited speculative construction in a few areas. They expect 
supply and demand to remain nearly in balance through 1999.
             <p>
              Home builders and residential real estate agents reported a very 
brisk sales pace in February. Brokers estimate price appreciation of 
existing homes at around 3 percent over the past 12 months for most 
parts of the region, but gains have been higher in a few places. 
Mild weather accounts for some of the strength in February sales, 
according to builders and real estate agents, but they also cite 
buoyant consumer confidence and healthy personal income in the 
region as factors that should underpin a continuing high rate of 
sales.
