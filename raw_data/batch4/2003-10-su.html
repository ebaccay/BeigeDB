      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 15, 2003
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Information received from District Banks suggests 
              that, on balance, the pace of economic expansion has picked up since 
              the last report. Ten of the twelve districts indicate that activity 
              has been expanding, while two--Boston and Cleveland--report mixed 
              but steady levels of economic activity. Overall, both wages and 
              prices of finished goods and services remained relatively stable, 
              though there were scattered reports of business input cost pressures. 
              Hurricane Isabel inflicted some limited damage across much of the 
              Richmond District, but the disruptions to activity from the storm 
              were said to be short-lived.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending generally strengthened, though 
              most districts report a recent pullback in auto sales. Improving 
              sales trends are reported in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. 
              Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Retail 
              inventories are generally described to be at or close to desired 
              levels, and retailers generally anticipate modest year-over-year 
              gains for the upcoming holiday season. Most districts report strengthening 
              in manufacturing activity. Employment in this sector remained generally 
              weak, though some districts note pockets of firming.
     </p>
     <p>
      Broad-based strength is reported in residential 
              real estate and construction, but commercial real estate markets 
              are still described as sluggish. Travel and tourism activity was 
              mixed but, on balance, showed some improvement. Reports from most 
              other service industries also show improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks in almost all districts report a substantial 
              drop-off in refinancing activity since the last report, though there 
              were a few reports of improvement toward the end of September. There 
              was some pickup in business loan demand, while home mortgage and 
              consumer lending were mixed. Credit quality was generally described 
              as good, with only scattered reports of increased delinquency rates. 
              Most districts report favorable weather conditions and improved 
              agriculture yields since the last report, though Richmond reports 
              significant crop damage from Hurricane Isabel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets generally remain slack, but some 
              signs of a pickup are reported in New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, 
              and Dallas. Prices of finished goods were generally stable, and 
              wage increases continued to be quite modest, though many districts 
              note continued escalation of non-wage benefit costs--particularly 
              health insurance. Also, fairly sharp price increases are reported 
              for cattle and certain commodities, such as steel, lumber, plywood, 
              and natural gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts report a general strengthening in retail sales but 
              some softening in automobile purchases. A few districts credit the 
              recent federal tax rebates with temporarily boosting sales, though 
              the timing of the effect on sales varied. Non-auto sales are generally 
              said to be improving in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, 
              Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, while Cleveland, 
              Atlanta, and Chicago describe sales as steady or moderating but 
              still ahead of plan. Boston and Richmond characterize sales as flat 
              but with some pockets of strength. Richmond reports that sales lost 
              due to hurricane-related closures were quickly made up, and that 
              hardware stores, grocery stores, and restaurants saw brisk business 
              after the storm.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent reductions in motor vehicle sales are reported 
              in most districts. Automobile sales are said to have weakened in 
              the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, Dallas, 
              and San Francisco Districts. St. Louis, on the other hand, reports 
              some improvement in vehicle sales in recent weeks, though they were 
              still lower than a year ago. Also, sales of imports are said to 
              be holding up better than those of domestic makes in the St. Louis, 
              and San Francisco Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Non-auto inventories are generally reported to 
              be in good shape in almost all districts, but vehicle inventories 
              are said to be higher than desired in Cleveland, Chicago, and St. 
              Louis. Looking ahead to the rest of 2003, retailers in most districts 
              are reported to be cautiously optimistic. Modest sales growth is 
              anticipated in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, 
              St. Louis, and Kansas City, while the remaining districts did not 
              specify sales expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of the districts report a pickup in manufacturing activity, 
              with several indicating significant improvement in a wide variety 
              of industries. Machine tool orders strengthened in the Atlanta and 
              Chicago Districts; semiconductor producers note a pickup in demand 
              in the San Francisco District; contacts in lumber and construction 
              related materials see improvement in several districts; and high-tech 
              manufacturers in the Dallas District indicate gains. On the downside, 
              Richmond reports a contraction in its manufacturing sector, and 
              contacts in Boston report weak demand and a decline in revenues. 
              The Minneapolis District notes only slight gains, and the Dallas 
              and Cleveland Districts report mixed activity. Kansas City, Boston, 
              and St. Louis report a decline in activity in the aerospace industry, 
              and several districts indicate marked deterioration in the textile 
              industry. Activity in the transportation equipment industry was 
              mixed, with declines noted in the Philadelphia District, little 
              change in Chicago, but increases in St. Louis. Several districts 
              report a continuing low level of inventories, and most contacts 
              report that input prices remain high, and above year-ago levels, 
              but have not accelerated further since the last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing employment exhibited modest gains 
              in some districts, but in most was stable or declining. The Kansas 
              City, Cleveland, and New York Districts report increases in hours 
              worked, and Kansas City, New York, and St. Louis report hiring gains. 
              Capital spending activity was mixed, with contacts in several districts 
              reporting plans to increase capital spending, while the majority 
              of contacts from other districts cite hesitation and lackluster 
              spending plans going forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate markets continued to show strength in virtually 
              all districts, while commercial real estate markets remained generally 
              sluggish. Virtually all districts describe housing markets as robust, 
              despite relatively modest signs of slowing in the Boston, Richmond, 
              Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. On the other hand, signs 
              of further strengthening are noted in New York, St. Louis, Minneapolis, 
              and Kansas City. A few districts specify that the recent increase 
              in mortgage rates appears to have had at most a limited impact on 
              home sales. Reports from Boston, New York, Chicago, and Kansas City 
              note particular strength for entry-level or lower- to mid-priced 
              homes, as opposed to the high end of the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction is also indicated to 
              be strong in most districts. Recent increases in construction activity 
              are reported in New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Kansas 
              City notes that builders have had trouble obtaining plywood, while 
              reports from Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco 
              indicate sharp increases in lumber and plywood costs, which, in 
              turn, are said to be squeezing builders' profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets, in contrast, continue 
              to be characterized as weak in almost all districts. Still, a number 
              of districts indicate slight signs of firming since the last report--specifically 
              New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas. 
              On the other hand, renewed signs of slowing are reported from Chicago 
              and Minneapolis, while conditions are described as stagnant in Richmond 
              and San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism and travel activity was mixed but, on balance, improved; 
              however, both business travel and international visitors were still 
              lagging, although there were some scattered signs of recovery. Overall, 
              tourism was described as robust in New York, Kansas City, and San 
              Francisco but sluggish in the Boston District. Since the last report, 
              New York and San Francisco report a pickup in international visitors, 
              while Boston, Minneapolis, and Kansas City note some pickup in business 
              travel. On the other hand, Atlanta describes both of these segments 
              as persistently weak. Richmond reports that Hurricane Isabel caused 
              substantial hotel damage and widespread cancellations along much 
              of the Virginia and North Carolina shore. The evacuations from the 
              storm resulted in a noticeable pickup in business at hotels in less 
              affected parts of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in other service industry 
              sectors varied but generally improved. Increased demand for various 
              business-related services (such as legal, accounting, IT, and executive 
              search) is noted in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco. 
              Increases in trucking are reported in Cleveland, while Dallas indicates 
              a decrease in trucking volume but an increase in rail shipments, 
              and New York reports strong increases in port traffic. Boston reports 
              mixed to firmer conditions in the insurance industry, with industry 
              contacts reporting little financial impact from the August blackout 
              and expressing optimism about the business outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks report mixed but generally favorable conditions. Loan demand 
              is generally steady overall, with some improvement from the commercial 
              sector, but steep declines in mortgage refinancing. Demand for commercial 
              loans strengthened in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
              Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, and was little changed in New 
              York. While none of the districts indicates weakening in business 
              lending, a few characterized the level of activity as still low. 
              Demand for consumer and home mortgage loans was steady to weaker 
              in New York, Cleveland, and Richmond, but some firming was indicated 
              in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Most districts 
              report sizable declines in mortgage refinancing activity, though 
              Dallas indicates persistent strength in this category, while Chicago 
              and Minneapolis report a slight bounceback in late September.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan quality is generally described as good, with 
              delinquency rates little changed since the last report. Chicago 
              and Dallas report some improvement in loan quality and Atlanta says 
              that loan delinquencies "remained manageable," while Philadelphia 
              cites an increase in debt-service to income ratios, and New York 
              indicates an uptick in delinquencies on consumer and home mortgage 
              loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Aside from lending, financial institutions report 
              favorable conditions and brisk growth. New York's securities industry 
              reports strong growth in revenue, profits and compensation. Similarly, 
              financial institutions in the Dallas District report a pickup in 
              mergers and acquisition activity, leading to higher fee income. 
              Finally, San Francisco suggests that a recent acceleration in business 
              deposit in-flows further reflects a pickup in general economic activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts report favorable weather conditions and improved 
              agriculture yields since the last report. However, Hurricane Isabel 
              wrought significant damage in the Richmond District. A combination 
              of flooding, high winds, and power outages resulted in damage to 
              crops, fruit, livestock, and fishing equipment in much of the Richmond 
              District. Otherwise, recent rains have improved crop yields in the 
              St. Louis, San Francisco, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Chicago Districts. 
              These rains, however, caused spotty problems for fall planting in 
              some districts. Suppliers from all cattle-producing districts report 
              banner prices, decent pasture conditions, and are optimistic that 
              profits will follow suit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the energy industry was mixed. The 
              Minneapolis District indicates a slight decline in oil and natural 
              gas exploration levels since the last report, while the Kansas City 
              District reports a moderate expansion in oil and gas drilling. The 
              Dallas District reports that activity remained at a relatively high 
              level, but was not quite as strong as might be expected given the 
              current price of oil and natural gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts continue to describe labor markets as slack, though 
              there are modest signs of improvement in a number of districts. 
              In general, labor markets are characterized as stagnant in Boston, 
              Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. On the other 
              hand, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas report increased 
              demand for temporary workers, while New York reports a pickup in 
              hiring across a number of sectors. Both New York and Chicago note 
              that much of the hiring is coming from smaller firms. Kansas City 
              notes some decrease in layoff announcements, as well as an increase 
              in hiring plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Modest wage growth is reported across the nation, 
              though continued escalation in non-wage benefits, particularly health 
              insurance, are noted in Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, 
              Dallas, and San Francisco. Rising benefit costs are said to be holding 
              down wage increases in the Atlanta District and deterring hiring 
              in Dallas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The various districts report little change in prices 
              of consumer goods and services, but steep escalation in certain 
              commodity prices. Retail prices are reported to be stable in Cleveland, 
              Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco; steady to slightly higher in 
              Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City; and steady to slightly 
              lower in Boston, New York, and Dallas.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast with the general price stability for 
              finished goods and services, prices for a number of commodities 
              have risen sharply. Steep increases in lumber and plywood costs 
              are noted in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, 
              and San Francisco--some of this is attributed to post-war rebuilding 
              in Iraq, post-hurricane repairs along the Mid-Atlantic seaboard, 
              and fires in the West that affected supply. There were also reports 
              of steep price increases for cattle, steel, and natural gas. However, 
              oil and gasoline prices have retreated, following a sharp run-up 
              in August. In terms of intermediate services, a noticeable increase 
              in freight costs is reported in the Minneapolis District, but declines 
              in commercial rents are seen in Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis.
