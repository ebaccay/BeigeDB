      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity picked up in March and April. 
More contacts reported price increases and lower inventories than in 
January and February, but there were fewer reports of wage pressures 
or labor shortages. Manufacturing orders rebounded, although several 
producers said activity was below the level of a year ago, and 
demand for semiconductors and telecommunications equipment remained 
weak. Business service firms reported a seasonal increase in demand, 
and retail sales improved. The financial services industry reported 
mixed lending activity over the past 6 weeks. Construction and real 
estate activity remained brisk, and energy activity strengthened. 
Drought, low cattle prices and high costs continued to stress the 
agricultural community.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices were up for crude oil, crops, petrochemicals, plastic 
packaging, steel, lumber and some primary metals, and semiconductor 
prices had stopped falling. Apparel, paper, computer and livestock 
prices were lower. Producers of cement, brick, crude oil and 
petrochemicals said that their inventories were below desired 
levels, while inventories were up for newsprint, lumber, and 
semiconductors, particularly memory chips. Semiconductor inventories 
were much too large-roughly 50 percent higher than 6 months ago-but 
are "not even close to inventory levels of the big semiconductor 
cycles in the 1970s and 1980s." Telecommunications and computer 
manufacturers said inventories were slightly larger than desired, 
and heavy competition was keeping downward pressure on personal 
computer prices. Shortages of cement led producers to ration 
customers. Brick plants in Texas are reported at near capacity, but 
strong demand had not yet led to higher prices. Low inventories 
pushed up crude oil prices to between $23 to $25 per barrel for most 
of April, although oil futures suggest prices will decline. Prices 
were up for plastic packaging materials, but prices continued to 
fall between 5-8 percent for all types of paper products, and 
producers said their customers had excess inventory of newsprint. In 
March, lower prices for livestock outweighed higher prices for most 
crops, pushing down the Texas All Farm Products Index of Prices 
Received to 1.0 percent below last month's level. Food processors 
said high grain prices raised costs and caused some producers to 
reduce production and boost selling prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing orders rebounded, although several producers said 
activity was below the level a year ago and demand for 
semiconductors and telecommunications equipment remained weak. 
Demand was up for apparel, lumber, brick, cement, primary and 
fabricated metals. Paper producers reported a notable rebound in 
demand for corrugated boxes, although demand for newsprint dropped. 
Demand for petrochemicals began to increase from both domestic and 
foreign customers, after what producers report was a successful soft 
landing for their industry, with continued profitability and no 
inventory build-up. Oil field machinery firms continued to report 
strengthening demand and good profits. Cold weather and snow in New 
England stimulated demand for heating oil at District refineries, 
causing a delay in the switch over to gasoline production. Gasoline 
inventories were 5 percent under last year's levels, with the 
driving season starting at the end of May. Electronics firms 
reported a slight increase in demand for computers, but demand for 
memory computer chips and microprocessors continued to be below 
expectations. Overall, semiconductor demand in real terms was 
growing at about a 10 percent annual rate, compared to 30 percent 
five months ago. Demand for telecommunications equipment also 
weakened, mainly due to softer sales in Europe. Electronics contacts 
were very cautious about the outlook for sales, expecting only 
slight increases in the volume of sales into 1997.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business service firms reported a seasonal increase in demand. 
Several firms were hiring and there were fewer reports of difficulty 
finding qualified workers. Demand was up for passenger and cargo 
transportation, temporary, accounting and legal services. Firms 
supplying temporary workers said that demand for workers to staff 
telephone call centers was particularly strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales continued to improve, although contacts said 
competition remains very stiff. Retailers must use heavy promotion 
to attract the "price-driven consumer" because there are "too many 
stores in Texas." Auto sales picked up, particularly for used cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial services industry reported mixed lending activity over 
the last 6 weeks. Higher long-term interest rates led to a slight 
decrease in residential real estate lending, and a sharp drop in 
refinancings. Contacts reported some increases in consumer and 
commercial real estate loans. District lenders were cautiously 
optimistic in their outlook for loan demand in the next 3 to 12 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and real estate activity remained brisk. Homebuilders 
reported a pickup in new and existing home sales, although they are 
concerned that rising mortgage rates could damp demand later in the 
year. Apartment leasing remained strong despite a large number of 
new units that were completed in the first quarter. Apartment 
builders continued to cut back on starts in anticipation of rising 
vacancies and slower growth in rents in the coming months. Office 
and warehouse leasing remained very strong and rents continued to 
rise. Contacts said construction of warehouse and office space 
increased, although labor shortages were causing some delays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy activity continued to strengthen. Demand for oil services was 
boosted by increases in international and U.S. drilling activity. 
Seasonally-adjusted, the U.S. rig count was up by over 50 rigs in 
April-to over 825 rigs-with two-thirds of the increase in Eleventh 
District states. Natural gas drilling is pulling the rig count 
upward, and the Gulf of Mexico is well positioned to sell gas to the 
East Coast. International drilling continues to increase, 
particularly in Latin America and Africa.
     </p>
     <p>
      Drought, low cattle prices and high costs continued to stress the 
agricultural community. Bankers reported an increase in the number 
of farmers and ranchers starting the year with large debt carryover, 
and expressed concern about the "serious problems" facing the 
agricultural community and the increased likelihood that some 
farmers and ranchers will quit or be forced out of business.
