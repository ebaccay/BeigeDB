      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 17, 1999
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continues to expand in the First District. 
Retailers see ongoing strong consumer demand, while manufacturing 
results are mixed. For the most part, prices are said to be steady 
and wages growing moderately.
      <p>
       <b>
        Retail
       </b>
       <br/>
       Contacts in the retail sector report continued expansion during the 
first two months of 1999 and news reports in early March cite 
unexpectedly strong sales growth for regional retailers. Sectors of 
strength include apparel, home furnishings, appliances, and discount 
retailers.
       <p>
        Employment is said to be holding steady on a same-store basis, 
increasing only with store expansions. Wage growth is reported to be 
in the same 4 to 6 percent range that characterized most of 1998. 
Most respondents say that prices continue to hold steady, primarily 
because of competitive pressures. Supplier prices are reported to
be level, except for imported goods, for which prices are falling on 
account of the Asian slump, and lumber prices, which are said to 
have increased dramatically because of very strong U.S. residential 
construction activity. Gross margins are unchanged. Contacts say 
that moderate increases in operations are planned for 1999, with 
heavy investments being made in information technology. Looking 
forward, respondents express optimism about the economic outlook for 
the rest of 1999, but do not expect consumer spending to continue 
growing at its current pace.
        <p>
         <b>
          Manufacturing
         </b>
         <br/>
         First District manufacturing contacts are about equally split as to 
whether recent business is up, down, or flat relative to a year ago. 
Companies selling to the automotive, furniture, and health care 
industries report positive trends, and demand for office supplies 
continues to rise. Sales of commercial aircraft parts are said to be
increasing, although incoming orders suggest a sluggish period 
ahead. Sales of electronics, industrial machinery, and sports 
equipment are reported to be down. New England's paper and textile 
industries are being hurt by import competition, although some 
niches are now showing positive trends. Overall, exports to Asia 
continue to fall, with a couple of large manufacturers noting recent 
sales declines in China.
         <p>
          Manufacturers indicate that materials costs continue to be flat or 
down. The majority report steady selling prices. One-quarter report 
some small increases, partly reflecting a pass-through of higher 
labor costs. Apparel textile makers indicate somewhat lower selling 
prices, and some equipment manufacturers say customers are 
pressuring them for reductions.
          <p>
           Most contacts report little change in the size of their domestic 
workforce compared to either a year ago or a few months ago. 
However, several companies have laid off some production workers. 
Most new hiring is concentrated on sales, marketing, and service 
positions. Manufacturers mostly report that overall pay is 
increasing 3 to 5 percent, which some contacts note provides workers 
comfortable increases in real compensation. In general, wage 
pressures do not seem to be on the rise, although information 
technology personnel continue to command large increases.
           <p>
            Over half the contacts plan higher capital spending this year. The 
increases are primarily to introduce new technologies for 
production, product design, distribution, or information processing. 
Several firms also intend to expand overall capacity.
            <p>
             Most manufacturers have positive expectations for 1999. However, 
some mention the need to remain cautious or flexible in light of 
economic uncertainties.
             <p>
              <b>
               Temporary Services
              </b>
              <br/>
              First District temporary employment firms report that 1999 is off to 
a reasonably good start as their business continues to expand. 
Demand continues to be strong, with firms reporting significant 
increases in their number of workers on assignment despite extremely 
tight labor markets across all industries. Wage inflation seems 
stable for most industries. For high tech workers, however, who are 
in extremely short supply (especially in the Boston area), robust 
wage growth continues. Prices that temp agencies charge firms for 
high tech workers are not rising as quickly as their wages because 
of increased competition; as a result, profit margins are being 
slightly squeezed. Revenues continue to rise due to increased 
business volume. Outside of high tech, clients have become more 
willing to accept higher prices. Most contacts foresee strong future 
growth for the staffing industry though some warn that "gravity has 
to work sometime."
              <p>
               <b>
                Commercial Real Estate
               </b>
               <br/>
               After a long period of declining vacancy rates and increasing rental 
rates, the Boston office market seems to be leveling off a bit. 
While demand is still high, new construction of office buildings is 
increasing the supply of office space. So far there has been no 
decrease in rental rates, but contacts worry about overbuilding,
especially since some of the new construction projects are 
speculative.
               <p>
                Hartford is said to be undergoing a "renaissance," caused in part by 
the upcoming construction of the Patriots' football stadium. Office 
and industrial vacancy rates have declined in Hartford, and several 
new construction projects are planned. Rhode Island, Maine, and 
Vermont contacts describe their commercial markets as "flat" and 
"steady."  Outside a few pockets of increased rental activity, the 
markets in those states have been stable. Most contacts anticipate 
market conditions to remain unchanged during the next few months.
                <p>
                 <b>
                  Nonbank Financial Services - Insurance
                 </b>
                 <br/>
                 The majority of respondents at insurance companies experienced 
reductions in employment in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the first 
two months of 1999. The decline is attributed mostly to mergers and 
acquisitions. Respondents expect the downward trend in employment to 
continue for the rest of this year. Revenues were flat or down for 
the majority of respondents in the fourth quarter of 1998 compared 
to the fourth quarter of 1997. However, one property-casualty 
insurer reports dramatic increases in revenue, due to acquisitions.
