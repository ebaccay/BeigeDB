      </strong>

      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District economy expanded at a moderate to vigorous pace in 
recent months. The underlying momentum in retail sales growth 
remained strong during the holiday season, and probably exceeded its 
third quarter pace on a seasonally adjusted basis. Manufacturing 
activity remained robust for the time of year. Labor markets 
continued to strengthen, with little sign of softening in employers' 
hiring intentions heading into the new year. Transaction price 
increases seem to remain centered in basic materials and 
intermediate goods, as retailers continued to stress intense 
competitive constraints on pricing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The underlying trend in retail sales growth remained quite strong 
during the holiday season. Sales gains reported by large retail 
chains were generally in line with or somewhat better than pre-
season expectations, except for apparel sales, where relatively warm 
weather held back sales prior to the last week of December. Apparel 
retailers blamed shifts in consumption toward hard goods, and not 
weakness in total consumption, for their relative sales weakness. 
Apparel sales have strengthened in early January, but as one 
retailer noted, "a good December is a heck of a lot better than a 
good January."
     </p>
     <p>
      Most large retailers indicated that year-over-year sales gains 
improved as the season matured, except in apparel sales. For 
example, one large durable goods retailer characterized sales in the 
last week of the season as "booming," with sales gains running well 
ahead of previous weeks. A number or retail chains indicated that 
toy sales gains were in line with or stronger than companywide 
averages, and home entertainment software and computers were among 
the strongest gift-giving categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Excluding apparel sales, most large retailers reported better 
overall sales gains in the District than their national average. A 
late December survey by an accounting firm suggested that Midwest 
consumers had higher planned and actual spending levels than 
consumers in any other major Census region. Large prospective and 
actual bonuses in the auto industry boosted retail sales in Detroit 
and other areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District has experienced large-scale expansion in retailing 
capacity in recent years. As a result, survey data, reported same-
store sales gains, and anecdotal evidence on individual store chain 
results may well understate the strength of aggregate sales growth. 
Increased retailing capacity also helps explain why discounting ran 
more aggressively than many retailers anticipated at the onset of 
the 1994 season, in spite of strong demand and customer traffic. The 
strongest holiday sales gains seem to have arisen in products where 
prices have been declining (such as computers and electronics) and 
in outlets where prices are relatively low. Several retailing 
analysts suggested that discount stores took a larger share of 
holiday sales growth in the region during 1994, as consumers turned 
more aggressive in their search efforts alter a less-cautious 
shopping season in 1993. One large outlet mall characterized its 
holiday sales season as "awesome." Customer traffic was up nearly 30 
percent based on vehicle counts, and the number of motor coach trips 
to the mall were up 36 percent. Separately, this contact noted that 
charitable gift giving rose markedly from 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity remained robust as the year came to 
a close. The composite production index for purchasing managers' 
surveys in Milwaukee, Detroit and Chicago has eased back from 
especially high levels in the second quarter of 1994, but in 
December still remained at a level consistent with vigorous growth 
in District industrial output. A similar trend was evident in 
surveys conducted in Western Michigan. Reflecting continued gains in 
durable and capital goods output, District steel production posted 
relatively sharp increases in October, November and December, in 
contrast to a normal seasonal slowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large automaker stated that dealer orders and showroom traffic 
remained stable or even picked up a little around the industry in 
recent months, on a seasonally adjusted basis. A large steelmaker 
stated that first quarter production plans were recently raised in 
response to modestly higher auto industry demand than originally 
anticipated. An association or machining shops reported that 
production continued to trend higher in recent months, with machine 
tool purchases among its membership surging since the industry trade 
show in September. One machine cool manufacturer stated that 
customers' capacity expansion projects accounted for a greater share 
of orders growth in recent months, joining continued gains in orders 
for tools designed more closely for productivity improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continued to tighten up, and there was little 
sign of softening in employer hiring intentions entering the new 
year. A substantial number of retailers expressed difficulty meeting 
seasonal labor needs during the holiday season, although this 
experience was not universal. An association of machining companies 
stated that skilled worker shortages continue to raise production 
bottlenecks, although they haven't intensified greatly since mid-
1994. In some cases these shortages have even prompted capital 
spending delays, as firms postpone the delivery of needed equipment 
because workers aren't available to operate the machinery. Staffing 
services firms have suggested that labor shortages and associated 
wage pressures are more closely concentrated in blue-collar than 
white collar labor. Separate surveys by two compensation consulting 
companies suggested that salary increases in large firms during 1995 
will remain in line with 1994, on average, but variable pay 
(contingent on sales growth, profitability, customer service or 
other goals) will continue to take an increased share of total 
compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hog production during the fall months was up only marginally from 
the year before and well short of expectations. Moreover, producers 
have made sizable cuts in both the inventory of foundation stock and 
in the intended number of litters to be farrowed this winter. As a 
result, analysts now believe the gains in pork supplies will end 
early in the second half. Production cuts have been especially 
apparent in this District, which normally accounts for about half of 
all hogs raised nationwide.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price increases seem to remain centered in basic materials and 
intermediate goods, as retailers continued to stress intense 
competitive constraints on pricing. A number of large retailers 
indicated that holiday season discounting and promotional activity 
were more aggressive than expected a few months ago. Inflationary 
expectations continued to rise in the industrial sector, however. 
The price components of District purchasing managers' surveys 
climbed further in recent months, pointing to faster industrial 
price inflation even as output growth slowed a little from its 
extremely rapid pace earlier in 1994. The price component of the 
Chicago survey has climbed steadily this year, but remains below 
levels during the late 1980s. The price component of the Detroit 
survey has depicted higher price increases for most of the last 
year, and in December climbed to its highest level since late 1987. 
A large share of respondents to surveys in Western Michigan 
continued to express frustration with shortages and lengthy lead 
times. Looking ahead, another regular survey of District businesses 
showed a significant increase in the share of respondents expecting 
higher inflation. When asked to name the most serious threat to 1995 
business conditions, rising interest rates and rising inflation were 
the most frequently mentioned factors in this survey.
