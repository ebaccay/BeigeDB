       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic conditions improved in May and early June, as 
consumer spending strengthened and input price pressures eased in 
the manufacturing sector. Inventory paring prompted retrenchment in 
District industrial output growth in recent months, while capital 
equipment producers' reports remained stronger than those from 
manufacturers of consumer goods. Retail sales growth strengthened in 
May and early June, after bad weather and some other special factors 
cut into sales in March and early April. Lower mortgage interest 
rates have yet to spark a widespread rebound in home sales and 
construction, but they have certainly buoyed optimism in this 
sector. District labor markets remained tight, but slowing growth in 
labor demand eased wage pressures in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Inventory paring prompted retrenchment in District industrial output 
growth in recent months. Purchasing managers' surveys in the region 
depicted substantial easing in production and new orders growth 
during March, April, and May. In turn, the price components of these 
surveys pointed to diminished input price pressures. Survey 
respondents' comments and reports from other District contacts 
pointed to a smoother flow of goods in the pipeline. However, even 
after its recent decline, the prices-paid component of the Chicago 
purchasing managers' survey remained at a relatively high level (in 
line with the late 1980s).
     </p>
     <p>
      District steel production flattened out at high levels through the 
early part of the second quarter,  then declined relatively sharply 
in late May and early June -- largely due to an explosion and 
downtime at a large blast furnace in Gary. Orders for steel from 
auto and appliance producers have eased in recent months, according 
to a large steel producer, while other markets remain relatively 
strong. A large appliance manufacturer stated that shipments remain 
below year-earlier levels, but have improved recently. Appliance 
industry data suggest shipments increased slightly in April and the 
first four weeks of May on a seasonally adjusted basis. A large 
manufacturer of housing products stated that shipments are running 
ahead of orders, but the company is building inventory even as 
backlogs decline. "We think things could turn up in the latter half 
of the year, and we don't want to get caught short."
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital equipment producers' reports generally remained stronger 
than those from manufacturers of consumer goods. A large 
manufacturer of machine tools characterized orders from the 
automotive Industry as "stable;" with no significant recent 
cancellations. Manufacturers of construction equipment continued to 
report strong sales gains. A heavy-duty truck manufacturer reported 
that orders fell below year-earlier levels after a stronger-than-
expected first quarter, but a price increase and tighter order 
cancellation policies prompted some of the recent pullback. A 
manufacturer of industrial automation equipment reported a slight 
decline in orders growth in April and May, but noted that "we've 
still got a backlog of biblical proportions."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales growth improved in the District in May and early June. 
A large retailer reported a stronger sales gain during May than in 
April, in spite of a more difficult year-over-year comparison. In 
turn, sales gains in early June were running above May's pace. 
Growth in this retailer's sales of appliances and home electronics 
exceeded the company-wide average in May and June, while apparel 
sales strengthened as well. Another large retailer stated that 
appliance sales increased along normal seasonal trends and in line 
with expectations during May, after falling below expectations in 
March and April. A large superstore chain also reported faster sales 
gains in May and early June than earlier in the year. Improved 
weather boosted sales of seasonal items, although this contact noted 
that these sales remain below targets set earlier in the year. A 
large apparel retailer stated that sales growth improved in May, 
particularly in areas where poor weather curtailed seasonal 
improvement in spring apparel sales in March and April. "We are 
cautiously optimistic," this contact noted. "We aren't optimistic, 
we are cautiously optimistic." A large car rental firm stated that 
business in the region strengthened significantly during May, after 
adjusting for normal seasonal trends. Sales tax revenues in one 
large District state posted a year-over-year increase in May twice 
the rate of the increase for the year-to-date.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of surveyed District auto dealers reported stronger sales 
in May and early June than in April, after discounting normal 
seasonal trends, while a slimmer majority expected sales to 
strengthen from the first half of the year to the second half. Most 
speaker presentations prepared for our recent auto industry outlook 
conference were cautiously optimistic, and the consensus forecast 
prepared for the meeting implied a small gain for new vehicle sales 
in the latter half of 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from realtors and homebuilders did not yield evidence of a 
widespread upturn in housing, but lower mortgage interest rates have 
certainly buoyed optimism in the sector. A minority of surveyed 
realtors stated that lower rates boosted homebuying interest in 
recent weeks. The latest survey conducted by a state association of 
realtors showed a significant year-over-year decline in existing 
home sales in the first quarter of 1995. Home sales have been 
relatively stable this year, according to an association leader, and 
seem to remain on an uptrend. Homebuilding permits continued to 
decline in the Chicago area through April and the leader of a large 
association of homebuilders stated that declining mortgage interest 
rates "haven't  really sparked all that much new activity, yet." 
Nonetheless, most housing industry contacts still expected better 
results in the latter half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets remain tight, but slowing expansion in the 
demand for labor may have eased wage pressures in recent months. A 
survey by a large temporary help company showed a flattening out in 
the rate of expansion in Midwest firms' hiring plans in the second 
quarter. However, this measure remained at its highest level since 
the survey began in 1977. Expansion in hiring plans among Midwest 
durable goods manufacturers has abated thus far in 1995, but these 
plans remained stronger than those of other Midwest employers as 
well as their national counterparts. Help-wanted advertising in the 
East North Central region posted an increase from the first quarter 
to April. A District newspaper reported that its help-wanted 
advertising section continued to expand strongly in May, albeit at a 
slightly slower rate than earlier in the year. "It's still very 
robust here" this contact stated. Another large newspaper reported 
that help-wanted advertising revenues posted a larger increase in 
May than the substantial increase for the year-to-date. An index of 
help-wanted advertising slipped in Western Michigan, but remained at 
a relatively high level. Several temporary help companies reported 
that expansion in demand for temporary workers slowed, but remained 
positive. At the same time, the supply of workers continued to 
tighten. One temporary help firm stated that its placements could 
grow faster were the supply of labor to increase, even if expansion 
in demand were to continue to slow. Prices charged client companies 
are still expected to increase, largely due to the rising expense of 
attracting workers. The regional manager of one large temporary help 
company stated that unfilled orders "are still running at a high 
level, and we're only just starting to enter into our busy period." 
Automotive-related placements slowed in Indiana, according to this 
contact, but total unfilled orders are still at high levels.
