      </b>
     </p>

      Reports from Twelfth District 
                contacts indicate modest economic growth in late July and August, 
                with substantial variation in conditions across and within sectors. 
                Wage and price increases were limited. Respondents noted solid 
                consumer demand for automobiles and other big-ticket items, but 
                sales of other retail trade and service items generally were flat 
                to down. Orders and sales of most high-tech and other manufacturing 
                products were sluggish, with excess capacity still a concern. 
                In agricultural markets, despite solid overall conditions, some 
                producers struggled with adverse supply factors, while energy 
                markets saw stable supply. Demand for commercial real estate was 
                weak, with rents falling further in some markets, but residential 
                demand remained solid. Financial institutions saw weak demand 
                for business loans, and they tightened credit standards for riskier 
                business loan applicants.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported little upward pressure on wages and 
                  prices in the most recent survey period, except for employer 
                  benefit costs. Widespread price discounting was reported at 
                  the wholesale and retail level for many consumer products and 
                  for high-tech, travel, and professional services. Rising energy 
                  prices increased production costs a bit in the agricultural 
                  and manufacturing sectors. Contacts indicated abundant labor 
                  supply and flat to slightly elevated wages, with substantial 
                  willingness on the part of job seekers to accept smaller compensation 
                  packages. However, some employers, especially in the high-tech 
                  sector, reportedly have resumed paying merit increases after 
                  suspending them last year. Increases in the cost of health insurance 
                  raised employers' benefit costs noticeably, and recent labor 
                  unrest has raised concern for near-term economic activity in 
                  the shipping industry, commercial aircraft manufacturing, and 
                  Hawaii's lodging sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales were mixed during the survey period. Contacts reported 
                    solid automobile sales and increased sales of large appliances, 
                    spurred by favorable financing terms and, for appliances, strong 
                    home sales. Sales of smaller retail items were weak in general, 
                    falling relative to the previous survey and year-earlier levels. 
                    Inventories for retail goods were stable and quite lean, with 
                    one respondent noting that the preference for tight inventories 
                    among clothing retailers was reinforced by the perception of 
                    heightened demand risk that has emerged in the aftermath of 
                    September 11.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions also were mixed in the District's 
                      service sectors. In Hawaii's tourism sector, weak counts for 
                      international visitors were largely offset by strong domestic 
                      travel, bringing the sector close to year-earlier performance 
                      levels. However, travel demand elsewhere was generally weak, 
                      with slight additional deterioration reported for the San Francisco 
                      Bay Area; some airlines faced financial difficulties due to 
                      weak demand for air travel. Providers of telecommunications 
                      services struggled with their bottom lines and implemented further 
                      layoffs in some areas. However, demand for health services expanded 
                      further, and improved demand and firming prices were noted for 
                      broadcast advertising.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions in the District's manufacturing sector were weak, 
                        with mostly flat or slightly declining demand relative to previous 
                        survey periods and continued excess capacity. Demand for most 
                        high-tech products, such as computers and telecommunications 
                        equipment, was sluggish, although respondents noted a small 
                        sales pickup and rising capacity utilization for semiconductor 
                        producers. Producers of other manufactured products also saw 
                        weak conditions in general, with demand for commercial aircraft 
                        reduced by ongoing problems in the airline industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related 
                          Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for most District agricultural and resource products 
                          was solid, although some producers faced adverse supply conditions. 
                          Yields and sales of fruits, vegetables, and nuts were high, 
                          spurred in part by strengthened export demand. However, drought 
                          conditions in some areas have restricted the supply and raised 
                          the price of various grains; this in turn has spurred ranchers 
                          to sell beef cattle earlier than preferred due to increased 
                          feed and grazing costs. In addition, fires in Oregon have hampered 
                          logging operations there. In the markets for natural gas and 
                          electricity, contacts noted that supply conditions are adequate 
                          to meet demand and keep prices stable in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports suggest that commercial real estate markets are at or 
                            near bottom, while residential market activity remains at high 
                            levels but may have peaked. Vacancy rates on commercial and 
                            industrial space were flat or increased at a slower pace than 
                            in previous periods. Some of the weakest markets, such as the 
                            San Francisco Bay Area, saw further declines in rental rates 
                            on commercial space. By contrast, industrial rents reportedly 
                            were flat or up slightly in most areas. Commercial construction 
                            activity remained at very low levels. On the residential side, 
                            sales activity and prices continued at high levels throughout 
                            the District, although the momentum for further expansion waned 
                            in late July and August. Housing starts declined a bit in some 
                            areas, and despite the reduction in inventory, the pace of housing 
                            price increases slowed. Construction capacity and materials 
                            were readily available, and material costs remained low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial institutions experienced mixed credit conditions. 
                              Despite amply available credit, business loan demand was weak, 
                              and respondents noted heightened competition among lenders for 
                              low risk loans in several District markets. At the same time, 
                              banks tightened underwriting standards for riskier business 
                              borrowers. In contrast to business loans, household loan demand 
                              remained strong, due to low interest rates and robust mortgage 
                              originations and refinancing activity.
