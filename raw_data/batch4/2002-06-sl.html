      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 12, 2002
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the District 
              is continuing to pick up, although slowly. Retailers report that 
              sales have been flat compared with their year-earlier levels, although 
              many apparel and automobile retailers attribute this to cool, rainy 
              weather and remain optimistic about the coming months. Cutbacks 
              continue in some manufacturing industries, although reports of recovery 
              are increasingly common. The residential real estate market continues 
              to be strong throughout most of the District, although the market 
              for high-end homes has been less strong. Commercial real estate 
              markets continue to be weak throughout the District. Although credit 
              standards remain largely unchanged, there are reports of increased 
              credit standards for mortgages and commercial and industrial loans. 
              In the agricultural sector, flooding and unfavorable weather have 
              delayed planting and damaged crops in much of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On average, contacts report that spending in April and May was flat 
              compared with year-earlier levels. Over one-half of the retailers 
              noted that sales met their expectations. Appliances, perishables, 
              furnishings and other home products, and summer items were strong 
              sellers, while apparel, jewelry, and gift items moved more slowly. 
              Some contacts attributed the slow summer-apparel sales to cool, 
              rainy weather. While inventories are lower than last year, contacts 
              reported that they tended to be at their desired levels. Retailers 
              remain optimistic about the summer, with over half of those surveyed 
              expecting growth over last year and about one-third expecting sales 
              to be about the same as their 2001 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District report 
              that sales were up, on average, in April but tapered off in May. 
              Reasons given for this decline include cool, rainy weather and low 
              consumer confidence. About one-half of contacts said that strong 
              manufacturer incentives have had the effect of "stealing" current 
              sales by prompting customers to buy early. A majority of dealers 
              are still offering these incentives, although less aggressively. 
              Several contacts noted decreased interest in new and high-end vehicles 
              and greater interest in cheaper, fuel-efficient vehicles. Overall, 
              dealers reported desirable inventory levels for all vehicles. Just 
              under 70 percent of dealers contacted are optimistic about summer 
              sales, expecting to see growth over last year, while the rest expect 
              sales to be around their 2001 levels. About one-third of the dealers 
              noted higher rejection rates of finance applications, while the 
              rest reported no change.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other 
              Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Eighth District manufacturing sector continues to recover, although 
              slowly. While cutbacks, layoffs, and plant closings are still being 
              reported in some industries, reports of recovery and growth are 
              increasingly common. Industries that have seen an increase in business 
              include apparel, furniture, medical supply, aluminum, food, home 
              products, power, corrugated box, and tools manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the services sector 
              are mixed. While distribution and logistics companies are still 
              recovering from a downturn last fall, some contacts noted that losses 
              were not as large as expected and that some companies have seen 
              strong employment and sales. Several medical centers in the District 
              are expanding, although the shortage of healthcare workers continues 
              to be a concern. Contacts also reported that advertising and gaming 
              are strong and that the tourism industry is doing better than expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's residential real estate market continues to be strong. 
              Housing sales in the Memphis and Little Rock portions of the District 
              are ahead of their 2001 levels. Also, sales in southern Indiana 
              were up between March and April, while sales in northern Mississippi 
              continued to improve. In most areas, though, high-end homes are 
              selling slowly or are selling at lower prices. Commercial real estate 
              markets continue to be relatively weak. For example, the vacancy 
              rate in the St. Louis industrial market was higher through the first 
              part of the year, and reduced lease rates are being used to attract 
              tenants. Residential construction opportunities are strong throughout 
              the District, as April year-to-date building permit levels were 
              generally higher than a year earlier. Commercial construction is 
              more mixed, remaining slow in western Tennessee but picking up in 
              central and western Kentucky.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent survey of senior loan officers at a sample of District 
              banks indicates that the credit standards for commercial and industrial 
              (C&amp;I;) loans have remained largely unchanged in the last three months. 
              Some contacts, though, reported a slight tightening of standards 
              for C&amp;I; loans, primarily due to deterioration in their bank's current 
              or expected capital position. Also important were increased defaults 
              by borrowers and decreased secondary market liquidity for loans. 
              Most contacts reported a moderately weaker demand for C&amp;I; loans 
              due to lower customer financing needs and cheaper nonbank sources 
              of financing. They also reported largely unchanged credit standards 
              for residential mortgages, consumer loans, and credit cards; although 
              a few reported moderate tightening. Commercial paper back-up lines 
              of credit have remained unchanged for nonfinancial firms. Contacts 
              reported no unexpected change in their operations or activity since 
              September 11. The only exception was a slight increase in the collateral 
              requirement for commercial real estate borrowers.
     </p>

      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural 
              Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unseasonably cool temperatures and substantial rainfall during May 
              have slowed the pace of corn and soybean planting and have impeded 
              crop emergence in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and parts of Kentucky. 
              In many cases, planting took place under less-than-ideal conditions. 
              Both corn and soybean plantings this year lag behind last year's 
              pace throughout the District. Planting that should have been completed 
              by mid- to late-May was reported as only one-half to two-thirds 
              complete by the first of June, with contacts reporting widespread 
              delays in southern Illinois and southern Indiana. In some areas, 
              further delays may force farmers to plant soybeans instead of corn. 
              Heavy rains have also caused substantial flooding and crop damage 
              in some areas along the Missouri, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. 
              Contacts in Arkansas and Mississippi report that the rice and cotton 
              crops are off to sluggish starts because of the cool, wet spring. 
              In general, the rice crop is in good condition while the cotton 
              crop is in fair condition. The winter wheat crop is generally in 
              good condition as the summer harvest approaches.
