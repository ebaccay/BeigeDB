      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity in he Twelfth District continues to strengthen 
modestly, although there are reports of slowing in some sectors. The 
strengthening partly reflects some pick-up in California's still 
moderate recovery. Activity continues to accelerate in Oregon, but 
growth is easing from high levels in the intermountain states. On a 
sectoral basis, retail sales growth slowed in January and early 
February, while service sector firms report generally strong demand 
and some upward pressure on input prices. Computer, machinery, and 
paper manufacturers report strong domestic and foreign demand, while 
lumber and aerospace firms show continued weakness. Agricultural 
conditions generally are good, with strong exports to Asia 
offsetting declining sales to Mexico. Residential real estate
activity has slowed noticeably in most areas, but commercial  
markets remain strong in the intermountain states and the Pacific 
Northwest. District banks report slow deposit growth, but generally 
strong loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District business leaders expect national economic growth to 
moderate over to next year. About three-fifths of survey respondents 
project national output growth to slow to the long-run historical 
average pace, after above-average growth last year. One-third of 
business leaders expect an increase in the unemployment rate during 
to next year, a marked change from he last report when few projected 
a worsening in unemployment. Business leaders expect continued 
strong growth in District exports to Asia and Europe, but weakness 
in sales to Canada and Mexico.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers report some slowing of sales growth in January 
and early February. Food store sales were slow and prices have yet 
to rise despite large increases in packaging costs. Consumer soft 
good sales also were reported slow, with prices flat or declining. 
New car sales in Idaho in December and January were reported down 9 
percent from a year earlier. Dealers have increased the use of 
rebates and other incentives to bolster sales. Retailers close to 
the Mexican border near San Diego report sharp declines in sales 
since the devaluation of the Mexican peso. In Idaho and Utah, 
reports indicate that entry-level retail workers are increasingly 
difficult to hire, and wage have risen 3 to 3 1/2 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many District service providers report continued strong demand. 
Software and communication firms in Washington continue to 
experience strong growth, but note some upward pressure on input 
prices. Newspapers report excellent demand, but newsprint prices are 
sharply higher. Lower health care premiums and slower growth in 
wages for health care workers are reported in the Pacific Northwest. 
Hotel occupancy remains above 80 percent in Salt Lake City, pushing 
room rates up 6 to 8 percent. In Southern California, hotel 
occupancy and room rates are beginning to increase slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remains mixed. Tool and machinery 
manufacturers report continued strong domestic and export demand, 
with prices rising for heavy construction equipment. Pulp and paper 
product orders and prices have increased. Newsprint manufacturers 
are operating at high levels of capacity utilization. Conversely, 
lumber sales continue to slow and prices are well below year earlier 
levels. Aerospace manufacturing remains weak, as lower production at 
Boeing is expected to lead to layoffs at its suppliers in the region 
this year. An additional 3,700 layoffs are expected at the Hanford 
nuclear facility in Washington by September 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural and resource industry conditions generally are good. 
Total District agricultural exports continue to grow, as rising 
exports to Asia offset slowing sales to Mexico. Arizona and 
California cotton producers report high production, prices, and 
export sales. Washington apple exports are reaching Japan for the 
first time, but sales to Mexico have slowed substantially. Cattle 
prices have risen, but reports from Arizona indicate that beef 
exports to Mexico have virtually stopped. District farmers report 
lower feed grain prices and significantly improved water 
availability, but pesticide and chemical prices have increased. Farm 
worker wages are reported flat in most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Timber exports to Japan have increased in response to demand from 
the Kobe earthquake rebuilding effort. Electricity prices in the 
Pacific Northwest are expected to remain low through the summer 
because of abundant hydroelectric supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential home sales and construction activity are reported to 
have slowed in most areas. Even with the recent slowing, the level 
of activity remains high in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and 
Utah; upward pressure on construction materials prices is reported 
in those markets. In California, home sales are reported to have 
slowed from 1994's pace, but sales and construction activity are 
expected to strengthen during the remainder of 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial markets are strong outside of California. In Salt Lake 
City, low office, industrial, and retail vacancy rates are spurring 
increases in rents and building activity. In downtown Portland, 
Oregon, office vacancy rates are the lowest in the nation, and rents 
are reported rising. Likewise, commercial and industrial office 
vacancy rates are falling and rents are rising in the Puget Sound 
area. Commercial office vacancy rates remain high in Los Angeles and 
San Francisco, and little new construction is reported, but some 
improvement in activity is expected during 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks in most parts of the District report slower deposit growth, 
but generally good loan demand. Consumer and business loan demand is 
reported strong in Southern California. In Northern California, loan 
demand is weaker, with competitive pressures on loan pricing and 
underwriting criteria. Some reports from Oregon indicate a recent 
slowing in loan demand. Upward pressure on wages are reported for 
entry-level workers at Oregon banks. Loan demand and quality remain 
good in Utah.
