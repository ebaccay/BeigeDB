      <p>
       The First District economy shows few signs of improvement. Retailers cite disappointing 

  December results, although some gained in January and February. Most manufacturing 

  contacts report weak demand. Commercial real estate markets in New England remain 

  very slow. Most software and information technology providers say demand is 

  declining. The outlook is highly uncertain and virtually no contacts are making 

  plans based on expectations of an upturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most retail contacts in New England report lackluster sales in December, although 

  some contacts report a slight uptick in January and February. Art and graphics 

  supplies reportedly sold well, while electronics sales slowed and inventories 

  rose. Conditions in the travel and tourism sector remain weak; contacts report 

  hotel occupancy rates in the Boston area continue to be low because of soft 

  corporate and international travel. Furniture sales did not meet expectations 

  in December, but reportedly picked up in January and February. A surplus merchandise 

  contact experienced record-high sales in December, having obtained unusually 

  good inventory from big retailers. Hardware stores report double-digit increases 

  in sales compared with a year ago; the harsh weather and fear of terrorism--consumers 

  purchasing items such as duct tape and plastic--have helped boost sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most retailers are holding employment levels steady; two contacts, however, 

  are implementing slight decreases in head count. Wages are mostly constant, 

  although Maine's minimum wage increase has led to some raises even in above-minimum 

  pay rates. Most capital spending plans continue to be minimal. Overall, vendor 

  prices and selling prices are level or falling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some retail contacts expect sales to increase slightly over the next six months, 

  while others foresee little improvement. Most contacts are hopeful for a turnaround 

  if the geopolitical uncertainties are resolved in the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District manufacturing contacts continue to report few, if any, signs 

  of a pickup in demand for their products in early 2003. Most makers of capital 

  goods and other business products indicate that business is weak, especially 

  for aircraft and power equipment. Makers of consumer products say business is 

  soft or, at best, just meeting plan. Some consumer goods companies indicate 

  new signs of deterioration. For example, one furniture company observes that 

  consumers became more cautious in early February and a label maker says that 

  sales to retailers have been running below expectations in the new year. However, 

  others say that conditions are basically similar to what they observed in late 

  2002 or even a little better. In contrast to the general trend, sales of supplies 

  and equipment to health-related sectors continue to rise. Contacts in the semiconductor 

  industry anticipate that first-quarter revenues will be up at a double-digit 

  rate from a year ago; however, one firm is continuing to see good momentum quarter 

  to quarter, while another calls the quarterly pattern "flattish."
      </p>
      <p>
       Selling prices remain under competitive pressure. Although materials costs 

  are generally in check, contacts express concern that rising oil prices will 

  raise costs for items such as plastics and chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       About one-half of the manufacturing contacts expect to shrink their workforce 

  in coming months. Most of the remaining firms are either holding staffing steady 

  following layoffs in recent months or hiring selectively. In 2003 merit pay 

  increases are or will be modest, ranging from zero percent to 4 percent at most 

  firms. Capital spending budgets for 2003 generally are similar to last year's. 

  The few companies planning significant increases cite the need for efficiency 

  improvements or new product development.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most manufacturers are either anticipating or hoping for a modest improvement 

  in conditions during 2003. However, they remain cautious in the face of economic 

  and geopolitical uncertainties. Contacts variously describe their companies 

  as "focusing inward" ? "not spending with confidence, not taking a lot of chances" 

  ? "just muddling along" ? "[having] absolutely no visibility right now."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Temporary Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Conditions in the staffing industry are mixed, with most companies experiencing 

  flat or modest year-over-year growth in revenues and profits during the fourth 

  quarter of 2002 and early 2003. Labor supply remains abundant. Wages and billing 

  rates are largely unchanged, although many respondents express alarm at steady 

  increases in employee insurance costs. Temp hiring in manufacturing and light 

  industry is particularly weak, with Vermont reportedly lagging behind the other 

  New England states. Staffing firms are keeping their own payroll and capital 

  spending low, with few instances of further restructuring or reorganization. 

  Most respondents anticipate modest growth in 2003, particularly during the second 

  half.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial real estate markets in New England remain sluggish. Respondents report 

  little change in activity since our last contact in November, with any new leasing 

  activity being spurred predominantly by consolidation rather than by expansion 

  or growth. While demand for building purchases continues to be strong, lack 

  of demand for rental space has led to lower rental rates and higher vacancy 

  rates in office markets throughout the region. In the Boston area, the published 

  vacancy rates are around 15 percent in the city and 30 percent in the suburbs, 

  but substantially more space is actually available for rent, as some companies 

  make deals for space that is not even listed for sublease. Rental rates for 

  Class A space have dropped to what Class B or Class C buildings commanded two 

  years ago. With little expectation that the economy will improve in the near 

  future, contacts predict a third consecutive year of negative absorption.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Software and Information Technology Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The demand for software and information technology services has continued to 

  weaken in early 2003. With some exceptions, contacts in the software industry 

  report flat or negative first-quarter revenue growth ranging from zero percent 

  to minus 12 percent compared with last quarter. January is said to have been 

  atypically slow for several custom applications and network software firms. 

  Providers of telecom-related software and services report soft sales along a 

  continuing downward trend, while firms selling software development tools say 

  demand has been level since November. By contrast, several contacts producing 

  human resources and health-care software report annual revenue growth of more 

  than 10 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Software producers seeing revenue gains continue to add labor. The rest are 

  still adding no jobs, with some firms having reached optimal size and others 

  beginning to struggle to avoid layoffs. Capital spending is level across the 

  sector with few plans for change in the coming months. Companies continue to 

  spend only out of necessity or to complete previously postponed investment projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Software and information technology contacts indicate that 
                  the outlook has deteriorated since the last quarter of 2002 
                  and is marked by considerable uncertainty. The majority of respondents 
                  expect flat to deteriorating demand for the next quarter, partly 
                  reflecting increased geopolitical risk.
