      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In late winter, the economy of the Ninth District remains strong, 
but consumers show increasing caution, particularly in regard to 
home and vehicle purchases. Manufacturers remain active as do 
construction firms. Iron and copper mining is strong. Paper 
production is going full steam. Weather and soil moisture conditions 
are excellent going into the new crop season and the mild winter has 
been beneficial for livestock producers. Office and commercial real 
estate rental markets are tight.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other side of the coin, sales of general merchandise are 
reportedly slack and auto dealers across the district describe mild 
to sharp drops in sales. Some tourist businesses suffered from lack 
of snow. Residential construction is slower than the previous two 
seasons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets in most cities remain tight and skilled manufacturing 
workers are particularly hard to get. However, reported wage 
increases are only marginally higher than those in the preceding 
three years. Some raw material and intermediate goods prices 
continue to rise, although reports of delays in delivery have 
moderated from last fall. Lumber prices have declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing is now the economy's bellwether. Directors, news 
media, advisory council members, electrical utilization figures and 
industry sources all describe the strongest manufacturing sector in 
recent years. Labor shortages are most pronounced in this sector, 
and the most common reports of price increases concern purchased 
inputs for manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The paper industry is coursing ahead with full sails after spending 
three or more years in the doldrums. Sales of all grades of paper 
from coated magazine stock to newsprint and packaging are reportedly 
very strong and most mills are running at capacity. One mill in 
Michigan's Upper Peninsula is investing over $100 million in a new 
paper machine and related plant expansion. Other mills reportedly 
are making improvements to eliminate bottlenecks. Lumber prices have 
softened somewhat from 1994 levels, reportedly due to some 
slackening in demand for residential construction and to higher than 
anticipated production in the Northwest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong demand from the steel industry and high copper prices have 
been a boon to the two major components of Ninth District mining. 
Iron mines on both shores of Lake Superior are running at capacity 
and at much higher levels of productivity than prevailed before 
painful restructuring that occurred in the 1980s. One Minnesota mine 
expects to produce 14.5 million tons in 1995 with less than 1,500 
workers, beating its previous record of 14.1 million tons set in 
1981 with 4,200 workers. A new copper mine in Wisconsin is producing 
at a higher rate than anticipated and older mines are reportedly 
working at capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction continues to outpace residential work in 
many areas of the district. Warehouse construction is particularly 
good, in part as a result of changing structural patterns in 
wholesale-retail distribution, but also due to growing general 
demand. One Minneapolis-St. Paul manufacturer noted that warehouse 
lease rates have increased by nearly 50 percent since last year. 
Commercial construction is reportedly strong in Fargo, N.D., Sioux 
Falls, S.D., and other urban areas. A Minnesota plumbing wholesaler 
said that requests for quotes for bidded projects were setting 
records.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction is apparently at a plateau, which building 
association officials describe as good, but is clearly below the 
levels achieved in the preceding two seasons. Fargo, N.D., and Sioux 
Falls, S.D., are areas of particular strength while western North 
Dakota is one area where residential work is reportedly much 
stronger than commercial. One Montana source noted a shift from 
retail and commercial work to government and industrial projects. 
Reports on sales of existing housing vary between localities but on 
balance such sales appear depressed from normal levels. Higher 
mortgage interest rates are cited by both builders and realtors as 
the principal cause of slowing in their businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fine weather and moderately stronger prices are setting a mood of 
cautious optimism as farmers approach the 1995 spring planting 
season. Livestock prices remain well below year-earlier levels but 
above the troughs reached in late 1994. Cattle numbers on January 1 
were generally 1 percent to 2 percent above 1994's already high 
levels, thus promising no early price relief. Crop prices are 
similarly below early 1994 levels but up from levels prevailing 
earlier in the winter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Minneapolis Fed quarterly survey of farm bankers reveals demand 
for all types of loans, together with farm income and spending, as 
slightly below normal levels. Few bankers report customers having 
problems with debt service, and feeder livestock and machinery loan 
volumes are described as below usual levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The most marked turn in the economy appears to be in retail sales. 
After a good holiday season, sales by general merchandisers in 
January and February were barely above year-earlier levels and news 
reports describe a retail slump. One North Dakota regional mall 
manager described traffic as "so-so." Another in South Dakota 
described business as "a bit slow" but noted that increased 
competition due to retail sector overbuilding might be the cause 
rather than consumer reluctance.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Auto sales are very soft," says a South Dakota dealers' association 
representative, citing higher interest rates and caution by farmers 
as the principal reasons. After a strong showing through most of 
1994, auto sales have declined in all parts of the district. During 
February, registrations of new passenger cars and light trucks in 
Minnesota were down about 6 percent compared to year earlier levels. 
Similar contractions are reported in the Dakotas and Wisconsin 
dealers confirm slowness in their region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Winter tourism has generally suffered from sparse snow cover over 
much of the district. Snowmobiling and cross country skiing are down 
from last year in many areas. However, the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan and areas of northern Minnesota with good snow conditions 
report very good business. South Dakota and Minnesota officials 
report steady traffic to downhill ski areas and in Montana most ski 
resorts have good snow and good business. Cuts in Amtrak service 
will dampen activity in North Dakota and Montana, according to a 
resort executive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remain tight as unemployment rates in several 
metropolitan areas are below 4 percent. Involuntary overtime has 
become an issue for some manufacturing and mining firms. Grievances 
have been filed at one Minnesota mine where many workers have been 
putting in 60 hour weeks on a regular basis. Some Minneapolis-St 
Paul machine shops have foregone bidding on some jobs because of 
their inability to hire new machinists. Plumbers, pipefitters and 
other skilled building tradespersons are also reportedly in short 
supply. In spite of such apparent tightness, few sources report 
sharp wage increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices have risen sharply for paper products of all types, packaging 
materials and commodity chemicals such as chlorine, caustic soda and 
methanol. Prices of intermediate goods including hardware, machined 
assemblies and plastic components also are up, but delivery delays 
for steel and other materials have abated. Nor is there much 
evidence of price increases at the final goods level. Petroleum 
product prices are essentially unchanged from a year ago.
