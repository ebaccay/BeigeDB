      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic growth in the Ninth District is picking up 
somewhat after perceptible slowing in late winter. Vehicle sales are 
improving after a midwinter slump and there are some reports of 
increases for general merchandise. Manufacturers still have some 
slack, but a number of firms report that orders are once again 
increasing. Soaring grain prices are improving prospects for 
farmers, though optimism is tempered by a cold, late spring and 
depressed livestock prices. Once again, construction is very strong 
in most parts of the district. Metal mining and oil drilling and 
exploration are at the highest levels in this decade. As throughout 
the winter, tourist business varies by location, with eastern areas 
of the district fairly upbeat, but Montana and the Dakotas less so. 
Skilled employees remain hard to get, and unemployment rates are
low. There are few reports of wage pressures. Price increases are 
concentrated in grains and energy-related items such as fuels and 
basic plastics. Inventories are reportedly normal for most firms 
except for paper products, some slow-moving automobile models and a 
few manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Building activity booms" and "Developers gearing up" are headlines 
in a Minneapolis paper describing office development in that city's 
central business district, but they apply equally well to Ninth 
District construction as a whole. Builders in most areas of the 
district expect a strong construction season for the third or fourth 
year running. "Commercial builders in Minot expect to be very busy," 
reports a North Dakota director. Minnesota single-family housing 
permits issued in February were 28 percent and 5 percent above the 
same month in 1995 and 1994. Home builders in Sioux Falls, S.D., and 
other regional centers also expect good business.
     </p>
     <p>
      A fourth consecutive strong year for large, publicly let projects is 
developing in Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. Contracts 
let through March are about 25 percent above the same period last 
year. State highway and bridge projects predominate, but 
construction of schools, municipal buildings, churches and private 
commercial building are all strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Markets for existing real estate are also active. March 1996 sales 
of existing homes were up nearly 13 percent over March 1995 in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area and realtors report continued 
strength in listing and sales in April. Strong markets for existing 
housing are similarly reported in several other areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ninth District resource extraction industries are feeling their 
oats. "With the plants already running wide open and order books 
full, there's little room for more downtime," is an area newspaper's 
recent description of the predicament of Lake Superior iron mines as 
they try to make up for slowdowns caused by harsh weather earlier in 
the year. Iron shipments from Lake Superior ports began in early 
April in spite of adverse weather. The principal gold mine in South 
Dakota reported a large addition to its known reserves, and its 
ratio of reserves to annual production is now the highest in two 
decades. Oil drilling and especially seismic exploration are at 
their highest level in North Dakota in 15 years, and production 
continues to inch upwards after having declined slowly for the 
decade through 1994. In contrast to strength in the minerals 
sectors, paper output continues to slow, with increased reports of 
selective downtime.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unseasonably cold, wet weather has delayed tillage planting in all 
district states. Such spring activities are two weeks or more behind 
five-year averages. But soil moisture levels are as near optimal as 
at any time in the past four years, with few areas having either 
strongly surplus or strongly deficient soil moisture levels. Bankers 
and extension agents expect planting to progress rapidly once 
temperatures rise. Fall-seeded crops such as winter wheat and rye, 
which constitute a small fraction of total crop plantings, are in 
fair to good shape in contrast to the much-publicized deteriorating 
condition of such crops in other states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Continuing increases in grain prices are improving farm incomes, 
although many rural elevators continue to report difficulty in 
securing railroad cars to transport grain to ports. Most observers 
expect higher prices to persist through harvest, and farmers 
reportedly are responding by planning the highest plantings of major 
crops in years. Supplies of inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides 
and seed are generally adequate, although some seed suppliers report 
that farmers are already trying to exchange longer-season varieties 
for shorter-season ones, and that short-season varieties will be 
extremely scarce if adverse weather persists.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing apparently is picking up, although reports vary 
considerably by sector and firm. "Business is pretty good," says the 
owner of a Minnesota chemical products firm. "Things picked up a bit 
after January," reports a farm machinery firm in North Dakota. 
Makers of some industrial machinery and metal components continue to 
describe soft orders, but printers and electronic equipment and 
medical device manufacturers note some strengthening. And one 
circuit board manufacturer announced plans to add 1,000 more workers 
by early 1997. Industrial electrical use has not grown from year-
earlier levels, however. Most manufacturers report normal 
inventories for their own businesses and their suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Cars are selling pretty well, things picked up in February and 
haven't slowed down," reports a South Dakota industry spokesperson. 
Vehicles and farm machinery are both selling pretty good," is the 
word from North Dakota. "We can't get enough of the light pickups 
and sport/utility vehicles says a St. Paul, Minn., auto dealer.
General merchandise sales also show some improvement from earlier in 
the year. "Traffic picked up in March and sales are excellent now," 
reports a South Dakota mall manager. A Minnesota department store 
executive notes improvements in sales for most lines since late 
winter. "Business is booming," says a retail spokesperson from 
Fargo, N.D., "but I think much of it comes from the way this town is 
growing." Other industry sources point to the difficulty of 
separating structural changes in retailing from changes in consumer 
spending. "Sales tax receipts at the state level from retail sales 
are consistently well above year-earlier levels, but our Main Street 
stores are dying," says a North Dakota director.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Montana had a disappointing winter tourist season, but hopes are 
that warmer weather will bring a good summer season. Unseasonably 
cold weather hurt business in all states in late February and in 
March, although the late spring prolonged cross-country skiing and 
snowmobiling in Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan. "But even the snowmobilers are getting sick of it," says 
one Upper Peninsula business owner. Prolonged ice cover in lakes and 
cold temperatures is raising concern about spring fishing opener 
participation. But overall, business owners and tourist officials 
are optimistic about prospects for the spring and summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "First 19-year old bus driver" headed a recent article describing 
how the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan transit system lowered its 
hiring age to secure desperately needed drivers. This is yet another 
indicator of how tight labor markets remain, especially for skilled 
blue collar workers. Fast-food and other service businesses 
employing low-skill workers have similar problems filling rosters. 
"I hate to see service slip the way it is," said one manager, 
apologizing for long checkout lines, "but we just can't get the 
people we need." Unemployment rates continue well below national 
averages. There are scattered reports of wage increases in the 4 
percent to 5 percent range. One large telemarketing firm announced a 
layoff of nearly 600 workers, but explained that these jobs are 
being moved to Florida because of a need for bilingual Spanish-
English workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy price increases, particularly for spot buyers of natural gas 
and for trucking firms, are the most widely noted price pressure. 
Some manufacturers who use polyethylene or polystyrene for packaging 
report rapid price increases from mid-February on, and low 
inventories by producers. "But cardboard prices are just in a 
freefall," reports one. Cash grain prices are soaring, and flour 
prices are following with only a slight lag. But a price war among 
breakfast cereal producers and plummeting livestock prices have thus 
far limited perceptible food price increases for consumers.
