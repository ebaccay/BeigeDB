     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District 
            expanded moderately in March and April. Manufacturers posted increases 
            in shipments and orders. Retail sales of general merchandise were 
            slightly higher than during the same period last year. Auto sales 
            were solidly above the year-ago pace. Bankers reported slight increases 
            in loan volume outstanding compared to a year ago, with most of the 
            gain attributable to commercial and industrial loans. Firms in a variety 
            of industries continue to indicate that finding and retaining employees 
            is difficult. While skilled workers are most in demand in service 
            industries, some manufacturers and construction companies indicated 
            they have been unable to fill their needs for both unskilled and skilled 
            labor. Reports of rising prices have increased in both the industrial 
            and consumer sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, most 
              business contacts in the Third District expect an easing in growth, 
              although retailers predict an improvement in sales. Manufacturers 
              forecast only steady rates of shipments and orders, on balance, 
              during the next six months. Retailers expect an upturn in sales 
              once the spring shopping period gets under way. Auto dealers foresee 
              a nearly steady rate of sales. Bankers anticipate slower growth 
              in business lending as a result of greater caution on the part of 
              lenders as well as borrowers. Bankers expect mortgage lending to 
              decline.
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing
       </b>
       <br/>
       Third District manufacturers reported moderate increases in shipments 
              and new orders in April. While only a few producers of nondurable 
              goods posted gains, most makers of durable goods saw increased demand 
              for their products. Rising shipments and growth in orders were relatively 
              more common among producers of lumber products, fabricated metal 
              products, and industrial and commercial equipment. Overall, order 
              backlogs and delivery times at industrial plants in the District 
              have been steady. Firms in a wide range of manufacturing industries 
              continue to report difficulty finding and retaining both skilled 
              and unskilled labor.
       <p>
        Third District manufacturers have trimmed their 
              forecasts recently. Earlier in the year they were predicting gains; 
              currently, the balance of opinion is that orders and production 
              will remain at about the current rate during the next two quarters. 
              Despite their forecast of steady business conditions, area manufacturers 
              expect prices of both the materials they purchase and the products 
              they make to remain on an upward trend.
        <p>
         <b>
          Retail
         </b>
         <br/>
         Reports from Third District retailers indicated that retail sales 
              were up moderately in March and the first half of April compared 
              to the same period a year ago. Discount stores, furniture and home 
              furnishings stores, and jewelry stores posted relatively strong 
              year-over-year increases. Clothing stores had modest gains. Results 
              at department stores varied, but on balance, these stores had year-over-year 
              gains of around 4 percent, in current dollars. Retailers believe 
              the late Easter this year has shifted consumer purchasing to the 
              end of April, and they expect better sales at the end of the month. 
              Cold weather was also cited as a cause of lower than expected sales 
              in early April, especially for spring apparel.
         <p>
          Auto dealers indicated that sales have been strong 
              in recent weeks. Nearly all the dealers surveyed for this report 
              said sales in March and early April exceeded sales in the same period 
              a year ago by significant amounts. Extensive manufacturers' incentives 
              were said to be supporting the high rate of sales. Dealers indicated 
              that these incentives, in the form of rebates and low-rate financing, 
              were offsetting any effect that might have been expected from recent 
              increases in consumer loan rates at financial institutions. Dealers' 
              earlier concern about slow sales of new large sport utility vehicles 
              has receded as sales of those vehicles have risen recently. Dealers 
              foresee some slowing in sales during the rest of the year. They 
              expect sales for all of this year to decline a few percent from 
              last year's level.
          <p>
           <b>
            Finance
           </b>
           <br/>
           Loan volume outstanding at Third District banks has edged up in 
              recent weeks, mainly because of growth in business lending. On balance, 
              banks in the District were boosting commercial and industrial lending. 
              Bankers reported that business borrowers were implementing their 
              expansion plans for the year, although a few bankers noted that 
              some firms with plans to develop Internet ventures were delaying 
              those initiatives and putting them under review.
           <p>
            Consumer lending was generally sluggish, with 
              most banks reporting flat to slightly declining loan volume outstanding 
              in March and April. The sluggishness in consumer lending extended 
              to credit cards, home equity loans, and indirect lending. Bankers 
              also reported that home mortgage refinancing activity has dropped 
              as mortgage interest rates have risen. In contrast, purchase money 
              mortgage lending has been rising, on balance, at banks in the region.
            <p>
             Commercial bank lending officers anticipate that 
              growth in business lending might ease as both lenders and borrowers 
              become more cautious about leverage ratios and debt service burdens. 
              However, bankers do not see any indications at this time of a slowdown 
              in business activity in the region. Financial institutions involved 
              in mortgage lending expect demand for purchase mortgages to slow 
              eventually in response to recent increases in interest rates. Some 
              banks that lend to builders and developers indicated that shortages 
              of construction labor and land approved for development appear to 
              be limiting the pace of home building in the region.
             <p>
              <b>
               Wages and Prices
              </b>
              <br/>
              Manufacturers reported continuing increases in prices for raw materials 
              and some manufactured inputs. The increases included but were not 
              limited to energy resources and petroleum-based products. Sectors 
              in which increases in input costs have been common are lumber products, 
              paper products, chemicals, and industrial equipment. As costs in 
              those sectors have risen, a growing number of firms have begun to 
              charge more for the products they make. In contrast, manufacturers 
              of apparel and processed foods indicated that their input costs 
              have been steady and foreign competition has impeded their ability 
              to raise prices for the goods they produce.
              <p>
               Retailers have also indicated that they are paying 
              more for some goods at the wholesale level. They have generally 
              avoided passing the full increase on to final selling prices, but 
              the combination of increases in the costs of some goods and rising 
              labor costs are leading a small but growing number of stores to 
              raise prices selectively.
