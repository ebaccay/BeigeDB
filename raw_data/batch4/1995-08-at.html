      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the Southeast generally reported improving economic 
activity since the last Beigebook period. Merchants said recent 
sales have bettered year-ago levels and expressed optimism about the 
fall season. Manufacturers generally expect to continue to see 
rising orders and output in the coming months, but gains are seen as 
modest and no significant hiring is expected. Summer tourism and 
theme park attendance appears to be exceeding expectations in most 
locales. Single-family housing sales are improving, and prices in 
some areas are increasing; markets also reportedly continue to 
strengthen for the commercial and multifamily segment. Bankers note 
generally healthy commercial and consumer loan demand. Most contacts 
believe that wage and price pressures are under control and expected 
them to remain so for the foreseeable future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers throughout the District reported that sales were above 
last year's levels during June and early July. Most merchants said 
that inventories were in good shape, with several noting that their 
inventories were actually a little under plan. Home furnishing sales 
have improved as have sales of women's and children's apparel. 
According to several retailers, men's apparel sales have slowed 
recently. Overall, retailers remain optimistic and expect good back-
to-school sales. Auto sales, on the other hand, were generally 
characterized as sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory activity is improving or steady, according to most industry 
representatives, but recent gains in shipments and new orders have 
been modest. Inventories for most producers are said to remain below 
levels posted earlier in the year. Most manufacturers contacted 
anticipate further near-term output increases; however, new hiring 
remains restrained. Some apparel manufacturing contacts said demand 
had recently been stronger than expected; however, some producers 
continue to announce layoffs. Increasing output was reported by
chemical plants, but they expressed a concern about the availability 
of raw materials. Industrial computer systems and electronics 
manufacturers note increasing order backlogs. Shipments are 
increasing for medical equipment fabricators, and producers of 
heavy-duty trucks say that strong demand has them operating at 100 
percent capacity. On the other hand, central Florida continues to be 
adversely impacted by military contractors' job cuts. Slow auto 
sales have also forced a regional tire producer to cut production. 
Although current sales remain good, some paper industry managers are 
becoming uneasy because of possibly slowing demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism is reported to be improving notably in Florida. There are 
more European visitors, and occupancy rates are rising. Savannah's 
tourist infrastructure is benefitting from improvements spurred by 
the Olympics. Casino gambling activity in Mississippi is reportedly 
stable to increasing, and hotel occupancies in New Orleans are above 
historical averages. On the basis of the record so far this summer, 
attendance at the region's theme parks is expected to outpace last 
year's figures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to real eats contacts, single-family home sales continued 
to improve throughout most of the District during June and early 
July. Realtors are again attributing the increase in housing demand 
to low mortgage rates. However, home inventories are extremely low 
in several markets, driving home prices up modestly. Single-family 
home construction activity is generally mixed. Both realtors and 
builders are cautiously optimistic that the market will continue to 
improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily contacts continue to report strengthening 
activity. Multifamily construction demand continues to be strong in 
many areas of the market but has slowed slightly in some. The 
majority of commercial construction remains build-to-suit; however, 
several major speculative office buildings have broken ground 
recently or been announced within the District. Realtors are 
optimistic and anticipate that both commercial and multifamily 
markets will continue to strengthen moderately during the remainder 
of 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers around the region report that overall loan demand remains 
moderately strong but portray competition on both price and credit 
terms as fierce. Commercial demand remains relatively strong. Most 
contacts reported moderate to strong activity in commercial and 
industrial lending; however, demand for commercial real estate loans 
has slowed. Consumer loan demand was generally characterized as 
mixed. Several bankers noted that home equity credit lines were 
doing quite well. They said that lower rates have spurred mortgage 
lending in the last few months. Refinancing activity has not been 
quite as strong as some bankers expected. With mortgage rates edging 
up again, many contacts expected home mortgage lending to slow 
somewhat in the coming months. Auto lending was reported to be flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although a few areas still face a shortage of skilled workers, wages 
generally remain stable in the region. Most contacts continue to 
report little change in prices received for finished goods or prices 
paid for materials. Few expect price changes in the near term. Those 
reporting price increases were confined mainly to the chemical, 
paper, and building products industries.
