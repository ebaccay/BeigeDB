      Recovery in the Eighth 
                District continues at a slow pace. Contacts in manufacturing report 
                few new hires, although some firms plan to expand in or relocate 
                to the District. Some contacts report that they are restructuring 
                with few or no layoffs. The services sector shows moderate growth, 
                with increased activity, particularly in tourism. Retail and auto 
                sales in July and August increased slightly over 2001 levels. 
                Sales of new homes have increased in several District locations, 
                but conditions in commercial real estate markets are mixed. In 
                the last three months, demand for commercial and industrial loans 
                has declined, while demand for residential mortgages, consumer 
                loans, and credit cards has remained mostly unchanged. In the 
                agricultural sector, estimates of crop yields for the upcoming 
                harvest are expected to be below year-ago levels throughout most 
                of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales showed flat-to-modest growth in the District in 
                  July and August, with one half of contacts reporting a slight 
                  increase in sales over 2001 levels. More than one half of the 
                  retailers surveyed noted that sales met their expectations, 
                  while one third expressed that sales were above what they had 
                  expected. Apparel, back-to-school items, and infant furniture 
                  sold well, while collectibles and gift items moved more slowly. 
                  Almost all contacts report that inventories are at desirable 
                  levels. Contacts are optimistic concerning fall sales, with 
                  three fourths of those surveyed expecting growth compared with 
                  last year, while the rest expect sales to be a little below 
                  2001 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District report that sales 
                  in July and August were up slightly, on average, compared with 
                  the same period in 2001. Several contacts note that sales of 
                  used and low-end vehicles were accounting for a relatively higher-than-normal 
                  percentage of car sales, although the rebates and financing 
                  incentives are holding consumers' interest in new automobiles. 
                  Overall, most dealers reported desirable inventory levels for 
                  all vehicles. One third of the dealers surveyed noted higher 
                  rejection rates of financing applications, while the rest saw 
                  no change. Three fourths of contacts are optimistic about fall 
                  sales, expecting to see growth over last year.

       Manufacturing and Other Business 
                  Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Eighth District's manufacturing sector continues to experience 
                  a slow recovery, on average. While some companies are still 
                  reporting cutbacks in capital spending, several of these reports 
                  indicate restructuring with few or no layoffs. Orders are up 
                  for some manufacturing products, including steel, auto components, 
                  and home and business products. Several firms are expanding 
                  or relocating to the District, including manufacturers in the 
                  plastics, cement, and window and door industries. While some 
                  contacts note few new hires to replace vacancies, others report 
                  that firms are experiencing difficulty finding skilled workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The services sector is showing moderate growth, 
                  District wide, although several contacts noted that firms are 
                  not planning to add new jobs in the next few months. A few contacts 
                  noted increased activity also in tourism and the construction 
                  of new hotels and restaurants. Reports from the distribution 
                  and logistics sector are mixed. While there has been an increase 
                  in ground transportation activity over 2001, air delivery operations 
                  are below last year's levels. Advertising revenues are also 
                  reported to be up. Contacts in the healthcare sector report 
                  that the nursing shortage continues to be a problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in most of the District's metropolitan areas report 
                  a healthy residential real estate market. In Louisville, new-home 
                  sales increased in June and July. Year-to-date sales in Little 
                  Rock, Memphis, and northern Arkansas have kept pace with 2001 
                  levels. Office space leasing has picked up in northern Arkansas, 
                  while retail leasing has slowed. In Memphis and St. Louis, high 
                  vacancy and low absorption rates have created a buyer's market 
                  for office and industrial space. The Memphis market for retail 
                  space, however, remains strong, with positive absorption and 
                  higher occupancy rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction opportunities have 
                  tracked sales, with July monthly and year-to-date building permit 
                  levels up in most of the District. Commercial construction opportunities 
                  are mixed. Expansions of colleges, churches, and hospitals are 
                  driving most of the commercial construction projects in central 
                  Kentucky and Arkansas. Contacts in Memphis and St. Louis do 
                  not anticipate many new commercial construction projects due 
                  to the oversupply of commercial space.
     </p>

      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent survey of senior loan officers at a sample of District 
                  banks indicates that, for large firms, credit standards for 
                  commercial and industrial (C&amp;I;) loans have remained largely 
                  unchanged in the last three months, although a slight tightening 
                  was reported for small firms. Terms for credit lines and C&amp;I; 
                  loans, for both large and small firms, also remained largely 
                  unchanged. Most contacts reported a moderate decline in the 
                  demand for C&amp;I; loans due to an increase in internally generated 
                  funds by customers and a decrease in capital investment in plant 
                  and equipment. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans 
                  remained mostly unchanged. Apart from normal seasonal variation, 
                  demand for such loans increased moderately. Credit standards 
                  and demand for residential mortgages, consumer loans, and credit 
                  cards were mostly unchanged, as well. The demand for automobile 
                  loans facing banks was reported to have decreased moderately 
                  due to zero-interest financing and other incentives provided 
                  by dealers and manufacturers.
     </p>

       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An August 1 USDA survey estimated corn yield losses in the District 
                  states, with yields in Indiana, Kentucky, and Missouri more 
                  than 20 percent below last year. Reports from northeast Kentucky 
                  and drought-stressed southern Illinois indicate that some of 
                  the corn crop is being cut for silage rather than grain. Soybean 
                  yields were estimated to be the same as last year in Arkansas 
                  and Mississippi, with losses in the remaining District states 
                  ranging from 11 percent to 23 percent. The District's cotton 
                  and rice crops, however, remain in good-to-excellent condition 
                  and the tobacco crop is in fair-to-good condition. For the upcoming 
                  harvest, the USDA survey estimated that District production 
                  of corn, soybeans, and cotton was sharply below year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      While rainfall in mid-August helped to improve 
                  the dry conditions in many locales, the lack of adequate moisture 
                  has hampered development of the soybean crop and accelerated 
                  the maturation process of the corn crop. As a result, harvesting 
                  of the corn crop is under way in the southern regions of the 
                  District.
