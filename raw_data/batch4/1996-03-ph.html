      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from major business sectors in the Third District in 
February indicated that economic activity has picked up after a 
storm-induced slowdown in January. However, the gain has not been 
sharp, and, according to these reports, business in the region has 
been relatively steady in recent weeks. Manufacturers generally 
indicated that while shipments were up a bit, new orders were flat. 
Retailers said sales had rebounded from January when snowstorms kept 
shoppers out of the stores, but most merchants indicated they were 
not making up all the lost sales and were merely back on a steady 
track. Auto dealers gave similar reports. Bankers said lending was 
either flat at their institutions or growing sluggishly. There were 
some positive reports from the real estate sector. Residential real 
estate agents and home builders were experiencing some increased 
traffic and greater sales. Commercial real estate agents said demand 
for office space appeared to be firming, and leasing and 
construction of industrial buildings were moving up.
      <p>
       <p>
        Expectations vary within the Third District business community. 
  Manufacturers anticipate some improvement in the next two quarters. 
  Retailers do not foresee immediate gains, but they are hopeful the 
  pace of sales will improve in the spring. Auto dealers expect only a 
  steady sales rate. Bankers report no evidence that loan demand will 
  accelerate soon. However, real estate agents expect continued modest 
  improvement in both residential and commercial markets.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Manufacturing activity in the Third District maintained a level pace 
  in February according to reports from industrial firms, although 
  slightly more firms said they were experiencing a pickup than said 
  business was off. Firms in most of the major manufacturing sectors 
  in the District indicated that demand for their products was just 
  steady. However, some gains in orders were noted by firms producing 
  metal products, nonelectrical machinery, chemicals, paper products, 
  and textiles. Overall, however, demand for manufactured products did 
  not appear to be strengthening for firms in the region; on balance, 
  they reported that order backlogs continued on the downward trend 
  that began late last year. A dip in employment and a decline in 
  industrial prices that manufacturers noted in February are further 
  evidence of slack in the goods-producing sector of the District.
         <p>
          Looking ahead, most of the Third District manufacturers contacted in 
  February expect demand for their products to pick up by summer. On 
  balance, they foresee a rising pace of orders and shipments, but 
  they do not expect order backlogs to move up strongly. Likewise, 
  they anticipate only very slight increases in employment.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Most of the retailers contacted for this report said sales at their 
  stores rebounded in February from the slackened pace of January when 
  snowstorms seriously hampered road travel and kept shoppers at home. 
  Some store officials think they may have recouped some of the sales 
  lost in January. However, the pickup appears only to have put retail 
  sales in the District back on a steady course; February sales just 
  matched expectations of most of the retailers surveyed at the end of 
  the month. Selling strategies remain promotional and price markdowns 
  are common. Store officials are hopeful that sales will improve as 
  spring approaches.
           <p>
            Auto dealers also noted a pickup in sales in February following a 
  poor January. However, they said sales were running at a pace just 
  matching last year's at this time, and they expect that rate to 
  continue in the months ahead.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Finance
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Most of the Third District banks contacted for this report said 
  overall loan demand was nearly flat or growing sluggishly in 
  February. Lending officers continued to describe the market for 
  business loans as very competitive. They said nonbank lenders were 
  aggressively seeking to expand lending to large companies and 
  competition was strong among banks for middle-market customers. 
  Consumer lending was relatively level according to bankers because 
  the usual seasonal decline in credit card loan volumes was offset by 
  some gains in other types of personal loans. Some banks were 
  stepping up commercial real estate lending and lending to home 
  builders, but credit officers at these banks said this lending was 
  confined to borrowers with significant equity stakes in their 
  properties. In general, bankers expect overall lending to trend up 
  slightly in the next few months.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Real Estate And Construction
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Residential realtors surveyed in February said traffic at their 
  offices had increased noticeably and serious interest in home buying 
  was evident in some areas of the Third District. While reports 
  varied around the District, in some local markets sellers were 
  getting multiple offers for their homes and selling them relatively 
  quickly. However, realtors noted that the inventory of homes for 
  sale remains large and that asking prices and bids have been fairly 
  stable. New home sales may be gaining also; several builders noted 
  increased traffic at their developments and a pickup in the signing 
  of contracts for new homes.
              <p>
               Commercial realtors said demand for industrial space, especially for 
  warehouses and distribution centers, has been increasing. They 
  attribute this to moves by several firms to consolidate activities 
  into large buildings in the region. Realtors expect further 
  increases in land development activity and construction for these 
  types of buildings.
               <p>
                Office markets in the Third District appeared to be firming, 
  according to commercial realtors and building managers. Vacancy 
  rates at the end of 1995 were estimated at 15 percent for the 
  Philadelphia central business district and in the range of 15 to 20 
  percent in suburban markets. Realtors expect a slow downward trend 
  in vacancy rates in the absence of new construction. Some realtors 
  noted increased interest in the purchase of office buildings by real 
  estate investment trusts.
