      Sixth District contacts 
                noted a modest improvement in economic activity in July and August, 
                whereas assessments of future prospects were mixed. Retail sales 
                increased, led by autos and positive back-to-school sales. Housing 
                markets remained strong overall, while commercial real estate 
                markets continued to stabilize. Manufacturing output improved 
                slightly. Contacts reported that leisure travel had returned to 
                healthier levels, but business travel in the region remained weak. 
                Labor market conditions were largely unchanged, while price pressures 
                remained limited to a few areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Back-to-school activity, strong home sales, and automobile sales 
                  supported retail activity in the District. Retailers reported 
                  that overall sales growth improved in August after lackluster 
                  results during July. Most agreed that back-to-school sales rose 
                  modestly compared with last year. Home-related product sales 
                  were described as strong while apparel sales were mixed across 
                  the region. Most contacts reported that retail inventories were 
                  balanced. Aggressive manufacturer incentives boosted District 
                  car sales in July and August. However, dealers operating national 
                  franchises noted that sales in the region still lagged other 
                  markets. Despite the generally positive retail results, August 
                  surveys of consumer attitudes in Florida and the Atlanta metro 
                  area indicated lower levels of consumer confidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Low mortgage rates continued to fuel robust District housing 
                  markets. Most builders and real estate agents reported that 
                  home sales and new home construction equaled or exceeded year-ago 
                  levels in July. For August, the reports were more mixed but 
                  remained positive overall. The strongest reports continued to 
                  come from Florida. Home inventories varied across the region, 
                  with a shortage of supply reported in some Floridian markets. 
                  According to reports, several apartment markets in the District 
                  continued to suffer as tenants were finding that low interest 
                  rates made home ownership an attractive alternative to renting. 
                  Lack luster commercial real estate markets have changed little 
                  since our last report. Vacancy rates remain at high levels, 
                  but reports continued to surface of small improvements in leasing 
                  activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory activity improved modestly in July and August, and contacts 
                  noted a slightly more optimistic outlook. New military contracts 
                  boosted the District's shipbuilding and aircraft industries. 
                  Auto parts producers continued to announce expansion plans to 
                  service the region's vehicle plants. Production volumes were 
                  expected to increase for a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and 
                  several glass producers noted that they were operating at full 
                  capacity to meet rising demand. One report also noted increasing 
                  orders and shipments for packaging materials. Less positively, 
                  producers of high-tech equipment continued to pare employment 
                  rolls. Higher imported steel prices were reported to be severely 
                  affecting some metal fabricators. Carpet production, especially 
                  for the commercial building segment, remained in the doldrums 
                  and contacts noted that demand was not expected to pickup in 
                  the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reports from the tourism and hospitality sector noted some 
                  recent improvement in leisure travel in August. However, more 
                  of Florida's visitors were reportedly traveling by car than 
                  by air, and the duration of visits has declined. Contacts reported 
                  that sluggish European and South American economies cut into 
                  international travel to the state, although some reports indicated 
                  increasing numbers of visitors from Brazil. Mississippi's gaming 
                  industry continued to attract customers reluctant to fly to 
                  other destinations. Record revenues for Mississippi Gulf Coast 
                  casinos were reported for July. Business travel remained weak. 
                  In Atlanta and New Orleans, attendance at some recent large 
                  business conventions was substantially below that of a year 
                  ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer lending continued to increase moderately while commercial 
                  loan demand remained weak. Additionally, bankers remained cautious 
                  in approving new commercial lines of credit, and some noted 
                  tightening standards for approving consumer loans as well. Lower 
                  mortgage interest rates drove up mortgage origination and refinancing 
                  activity throughout the District. One contact noted a surge 
                  in the number of borrowers looking to shorten the term of their 
                  loans. The venture capital sector remained largely inactive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With the exception of vehicle manufacturers, part suppliers, 
                  and producers of military equipment, reports continued to indicate 
                  that firms were not adding significantly to payrolls in August. 
                  However, the pace of layoffs appears to have eased back. Most 
                  business contacts continued to report that their focus is on 
                  cost cutting, and expansion plans remain on hold as a consequence. 
                  But some were optimistic that the hiring environment would improve 
                  over the next six months. Prices were mostly unchanged with 
                  the notable exception of continued increases in healthcare and 
                  insurance costs. Many employers were reportedly passing some 
                  of these higher costs on to employees and some were also reducing 
                  benefits. Prices for building materials were increasing according 
                  to several reports, and import tariffs continued to place upward 
                  pressure on prices paid for steel products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Summer rains improved the agricultural outlook in Florida, Louisiana 
                  and Mississippi, but drought conditions remained a problem for 
                  farmers in parts of Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. Stronger 
                  cotton and corn prices were benefiting those producers not severely 
                  impacted by the drought.
