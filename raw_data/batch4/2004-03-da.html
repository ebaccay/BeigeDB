      Beige Book Report: Dallas

     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity showed signs of accelerating from early January to mid-February. Contacts expressed increased optimism about the economic outlook but had mixed views about the strength of expected activity in the second half of 2004. Manufacturing activity continued to strengthen, and retail sales were up. There was little change in service sector, energy, construction, financial services, real estate activity and agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy prices remain relatively high putting upward price pressure 
              on other products and services. Crude oil prices have remained in 
              a range of $32-$35 in the first six weeks of 2004. U.S. crude inventories 
              averaged near 270 million barrels since January, about the level 
              set by the National Petroleum Council as critically low, and at 
              one point hit the lowest levels since 1982. Prices and inventories 
              have been driven by strong demand, a weak dollar, restrictive OPEC 
              quotas, and higher tanker rates. Looking ahead to the possibility 
              of weaker demand in the spring, OPEC announced a quota reduction 
              of 4 percent to 23.5 million barrels per day, but actual compliance 
              would mean nearly ten-percent less production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heating oil prices, near 90 cents in late December, were pushed 
              over $1 per gallon by cold January weather and high crude prices. 
              However, high inventories of distillates and warmer weather have 
              put downward pressure on prices in recent weeks. Gasoline demand 
              has been strong, and gasoline prices have been rising as heating 
              oil retreats, with wholesale prices over $1 per gallon. At the pump, 
              (nominal) prices have been the highest ever seen in January and 
              early February.
     </p>
     <p>
      Natural gas prices rose sharply with winter weather in early January, 
              and spot prices peaked at the Henry Hub around $7.00 per million 
              Btu. Inventories so far this year generally have remained above 
              the five-year average, with cold weather not pulling them below 
              normal for this time of year. Milder weather in late January and 
              February pushed prices back to near $5.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of industries reported upward price pressures--as a result 
              of stronger demand, input cost increases and a weaker dollar. Prices 
              of food products have started to rise, according to contacts, as 
              a result of higher input costs; flour and shortening costs are up 
              15 percent over the past month. High fuel prices remain a concern 
              for transportation firms. Strong rail demand pushed up prices, but 
              intense competition between airlines is keeping a lid on fares.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices have risen for some construction-related products. Producers 
              of cement are very excited because this is the first price increase 
              in 2 to 3 years. Heavy demand and low inventories pushed up lumber 
              and timber prices. Prices for some final products, such as doors 
              and cabinets, have remained steady but are expected to increase 
              in 2005. Paper manufacturers say their customers are increasing 
              inventory in response to an announced 10 percent price increase 
              planned for early March. Paper manufacturers say customers expect 
              to be able to pass roughly 50 percent of this price increase on 
              to consumers. High petroleum prices have increased the price of 
              resin and box liners.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories are low for fabricated metals, with shortages of scrap 
              steel becoming more pervasive. Producers of fabricated metals report 
              that input commodity prices have risen sharply. Primary metal producers 
              also report concerns about shortages of inputs, including copper 
              and scrap steel. Producers of primary metals report that soaring 
              input prices are pushing up selling prices, although one contact 
              said profits are up as well. High tech firms report that inventories 
              are at desired levels and, while overall prices were sluggish, there 
              were some increases in semiconductors prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many contacts expressed continued concerns about high insurance 
              costs but say the rate of increase has subsided. Some industries 
              also reported concern about the increased cost of state unemployment 
              insurance and municipal real estate taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There were more reports of hiring in both the service sector and 
              in manufacturing, although reports remain scattered, and there is 
              little pressure on wages. Temporary service firms say competition 
              for business remains stiff and that wages have yet to recover from 
              declining during the recession. One client reported that average 
              salary for temps has fallen 2.7 percent year over year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity picked up. Producers reported strong demand 
              for food products, primary and fabricated metals. Apparel producers 
              reported increased demand and noted that the downward pressure on 
              selling prices had forced them to increase outsourcing. Demand for 
              lumber was up. Paper producers report some signs of strengthening 
              sales, including an increase in box shipments, but it is difficult 
              to gauge the overall change in demand because some box plants are 
              closing. The long-term outlook for this industry is pessimistic 
              because international competition is reducing overall demand. Unfavorable 
              weather conditions dampened demand for some construction-related 
              products, including stone, brick and glass, and slightly inflated 
              inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      High-tech manufacturing conditions continue to strengthen. Manufacturers 
              of electronics and communications devices said that shipments have 
              picked up and strength in orders suggests continued strong activity 
              in the second quarter. Demand was reported to be coming from a broader 
              area of the world with some pickups occurring in Europe and Latin 
              America and continued strength in North America and Asia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemical activity was up, including increases in demand, capacity 
              utilization, and margins for ethylene, polyethylene, propylene, 
              chlorine and PVC. Stronger U.S. industrial activity helped boost 
              demand, but sales were also stimulated by major outages in Europe 
              and Venezuela. Activity is expected to weaken some as these outages 
              are restored and as a new ethylene plant starts up on the U.S. Gulf 
              Coast. Strong demand for heating oil and gasoline boosted refining 
              activity and profits. Imports of refined products were at the top 
              of their five-year average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for legal services is unchanged. Bankruptcy work continues 
              to slow, while litigation and real estate remains strong. Legal 
              contacts report hearing increasingly positive attitudes from clients, 
              yet some uncertainty lingers. Demand for accounting/consulting services 
              is strong and is up from last quarter. There is increasing interest 
              in transactional work, capital raising and IPOs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for temporary staffing services is improving slowly. There 
              continues to be strong demand for workers to supply the health care 
              industry, and demand for workers to supply most other sectors has 
              bottomed out. A lot of call center work and some IT (programming) 
              jobs are being sent overseas, though there continues to be rising 
              demand to provide call centers in some regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trucking firms reported a seasonal drop in demand but expect activity 
              to pick up seasonally. Demand for rail shipments was robust and 
              surpassed shipping activity levels both year-to-date and during 
              the last four weeks across all categories except for motor vehicles. 
              Demand was particularly strong for shipments of grain and to support 
              ocean freight. The airline industry remains very competitive. Some 
              airlines report improved demand while others report that demand 
              remains soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report strengthening sales in most categories. Contacts 
              are cautiously optimistic that sales will continue to strengthen, 
              with one noting that consumers are willing to spend on more frivolous 
              products. Auto dealers report unseasonably low demand that has left 
              them with high inventories, lower selling prices and slimmer profit 
              margins. Manufacturers continue to increase incentives to keep sales 
              from declining further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts say the long downward trend in office demand seems to have 
              reversed in the major metros because rents are declining less rapidly. 
              Capital demand for real estate remains especially strong in Dallas/Fort 
              Worth suggesting investor optimism remains high. Commercial developers 
              say there is steady demand for retail, healthcare, and school buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment markets continued to weaken, with Dallas/Fort Worth 
              and Houston posting the lowest occupancy rates in a decade. Rents 
              are still falling, and concessions remain prevalent. Single-family 
              construction continues to rise at a good pace. Competition has kept 
              a lid on home prices despite increases in some building materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts say that deposit growth has slowed, which they attribute 
              to money flowing back into equity markets. Several respondents commented 
              that CDs and other instruments are being liquidated. Overall lending 
              activity has been unchanged; mortgage activity is down, mostly because 
              of a drop in refinancings, but commercial and industrial activity 
              has picked up and consumer categories remain positive but unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although the industry is expressing optimism about market conditions, 
              there was little change in drilling activity. The U.S. rig count 
              held steady near 1100 working rigs through the first six weeks of 
              this year, almost exactly equal to the average for the second half 
              of 2003. Activity weakened in the Gulf of Mexico to fewer than 100 
              working rigs on the U.S. side, although utilization rates and day-rates 
              for rigs working in the Gulf as Mexico have picked up slightly in 
              recent months, largely because of increased activity on the Mexican 
              side of the Gulf. As Mexico has added 20 offshore rigs to its drilling 
              programs in the last 12 months, it has drawn rigs out of U.S. waters. 
              International activity continues to slowly improve as it continues 
              to shift from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea to the Middle 
              East and former Soviet Union.

      Cooler temperatures and snow slowed growth of winter pastures, but 
              contacts are optimistic because the snow helped soil moisture. There 
              were no reports of serious damage to crops or livestock from the 
              freezing temperatures. Bad weather dampened 2003 cotton yields but 
              higher cotton prices were received for the crop. Citrus producers 
              reported a good crop. Cattle producers noted that the "mad cow" 
              scare did not affect beef demand or prices as much as expected.
