      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity remained fairly strong in May and June, but there 
were some further signs since the last survey that growth may be 
slowing. Manufacturing orders remained at high levels, but contacts 
in some manufacturing industries said demand had moderated recently. 
In addition, transportation contacts said cargo volume had fallen 
since the last Beige Book. Retailers reported a slight pickup in 
sales in late May, although sales were still weak at stores near the 
Texas-Mexico border. On a more positive note, demand for business 
services continued to increase, with no slowdown in sight. Contacts 
in the construction industry said that commercial construction 
continued to rise and that home sales had risen in May and June as 
mortgage rates declined. Bankers reported steady loan demand. Energy 
contacts said that drilling had improved in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Agricultural conditions are generally good, but drought continued to 
hamper agricultural production in some areas of the Eleventh 
District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price and wage pressures seem to have subsided in the last six 
weeks. The notable exception was in the semiconductor industry, 
where contacts said low supplies led to higher selling prices. 
Although some manufacturing contacts said that high prices for 
packaging had raised costs, manufacturers of paper and corrugated 
boxes said that selling prices had stopped rising. Manufacturers of 
construction-related products said prices had softened because of 
slower homebuilding in the first quarter. In the service-producing 
industries, retailers said that apparel discounting was widespread, 
and fees for business services were stable after rising earlier in 
the year. Crude oil prices were lower in May and June after moving 
above $20 per barrel in April, and natural gas prices were flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District manufacturing demand remained at high levels, but 
there were some signs that growth may be slowing. Corrugated box and 
paper manufacturers said demand remains very high, but that orders 
had flattened in the past few months, which may signal a slowing in 
the growth of overall manufacturing shipments. Similarly, 
respondents in construction-related manufacturing industries said 
that while demand related to commercial construction remained 
strong, orders for lumber and cement had slowed as fewer homes were 
constructed in the first quarter of 1995. In addition, glass 
producers noted a decline in orders stemming from lower auto sales. 
Demand for electronic products continued to increase, however. 
Semiconductor manufacturers said that orders were rising strongly 
and that a lack of capacity was putting pressure on selling prices. 
Apparel sales were steady, and contacts expected demand to remain at 
current levels through the rest of the year because of slower growth 
in retail sales. Demand for food products was flat. Respondents in 
the petrochemicals industry said that demand had eased slightly, but 
that high prices were still providing very strong profits. A sharp 
increase in gasoline prices from April through May provided improved 
margins for refiners, after one of the worst quarters in the history 
of the refining business. Demand for oil field machinery remained 
flat despite a pickup in drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents at business service firms, such as temporary employment 
agencies, accounting and consulting firms and legal firms, said 
demand continued to rise. Sources of increased demand included real 
estate transactions, mergers and acquisitions and high technology 
manufacturing. Hiring increased, and the outlook for the next 
several months was optimistic. Despite the strong demand, 
competition kept prices flat. Respondents in the transportation 
services industry said that a slowdown in economic activity and 
Mexico's peso crisis had caused demand to fall in the last six 
weeks. Nevertheless, some contacts said they were starting to see a 
slight pickup in shipments from Texas to Mexico.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers reported a slight pickup in sales in late May, although 
sales continue to grow at a slower pace than last year. Selling 
prices were very competitive, with contacts reporting no change in 
price for most products and continued discounting for apparel. Sales 
remained weak at stores along the Mexican border. Auto sales 
remained flat in May and June, and were well below year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      District banks reported steady loan demand. Construction loan demand 
remained strong, primarily because of warehouse and plant 
construction. Although demand for new residential mortgages was 
slightly weaker, refinancing was slightly stronger. Continued 
competition between banks and other lenders for business and 
commercial and industrial loans squeezed margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity remained strong. Rising demand for warehouse 
and retail space kept the level of nonresidential construction high. 
In addition, there were several reports of new office construction, 
something that has not been seen since the real estate bust of the 
mid-1980s. Homebuilders said that sales were up in May and June 
after declining in the first quarter, mostly a result of lower 
mortgage interest rates. Homebuilders have revised their outlooks 
upwards but still expect 1995 sales to be below 1994 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy respondents said that drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico 
had improved, with both the number of rigs under contract and the 
number of active rigs rising. After moving above $20 per barrel in 
April, crude oil prices fell to $18.69 on May 26th on news that a 
refinery strike in Brazil had ended. Crude prices have since 
rebounded to about S19 per barrel. Natural gas prices remained 
relatively flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural conditions were rated as mostly good, with the 
exception of the wheat crop which was rated as fair to poor. Drought 
continued to hamper production in South Texas, greatly reducing the 
amount of forage available to cattle. Dry conditions have also 
stressed crops, and irrigation is heavy although the lack of 
rainfall has led to pumping limits on the Edwards Aquifer. Texas 
farmers received higher prices for most crops in May, although 
livestock prices continued to decline and are now 14 percent below 
last year's level.
