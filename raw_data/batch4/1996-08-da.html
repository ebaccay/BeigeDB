      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District expansion moderated in late June and July 
after strong growth noted in previous surveys. Most respondents 
expect business conditions to remain at good levels for the rest of 
the year. Manufacturing orders were softer, as construction-related 
orders slowed slightly and semiconductor orders remained weak. 
Increased drilling activity boosted orders for energy-related 
equipment. Retailers reported slower sales and noted reduced traffic 
at stores. Loan demand was mixed, as refinancings continued falling, 
new residential loans held steady, and loans for commercial 
construction and consumers picked up. Although construction activity 
held steady over the past six weeks, contacts in the residential 
sector expected slower housing construction in coming months. 
Nonetheless, contacts said higher demand for office space reduced 
vacancies, especially in suburban markets. Record heat and drought 
continued to impede agricultural production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There were scattered reports of price pressures over the past six 
weeks. Contacts said prices were up for plastic products, some base 
petrochemicals and lumber. In addition, several manufacturing 
respondents said higher natural gas prices had boosted their costs. 
Crude oil prices were down from the last survey, but remained above 
$20 per barrel according to contacts. Despite low cattle prices, the 
June Texas All Farm Products Index of Prices rose 2.9 percent above 
the May level, pushed up by higher prices for hogs, broilers, eggs, 
milk and all crops except potatoes. Prices were reported as falling 
for steel, paper, some apparel products, semiconductors and 
computers. There were few reports of wage pressures, although 
contacts in some industries continued reporting difficulty finding 
qualified, entry-level workers. A few manufacturing respondents were 
concerned about the possibility of a minimum wage increase, but 
retailers said they would not be significantly affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing orders softened over the past six weeks despite 
stronger demand for most energy-related products. Semiconductor 
orders continued to fall, and contacts were more pessimistic about 
the outlook for the industry. Most respondents hoped the decline in 
orders would bottom out by year-end. Respondents in the computer 
industry reported flat demand overall, although firms that make 
"build-to-order" products reported stronger sales than the industry 
average. Many construction-related manufacturers reported somewhat 
softer demand in the past six weeks following extremely strong 
growth in orders earlier in the year. After reporting shortages in 
the last Beige Book survey, cement contacts said demand had softened 
in the last six weeks, allowing them to take customers off of 
allocation. Brick producers said plants continued to run at capacity 
and inventories were low, but demand had slowed slightly in July. 
Lumber producers reported steady demand and low inventories. Apparel 
manufacturers reported flat demand after a noted improvement in the 
last Beige Book. In energy-related sectors demand was strong for 
most products. Petrochemical producers said that demand was solid 
overall and profits were improving, but that demand for plastic 
products (such as polyethylene and polypropylene) was especially 
strong with low inventories and scattered shortages. Oil field 
machinery companies reported that increased drilling activity had 
boosted demand. Gulf Coast refiners said weaker gasoline prices 
combined with high prices for crude oil were reducing profits, 
however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail and Auto Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales slowed in June and July, particularly for apparel. 
Retailers noted that traffic at stores was down. Inventories were in 
line with expectations, and there was no mention of price pressure. 
Contacts remained optimistic that sales would pick up in the fall. 
Auto sales softened in June and July, but inventories remained on 
the light side according to respondents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the financial services industry reported mixed loan 
demand over the last six weeks. Refinancings continued to decline as 
long-term interest rates remained at high levels. Other residential 
real estate loans reportedly held steady. Consumer loan demand was 
up for some contacts in Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin. In addition, 
respondents reported higher demand for commercial construction 
loans, fueled by plans for speculative office and warehouse 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity held steady in late June and 
July. Home construction remained at high levels, but contacts expect 
activity to cool in coming months because of higher financing costs 
and lower buyer traffic. Respondents said strong demand for 
industrial space continues to buoy nonresidential construction. 
While there are minimal office projects in the works, contacts 
reported tighter office occupancy and rising rents, especially in 
suburban markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The energy market strengthened since the last Beige Book report, and 
crude oil and natural gas prices were at relatively high levels. 
Domestic drilling activity increased, with virtually all of the 
increase in drilling attributable to rigs looking for natural gas. 
Offshore activity remains strong in the Gulf of Mexico with every 
available rig under contract. According to contacts, a number of 
projects are underway to build new rigs or to refurbish old ones.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought continues to stress agricultural conditions, according to 
contacts. In early July, rainfall reduced stress in some areas, but 
record-breaking heat kept pastures and forages dry in many parts of 
the Eleventh District. Numerous fields of failed corn and grain 
sorghum continued to be cut as farmers and ranchers searched for 
sources of hay to feed livestock.
