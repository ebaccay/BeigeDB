      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy continues to grow at a healthy pace in 
spite of consumer reluctance to purchase new homes and vehicles. 
Manufacturing is strong. Mines and paper mills are running at 
capacity. Commercial construction is also robust. General 
merchandise sales are good, with some sources noting an increase 
from the January-February period. Tourist business is solid, but not 
spectacular. Labor markets remain tight, and many employers find it 
difficult to hire new workers. Prices for industrial inputs continue 
to show upward pressure but those for construction inputs have 
eased.
     </p>
     <p>
      But interest-rate sensitive sectors clearly have slowed. Automobile 
sales are substantially below year-earlier levels. Home construction 
has slowed in virtually all areas of the district compared to 1994's 
heated pace. Weather rather than interest rates is the problem for 
agriculture, where cold, wet weather has delayed planting and harmed 
beef producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Business is excellent, but margins are tight," sums up one 
Minnesota manufacturer. Managers, news media, industrial electricity 
use, employment and earnings reports all point to continuing 
strength in the manufacturing sector. Some firms squeezed by rising 
input costs complain that passing along such increases in their 
product prices is difficult due to competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mining is geared up for a big year. Minnesota's mining employment is 
up 10 percent from 1994. In South Dakota and Montana gold and copper 
mines are running at capacity. Oil production is stable, but there 
are some indications of increased exploration activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper producers enjoy favorable prices and mills are running at 
capacity. Prices for recycled paper and cardboard have risen 
substantially as producers compete for raw materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction remains strong, but has slackened from the heated pace 
that characterized much of 1994. Commercial construction continues 
to outpace residential work. Large, publicly let projects in 
Minnesota and the Dakotas are up about 1 percent for the first 
quarter of 1995 compared to 1994. Commercial work such as 
warehouses, suburban office buildings and stores remains robust, but 
reportedly with less of a backlog than was common in the last half 
of 1994.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential building is clearly down from year-earlier levels in 
most areas. New starts are typically down 5 percent to 20 percent in 
metropolitan areas. The extreme was Sioux Falls, S.D., where new 
permits for March declined 60 percent compared to a year earlier. 
But even that decline was reported under the heading, "Builders 
positive despite drop." In most areas declines are from a very fast 
pace set in 1994 and builders generally expect a satisfactory season 
in 1995. Minnesota's construction employment for March was up 1.6 
percent over a year earlier. Reflecting strong commercial work, 
Minneapolis-St. Paul construction worker numbers increased 6.5 
percent in the same period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cold, wet weather has cast a pall over the outlook for agriculture. 
Cow-calf operators experienced problems with rain and mud during 
calving, and calf mortality is reportedly higher than usual, 
particularly in South Dakota. More importantly, tillage operations 
and spring planting of wheat and other small grains have been 
seriously delayed by the unseasonable weather. In general, crop 
operations are one week to two weeks behind schedule. The delay is 
reaching a level where at least some potential yield is being 
sacrificed even if conditions are optimal later in the season.
     </p>
     <p>
      A cautious mood was apparent among farmers even prior to April's 
unseasonable weather. Bankers responding to the Minneapolis Fed's 
first quarter 1995 survey of agricultural credit conditions describe 
their farm borrowers as cautious, particularly in regard to capital 
spending, citing low product prices and uncertainty about the future 
of federal agricultural legislation. Rates of loan repayment are 
described as somewhat below normal and requests for extensions 
somewhat higher, although most farm borrowers are reportedly able to 
service their debts. Farm interest rates continue to edge up, with 
most categories in the 10 percent to 10.5 percent range.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Our retail sales continue to be very strong," reports the CEO of a 
firm with department stores across the Ninth District. Across the 
region, sales of general merchandise appear to be improved since the 
preceding report. Some mall managers describe a recent pick-up in 
traffic after a slump earlier in the year and national chains based 
in Minneapolis report improved sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicles are another story. New vehicle registrations for the year 
through March were down about 8 percent for the state of South 
Dakota compared to the same period in 1994. For Minnesota and North 
Dakota the declines were 6 percent and 10 percent respectively. 
Dealers and association representatives agree that the strong sales 
climate which had prevailed through most of 1994 is definitely over.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sparse snow cover hampered winter tourism in Montana and many other 
areas, although Michigan's Upper Peninsula had good cover through 
March and strong business. Tourism inquiries for the summer are 
active and up from last year, except in Montana. In South Dakota, 
visits to museums and major outdoor attractions are up sharply over 
last year and tourism officials expect a very busy summer season. 
New motels are being built in a number of South Dakota locations in 
anticipation of growing tourist business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Jobs aplenty" was the headline used by one newspaper to describe 
the labor market in southwest Minnesota. It would be accurate in 
most other parts of the Ninth District. In South Dakota, labor 
shortages continue to be described as a stumbling block to 
manufacturing growth. One firm announced a new plant in northern 
Iowa because of the difficulty of securing additional workers near 
its existing plant in South Dakota. One Minneapolis-St. Paul multi-
screen theater chain has cut the number of showings of less-popular 
movies because of difficulty in hiring enough staff to keep the 
normal schedule. Managers who expected that their firms' employment 
would increase in the next 12 months outnumbered those expecting a 
decrease by two to one in a Minneapolis Fed poll of business people 
in northwestern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices continue to increase for industrial inputs, particularly 
paper, packaging and basic chemicals. But lumber and other 
construction materials' prices have moderated somewhat. One Montana 
mill reportedly cut 2x4 lumber prices sharply to move excess 
inventory. Petroleum product prices rose in March and April, and are 
now about 4 percent above a year ago. At the consumer level, some 
fresh vegetable prices are markedly higher but meat is steady to 
lower. Few other price changes are reported.
