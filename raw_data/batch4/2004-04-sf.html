      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       April 21, 2004
      </b>
      <p>
       Reports from business contacts indicate that the Twelfth District's 
              already firm economic expansion acquired some additional momentum 
              in March and early April. Price inflation for final goods and services 
              has remained low overall, although increases in the prices of energy 
              and key industrial commodities raised costs in some industries. 
              Some District firms have increased their hiring pace for permanent 
              employees or indicated plans to do so in the near future. District 
              retailers and service providers saw generally solid demand. Manufacturing 
              activity picked up for a variety of products. Both domestic and 
              foreign demand for District agricultural and resource-related products 
              reportedly was solid. Activity in residential real estate markets 
              remained vibrant, while the glut in commercial real estate markets 
              eased a bit. Most banks reported solid loan demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Prices and Wages
       </b>
       <br/>
       The reports indicated a

slight pickup in the pace of price increases in recent weeks. Contacts noted

rising prices for gasoline and certain commodities, notably steel. These

increases raised transportation costs for consumers and businesses and also

raised production costs in selected industries, but the overall impact on final

prices was limited, reportedly due to stiff competition in most industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upward

wage and salary pressures in the District were quite modest during the survey

period. However, the rising cost of health benefits increased labor costs

somewhat, and employers have responded in part by shifting some of the burden

to workers. In labor markets more generally, respondents noted a modest pickup

in hiring by District businesses, especially in the construction, education,

health-care, and retail sectors. Hiring was focused largely on permanent

rather than temporary workers, and some firms not currently hiring reportedly

plan to do so in the near future. By contrast, some state and local

governments cut staff due to budget constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </b>
       <br/>
       District retail sales were solid overall and generally stable relative to the previous survey

period. Automobile sales were at high levels, sustained in part by renewed

financing incentives. However, sales were stronger for foreign than for

domestic makes, and inventories were at unusually high levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       District service

providers saw further strengthening in demand. Sales increased for media

services and high-tech services in some areas, and reports indicated that

activity at District seaports had stepped up to handle increased merchandise

trade flows. Demand for preventive and outpatient health-care services edged

up further, although rising out-of-pocket payments for patients reportedly have

led to reduced use of hospital services in some areas. District travel and

tourist activity generally was solid, with notable strength reported for Hawaii, Utah, Arizona, and Southern California. A Southern California respondent also

noted substantial sales gains in the restaurant industry there. The weak

dollar relative to the yen reportedly helped boost Japanese visitor counts to

selected District destinations. Although hotel occupancy rates rose in many

areas, room prices generally remained somewhat low compared to prior years,

reportedly due in part to rising reliance on bargain deals available through

the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturers

generally faced increased demand for a variety of products, consistent with

reports of a further pickup in capital spending by firms during the survey

period. Sales of semiconductors and other high-technology products

strengthened, as businesses replaced existing stocks of computer and communications

equipment. Prices for high-tech products rose modestly, due to reduced

inventories and increased capacity utilization. Both domestic and foreign

demand for wood products was strong, and prices for pulp, containerboards, and

wood panels edged up as a result. District apparel makers saw rising orders,

and relatively lean inventories kept prices elevated in recent weeks. The weak

dollar has helped boost exports of many manufactured products; however, it also

has increased prices on imported raw materials and intermediate goods,

exacerbating increased production costs associated with rising scarcity of

selected commodities, particularly steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Agriculture and Resource-related

Industries
       </b>
       <br/>
       District contacts

reported robust demand and sales for a variety of agricultural and

resource-related items. Demand for nuts was especially strong, and several

countries have relaxed bans on imports of American cattle, increasing the

demand seen by District cattle ranchers. More generally, agricultural contacts

reported that demand for items with high protein content has been boosted by

the growing popularity of protein-heavy diet regimes. Overseas demand for

District agricultural products remained quite strong, held up in part by the

low value of the dollar. In energy markets, capacity utilization was high for

electrical generation and oil and natural gas extraction, and contacts noted

scattered capacity increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </b>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate markets remained robust during the most recent survey period, and conditions

improved a bit in nonresidential markets. The pace of home sales, price

appreciation, and construction was rapid, especially in Southern California and

  Hawaii, and new homes sold quickly, often before completion. However, higher-priced

homes typically remained on the market longer than less-expensive homes. With

low interest rates pushing up home ownership rates, apartment vacancies edged

up further in some areas. On the commercial side, demand for office space

improved a bit, with a slight dip in vacancy rates reported for some markets.

Moreover, demand for industrial and retail space was solid in parts of Southern California, and contacts noted several large-scale construction projects in that

region.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Financial Institutions
       </b>
       <br/>
       District banking contacts reported that overall demand for commercial 
              and industrial loans improved slightly, particularly for loans to 
              small businesses. Demand for commercial real estate loans picked 
              up in several markets, and bank loan portfolios generally exhibited 
              stable credit quality.
