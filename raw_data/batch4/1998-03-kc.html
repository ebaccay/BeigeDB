      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The district economy continues to grow at a moderate pace. During 
the past month retail sales edged up, construction activity picked 
up slightly, and manufacturing activity remained fairly strong. One 
weak note was a slight decline in energy activity. In the farm 
economy, the winter wheat crop is in good shape, and the quality of 
wheat pasture is good to excellent. Labor markets remain tight in 
much of the district, with continued evidence of moderate wage 
pressures. Prices generally held steady at the retail level and for 
construction materials. Price changes were mixed for manufacturing 
materials, with some slight increases for some materials and 
declines for others.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report sales edged up last month, and were moderately 
above year ago levels. All respondents expect to continue growing 
sales over the next three months. While most retailers thought 
current stocks were too large, they do not anticipate major changes 
in inventories in the coming months. Automobile dealers report mixed 
results last month, with sales overall moderately lower than a year 
ago. Sales of sport utility vehicles and light trucks remained 
strong, while sales of passenger cars were weak. Dealers have 
trimmed inventories slightly and are generally satisfied with 
current stock levels. Respondents expect to increase inventories to 
match seasonal stronger sales in the coming months.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturing plants operated at moderately high levels of capacity 
last month as activity continued to expand. Purchasing managers 
report that raw materials were generally available and there were no 
noticeable changes in lead times. Inventories edged down last month, 
and further reduction is expected in the near future as stocks 
exceed desired levels. A quarterly survey of district manufacturers 
indicate that production increased slightly, while shipments and new 
orders both posted slight declines from December 1997 to January 
1998. New orders from exports also declined slightly, reflecting 
lower export demand from Asia and the effects of a strong dollar.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Housing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Builders report housing starts rose slightly last month, moderately 
above year ago levels. Builders anticipate additional gains in 
construction activity in the coming months as mild weather provides 
a seasonal lift. Sales of new homes were slightly higher last month, 
above levels reached a year ago. Inventories of unsold new homes 
remain at moderate to slightly high levels. Most building materials 
were readily available and delivery times were normal. Mortgage 
lenders say demand was up slightly last month, boosted by a rush of 
refinancings. Mortgage demand for home purchases is expected to 
increase somewhat in coming months while demand for refinancing is 
likely to level out from the strong increases registered in previous 
months.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Bankers report that loans and deposits generally held steady last 
month, leaving loan-deposit ratios little changed. All loan 
categories were flat except home mortgages, which increased 
somewhat. Money market deposit accounts edged up, NOW accounts 
declined slightly, and other deposit categories remained unchanged.
          <p>
           Almost all respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged 
last month and expect to hold rates steady in the near term. All 
banks held their consumer lending rates constant and most banks 
anticipate no future changes. Lending standards were unchanged.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Energy
            </strong>
            <br/>
            District energy activity edged down in the last two months after 
short-lived improvement in activity in December. Mild winter weather 
contributed to further decline of both crude oil and natural gas 
prices last month. Both prices remained well below year-ago levels. 
Reflecting lower prices, the district rig count was down 5.0 percent 
in January and fell another 1.4 percent in February to a level only 
1.3 percent higher than a year ago.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Agriculture
             </strong>
             <br/>
             The district's winter wheat crop is in good condition, and the 
quality of wheat pasture is good to excellent. Relatively high 
prices for feeder cattle should help ranchers earn modest profits in 
1998. However, operators of cattle feedlots are losing money due to 
low prices for slaughter cattle and the losses may persist through 
the first half of the year. Low hog prices have not slowed expansion 
by large, integrated operations, but many smaller producers are 
liquidating their herds. Farmland rents around the district have 
continued to edge up. Rural businesses are earning modest profits.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Wages and Prices
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Labor markets remained tight last month in much of the district, 
with continued evidence of moderate wage pressures. Retailers report 
a shortage of entry-level workers due to the availability of other 
jobs at higher wages in other sectors. Manufacturers have began to 
report low-skill labor shortages in addition to ongoing problems 
hiring skilled and technical workers. Builders say workers are hard 
to find in general, but framers, brick layers, and dry wallers are 
especially difficult to hire. Some companies have raised wages more 
than in the recent past to attract or retain workers, while many say 
wage increases are about average. Retailers report that prices were 
generally unchanged last month. Prices increased slightly for some 
manufacturing materials, such as rubber and carbon, and edged down 
for chemicals. Prices of construction materials held steady. 
Retailers expect no major price changes in the coming months.
