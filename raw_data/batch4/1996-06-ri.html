      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Economic activity grew moderately in the Fifth District in 
May, with some firms straining capacity, but others experiencing 
weaker demand. Retail activity picked up while service-sector 
activity was mixed. Manufacturing activity continued to grow 
moderately overall, and some manufacturers indicated that capacity 
constraints limited further growth. Tourism grew at a faster pace 
and real estate activity strengthened. Mortgage loan demand 
weakened, but consumer loan demand strengthened. Markets for inputs, 
especially labor, tightened. Scattered price pressures were 
reported; expectations of future price increases were more 
widespread in manufacturing, but less apparent in the service 
sector. In agriculture, crop conditions improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers surveyed reported faster growth in retail 
sales, employment, average wages, big-ticket sales, and shopper 
traffic. Respondents also reported an increase in inventory growth. 
Retail prices rose more slowly in May and retailers expected their 
prices to rise more slowly during the next six months than they had 
in April. They anticipated a decrease in demand for their products 
over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Service Production
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service producers surveyed by mail reported 
mixed activity in May. Revenues declined slightly and employment 
growth increased in May from April. Average wages increased faster 
in May. Service producers said prices rose more quickly in May than 
they had in April. Respondents expected demand for their product to 
soften over the next six months, and believed that their prices 
would rise more slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand at a 
moderate pace in May, and tight inputs markets constrained some 
firms. Except in Virginia, respondents to a mail survey reported 
faster growth in shipments. Virginia manufacturers said their 
production was hampered by a scarcity of skilled labor. A boat 
manufacturer and a textile producer also indicated that tight labor 
markets limited their production. Durable-goods producers were 
upbeat, reporting that new orders had strengthened in May. Several 
suppliers of industrial machinery and equipment reported that their 
lead time lengthened recently because demand strengthened and one 
said delays in receiving inputs reduced output at his firm. 
Manufacturers indicated that finished goods prices increased and raw 
materials prices decreased in May from April. Respondents' six-month 
outlook was for higher finished goods and raw material prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity continued to pick up in May, despite a 
rainy Memorial Day weekend that dampened beach activity in some 
areas. Baltimore contacts attributed increased tourism to the 
Orioles' baseball team while respondents from mountain resorts cited 
vacation packages that emphasized golf and skeet shooting. Contacts 
reported that summer bookings looked good. However, one respondent 
from a popular North Carolina coastal area said tourist activity 
there was the slowest it has been in the last 10 years. Contacts 
expected summer rates to increase by 3.8 percent to 6.5 percent 
after adjusting for inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity at District ports changed little in April 
from March and from a year ago. Port representatives continued to 
expect exports and imports to increase during the next six months, 
with exports expected to rise faster than imports. Several port 
contacts said that an increasing number of ship lines were entering 
into vessel sharing agreements, an arrangement that the contacts 
believed would lead to more ships calling at their ports during the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The demand for temporary workers increased in 
May. Demand was especially strong for light-industrial laborers and 
customer-service representatives. Several temporary agencies 
reported that their clients increasingly opted to use "contingent" 
workers rather than hire permanent employees. However, a North 
Carolina contact indicated that less employee turnover at firms in 
his area had reduced the demand for temporary workers. Temporary 
workers' wages changed little in May, although slight increases were 
reported in a few localities with low unemployment and for computer-
skilled workers. Contacts generally expected stable wages during the 
next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts indicated that overall lending activity 
changed little in May. District mortgage loan companies said that 
demand weakened noticeably; one Virginia contact described demand as 
"crummy." Mortgage lenders reported particular weakness in 
refinancing activity and two contacts indicated that refinancings 
occurred only in cases of extreme financial necessity. Consumer 
lending strengthened during May but some respondents expected 
activity to moderate in coming weeks. Descriptions of commercial 
lending ranged from very weak to very strong. Several contacts 
indicated business loans were mainly being used to finance 
activities other than fixed capital investment. District banks 
generally reported that they were "cautiously optimistic" about 
future loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate sales rose in May, 
but builders in some areas reported stagnant growth. Realtors 
reported increases in sales and customer traffic; some contacts 
describing the market as "terrific" and "outstanding." However, 
homebuilders indicated that customer interest in new homes declined; 
one builder reported that the weak market had forced her company out 
of business. Wages and materials prices increased. Several contacts 
said that higher petroleum prices had increased the cost of 
transported materials, such as lumber and concrete.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A telephone survey of commercial real estate 
brokers suggested that commercial real estate activity picked up in 
May and early June. Leasing activity remained brisk and, except in 
the District of Columbia, vacancy rates fell. Commercial rents 
increased, continuing a trend which began last November. The 
availability of prime office space continued to tighten, and nearly 
half the respondents reported shortages, particularly for large 
blocks of space. Contacts continued to report an increase in new 
construction, and one District of Columbia contact reported the 
construction of a new speculative office building there, an anomaly 
in recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State tax collections were flat in the Carolinas but 
were higher in the other District states. Contacts across the 
District reported that strong 1995 capital gains led to higher May 
estimated tax payments. North Carolina and Virginia contacts said 
corporate tax collections were down significantly because of lower 
profits. Retail sales collections were higher in the District of 
Columbia, Maryland and South Carolina and real estate recordation 
receipts rose in Maryland, North Carolina, and West Virginia.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On balance, agricultural conditions improved in May and 
early June according to District analysts. Spring planting was 
almost complete. Recent rains brought relief to crops in dry areas 
of South Carolina, but led to flooding in some areas of West 
Virginia. Cooler temperatures caused some scattered freeze damage to 
the already-poor fruit crop. Despite these episodes, the weather was 
generally favorable for crops, and most were in good condition.
