      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia

       March 3, 2004
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District expanded in February.  Manufacturers reported increases in orders and shipments for the month.  Retail sales of general merchandise rose in February compared with January and with February of last year.  Auto and light truck sales were mostly steady for the month, but up on a year-over-year basis.  Bank lending has been advancing moderately, with gains in business and residential mortgage lending but a decline in consumer loans outstanding.  Commercial real estate markets in the region remain soft, with little change in vacancies but continuing declines in rental rates.  Residential real estate construction and sales continued to be strong, moving up in February after cold, stormy weather interrupted sales and building activity in January.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is generally positive.  Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments and orders during the next six months.  Retailers anticipate a moderate increase in sales in the spring compared with a year ago.  Bankers expect business and consumer lending to increase, but have mixed views on the course of residential mortgage activity.  Commercial real estate companies expect the region's office markets to firm up slowly during the year.  Residential real estate agents anticipate a nearly steady sales rate for most of this year, but builders have varying forecasts: some expect increases and some expect decreases in sales for the year as whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained on the rise in February, according 
              to reports from Third District firms. One-third of the manufacturing 
              companies contacted in February reported increased shipments compared 
              with January, twice the number that reported decreases. Four out 
              of 10 said their orders have increased compared with January while 
              only around one in 10 reported decreases. On balance, order backlogs 
              at area plants continued to edge up in February. Firms in nearly 
              all of the major manufacturing sectors in the region generally indicated 
              that business conditions were improving. Increases in demand were 
              especially strong for firms producing industrial rubber and plastic 
              products, electrical machinery, and a variety of metal products. 
              Demand for products used in homebuilding remained strong, and demand 
              for materials and products used to manufacture industrial equipment 
              has increased. Although conditions were improving in most industry 
              groups, there were some reports of slowing orders among makers of 
              electronic instruments. Processors of poultry products indicated 
              that the occurrence of avian flu in the region has negatively affected 
              exports but has not had much impact on domestic demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing firms in the region reported generally rising prices in February, and the number of firms making such reports has increased in recent months.  Among the goods frequently mentioned as rising in cost are natural gas, oil, scrap metal, steel, lumber, and various building materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, the region's manufacturers anticipate further improvement in business conditions.  More than half of the firms contacted for this report expect increases in shipments and orders, and only around one in 10 expect decreases during the next six months.  Area manufacturing firms plan to add employees and extend working hours in the next six months, and, on balance, they are scheduling increases in capital spending.  Although inventories have been flat, overall, among area firms, almost half plan to increase finished goods inventories in the next six months and around one-fourth plan to reduce inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally reported that sales moved up 
              in February compared with January and with February of last year. 
              The monthly gain was moderate, but the year-over-year increase was 
              fairly strong because sales in February of last year were severely 
              reduced by store closings during snowstorms. A brief spell of cold 
              weather in late January helped stores move out winter apparel, and 
              warming temperatures later in February boosted sales of spring clothing. 
              Most of the stores contacted for this report also indicated that 
              sales of Valentine's Day merchandise were up from last year. Retailers 
              generally described inventories as satisfactory though they are 
              still awaiting delivery of some spring merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District retailers expect sales for the spring season to be moderately above the same period last year.  Store executives said consumer confidence appears to be on the rise, although they noted that shoppers are still being selective and resisting impulse buying.  Although retailers in the region believe economic conditions are improving, they noted that some national chains that are retrenching have closed stores in the region despite their profitability locally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers reported generally steady sales in February at a pace somewhat higher than in February of last year.  They cited favorable weather conditions this year compared to last for the year-to-year gain.  Some dealers reported strong sales of new model vehicles and said they could sell more if the supply were greater.  Local auto dealers believe the current relatively healthy sales rate will persist as long as manufacturers maintain their financial incentive programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks was moving up at 
              a moderate pace in February, according to banks contacted for this 
              report. Commercial and industrial loans were on the rise as business 
              at area firms has been increasing. Residential real estate lending 
              continued on an upward trend with gains in purchase mortgages despite 
              some slowing in refinancings. Bankers generally indicated that consumer 
              loan volume has moved down seasonally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the District anticipate moderate growth in lending this year.  They expect business lending to increase further as business conditions improve in more industrial sectors.  Bankers generally see an upward trend in consumer lending as employment gains begin to solidify, but some expressed concern that consumer credit quality has been weakening.  Bankers and other mortgage lenders expect a fairly steady rate of residential lending for purchase mortgages during the spring, although some anticipate a slowdown later in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate firms in the Third District reported little 
              change in market conditions in the past few months. The overall 
              office vacancy rate rose slightly in suburban markets, but was steady 
              in the Philadelphia central business district. For suburban markets 
              as a whole the vacancy rate is estimated at 25 percent, with a great 
              deal of variation from location to location. The vacancy rate in 
              the Philadelphia central business district remains at nearly 13 
              percent. Throughout the region, effective rental rates have continued 
              to decline. Many lease renewals are being negotiated and tenants 
              have tended to sign for shorter terms and less space than they had 
              done previously. Commercial real estate contacts say that owing 
              to these new leases, as well as the capacity of many firms to expand 
              within their currently leased space, vacancy rates will decline 
              only gradually during 2004. Industrial building vacancy rates have 
              been nearly steady, although rents have edged down. However, real 
              estate contacts in the region said they have seen recent signs that 
              demand for industrial space is firming as manufacturing and distribution 
              activity has picked up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate agents and homebuilders generally reported that sales have been rising in recent weeks, with a noticeable pickup after a series of winter storms passed through the region.  Price appreciation appears to be steady.  Real estate agents expect the pace of existing homes sales to continue near its current rate through most of this year.  Builders have mixed views; some expect slight declines, others expect slight increases in sales this year.  Shortages of land for development continue to constrain builders' ability to meet demand in some parts of the District.
