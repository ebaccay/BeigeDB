      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 28, 2004
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District was rising moderately in July. Manufacturers 

  reported increases in orders and shipments compared with June. Retailers indicated 

  that sales of general merchandise were strengthening in early July after a slight 

  dip in June. Auto and light truck sales slowed in June and were about steady 

  in early July. Banks reported that overall lending continued on an upward trend, 

  with increases in most credit categories. Service sector firms have seen increased 

  demand and employment agencies reported stepped-up hiring.
      <p>
       The outlook in the Third District business community is generally positive. 

  Manufacturers expect increases in shipments and orders during the next six months. 

  Retailers expect a good pickup in sales for the back-to-school shopping period. 

  However, auto dealers forecast a fairly steady sales rate in the second half 

  of the year, somewhat below the pace of the first half. Bankers expect moderate 

  growth in lending to continue in the months ahead. Service sector companies 

  are optimistic that business will continue to expand.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued on an upward trend in 

  July, and the number of firms reporting gains increased slightly compared with 

  June. About half of the companies surveyed in July posted higher shipments and 

  orders than in the previous month, and around one in ten reported decreases. 

  Overall, there were increases in order backlogs and delivery times at area plants. 

  Increases in new orders were especially strong for firms producing industrial 

  materials and equipment, building materials, and a variety of paper products. 

  Order backlogs have risen markedly among makers of petroleum, metal, and lumber 

  products.
        <p>
         Around half of the manufacturing firms polled in July indicated that the prices 

  of the goods they purchase rose during the month, although some noted that prices 

  for steel and lumber appeared to be leveling off. Many firms continued to express 

  concern about continuing high prices for natural gas. Around one-third of the 

  firms surveyed for this report implemented price increases in the past month 

  for the products they make. About one-third of the firms indicated that they 

  have raised wages recently; most of these reported that the increases were between 

  2 and 4 percent.
         <p>
          The region's manufacturers expect further expansion in business activity. Half 

  of the firms surveyed in July expect increases in shipments and orders, and 

  less than one in five expects decreases during the next six months. Area manufacturing 

  firms are scheduling increases in capital spending and are planning to add employees 

  in the next six months.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Third District retailers generally reported a slowing in sales from May to June 

  but some strengthening in early July. Most of the store executives contacted 

  for this report attributed the slower sales in June to unseasonably mild weather, 

  which restrained sales of fans, air conditioners, warm weather apparel, and 

  other seasonal merchandise. Merchants also said store traffic was off as outdoor 

  activities took precedence over shopping for many consumers.
           <p>
            Retailers said the slackening in sales in June left some stores with higher 

  than planned inventories, and these stores were implementing price discounting 

  to move summer merchandise. However, most stores have been keeping inventories 

  relatively light, so extensive discounting is not anticipated. Several stores 

  have already begun back-to-school promotions, and most retailers expect a healthy 

  pickup in sales as the back-to-school shopping period gets under way.
            <p>
             Auto dealers reported a slowing in sales in June compared with May, and roughly 

  steady sales in early July. Inventories have increased well above desired levels 

  at many dealers. On balance, dealers in the region expect total vehicle sales 

  to be steady during the rest of the year, but at a lower level than during the 

  first half of the year. They anticipate declining demand for light trucks to 

  be offset somewhat by higher demand for cars.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Finance
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks rose slightly in June, according 

  to banks contacted for this report, and the trend has continued in July. Commercial 

  and industrial loans were growing moderately, with much of the gain coming from 

  rising credit needs of service companies and continuing growth in lending to 

  residential construction firms. Residential mortgage lending has also continued 

  on an upward trend. Consumer credit was rising, with moderate increases in credit 

  card lending and somewhat stronger growth in other types of personal loans. 

  Contacts at the region's banks and financial services companies continue to 

  remark that strong competition among bank and nonbank lenders is limiting increases 

  in loan interest rates.
              <p>
               Bankers in the District generally expect overall lending to rise during the 

  rest of the year. They anticipate further moderate gains in business and personal 

  lending. Many expect lending for residential construction and sales to peak 

  soon, but they note that activity in this sector has yet to show signs of easing.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Services
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Most of the Third District service firms contacted for this report indicated 

  some recent improvement in business conditions. There has been increased activity 

  in accounting and engineering services and some strengthening in demand for 

  information technology services. General business services activity has also 

  picked up somewhat. Trucking firms reported growing demand for their services 

  throughout the region. Most service sector contacts express cautious optimism 

  that business conditions will continue to improve.
                <p>
                 Temporary and permanent employment agencies in the region reported increasing 

  demand for workers. Firms in a broad range of industries are seeking sales and 

  marketing professionals, and there has been growing demand for information technology 

  workers, especially programmers. While staffing companies indicated that firms 

  are stepping up employee searches and hiring, they noted that most companies 

  are adding workers only as their business picks up and staffing needs become 

  pressing.
