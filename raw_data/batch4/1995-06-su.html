      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity remains at a high level across much of the nation, 
although there are indications of some softening in many reports 
from the 12 Federal Reserve districts. Activity in interest-sensitive sectors generally remains well below year-earlier levels 
and continues to decline in some areas. There are regional 
variations, with strongest growth reported in the center of the 
county, but generally less favorable conditions on the East and West 
coasts. Manufacturers of capital goods and electronics continue to 
report good sales. But producers of some consumer items, automobiles 
and their components, and building materials report slowing demand. 
Residential building remains slower than last year, but strength in 
commercial and other non-residential construction is taking up the 
slack in some areas. Developments in energy and mining are 
favorable, but agriculture has been hurt by unfavorable weather and 
livestock prices. Loan demand is largely flat, with some declines 
reported in lending rates. Most districts report that non-auto 
retail sales improved in May from earlier in the year. Auto sales 
remain depressed, with a few indications of an upturn. Tourism is 
mixed, with some districts reporting slow business due to 
unfavorable weather. Labor markets generally remain tight, but 
little wage pressure is evident. Similarly, price increases for 
products such as paper and semiconductors have been partially offset 
by price declines for building materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions for manufacturers vary across the country. At the 
extremes, Philadelphia and Richmond report notable declines, while 
Boston, Minneapolis and Kansas City describe continued strength. 
Other districts fall somewhere in between. There are some common 
threads running through several district reports. Orders for high-
tech items appear stronger than for traditional products such as 
apparel or home furnishings. Chicago notes that a manufacturer of 
industrial automation equipment has an order "backlog of Biblical 
proportions," while Dallas and Atlanta describe rising orders for 
electronic products, semiconductors and telecommunications 
equipment. San Francisco reports increased capacity utilization and 
lengthening lead times for makers of electronics components.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for capital items seems more sustained than for durable 
consumer goods, particularly for Chicago and Cleveland. Several 
districts report slowing output of vehicles and their components and 
a decrease in orders for building materials. Reports on consumer 
items are mixed; several districts, especially Boston, see weakness 
in this area. Atlanta notes specific declines in carpet, furniture 
and some apparel categories. Apparel is also don for St. Louis, but 
footwear is stable and furniture strong. Within this overall pattern 
for the manufacturing sector, several districts cite export orders 
as one source of strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction remains below year-earlier levels in all 
districts and a few report continuing declines in single-family home 
activity. But a few others, including Dallas and San Francisco, 
report gains in home building, and several districts report some 
degree of optimism on the part of builders with regard to the 1995 
construction season. Moreover, multifamily construction activity is 
buoying some regions, especially St. Louis and San Francisco. 
Furthermore, in several districts, notably Cleveland, Minneapolis, 
Dallas and San Francisco, commercial and other non-residential 
construction is strong, in some cases fully offsetting any weakness 
in the residential sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leasing and sales of existing housing follows a similar checkered 
pattern. Eastern cities such as Boston, New York and Washington 
reportedly have weakening rental markets for housing and commercial 
property, as does Chicago. But Atlanta and San Francisco report 
strong rental markets in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions are poor for farmers in several districts, largely 
because of adverse weather. For Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis 
and St. Louis, the problem is too much rain. Corn, soybean and wheat 
planting has been severely delayed across most of the Midwest and 
much of the Great Plains and yield expectations are dropping. 
Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota are particularly hard hit. 
Dallas and Kansas City report that winter wheat is in poor condition 
due to unfavorable weather earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bad weather is also hurting agriculture in the Richmond and Dallas 
districts, but here the problem is drought and unseasonable heat. 
The Carolinas and southern Texas are particularly hard hit. 
Livestock prices remain depressed. Kansas City reports higher than 
normal levels of farm loan refinancing, largely as a result of 
losses in the livestock industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cleveland, which describes producers as expecting excellent 
harvests, is one bright spot in the agricultural sector. San 
Francisco, which reports strong growth in exports of fruit and other 
agricultural products, is another.
     </p>
     <p>
      In other natural resource sectors, Dallas and Minneapolis report 
increased oil and gas activity, but Kansas City notes continuation 
of a half-year decline in drilling. For Dallas, the increase is 
concentrated offshore, while for Minneapolis production drilling 
into a new formation has led to a minor boom in North Dakota and 
Montana. Minneapolis also reports high production in iron and non-
ferrous metal mining, and good business for paper mills and loggers 
in spite of a price slump for lumber producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts report flat to slight increases in loan demand. One 
exception is San Francisco where growth is strong throughout the 
district, with improvements in real estate and construction lending 
in California. Loan demand softened somewhat in Cleveland, although 
new mortgage lending and mortgage refinancing have improved with 
declining rates. Loan demand is mixed in Atlanta, with moderate to 
strong activity in commercial real estate, industrial and general 
business lending, and slower activity in consumer lending, 
especially auto loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan rates decreased slightly in several districts. Average loan 
rates declined at about 60 percent of small and mid-size banks in 
the New York district. In Richmond rates fell slightly for consumer 
and commercial loans and fell sharply for mortgage loans. Kansas 
City reports little change in rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      General retail sales improved slightly in May compared to April in 
most districts. Exceptions include New York and Minneapolis where 
sales show moderate growth and Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco 
where sales are sluggish. In Boston sales are up 1 percent to 10 
percent over year-earlier levels, though retailers view the second 
half with uncertainty. Computers and telecommunications equipment 
are selling well in Cleveland, while home improvement products are 
moving slowly. A large retailer in Chicago reports that sales of 
appliances and home electronics exceeded average for May and June, 
while apparel sales also strengthened.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales are slow in many districts. Sales are described as 
significantly lower than year-earlier levels in Cleveland and 
Dallas, while waning in St. Louis. Kansas City dealers report flat 
or declining sales for the past month. Sales continue somewhat below 
last year's pace in Minneapolis, but there are signs of an upturn. 
Chicago dealers report that sales are up for May and early June, 
compared to April, and they expect a small gain in the latter half 
of 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism is mixed across districts. Activity for May was above April 
and year-earlier levels in Richmond. Tourism in Florida is spotty, 
but growing in the rest of the Atlanta district. Cold weather has 
slowed activity in Minneapolis, while San Francisco service 
industries report continued strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remain tight Employment growth remains robust, 
Minneapolis notes, and several New York small business executives 
relate difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled workers. Many 
areas of the St. Louis district are still experiencing tight labor 
markets, particular for entry-level positions, and have relaxed 
hiring standards. One-third of manufacturing firms surveyed by 
Boston have current openings or hiring plans. Help-wanted 
advertising and demand for temporary workers are strong in the 
Chicago district. Philadelphia, however, notes that area 
manufacturers plan to trim payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Notwithstanding taut labor markets, wage pressures are muted. 
Reports of wage increases remain scattered, according to Kansas 
City, and recent wage agreements specify increases in the 2 percent 
to 3 percent range in the Minneapolis district. Wage increases 
remain generally stable, states Atlanta. Moreover, although district 
labor markets remain tight, Chicago reports that a slowing of 
expansion in the demand for labor may have eased wage pressures in 
recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      While prices continue to increase, the rate of increase has recently 
diminished, according to Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, 
Philadelphia and Richmond. Some of this easing relates to the letup 
in home-building as Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis and San Francisco 
report a softening in building material prices. Atlanta's apparel 
and carpet producers are having trouble passing on higher material 
prices to consumers. Only 10 percent of manufacturers are raising 
prices on their own products, according to a Philadelphia survey. 
Semiconductor prices, however, have accelerated, states Dallas, 
while Boston, Kansas City and Minneapolis report price increases for 
packaging materials. But according to Dallas, manufacturers of paper 
and corrugated boxes said that selling prices have flattened, which 
may signal easing cost pressures in coming months.
