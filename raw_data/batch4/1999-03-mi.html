      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 17, 1999
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In early 1999 the pace of Ninth District business activity has 
picked up from the strong conditions reported at the beginning of 
the year, although natural-resource based industries remain in the 
doldrums. Businesses and forecasters are more optimistic now than in 
December. The forward momentum continues for construction, consumer 
spending and manufacturing. Low commodity prices continue to depress 
farm income, curb iron mining and stall oil exploration. Businesses 
would like to hire additional workers and are raising wages to 
attract them. They, however, are reporting few other price 
increases.
      <p>
       <b>
        Business Sentiment
       </b>
       <br/>
       "Nothing short of awesome," is the Minnesota state economist's 
current description of the national and state economies. Minnesota 
is now projecting a state budget surplus of $4.1 billion over the 
next three years, up from a $3.3 billion surplus that was projected 
in early December. A recent survey of Upper Midwest business 
supports his contention. In February 64 percent of respondents 
reported increasing sales as contrasted to 53 percent in December. 
Ninth District banks report strong loan demand.
       <p>
        <b>
         Construction and Real Estate
        </b>
        <br/>
        "Home builders have greatest January in 7 years," proclaims a 
Minneapolis news article. Housing permits increased all across the 
region in January from the previous year's level. Other construction 
remains strong, with January contract awards in Minnesota and the 
Dakotas 15 percent over year-earlier levels. Medical and health care 
facility construction projects are under way in Minnesota and 
Montana, and a large factory hog farm is planned in South Dakota. 
Public works projects are increasing across the district, with 
highway construction driven higher in Minnesota, Montana and South 
Dakota.
        <p>
         <b>
          Consumer Spending and Tourism
         </b>
         <br/>
         Retail spending showed continued momentum in early 1999. A major 
electronic goods retailer reports sales up substantially so far in 
1999. A major Minneapolis/St. Paul retailer reports strong sales 
gains in February and is "cautiously optimistic" about future sales. 
Elsewhere, a mall manager in North Dakota reports sales up 5 percent 
from a year ago for the first seven weeks of 1999.
         <p>
          Vehicle registrations increased significantly in South Dakota for 
the month of January compared to a year earlier, but decreased 
slightly in North Dakota. A North Dakota auto dealer association 
spokesperson expects the trend in auto sales to be "flat at best," 
due to the lagging agriculture and oil sectors.
          <p>
           After a slow start in December, winter tourism picked up in January 
and February. In northern Minnesota a major ski hill recorded record 
weekends in January and February, following a weak December. In the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan most motels were full on weekends in 
February, as contrasted to vacancies in December. South Dakota ski 
resorts also report a strong season, but a lack of snow has slowed 
snowmobiling. Meanwhile, in northern Montana business at a ski 
resort has been up only slightly from a year ago, due to the 
unfavorable exchange rate with Canada.
           <p>
            <b>
             Manufacturing
            </b>
            <br/>
            District manufacturing remains quite robust, despite the restraining 
influence of a weak international economy. A computer-components 
manufacturer recently announced a major expansion in western 
Wisconsin, which could add more than 1,000 jobs. A construction 
equipment manufacturer intends to expand its two North Dakota 
manufacturing plants, and a window manufacturer is adding workers at 
its North Dakota plant. High-tech manufacturing is bolstering 
production in South Dakota, according to a regional survey of 
purchasing managers. Moreover, several small manufacturers report 
strong, improving sales, according to a recent survey of Upper 
Midwest business.
            <p>
             Weak foreign economies, however, continue to constrain 
manufacturing. The Asian economic collapse has weakened demand for 
paper, and a major paper manufacturer recently announced the closing 
of a plant in northwestern Minnesota. Moreover, two western 
Wisconsin manufacturers attribute soft sales to weak
international business, and according to a regional survey of 
purchasing managers, Minnesota manufacturers tied to international 
markets, especially high tech, continue to report problems.
             <p>
              <b>
               Energy and Mining
              </b>
              <br/>
              Mineral-based industries remain in the doldrums. In response to 
weakening demand for domestic steel, one Minnesota mine shut down a 
taconite pellet line last fall, and it is uncertain whether the line 
will restart this spring as hoped, states a company spokesperson. 
Another Minnesota taconite producer is expected to lay off at least 
100 workers by late May and could cut production this year by 18 
percent.
              <p>
               Meanwhile, "oil exploration is at a standstill," reports a bank 
director. No rigs are currently working in North Dakota and only 
five in Montana as compared to 16 and 9, respectively, a year ago.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Agriculture
                </b>
                <br/>
                Like mining, agriculture remains stalled. Corn, soybean and wheat 
prices continue to remain near historic lows. Moreover, milk prices 
are declining, due to increased production. Hog prices have recently 
increased from December's extremely low prices but still remain 
below the break-even point for many producers. Several outbreaks of 
hog pseudorabies have been reported due to cash-strapped hog farmers 
eliminating vaccinations. The mild winter weather and low feed 
prices, however, have benefited cattle, dairy and hog producers.
                <p>
                 "The low commodity and livestock prices are drastically taking 
their toll on the net worth/capital of the farmers and drastically 
diminishing their ability to repay loans," reports a local 
agriculture lender. Based on preliminary results of the Ninth 
District's first quarter survey of agricultural credit conditions, 
61 percent of respondents reported a below normal rate of loan 
repayment compared to 51 percent of the fourth quarter survey 
respondents. In both the first quarter 1999 survey and the fourth 
quarter 1998 survey approximately 70 percent of respondents reported 
farm income decreases from the previous year's levels.
                 <p>
                  <b>
                   Employment, Wages and Prices
                  </b>
                  <br/>
                  "Most firms would hire qualified workers if they could find them," a 
recent survey of Upper Midwest businesses reports. But it is tough; 
unemployment rates are under 3 percent in nine out of the district's 
14 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Nevertheless, 60 percent 
of the St. Paul firms responding to a staffing firm's recent survey 
indicated they plan to add workers in the second quarter, which is 
up from the 46 percent giving that response a year ago.
                  <p>
                   In addition to innovative incentives and recruiting schemes to 
attract workers, employers are raising wages. A telemarketing firm 
recently boosted its starting wage to $7.50 an hour from $6.75. 
Plus, several large district firms indicated that they are 
increasing wages 4 percent to 5 percent this year. Increasing health 
insurance premiums are pushing up compensation costs, states a 
Minnesota union official.
                   <p>
                    While firms have to raise wages, they "can't increase prices," says 
a Minneapolis/St. Paul banker. Competitive pressures are keeping 
firms from raising prices, but low import prices are helping many of 
them to keep their costs down. Seventy percent of participants to a 
survey of Upper Midwest business reported stable or declining prices 
for their products, the same percentage as in December. Construction 
input prices, however, have been rising, due to the strong pace of 
building activity.
