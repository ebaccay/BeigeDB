      Beige Book Report: Chicago

     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Seventh District economy continued to expand moderately as 
              the old year ended and the new year began. Consumer spending over 
              the holiday season ended up in line with most retailers' expectations, 
              despite unseasonably warm weather hindering the sale of some seasonal 
              items. The normal seasonal slowdown in the region's construction 
              activity was less pronounced than in the past, with December's warmer 
              weather allowing more projects to be started. Manufacturers' plants 
              continued to run near capacity, although new orders appeared to 
              soften slightly in some industries, in part reflecting developments 
              in Asia. Business lending activity remained brisk, and mortgage 
              refinancing activity picked up noticeably as interest rates continued 
              to fall. Shortages of skilled labor persisted in most areas and 
              there were new reports of some projects being canceled as a result. 
              Prices for most key Midwest farm commodities have declined considerably 
              in recent weeks, adding to the likelihood of lower farm sector earnings 
              in 1998.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most merchants were generally pleased with December's sales results. 
              Consumers in the Midwest were reluctant to spend early in the month, 
              but sales activity picked up dramatically the week of Christmas 
              and continued strong through the post-holiday sales events. Despite 
              consumers waiting until the last moment to do their holiday shopping, 
              there was very little use of unplanned discounting to clear inventories. 
              These results were nearly universal across store types--with discounters 
              as pleased as department stores-- although one large national chain 
              reported District sales to be well below expectations, but in line 
              with their national results. Most merchants noted that sales of 
              appliances, electronics, jewelry, and consumables were exceptionally 
              strong, while apparel did well. Sales of some seasonal merchandise, 
              such as snow-blowers and outerwear, were hampered by unseasonably 
              warm weather in December. Despite their earlier concerns about shortages, 
              none of the merchants contacted indicated that the availability 
              of seasonal help had any discernible impact on sales.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Housing and Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Overall construction activity remained robust with the seasonal 
              slowdown less than usual. As in our last few reports, the commercial 
              segment was stronger than the residential side, although the latter 
              showed a slight rebound in December in some areas. Homebuilders 
              in Wisconsin and Illinois said that unseasonably warm weather had 
              boosted traffic in December, usually one of their worst months, 
              which subsequently boosted sales. Most homebuilders in the District 
              expect 1998 to be down slightly from last year's very high levels, 
              though December's strong showing made some less certain. The commercial 
              segment experienced a normal seasonal slowdown, but most contacts 
              felt that it was less pronounced than in previous years. Public 
              projects remained very strong and expectations for 1998 were very 
              high among contacts in this segment. One District materials supplier 
              suggested that this is the highest level of public construction 
              activity he had seen in years.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The District's manufacturing sector was very strong and continued 
              to expand at the end of 1997, but momentum may have been slowing 
              slightly heading into the new year. Though most contacts noted that 
              production continued to be near capacity, new orders--previously 
              described as "strong"--were generally described as "holding up," 
              and inventories--which had been "lean"--were being called "okay." 
              The Midwest's strong construction industry continued to boost sales 
              of heavy equipment, and construction equipment dealers were reported 
              to be "crying for more inventory." Strong motor vehicle sales in 
              December bolstered production for the District's automakers, although 
              one contact worried that December's strong showing may have borrowed 
              from January sales. Most producers expected light vehicle sales 
              to soften slightly in 1998 but to remain near the very good 15 million 
              unit level. A major producer of high-tech components indicated that 
              new orders were softer than at this time last year, but that the 
              company "can live with it." The pricing environment for most manufacturers 
              remained very soft and raw material costs were either flat or down 
              in most instances.
         <p>
          The turmoil in Southeast Asia has begun to filter through the 
              manufacturing sector since our last report. Heavy equipment producers 
              appeared to be influenced most directly, with exports to the region 
              falling off noticeably. One producer described the Asian market 
              as "a disaster," as the company's sales to the region were cut nearly 
              in half. The District's automakers expressed some concern that competitors 
              from Southeast Asia would increase the use of incentives in the 
              U.S., though there were few reports of this taking place recently. 
              This would further soften the pricing environment for the industry.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Banking and Finance
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Bankers in the District suggested that lending activity remained 
              very strong as 1997 drew to a close. As was the case in our last 
              few reports, commercial lending was stronger than consumer lending, 
              with one large bank noting that loan growth was "outstanding." While 
              business lending activity normally picks up at the end of the year, 
              one major bank reported an extraordinary increase in December which 
              showed no signs of slowing in early January. Other banks noted that 
              the growth in business loans had tapered off somewhat, but remained 
              at very high levels. Competition for quality commercial customers 
              remained very fierce and margins continued to be squeezed. On the 
              consumer side, the big story was a sharp increase in mortgage refinancing 
              activity. Falling interest rates lured many homeowners back into 
              the mortgage market in December and one major bank reported that 
              refinancing now accounts for over 60 percent of new applications, 
              up from approximately 30 percent. Overall asset quality was unchanged, 
              with most contacts describing it as "excellent."
           <p>
            <strong>
             Labor Markets
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Labor markets remained very tight through December and early January, 
              although the steady decrease in the region's unemployment rate appeared 
              to have ended. The average unemployment rate, which began declining 
              in mid-1992, flattened out in the latter half of 1997 and may be 
              trending upward ever so slightly. The major concern of employers, 
              however, continued to be labor shortages. Though these shortages 
              were broad-based, information technology and construction workers 
              were most often cited as being in short supply and accounting professionals 
              were again hard to find heading into the upcoming tax season. A 
              major producer of high-tech equipment reported that some projects 
              had to be scuttled because of the shortage of engineers. Homebuilders' 
              associations in Wisconsin recently began setting up recruiting booths 
              at some of the state's "home shows." The shortages continued to 
              hinder the District's employment growth and most analysts contacted 
              expect this to continue into 1998. A survey of employers' hiring 
              plans forecasted that the Midwest's payrolls would continue to expand 
              in the first quarter of 1998, with Detroit and Milwaukee area employers 
              being the most optimistic. Wage pressures generally remained subdued, 
              with new reports of increasing wage gains generally confined to 
              those occupations where skill levels were upgraded, such as upper-end 
              administrative staff with project leadership or report writing skills.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Agriculture
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Prices for most key Midwest farm commodities have declined considerably 
              in recent weeks, adding to the likelihood of lower farm sector earnings 
              in 1998. Sluggish export prospects, compounded by recent problems 
              in several Asian markets, contributed to the price decline for both 
              crops and livestock. Livestock prices were further undermined by 
              a seasonal rise in domestic hog marketings and by a bulge (presumably 
              temporary) in hogs imported from Canada, where labor strikes curtailed 
              operations at several packing plants. In addition, recent surveys 
              confirmed a major buildup in the number of hogs on U.S. farms during 
              the latter half of 1997, foreshadowing large gains in pork production 
              for much of this year.
