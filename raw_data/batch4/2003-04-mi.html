      <p>
       Ninth District economic activity decreased slightly in March 
                and early April. The manufacturing, commercial real estate, consumer 
                spending, and mining sectors were down. Although the energy sector 
                was flat, winter tourism activity rebounded somewhat after a slow 
                start. Residential real estate and agriculture grew. Over this 
                period, labor markets loosened somewhat. Overall wage and price 
                increases were modest. Significant price increases were noted 
                in insurance and natural gas, and decreases were noted in gasoline.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial real estate activity was slow. Vacancy rates for office 
                buildings in Minneapolis-St. Paul recently topped 19 percent, 
                reported a commercial real estate firm. A representative of a 
                commercial real estate firm in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area noted 
                that new leasing activity remained slow as companies are still 
                consolidating some operations. However, sales of commercial real 
                estate have been solid due to low interest rates. The value of 
                permits awarded for commercial projects in Billings, Montana, 
                were higher during the first quarter of 2003 than a year ago, 
                according to a city official.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential building and real estate activity continued to show 
                signs of strength. Housing units authorized in District states 
                were up 15 percent for the three-month period ending in February 
                compared with a year ago. A western Montana bank director noted 
                recent strong residential real estate activity. Although the apartment 
                vacancy rate in Sioux Falls recently reached its highest level 
                since 1996, developers are adding more units.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Recent retail spending was generally slow compared with a year 
                ago, in part due to consumers' focus on war coverage and a late 
                Easter relative to last year. A major Minneapolis-based department 
                store and discount retailer reported weaker sales in March compared 
                with a year ago. A representative of a leather products chain 
                noted an immediate negative effect on sales when the Iraq war 
                started; same-store sales were down about 7 percent in March compared 
                with a year ago. A Minneapolis-area mall manager reported that 
                although sales started out the year strong, several store owners 
                have complained about slower traffic in recent weeks. Another 
                mall manager in the Minneapolis area noted a steep drop-off in 
                traffic during the first two days after the start of the war, 
                but traffic and sales for the month of March as a whole were down 
                only 1 percent compared with last year. A mall manager in North 
                Dakota noted that sales were about even with a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto sales in Minnesota were very weak in February and March 
                compared with a year ago; however, sales picked up by early April 
                due to incentives, according to a representative of an auto dealers 
                association.
      </p>
      <p>
       Winter tourism activity rebounded somewhat after a slow start. 
                The winter tourism season began slower than last year in Montana, 
                according to an official; conversely, February and March were 
                relatively strong. Lodging and visits to tourist destinations 
                were up from a year ago in South Dakota. An official in the Upper 
                Peninsula of Michigan reported a solid winter tourism season; 
                however, traffic crossings at the International Bridge at Sault 
                Ste. Marie were down 11 percent in March compared with a year 
                ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity was down slightly. A March survey of purchasing 
                managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Nebraska) indicated decreased 
                manufacturing activity and lower new orders in Minnesota. As evidence, 
                a Minnesota pipe fabricator temporarily reduced employment due 
                to weak orders, and a northern Minnesota paper plant closed. A 
                western Wisconsin video monitor factory and a tool producer are 
                also closing. However, the Creighton University survey indicated 
                increased activity in the Dakotas. For example, a new ethanol 
                plant is planned for South Dakota.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy and Mining
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the energy sector was level, while the mining sector 
                was down slightly. End-of-March District oil and natural gas exploration 
                levels were about equal with early March. Meanwhile, an iron ore 
                mine in northern Minnesota announced plans to shut down temporarily 
                due to weak orders. In addition, due to unseasonably cold weather, 
                the start of the Great Lakes shipping season has been delayed, 
                and therefore mine production may be reduced, according to an 
                iron mining official.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The agricultural economy was up slightly. District cattle and 
                sheep remain in mostly fair to good condition. The calf and lamb 
                season is progressing well in most parts of the District. Montana 
                received above-normal moisture in March, and the District winter 
                wheat crop is faring better than last year's crop. According to 
                the U.S. Department of Agriculture, District farmers intend to 
                plant more acres of corn and soybeans but fewer acres of wheat 
                this spring compared with the spring of 2002. Meanwhile, March 
                milk prices dropped significantly from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages, and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Labor markets loosened somewhat as a number of layoffs were announced 
                since the last report. A major Minnesota-based airline announced 
                a new round of layoffs that will affect about 2,000 positions 
                in the state, while a regional airline in Minnesota will cut 85 
                jobs. A computer maker announced the layoff of about 500 workers 
                in South Dakota. In St. Cloud, Minnesota more than over 100 jobs 
                will be cut at a valve plant, and 100 workers will be idled at 
                a freezer factory for at least six weeks. A Minnesota-based firm 
                that provides services for issuers of identification and credit 
                cards recently announced about 200 layoffs companywide. A Minneapolis-based 
                investment firm will lay off 100 local employees. Initial claims 
                for unemployment insurance in Minnesota were up 14 percent in 
                March compared with a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, a reservation center in South Dakota will add up 
                to 200 jobs this spring. A new call center in Fargo, North Dakota 
                will employ 200 workers within two years. Nurses remain in short 
                supply in many areas of the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wage increases were moderate. A bank director reported that wage 
                increases were generally in the neighborhood of 2 percent to 3 
                percent over a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although overall price increases were modest, significant price 
                increases were noted in insurance and natural gas. Bank directors 
                reported generally slight increases in prices, but mentioned significant 
                increases in health and liability insurance. Small businesses 
                in Minnesota expect double-digit increases in health insurance 
                this year. Residential natural gas prices increased 15 percent 
                in March compared with a month earlier. In contrast, as of early 
                April, regular gasoline dropped 23 cents from a month ago and 
                6 cents from a year ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
