      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Overview
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The pace of economic activity in the Fifth District 
  quickened in late January and February, but some respondents 
  indicated that the recent uptick was a rebound from January's 
  weather-induced sluggishness. Retailers, manufacturers, and service 
  producers reported that growth picked up in their industries. Growth 
  in the real estate and financial sectors also increased. Employment 
  agencies saw stronger demand for temporary workers. Area port 
  representatives, however, reported slower business. Abundant 
  snowfall boosted tourism at ski resorts, but harmed farmers.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail Trade
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Preliminary results from a monthly mail survey of 
  District retailers pointed to stronger retail conditions in 
  February. Growth of sales revenues, employment, wages, big-ticket 
  sales, and shopper traffic increased, while inventory growth slowed. 
  Survey respondents said that retail prices rose more slowly in 
  February than in January. They expected price increases during the 
  next six months to be in line with their January forecasts.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Service Production
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Service-sector growth increased in February, 
  according to preliminary results from a monthly District mail 
  survey. Several respondents reported that inclement weather 
  adversely affected their businesses. Despite the weather, revenues 
  and employment grew somewhat faster, although wages grew more 
  slowly. Service prices rose more slowly in February than in January. 
  Respondents expected larger price increases during the next six 
  months than they had in January.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br class="style1"/>
        Most indicators of manufacturing activity increased 
in February from their January levels, according to preliminary 
results from a monthly mail survey of District manufacturers; this 
was the first such increase since September. Survey respondents 
reported that shipments, new orders, order backlogs, and the 
workweek increased; employment changed little. They were more 
optimistic about their prospects during the next six months than 
they had been in January, but they continued to report a scarcity of 
skilled labor. Manufacturers indicated that finished goods prices 
declined in February from the month before, but that raw materials 
prices rose. Compared to January, respondents expected raw materials 
prices to rise less rapidly during the next six months.
       </p>
       <div>
       </div>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Tourism
        </strong>
        <br/>
        A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts 
  throughout the District indicated that tourist activity in February 
  was above that in January and a year ago. Ski resorts in North 
  Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia reported unusually good 
  business as record snowfalls continued to boost winter bookings 
  above year-ago levels. Contacts expected better-than-normal business 
  and some price increases during the next six months.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Port Activity
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Representatives at District ports indicated that both 
  export and import levels in January were lower than in December and 
  a year ago. Severe weather hampered activity in Hampton Roads (Va.) 
  and Baltimore. Contacts continued to expect exports and imports to 
  increase during the next six months.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Temporary Employment
        </strong>
        <br/>
        A telephone survey of Fifth District temporary 
  employment agencies indicated that the demand for temporary workers 
  rose in February, although it was unchanged from a year ago. One 
  contact in Columbia, S.C. said that increased business development 
  boosted demand in that area. Temporary workers' wages rose faster 
  than the general price level during the past year. Most contacts 
  expected wages to stabilize but demand to rise during the next six 
  months.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Finance
        </strong>
        <br/>
        District financial institutions reported that lending 
  activity increased during January and February. Demand changed 
  little for consumer loans but increased for commercial and mortgage 
  loans. A mortgage lender in North Carolina said that refinancings 
  boosted activity at his institution to its highest level in several 
  years. Compared to December, interest rates were lower on commercial 
  and consumer loans, and higher on mortgage loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Residential Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        According to a telephone survey of District 
  real estate agents and homebuilders, residential real estate 
  activity increased in January and February. Housing starts, sales, 
  and prices were up compared to December. Participants reported a 
  strong increase in customer traffic, which they attributed to recent 
  declines in mortgage interest rates. Building permit levels changed 
  little throughout the District, except in West Virginia where they 
  decreased. Construction wages were steady and some materials prices 
  declined slightly.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Commercial Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Commercial real estate activity strengthened 
  in January and February. Leasing activity increased sharply and 
  commercial rents rose in most areas of the District. Office vacancy 
  rates decreased, except in the District of Columbia and Maryland 
  where they were unchanged. The availability of prime office space 
  continued to tighten, and many contacts reported shortages. 
  Respondents in Virginia and the Carolinas said that some new 
  construction was underway in their areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Agriculture
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Adverse weather damaged some crops and farm buildings 
  in recent weeks, according to District agricultural analysts. Near-record January and early February snowfalls and low temperatures 
  stunted late-winter, small-grains crops in some areas. Heavy snows 
  also collapsed numerous farm buildings, and flooding caused 
  scattered crop losses in several District states. On the plus side, 
  the cold temperatures benefited fruit growers in the Carolinas by 
  preventing fruit tree overbudding.
