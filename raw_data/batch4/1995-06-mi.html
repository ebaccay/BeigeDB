      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 21, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy shows few signs of slackening from the 
brisk pace reported previously. Manufacturing is strong. Oil 
drilling is experiencing a resurgence, mines are looking for ways to 
expand output and paper mills are running full out. The construction 
sector as a whole is robust, with commercial and heavy building 
projects more than offsetting declines in residential work. General 
merchandise sales are improved from earlier in the year. Vehicle 
sales remain below year-earlier levels, but some sources note an 
upturn in sales. Employment growth remains robust and employers 
report continuing problems in finding employees. Few substantial 
wage or price increases are reported other than for paper products 
and some industrial inputs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Adverse weather is responsible for problems in two sectors. Excess 
rainfall and cool weather severely delayed planting in many areas. 
Some loss of potential yield appears likely, particularly in the 
Dakotas. Moreover, the same wet, cool weather has dampened business 
in most tourist regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "We are as busy as we ever have been," says one Minneapolis small 
manufacturer, "and so is everyone else that I talk to." That 
statement generally characterizes conditions for manufacturers 
across the district, and is especially true for Minneapolis-St. 
Paul, Minn., Fargo, N.D., and Sioux Falls, S.D. Orders remain strong 
and the most pressing problem for many firms is securing skilled 
employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy and the other non-agricultural natural resource sectors are 
very strong. New drilling technology and a recently discovered oil 
formation have caused an upswing in drilling in North Dakota. 
Leasing, exploration and drilling activities in that state are at 
their highest levels in a decade. Gas and oil drilling is also 
strong in Montana. The non-ferrous metal mining sector continues to 
respond to strong prices by producing at capacity. An open-pit gold 
mine in South Dakota proposed doubling in size, while a new copper 
refinery is being constructed adjacent to a mine in Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula. Iron mines round Lake Superior continue to expect 1995 
shipments to be the strongest in several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Favorable prices have paper mills running at capacity and looking 
for ways to eliminate bottlenecks. Lumber prices are down in 
response to slowing of residential construction for the nation as a 
whole, but loggers remain busy. Plants producing oriented-strand 
board and other plywood substitutes are also busy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "The construction industry will continue strong, although the boom 
in residential and commercial construction will be replaced by 
industrial and public works projects," says a Montana business 
forecaster. That aptly summarizes the construction sector for the 
Ninth District as a whole. There is some slackening of residential 
work from the effervescent levels reached a year ago, but non-
residential projects are so strong that overall activity is up 
slightly. In Minnesota, for example, total construction employment 
in April was up 1 percent over year-earlier levels in spite of a 25 
percent decline in single-family permits over the same period. For 
the Minneapolis-St Paul metropolitan area, the employment increase 
in the same period was nearly 9 percent as increased commercial work 
more than compensates for the drop in home building. Moreover, in 
early June, one builders association representative reported that 
declining mortgage interest rates are causing increased interest in 
home building. Large, publicly let projects in Minnesota and the 
Dakotas for the year through April are even with 1994 and well above 
levels of the previous three years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Persistent rain, flooding and excessive soil moisture are widespread 
problems for crop producers. Spring planting was delayed by two 
weeks or more for all major crops in all district states except 
Montana. Large areas of eastern North Dakota and South Dakota are 
still unplanted. While weather conditions improved in early June, 
planting delays were so severe and so widespread that some yield 
loss can be expected. For example, as of June 4, only 55 percent of 
South Dakota's corn was planted compared to a five-year average of 
91 percent. The growing season in this region is such that corn 
planted after the first week in June is usually ensiled as cattle 
forage, but seldom produces marketable grain. In the livestock 
sector, hog and cattle numbers remain high and prices low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Our retail sales continue to be very strong," reports the CEO of a 
firm with department stores across the Ninth District. Across the 
region, sales of general merchandise apparently have improved since 
the preceding report. Some mall managers describe a recent pickup in 
traffic after a slump earlier in the year, and national chains based 
in Minneapolis report improved sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicle sales continue somewhat below levels that prevailed a year 
ago. In North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota new registrations 
for the year through May are about 10 percent below year-earlier 
levels. But there may be some upturn. While South Dakota's year-to-
date totals continue to lag 1994, new registrations for the month of 
May were up 11 percent from year-earlier levels. Some dealers and 
association representatives confirm some strengthening of sales, 
particularly for pickups and sport-utility vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      A cold, wet spring has dampened tourism in many parts of the Ninth 
District Tourism in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan decreased during 
May from a year ago due to poor weather and the Canadian exchange 
rate, according to tourist officials. In South Dakota, visitations 
to major outdoor attractions dropped about 10 percent. On a brighter 
note, an official in Duluth, Minn., reports a 7 percent increase for 
May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "State economy still churning out new jobs," was a headline in a 
recent Montana newspaper that could be used to characterize the 
Ninth District as a whole. Employment levels are generally 2.5 
percent to 3 percent above a year ago. Unemployment rates in most 
important labor market areas range from less than 2 percent to 4.5 
percent Many firms continue to report difficulty in securing both 
skilled and entry level workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to wages and prices, reports are mixed. Paper products 
continue to increase in price, and there are reports of magazine 
publishers switching to cheaper grades. Some manufacturers report 
increases in prices for steel and plastic components. But a builders 
association noted that building materials prices, especially lumber, 
have dropped dramatically. Reports on wage trends are mixed. Many 
employers report they have raised entry-level wages substantially in 
order to secure needed workers. But others report new wage 
agreements with increases of 2 percent to 3 percent.
