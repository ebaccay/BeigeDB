      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia

      <b>
       March 6, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     Business conditions in the Third District showed 
            some signs of improvement in February. Manufacturers reported increases 
            in shipments and orders. Retail sales of general merchandise have 
            been rising modestly, and auto sales have been steady. Sales of new 
            and existing homes have been running at a fairly high rate. However, 
            there were clear indications that commercial real estate markets have 
            weakened. Bank loan volumes have been flat, and slight growth in business 
            lending has been offset by a decline in consumer loan balances.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <p>
      The consensus among Third District businesses 
              surveyed in February is that there will be slow growth in the region 
              during the rest of the year. Manufacturers expect gains in shipments 
              and orders. Retailers anticipate modest improvement in sales. Auto 
              dealers expect the current sales rate to carry through most of the 
              year. Bank credit officers generally forecast slow growth in overall 
              lending, with gains in commercial and industrial loans as well as 
              consumer credit but a falloff in real estate lending. Contacts in 
              the commercial real estate industry forecast steady market conditions 
              for the first half of the year and some increase in demand for space 
              in the second half of the year. Residential real estate contacts 
              expect sales of both new and existing homes to be steady through 
              most of the year at around the current rate.
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing
       </b>
       <br/>
       Third District manufacturers reported moderate gains in activity 
              in February, continuing the improvement that began in January. Orders 
              and shipments increased in February at about the same pace as they 
              had in January. Business conditions improved somewhat more for makers 
              of durable goods, such as metal products and industrial equipment, 
              than for makers of nondurable goods, such as apparel and food products. 
              Area manufacturers kept working hours steady in February but reduced 
              employment. On balance, industrial firms continued to reduce inventories, 
              although half of those contacted for this report said they were 
              maintaining steady inventories. Three out of four manufacturers 
              in the region indicated that prices for both inputs and for the 
              goods they manufacture were steady in February. The number of firms 
              reporting falling prices has been declining for the last few months.
       <p>
        Local manufacturers have positive forecasts. Over 
              half of the firms surveyed in February forecast increases in orders 
              and shipments during the next six months, while around one in 10 
              anticipate decreases. On balance, area firms have raised capital 
              spending plans, but increases are modest and spotty across the major 
              industrial sectors in the region. Several chemical and plastics 
              companies have scheduled increases in outlays for the first half 
              of the year. Capital spending in other manufacturing sectors is 
              likely to be flat or up just slightly.
        <p>
         <b>
          Retail
         </b>
         <br/>
         Third District retailers reported modestly rising sales during February. 
              Sales growth was noted across nearly all lines of goods, with the 
              relatively strongest growth for jewelry and electronics. However, 
              warmer than normal weather has held down sales of winter coats and 
              some other seasonal merchandise.
         <p>
          Most area retailers said their inventories were 
              at appropriate levels. Stores in the region have increased discounting 
              to spur sales of winter merchandise during a prolonged spell of 
              warm weather, but they have been conservative in their buying of 
              spring merchandise and do not expect to make significant markdowns 
              on spring goods. Store executives believe consumer confidence may 
              be firming, and some have raised their sales forecasts for the year. 
              On average, they expect sales for the year to be around 5 percent 
              above last year, on a comparable stores basis.
          <p>
           Auto sales in the region were steady in February. 
              Although below last year's high rate, the current pace of sales 
              was described as good by most of the dealers contacted for this 
              report, as manufacturers' incentives continued to attract car buyers. 
              Inventories were generally described as in line with sales. Dealers 
              expect sales to continue around the current rate through most of 
              the year.
           <p>
            <b>
             Finance
            </b>
            <br/>
            Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks has been virtually 
              flat in recent weeks. Some banks have seen modest growth in business 
              loans, but consumer credit has declined somewhat. Mortgage refinancing 
              activity has started to ease at most banks in the region, and bank 
              lending officers expect a substantial decline in the next few months. 
              Most of the bankers contacted for this report indicated they were 
              limiting their commercial real estate lending activity even though 
              local developers were continuing to seek financing for new commercial 
              and industrial projects. Bank lending to residential developers 
              appeared to be steady, for both single-family home building and 
              multifamily housing construction. In general, although bankers noted 
              some deterioration in loan quality, both commercial and consumer, 
              they indicated that the decline has been within the parameters they 
              had anticipated.
            <p>
             Bankers in the Third District expect overall loan 
              demand to increase slowly through the year. They expect a modest 
              economic recovery with commensurate growth in business and consumer 
              lending, but they anticipate that residential real estate lending, 
              both refinancing and purchase mortgage activity, will be slower 
              this year compared with last year.
             <p>
              <b>
               Real Estate and Construction
              </b>
              <br/>
              Third District commercial real estate markets have eased since last 
              fall. According to surveys by commercial real estate firms in the 
              region, the office vacancy rate in the Philadelphia central business 
              district has increased by about 2 percentage points, to around 12 
              percent. Vacancy rates have increased more in suburban office markets, 
              to an average of around 15 percent. Vacancy rates are higher in 
              the suburbs because more new space has become available in suburban 
              areas and more space has been made available for sublease by firms 
              that have scaled back operations or gone out of business. Many of 
              these firms were high-tech or e-commerce companies. Rental rates 
              have decreased, and in some markets, landlords have begun offering 
              tenant improvement allowances. There has been some renegotiation 
              of soon-to-expire leases to extend them for longer terms at reduced 
              rates. Demand for industrial space has been fairly steady in most 
              parts of the Third District, although vacancies have increased in 
              a few areas where new buildings have become available. Commercial 
              real estate agents expect demand for office space to be steady through 
              the first half of the year and pick up during the second half. They 
              expect demand for industrial space to be steady through most of 
              the year.
              <p>
               Residential real estate agents generally reported 
              steady sales of both new and existing homes. Sales have been running 
              at a fairly high rate in most price categories except for the very 
              high end, where sales have slipped. Price appreciation has been 
              steady, except for very expensive homes. Price appreciation for 
              these homes has slowed in recent months. Home builders also reported 
              steady sales, although below last year's rate. Builders' backlogs 
              remain high. Real estate agents and builders indicated that relatively 
              low mortgage interest rates continue to support home sales, and 
              some real estate agents believe there has also been a shift in consumer 
              attitudes favoring home purchases over financial investments. Real 
              estate agents and home builders anticipate relatively steady sales 
              at around the current pace during the rest of the year.
