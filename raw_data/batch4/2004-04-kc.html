      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       April 21, 2004
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded solidly 
              in March and early April. Retail sales increased, manufacturing 
              activity continued to grow, and labor markets showed further improvement. 
              In addition, housing and energy activity rose from already high 
              levels. Agricultural conditions were little changed from the previous 
              survey, while commercial real estate markets were still generally 
              weak. Wage and retail price increases remained modest, but more 
              manufacturers than in past surveys were raising their output prices.
      <p>
       <b>
        Consumer Spending
       </b>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending in the district increased solidly in March and

early April. Nearly all retail stores reported sizable gains from earlier in

the year. Most stores also reported very strong year-over-year sales growth,

although some of these gains were due to soft sales during the onset of the Iraq war last spring. Among product categories, sales were particularly strong for women's

apparel, electronics, and most luxury goods. Inventory levels were generally

reported as satisfactory. Heading forward, most managers are very optimistic

and plan to increase stocks to meet strong anticipated demand. Motor vehicle

sales in the district also improved compared with previous months, although

they were still somewhat lower than a year ago in most areas. Most dealers

anticipate further improvement in coming months, due in part to the spending of

tax refunds. With the recent improvement in vehicle sales, dealers were

generally satisfied with inventory levels, and many plan slight expansion of

inventories in the months ahead. Travel and tourism activity in the district

was mixed in March and early April. Airport traffic was up in most district

cities, but activity at many Rocky Mountain ski areas slowed due to lack of

adequate snowpack. Resort operators were optimistic about future tourism

activity, as summer bookings have been strong. However, some tourist

businesses that rely heavily on automobile travelers were worried about the

potential impact of high gasoline prices this summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing
       </b>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity continued to expand in March and early April.

Most manufacturers reported higher levels of capacity utilization than in the

previous survey, and a larger number of firms said they were adding workers.

Expenditures on plant and equipment also continued to rise solidly. Most plant

managers reported continued increases in raw material prices, and many noted

longer supplier delivery times. Higher material prices continued to put

pressure on many firms' profit margins. However, more firms than in previous

surveys were able to pass some of their recent cost increases through to

finished goods prices. Expectations for future factory production and orders

remained strong, and many plants plan continued moderate increases in

employment and investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </b>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate activity strengthened

further in March and early April, while commercial real estate markets

generally remained weak. Single-family housing starts rose solidly in most

district cities, and starts of luxury and second homes were reported to be especially

strong in some areas. Nearly all builders anticipate continued strength in

homebuilding heading forward, although limited availability and rising prices

of some building materials were a concern. Realtors reported that home sales

increased slightly in most district cities and were stronger than expected in

several areas, including Denver. Home prices continued to increase at a

moderate pace. Looking ahead, realtors expect home sales to continue to

improve and home prices to rise slightly. Most mortgage lenders reported

sizable increases in mortgage demand, due mainly to rising demand for home

purchase loans. Lenders expect continued strength in mortgage demand through

the summer. Commercial real estate activity in the district generally remained

weak in March and early April, but a few signs of improvement were apparent.

Prices for office space were flat to slightly lower throughout the district,

and vacancy rates remained high by historical standards. In addition, several

contacts reported nonresidential construction had been disrupted by rising

prices and shortages of steel. On the positive side, vacancy rates in some

cities edged down from earlier in the year, as absorption and sales of office

space rose modestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Banking
       </b>
       <br/>
       Bankers report that loans edged up and deposits held steady since the last

survey, raising loan-deposit ratios slightly. Demand for commercial and

industrial loans and commercial real estate loans increased, while demand for

other loan categories was little changed. On the deposit side, slight

increases in liquid accounts were offset by a decline in large CDs. All

respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged, and most banks also

held consumer lending rates steady. Lending standards were unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Energy
       </b>
       <br/>
       District energy activity rose in March and early April from already high

levels. The count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region was up

slightly from the previous survey and up considerably from year-ago levels.

Producers generally expect drilling activity to remain very strong in coming

months, as energy prices are expected to stay elevated. Most producers

reported continued shortages of drilling equipment and qualified workers, and

several contacts noted that some materials used for drilling, such as steel

pipe and sand, were becoming very difficult to obtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Agriculture
       </b>
       <br/>
       Agricultural conditions were little changed in March and early April from the

previous survey. Prolonged drought in the western portion of the district

continued to strain the winter wheat crop, and ranchers were concerned about

pasture conditions. In contrast, eastern areas of the district received

significant rainfall and had adequate subsoil moisture for spring planting.

With soybean prices at 15-year highs, agricultural bankers expect more soybean

planting this year than usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Wages and Prices
       </b>
       <br/>
       Wage and retail price increases generally remained modest in March 
              and early April, but an increasing number of manufacturers were 
              raising their output prices. Labor markets showed further improvement, 
              as hiring announcements by district firms continued to exceed layoff 
              announcements. There were also more reports of labor shortages than 
              in previous surveys. A number of contacts cited difficulties hiring 
              nurses, skilled rig workers, geologists and engineers, and some 
              types of factory and warehouse workers. Even so, most firms continued 
              to have few problems hiring workers, and wage pressures generally 
              remained muted. Several employers noted that high benefit costs 
              continued to discourage them from hiring new employees. As a result, 
              they were focusing on retraining current employees or hiring temporary 
              workers. Most retailers reported flat selling prices compared with 
              previous surveys and expect little change in prices heading forward. 
              One store, however, reported increasing prices for furniture containing 
              steel parts and for flooring items made from petroleum-based products. 
              Builders reported that prices for lumber, sheetrock, and steel products 
              rose again, and further increases are expected. Most manufacturers 
              reported continued increases in raw materials prices. There were 
              also more reports than in previous surveys of increases in finished 
              goods prices, especially among producers of food, petroleum-intensive 
              products, and steel-intensive products. Manufacturing materials 
              prices are generally expected to continue rising in coming months. 
              A growing number of firms expect to be able to pass along at least 
              some of the future cost increases, in part by including price-escalation 
              clauses in new customer contracts.
