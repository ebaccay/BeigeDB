       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy continued to expand moderately in 
September and early October. Retail sales growth rebounded in 
September from heat wave-depressed levels in August and then turned 
mixed in the first two weeks of October. Stronger housing activity 
is anticipated to help prompt greater retail sales gains in the near 
term, but several large retailers expressed more caution about 
growth prospects in 1996 than they did in previous months. Consumer 
durable goods production has taken the lead in District industrial 
output growth, while increasingly mixed messages have arisen in 
previously strong capital goods industries. Labor markets remain 
relatively tight, and reports of rising wages in entry-level 
positions have grown increasingly frequent. However, surveys of 
retailers and manufacturers showed little sign of accelerating price 
increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales rebounded in September from heat wave-depressed levels 
in August, but October sales reports were mixed. Weather played the 
most important role determining recent department store sales 
patterns, with sales strengthening during colder weather in early 
October, and fading during unseasonably warmer weather during mid-
month. Retailers generally remain optimistic about prospects for the 
holiday season, partly because of a longer-than-usual holiday season 
this year. Several large retailers expressed greater caution about 
sales prospects in 1996 than they did in previous months, however. 
One large retail chain reported pronounced weakness in customer 
traffic in its own and its competitors stores in the first two weeks 
of October. This chain reduced its orders and inventory plans 
slightly, and anticipated further retrenchment and greater 
promotional activity in the absence of a turnaround. Another large 
department store chain characterized recent trends as simply "okay, 
on balance" noting sharply increased volatility in within-month 
sales results. This contact reported that the tardy arrival of back-
to-school and other seasonal sales prompted extraordinarily large 
year-over-year sales gains in mid-to-late September, followed by 
weaker results in early October. Retailing contacts remained 
optimistic that gains in sales of housing-related items would 
strengthen in line with traditional lags following stronger housing 
activity. A survey of retailers in Iowa showed inventory plans were 
in line with or slightly stronger than year-earlier intentions, 
while a survey of retailers in Michigan showed that inventory and 
hiring plans for coming months had risen in line with strong year-
earlier levels. However, auto dealers in the region reported slowing 
traffic and sales in recent months, and many have cut back their 
orders and inventory plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Survey data and discussions with realtors, homebuilders, banks and 
lumberyards indicate that home sales continued to strengthen during 
September and early October. Favorable weather enabled home 
construction to finish the peak building season at a high level of 
output. One of the largest realtors in the District reported that 
sales strengthened significantly in August and September, and noted 
that "our salespeople are all quite upbeat." Banks reported strong 
home loan applications and closures; one large bank closed a record 
number of home loans during September. Apartment rents were reported 
to be rising at a slightly faster pace this year than earlier in the 
1990s; lower vacancy rates have squeezed out incentives, and owners 
have also passed on increased interest costs under adjustable rate 
mortgages. Homebuilders' appraisals of current and expected sales 
activity continued to improve from low second quarter levels. A 
survey showed homebuilders' responses in the Midwest remained the 
strongest among the four regions in the nation, and well above year-
earlier levels. An association of lumberyards stated that members' 
requests for association services had dried up in the past month. 
"If our phones aren't ringing," this contact stated, "then the 
dealers are busy. Right now, it seems like they're busy from dawn to 
dusk."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District purchasing managers surveys show stronger industrial output 
in the region in August and September, with little renewed upward 
pressure on input prices. District steel output rose sharply in 
September; it fell back slightly during early October, but remained 
well above year-earlier levels. One steel industry contact stated 
that demand from auto and appliance producers prompted much of the 
September increase in output in the region, but demand from 
construction machinery manufacturers weakened somewhat. Steel 
production plans for the fourth quarter have increased slightly in 
recent months, but this contact quickly noted "it's not a boom, mind 
you." An auto industry analyst stated that fourth quarter auto 
production schedules imply a substantial increase in assemblies 
during the fourth quarter. Distributor sales of appliances in the 
first two weeks of October continued to strengthen relative to year-
earlier trends after weakening in the second quarter and into early 
July. An appliance industry analyst stated that housing activity has 
proven stronger than expected earlier in 1995, and a large 
manufacturer expected a modest gain in appliance shipments in 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      Signs of slowing have arisen within the District's capital goods 
sector, notably among producers of construction equipment and heavy-
duty trucks. A construction equipment industry analyst stated that 
retail sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be flat to down 
slightly from last year, as an uptick in activity in August doesn't 
seem to have followed through into September and October. Sales 
remain at high levels, and recent strengthening in housing activity 
is still expected to boost construction equipment sales by the 
second quarter of 1996. Nonetheless, this analyst characterized 
manufacturers' current inventory as "high for all types of 
machinery." Another analyst reported that heavy-duty truck order 
cancellations have risen sharply in recent months. Order backlogs 
have declined considerably, albeit from dramatically high levels. 
Even so, current production schedules imply a small decline in 
heavy-duty truck output in the fourth quarter, and another trucking 
industry observer estimated that fleet utilization slipped further 
in the third quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. A large 
manufacturer of locomotives also reported slower new orders in 
recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continue to tighten, and reports of wage 
increases in entry-level positions grew increasingly frequent. 
Unemployment rates in District states remained at or near their 
lowest levels in the past two decades. Help-wanted advertising 
firmed up in the region in the third quarter, climbing back in line 
with first quarter levels. Initial claims for unemployment insurance 
in the region declined in recent months relative to year-earlier 
trends. In the manufacturing sector, the employment components of 
District purchasing managers' surveys slipped in the second quarter, 
but firmed up during the third quarter, and remained substantially 
above their averages for 1990, 1991, and 1992. Manufacturers' hiring 
plans remained stronger than the overall Midwest average in the 
latest hiring survey conducted by a large temporary help company, 
and several manufacturers reported increasing entry-level wages to 
attract new hires. A temporary help company reported that employers 
in its market area have increasingly displayed wage rates in help-
wanted advertising. An auto supplier reported high and increasing 
turnover, and expressed concern that at current unemployment rates 
deer-hunting season could cut into output to a greater extent than 
usual this year.
