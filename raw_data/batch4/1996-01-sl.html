      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 17, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District economy continues to grow at the slow-but-steady pace 
indicated in our last report. District retailers report that holiday 
sales were slightly above last year's levels, but the growth rate 
was below that of last year. Relative to previous reports, few plant 
expansions or closings were announced in recent weeks. Most firms 
report moderate sales increases. Most of the growth in residential 
construction is occurring in the southern part of the District, 
while much of the District's nonresidential construction is focused 
in Arkansas and Missouri. Total deposits and loan demand at large 
District banks increased during the last two months of 1995. The 
District's winter wheat crop appears to be in fair-to-good shape.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retailers report that same-store holiday sales were up 
between 2 and 3 percent over last year's season, with a few 
reporting increases of up to 6 percent. These rates, however, are 
below last year's average increase of between 6 and 7 percent. 
Discounters posted slightly higher sales growth than malls and large 
department stores. Because consumers seemed to wait for last-minute 
sales, the holiday season started off sluggishly, pushing many of 
these sales gains to just before and after Christmas. Most 
retailers, however, used less pre-Christmas discounting to stimulate 
sales than in prior years. Electronics, household items, jewelry and 
toys were the strongest sellers. Anticipating soft holiday sales, 
retailers adjusted their orders accordingly; as a result, 
inventories are generally at or below their desired post-Christmas 
levels. Many retailers noted a greater use of credit and layaway for 
purchases. Most expressed mixed expectations about the current 
quarter, with discounters generally more upbeat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District firms report that the pace of economic activity has 
remained relatively unchanged from the previous reporting period. 
Some contacts report moderate increases in sales and employment. 
Fewer announcements than in prior reporting periods about new 
plants, plant expansions or closings were noted, but some of these 
are noteworthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Japanese automaker announced that it will build its first U.S. 
pickup truck plant in southern Indiana. The $700 million plant will 
open in 1998 and employ at least 1,300 workers. State incentives for 
the plant amount to almost $30 million. A firm distributing 
industrial uniforms reports that it will bring more than 300 jobs to 
western Kentucky when it opens a new distribution center there 
within the current year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moderate sales increases are reported by some contacts. One from 
northwest Mississippi reports that businesses targeting specialty 
markets, like gourmet stoves or home decorating, have exhibited 
strong growth in the last few months. Another in eastern Arkansas 
reports that sales at some local manufacturing firms are up between 
14 and 21 percent year-to-date through late 1995 over the same 
period last year. A building materials supplier, though, reports 
sales through late 1995 are essentially unchanged from the year 
before. A dealer in heavy farm equipment remains upbeat even though 
sales in 1995 were slightly below 1994's level because 1994 was an 
exceptionally good year.
     </p>
     <p>
      A recent survey of firms in various cities nationwide by a temporary 
employment agency reports that 13 percent of St. Louis firms and 33 
percent of Memphis firms plan to hire new employees during the first 
quarter of this year. Nationally, 20 percent of surveyed firms 
indicated they will hire this quarter. Counterbalancing these 
reported expansions, a major St. Louis-based retailer, that is 
currently reorganizing under Chapter 11, announced it will close 500 
stores nationwide, 16 of which are in the St. Louis area, as part of 
its bankruptcy resolution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential building permits on a year-to-date basis through late 
1995 were above 1994's levels in only four of the District's 12 
metropolitan areas. Three of these four areas are in the southern 
part of the District. In five of the remaining eight, the gap 
between the two years has been narrowing recently. The number of 
nonresidential building permits is well above 1994 levels and 
continues to rise in half of the District's metropolitan areas. 
Arkansas and Missouri cities are experiencing the strongest growth 
in nonresidential construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand at large District banks appears to have picked up in the 
last two months of 1995, after being relatively soft the previous 
two months. Total loans outstanding at 11 large District banks rose 
2.3 percent from mid-October to mid-December, after increasing just 
0.7 percent from mid-August to mid-October. All major categories of 
loans-consumer, real estate and commercial and industrial-posted 
increases in the October-to-December period. Total deposits at these 
banks increased 1.7 percent from mid-October to mid-December 
compared with a 1.3 percent increase in the prior two-month period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The winter wheat crop in most areas of the District appears to be in 
fair-to-good condition. Although seeding of the crop occurred under 
less than optimal soil moisture conditions last fall, recent rains 
and snowfall have been beneficial. Some isolated areas, however, are 
still reporting dry soil conditions. Southern pine lumber mills 
report that year-to-date orders and production for 1995 are modestly 
below 1994's levels.
