       September 11, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy 
                appears to have grown very little from mid-July through August. 
                Agriculture, residential construction and tourism grew. Output 
                was flat, however, in the energy and mining sectors, consumer 
                spending was level, and commercial construction and manufacturing 
                contracted. Over this period, labor markets were mixed, while 
                wages and prices were stable. Significant price increases were 
                noted in insurance and housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction was soft. A commercial real estate firm 
                  noted that office vacancy rates in Minneapolis-St. Paul have 
                  recently increased to 16 percent, not including sublease space. 
                  The value of contracts awarded for new construction projects 
                  in Minnesota and the Dakotas was higher for roads and bridges, 
                  but lower for public and private buildings for the three-month 
                  period ending in July compared with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, home building and real estate 
                  activity were solid. District housing units authorized were 
                  up 8 percent for the three-month period ending in July compared 
                  with a year ago. More home sales were closed in the Minneapolis-St. 
                  Paul area in July than in any month during the past five years. 
                  Home builders in Grand Forks, N.D., were busier than last year, 
                  according to a contractor. However, Minneapolis-St. Paul apartment 
                  vacancy rates were twice as high as last year. Furthermore, 
                  recent home foreclosures were above last year's levels in the 
                  Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall consumer spending was level with noted increases in 
                  car sales and weak other retail sales. A major Minneapolis-based 
                  department store retailer reported that overall same-store sales 
                  were below plan for the first two weeks of August. A Minnesota-based 
                  electronics retailer reported flat sales in July compared with 
                  a year ago. Meanwhile, a Helena Branch director reported recent 
                  soft retail sales in northwestern Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mall managers reported that sales were generally 
                  weak. In the St. Paul-Minneapolis area two mall managers reported 
                  that recent sales were flat to slightly higher than last year. 
                  Retail sales were down slightly in July from last year at a 
                  North Dakota mall; however, foot traffic in August was strong. 
                  A Montana mall manager reported flat sales in July compared 
                  with a year ago. However, same-store sales at a South Dakota 
                  mall were up 5 percent in July, and were up about 3 percent 
                  to 5 percent in August from last year, according to a mall manager.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Montana car dealer reported record sales 
                  for the month of July—15 percent higher than last year. Recent 
                  car sales were robust at dealerships in South Dakota, according 
                  to an auto dealers association representative.
     </p>
     <p>
      Summer tourism activity was strong. July and 
                  August tourism activity was up 3 percent to 5 percent compared 
                  with a year ago in the Duluth, Minn., area due to active convention 
                  business and leisure travel. In northwestern Wisconsin, recent 
                  visitor numbers and resort bookings were higher than a year 
                  ago. Visits to Mt. Rushmore and state parks in South Dakota 
                  were up 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in July compared 
                  with a year ago. A tourism official in Montana predicted a 1 
                  percent to 2 percent increase for 2002 in nonresident travelers 
                  compared with last year. Visits to Yellowstone and Glacier National 
                  parks were up from last summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity was down. An August survey of purchasing 
                  managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated decreased 
                  manufacturing activity in Minnesota and North Dakota and increased 
                  activity in South Dakota. In Minnesota, a maker of electrical 
                  contractor tools announced it will close a manufacturing facility, 
                  and a water filtration producer will close a factory by the 
                  end of the year. In northwestern Wisconsin, a furniture manufacturer 
                  recently abandoned expansion plans, while a veneer plant is 
                  currently ramping up production and a new saw mill opened. In 
                  South Dakota, a food processor is building a $40 million cheese 
                  plant, which is one of the largest one-time private investments 
                  in state history.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining sectors was unchanged. Mid-August 
                  district oil and natural gas exploration and production levels 
                  were about even with early July. Meanwhile, August production 
                  at a large iron ore mine was about equal with July, according 
                  to a company spokesperson. Late August Montana mining output 
                  was unchanged from early July, and miners are cautiously optimistic 
                  about the future, according to a Montana mining industry spokesperson.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The overall agricultural economy was up, primarily due to stronger 
                  crop prices. Late August corn, soybean and wheat futures prices 
                  were up 11 percent, 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively, 
                  from early July. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported 
                  diverse estimates for corn, soybean and small grain output in 
                  district states. Minnesota's 2002 corn and soybean crops are 
                  anticipated to increase 18 percent and 4 percent from 2001, 
                  respectively, while South Dakota's 2002 corn and soybean crops 
                  are forecast to decrease 5 percent and 13 percent, respectively. 
                  North Dakota oat production is predicted to increase 33 percent 
                  in 2002 from 2001. The total Montana 2002 wheat harvest is expected 
                  to increase 45 percent over 2001's drought-ravaged crop. However, 
                  the drought has moved into South Dakota, causing hay production 
                  to be down an estimated 46 percent from last year. The USDA 
                  recently announced a feed assistance program to help South Dakota 
                  cow-calf operators.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets were about the same as the previous report with 
                  a mix of layoff and expansion announcements. A Minnesota company 
                  that installs and services telecommunications systems announced 
                  plans to lay off 100 workers. A North Dakota agricultural machine 
                  manufacturer recently cut 22 employees. A state agency in Minnesota 
                  is cutting over 100 jobs. According to a poll by a staffing 
                  company, 23 percent of respondents in Minneapolis-St. Paul plan 
                  to expand payrolls during the final quarter of 2002, while 11 
                  percent expect to decrease staffing levels -- similar to the 
                  same survey taken a year earlier. Recent job vacancies were 
                  down 24 percent in the La Crosse, Wis., area from a year ago, 
                  according to a Wisconsin study. A state survey revealed that 
                  second quarter job vacancies in Minnesota were down 41 percent 
                  from a year ago. However, almost 7 percent of nursing jobs in 
                  Minnesota were vacant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meanwhile, a call center in the Upper Peninsula 
                  of Michigan is expected to hire 60 more people. In North Dakota 
                  a children's play equipment producer recently announced plans 
                  to add 100 new jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases were moderate. More than half 
                  of business leaders in central Minnesota who responded to a 
                  recent survey conducted by the
      <em>
       St. Cloud (Minn.) Area Quarterly 
                  Business Report
      </em>
      expect wages and compensation to remain 
                  level through the end of the year. Wages for field workers in 
                  a region that includes Minnesota and Wisconsin were down 5 percent 
                  in July compared with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases were also moderate, with significant 
                  increases noted in health insurance and home prices. A bank 
                  director noted slight increases in overall prices, but significantly 
                  increased health insurance costs compared with last year. The 
                  median home sale price in the St. Paul-Minneapolis area was 
                  up 8.6 percent in July over a year ago.
