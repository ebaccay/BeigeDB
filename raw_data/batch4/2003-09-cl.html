      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       September 3, 2003
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Fourth District contacts reported increased 
                  economic activity since the last report, although growth appears 
                  to be modest. For the third consecutive report, manufacturers 
                  cited steady or improving production and sales. Residential 
                  homebuilders reported continued sales growth. Demand for commercial 
                  loans increased since the last report, while consumer loans 
                  remained constant.
      <p>
       Reports from other areas of the economy were mixed. Retailers 
                  and auto dealers experienced continued slow sales, though these 
                  were not necessarily unanticipated. Activity in commercial construction 
                  accelerated in parts of the District, but it remained sluggish 
                  in others. After a more optimistic report in July, conditions 
                  in steel did not show further improvement. Though overall prices 
                  of inputs were flat or declining, utility prices rose. Employment 
                  levels did not change for most contacts; some added employees, 
                  and a few firms reported layoffs. While there is plenty available 
                  labor, contacts stated there is less available now than during 
                  the same time last year. Rising insurance costs have caused 
                  a number of firms to change features in benefits offered to 
                  employees, both by passing some costs to employees and curtailing 
                  some benefits.
       <p>
        Most contacts in manufacturing, residential construction, 
                  banking, and trucking and shipping expect conditions to continue 
                  improving throughout the rest of the year, while contacts in 
                  steel, commercial construction, and retail were more mixed with 
                  regard to continued activity.
        <p>
         This District was affected by the blackout in 
                  mid-August. Though most contacts could not immediately discern 
                  the total impact, retail and manufacturing experienced the greatest 
                  impact as a result of closures. Other sectors of the economy 
                  experienced minor or no problems due to the electricity problems.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most manufacturing contacts reported continued improving conditions 
                  in July and August. However, unlike the previous report, a few 
                  contacts did note declines in both production and sales. Overall, 
                  both production and sales were higher during this period than 
                  in the most recent report and during the same time last year, 
                  with nondurable goods manufacturers generally citing more favorable 
                  conditions than durable goods producers. Inventory levels were 
                  flat during this time period, with idle capacity remaining relatively 
                  the same as well. While most manufacturers said they were maintaining 
                  their current workforce levels, the proportion of firms reporting 
                  new hires was greater than those cutting payrolls. Most contacts 
                  still anticipate moderate sales and production growth by year's 
                  end.
          <p>
           Auto production fell again at most District plants 
                  in July and early August compared with June, but it should be 
                  noted that many facilities re-tooled in early July. Regardless, 
                  same-model production was about 4 percent lower than 2002 levels. 
                  In July, three new models began production in the District. 
                  A few facilities reported the use of overtime.
           <p>
            In the steel industry, production was fairly stable between July 
                  and August, though there was some mention of increased sales 
                  between July and August. However, overall demand was characterized 
                  as "soft" in August, and both sales and production levels during 
                  this period were substantially down from last year. Inventories 
                  are down from a year ago, and firms anticipate holding inventories 
                  at their current low level. New orders for steel for the fall 
                  are coming at a steady rate, and contacts expect the demand 
                  to remain the same till the end of the year. To meet current 
                  demand, plants are running normal-to-shortened work schedules. 
                  Most contacts have held employment levels constant since the 
                  previous report although a few are reducing jobs. Steel prices 
                  were mixed, with slight movement in both directions.
            <p>
             Many manufacturers in the areas affected by the 
                  blackout were closed up to three days; however, most firms stated 
                  that they were able to tap into inventories and anticipated 
                  being able to use overtime production, as needed, to make up 
                  for the loss. Manufacturing contacts stated that supply chains 
                  were largely uninterrupted and orders were unaffected.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Retail Sales
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Economic conditions were again mixed in retailing during July 
                  and early August compared to the previous report, with small 
                  increases and decreases in sales activity reported. However, 
                  all contacts noted sales declines of slightly lower to almost 
                  15 percent down since the same period last year. Discounting 
                  and promotional activity continued, as many retailers geared 
                  up for back-to-school shopping. Sales were in-line with retailers' 
                  expectations, and all contacts reported favorable inventory 
                  positions. Though activity in apparel remains generally sluggish, 
                  contacts stated that sales of furniture, cosmetics and personal 
                  care items, shoes, and career wear (men's and women's suits) 
                  were strong during this period. Most contacts are expecting 
                  sales to be flat or slightly higher this year relative to last.
              <p>
               Retailers in the District reported electricity-related 
                  losses on Thursday, though many were able to open on Friday. 
                  Overall impact on the sector is not yet known. Restaurants were 
                  particularly hard hit because of the water problems that continued 
                  after electricity was restored.
               <p>
                Automobile dealers noted flat-to-declining new car sales throughout 
                  the District. Overall sales this period were lower than during 
                  the same time last year. Sales continue to be dependent on incentives, 
                  though their impact on consumers has deteriorated. Used car 
                  sales, on the other hand, continued to increase. New car inventory 
                  levels are more favorable than in previous months.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Construction
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 Continued strong sales were cited by homebuilders in the District, 
                  as in last month's report. Growth in sales has continued since 
                  the spring and, while not uniform, some contacts cited this 
                  period being one of the strongest ever. Sales for most builders 
                  are above plans, which anticipated sales increases of about 
                  3 to 5 percent during 2003 relative to 2002.
                 <p>
                  Commercial building continues to be slow, though parts of the 
                  District show signs of improvement. Within the last several 
                  weeks in the Cleveland area, the number of new projects in several 
                  building segments, including manufacturing, warehousing, and 
                  distribution had accelerated. There also appears to be increased 
                  activity in the Pittsburgh area, while in the Columbus area 
                  and the southern part of the District demand remained sluggish.
                  <p>
                   <strong>
                    Trucking and Shipping
                   </strong>
                   <br/>
                   Demand for trucking and shipping held constant again since the 
                  previous report, and conditions were flat compared to the same 
                  time last year. Consolidation in the industry points to further 
                  increases in capacity utilization. Increased demand from retail 
                  and consumer goods was reported, while manufacturing demand 
                  continues its flat-to-negative trend of recent years. Most contacts 
                  anticipate at least limited growth over the next months, though 
                  capital expenditures will generally be targeted toward replacing 
                  current vehicle stock rather than increasing capacity. The electricity 
                  problems delayed some shipments, but due to available capacity 
                  the backlog was alleviated within twenty-four hours. Some likened 
                  it to a one-day snowstorm.
                   <p>
                    <strong>
                     Banking
                    </strong>
                    <br/>
                    Both commercial and consumer loan activity remained steady or 
                  increased since the last report. Most contacts reported increased 
                  demand for commercial loans relative to both June and the same 
                  period last year. Consumer loan activity remained strong because 
                  of mortgage refinancing. There was no change in the number of 
                  applicants, and reports on the credit quality of applicants 
                  were mixed. There were also mixed reports regarding core deposits, 
                  with contacts reporting both slight increases and decreases. 
                  Business and mortgage loan delinquencies increased during this 
                  time period for most contacts. The squeeze on net interest margins 
                  continued into this report, as loan rates have adjusted downward 
                  and funding rates remained relatively constant. Contacts observed 
                  that business confidence has improved, evidenced by interest 
                  in borrowing for new capital expenditures, while general consumer 
                  confidence has not changed.

                     During the blackout, many banks lost ATMs and 
                  some branches closed, though it was toward the end of the business 
                  day, and most areas had power restored by the following morning 
                  for business.
