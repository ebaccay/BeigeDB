     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity rose at a steady pace in late 
April and May, and contacts were optimistic about future business 
conditions. Orders for nearly all manufactured products increased. 
The most notable exception was orders for semiconductors which 
continued to plunge, driven by lower-than-expected computer sales. 
Construction activity remained strong, boosting demand for most 
construction-related products. The financial services industry held 
steady, and retail sales improved slightly. Energy activity 
strengthened despite lower oil prices than reported in the last 
survey. Drought continued to hamper the agricultural sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents in several industries noted rising price pressures. 
Prices were up for paper. brick, steel, cement, lumber and some 
chemicals, and prices stabilized for corrugated box liner after 
falling in previous months. In contrast, prices for semiconductors 
continued to fall. Contacts in construction-related industries--
notably steel, brick, cement and glass--expected further price 
increases later in the year due to strong demand and dwindling 
inventories. High demand was reportedly causing rents to rise for 
office and warehouse space. Livestock prices remained low, but food 
processors said high grain prices continue to boost costs. In the 
energy industry, oil prices fell to near $20 per barrel after news 
of pending Iraqi sales of $1 billion per quarter, however, gasoline 
and natural gas prices are expected to remain strong through the 
summer. Reports of wage pressures were minimal, except for a few 
respondents who were concerned about rising costs associated with a 
higher minimum wage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing orders rose steadily over the past six weeks. The most 
notable exception was semiconductor orders which continued to 
plunge. Contacts in the semiconductor industry said demand was down 
for all types of semiconductors, not just DRAMs as noted in previous 
reports, and inventories were rising. The weakness was attributed to 
slower-than-expected demand for computers and computer-related 
products. Contacts in the electronics industry were more pessimistic 
in their outlooks and did not expect orders to bottom out for 
another three to six months. On a more positive note, demand 
increased for most construction-related products. Respondents said 
an increase in brick orders had reduced inventories, and cement 
shortages were reportedly worsening due to a pickup in commercial
and residential construction. Strong construction activity also 
boosted demand for glass, steel and other metal products, and 
inventories were on the small side. Contacts in the paper industry 
said demand for several products, including corrugated box liners 
and recycled paper, had bottomed out after falling for the past 
three months. Apparel manufacturers noted somewhat stronger demand 
due to an improving retail environment, and several had increased 
hiring recently. The Gulf Coast petrochemical market continued to 
improve, with good domestic demand, although profits have been 
pressured by higher costs of oil and natural gas feedstocks. Oil 
field machinery companies reported improving demand, driven by 
strong international and offshore drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail and Auto Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales improved in May, thanks in large part to an increase in 
demand for women's apparel. Sales of lawn and garden materials were 
also strong according to respondents. Most contacts reported no 
inventory problems, but some retailers were letting their 
inventories thin by not adjusting to the recent increase in demand. 
Sales along the Texas-Mexico border continued to improve slowly. 
Auto sales remained brisk in late April and May, and several 
contacts said inventories were dwindling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the financial services industry reported steady loan 
demand over the past six weeks. The only exception was residential 
refinancings which continued to fall. Contacts said demand for 
consumer and commercial real estate loans remained at good levels. 
District lenders expect loan demand to remain steady over the next 
three to twelve months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity continued to rise, according 
to respondents. Homebuilders reported strong demand for new homes 
despite higher mortgage rates, and sales of existing homes were also 
brisk. Although apartment leasing remained strong, new completions 
caused some developers to make concessions, such as a free month's 
rent, in order to attract tenants. While downtown areas still have 
excess office space, contacts said suburban markets are the tightest 
they have been in over a decade and rents are rising as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite slipping oil prices, energy industry activity improved over 
the past six weeks, according to contacts. Demand for oil services 
was driven by strong international, offshore and domestic drilling 
activity. Natural gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has virtually 
squeezed out oil drilling as producers seek to take advantage of 
expected high natural gas prices through the summer months. The 
global offshore market, including the Gulf of Mexico, is rig-
constrained with significant investment necessary to bring more 
equipment on line.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought continues to impede agricultural production. Contacts rated 
crop conditions as mostly good to fair, although Texas winter wheat 
producers expect to harvest 27 percent less than both the 1995 crop 
and 1994 crop. Range and pasture conditions were rated as fair to 
very poor across the state, and livestock operators continue to 
downsize their herds in response to weak prices and high feed costs.
