      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       April 21, 2004
      </b>
      <p>
       Business conditions continued to improve in the Fourth District, 
              and the pace of improvement appears to have accelerated in recent 
              weeks. More manufacturers reported expanded production in the last 
              several weeks than earlier in the year, and most expect growth to 
              continue in the months ahead. Steel producers continued to see strong 
              demand. Retailers reported improved sales this spring. In the construction 
              industry, residential builders continued to report strong sales, 
              and conditions for commercial contractors appear to have improved 
              in some areas of the District. District banks reported rising commercial 
              loan demand and falling delinquency rates. Finally, shipping firms 
              reported that activity continues to expand, at year-over-year rates 
              on the order of 10 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite these signs of improvement in the economic

environment, the hiring plans of most firms remain modest. Reports of rising

input prices that began earlier in the year became more widespread in recent

weeks, and firms indicated that they have been more successful at passing these

input-cost increases along to their end consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing
       </b>
       <br/>
       For

February and March 2004, a majority of manufacturers reported increases in

month-over-month production levels. Domestic steel producers again reported

robust orders in recent weeks, and many steel mills are said to be running at

or close to capacity. Those firms that did not report an increase in

production said that production levels stayed steady in the last eight weeks.

This follows reports from earlier in the year in which production levels were

characterized as flat for the majority of manufacturers over the first few

weeks of 2004. More than half of those surveyed reported higher production

levels than at this time last year. Most manufacturing firms expect modest

growth in the months ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers' inventories remained at acceptable levels in

recent weeks according to most contacts. However, some steel buying is said to

be to supplement low levels of inventoried steel, as concerns about the

availability of steel supplies intensify and production lead-times remain long.

Manufacturers reported limited additions to their payrolls in the last several

weeks. Nearly all manufacturers who sought new hires reported being able to

find workers without difficulty and at no significant increase in wages. Any

concerns about labor costs related mainly to rising health care and other

benefits costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rising materials costs, however, were a common theme from

many manufacturing contacts, though these reports were more widespread among

durable-goods producers. Prices reportedly rose in recent weeks for petroleum-based

products and items such as steel and aluminum. Prices for both flat-rolled and

structural steel have continued to rise in recent weeks. And as shortages

persist, prices for scrap steel are still about twice what they were a year

ago, though some reports suggested that these prices may have peaked in March.

Several firms indicated that they had successfully raised their prices to

compensate for these input-cost increases and indicated their intention to

continue raising prices in order to offset additional increases in input costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Retail Sales
       </b>
       <br/>
       District

retailers reported that sales strengthened in recent weeks. Contacts

attributed the improvement to strengthening consumer sentiment. Discount and

department stores in the District reported that sales had increased from a year

ago. This marks a departure for department stores, which had consistently

reported sluggish sales in previous reports. Contacts at both discount and

department stores anticipate that sales will continue to improve in the weeks

ahead. Sales growth at specialty retailers was more varied: Apparel and

personal care products reportedly sold well in recent weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some retailers noted that merchandise is being marked down

less and promotions are being offered less often, while firms are said to be

spending more on advertising. Contacts continued to characterize inventories

as mostly flat on a year-over-year basis. There were no reports of significant

wage changes; however, contacts continued to report rising health care costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pace of automobile sales has risen slightly since the

beginning of the year. Contacts attributed the improvement in part to the poor

weather that persisted earlier this year. Nevertheless, sales in March were

said to be similar to those from this time a year ago. Inventory levels

reportedly remain high. Used car sales are said to be steady.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Construction
       </b>
       <br/>
       Residential

builders reported that sales rose in recent weeks, though some of this was

attributed to seasonality. Several builders reported that starter homes

continue to sell well. Sales growth so far in 2004 remains on a par with the

pace of sales seen in 2003. However, rising materials costs remain a concern

for many homebuilders; prices for lumber, plywood, drywall, and steel have

reportedly risen significantly recently. Homebuilders have been able to offset

these input-cost increases to a considerable extent by raising the prices to

their customers, but are becoming concerned about additional cost increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       For

commercial builders, conditions appear to be improving in some areas of the

District. Reports suggested that sales may be reviving in the Cleveland and Pittsburgh markets after a period of prolonged weakness. District-wide,

however, conditions remain rather weak. Some contacts expect the

economic environment to improve in the months ahead, reporting renewed customer

interest. Of concern, however, are rising materials

costs, particularly for steel-related products. Commercial builders have been

less successful than homebuilders at passing input-cost increases along to

their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Banking
       </b>
       <br/>
       Commercial loan demand reportedly increased in March from the levels that

prevailed earlier in the year. Real estate lending has been particularly

strong recently. Consumer loan demand, by contrast, has been largely flat in

the last two months. However, mortgage originations and refinancings are said

to have revived recently. Core deposit growth was reportedly flat in recent

weeks. Several institutions indicated that holdings in their most liquid

instruments, such as savings and checking accounts, were increasing, while

their certificate-of-deposit balances were declining because of low rates of

return. Many contacts noted that delinquencies have declined in the past two

months and are lower than in the first quarter of 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trucking and Shipping
       </b>
       <br/>
       Trucking and shipping firms reported an increase in activity in 
              recent weeks, continuing the upward trend from earlier in the year. 
              Many contacts reported an increase in activity on the order of 10 
              percent relative to this time a year ago. Several firms reported 
              that they are running their fleets near capacity. Firms are attempting 
              to hire additional drivers, but it is reported that finding qualified 
              drivers is difficult, and retaining drivers is difficult as well. 
              Some carriers have changed operational procedures to try to offset 
              increased costs stemming from the revised hours-of-service regulations 
              that took effect in January. Firms are also replacing trucks in 
              their fleets, partly in anticipation of scheduled changes in emissions 
              standards. Rising fuel costs are a concern to many carriers, but 
              firms have generally been able to pass along these increased costs 
              to customers through surcharges.
