      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts, the Southeast economy grew at a moderate pace 
in November. After recording disappointing results in October, 
retailers reported significant improvement in sales in November. 
They also indicated that the holiday shopping season got off to a 
good start over the Thanksgiving weekend, with a majority reporting 
healthy year-over-year sales increases. Reports on industrial 
production were mixed, with several manufacturers reporting a 
substantial decline in new orders. Tourism and business travel were 
said to be strong in all District states. While construction and 
sales of single-family homes have slowed seasonally, realtors 
indicated that these markets have been more active than is generally 
the case for this time of year. Commercial and multifamily 
construction continue at a strong pace, with reports of speculative 
building becoming more numerous. Bankers said that loan demand 
remains good overall, although commercial lending has been much 
stronger than consumer lending. Most contacts reported only modest 
wage and price pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After recording disappointing sales results in October, most 
District retailers said that sales improved significantly in 
November. A majority of retailers contacted after the Thanksgiving 
holiday weekend said that sales generally had met or exceeded their 
expectations. Retailers in Georgia and Tennessee reported the most 
positive weekend results, while contacts in Florida were somewhat 
disappointed with their showing. However, retailers throughout the 
District remain optimistic that holiday sales will be relatively 
good this year, with healthy year-over-year growth. The best selling 
items were reported to be electronics and other household durables 
while apparel products made an unexpectedly strong showing in most 
of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although a majority of manufacturing firms contacted reported 
increases in production in November, most also saw a slowing in new 
orders, even in sectors that previously had recorded strong growth. 
In general, fewer contacts than before indicated that they had 
increased their factory payrolls since the last Beigebook and most 
were less optimistic concerning their future hiring plans. More 
positively, however, several companies recently have announced plans 
to expand their operations in the District. In Alabama, several 
firms indicated that they would be locating new manufacturing plants 
in the state in order to supply the new Mercedes Benz assembly 
plant. Contacts in the printing and publishing industry say that 
their operations in the Nashville area continue to do well, while 
building suppliers reported a boost in activity related to the 
hurricane Opal rebuilding effort.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism and business travel remain a bright spat in the District 
economy. According to tourism officials, the number of foreign and 
domestic visitors to south Florida has rebounded significantly from 
last year's disappointing levels. Hotel owners in central Florida 
reported good occupancy rates despite the addition of a large number 
of new rooms over the last year. Florida tourism officials are 
optimistic that hurricane damaged beach properties in the Florida 
Panhandle will be ready to accommodate both the snowbirds who will 
arrive in January and February and the collegiate spring break crowd 
in March and April. Tourism associated with the gaming industry in 
western Louisiana and along the Mississippi Gulf Coat continues to 
do quite well, although disappointing gambling revenues were said to 
be a factor in the recent closing of New Orleans' land based casino.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several real estate contacts noted that while sales and new 
construction slowed seasonally, they have been better than generally 
is expected at this time of the year. Inventories of new and 
existing homes for sale were reported to be tight, particularly at 
the low end of the market. In some areas, this lack of supply has 
begun to drive home prices higher, although prices generally remain 
stable in most of the District. Both realtors and builders are 
optimistic that local real estate market conditions will remain 
favorable, and most anticipate that sales and construction in the 
first half of 1996 will exceed year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts from across the 
District characterized their markets as strong. Low vacancy rates 
and higher rents have spurred new apartment and office development 
in many local markets. While most office and retail projects 
continue to be build-to-suit, contacts also noted that a number of 
speculative projects have gotten underway in recent months. Real 
estate professionals remain optimistic about the prospects for each 
of these markets, and most anticipate that the pace of new 
construction of both commercial and multifamily projects will be 
strong through much of 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of bankers contacted in November characterized overall 
loan demand as good. Commercial lending continues to be stronger 
than consumer lending in most areas. Bankers noted that consumer 
lending generally has been flat, except for a few pockets of 
strength. Most contacts reported that auto lending remains weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In parts of the District that previously had reported increased wage 
pressures due to tight labor market conditions, contacts reported 
that pressures have begun to subside. Manufacturers generally 
reported that commodity price pressures also have eased, although 
some producers indicated that they expect to see renewed materials 
price increases in the next few months.
