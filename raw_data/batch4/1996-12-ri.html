     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifth District economic

activity expanded at a slightly faster rate

in the last six weeks, although the retail

and housing sectors showed signs of

slower growth.  Manufacturing shipments

expanded somewhat faster, and the service

sector grew more quickly.  Tourism

improved, spurred largely by a recovery in

the coastal areas.  Loan activity edged up,

and state tax revenues accelerated

modestly.  Tight labor markets and wage

pressures persisted, but contacts noted

only modest price pressures.  The

commercial real estate market continued

to strengthen at a healthy pace, and fall

harvesting and planting activity picked up

in agriculture.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The pace of activity in the retail

sector moderated in October.  District

retailers reported that sales grew more

slowly and that shopper traffic and big-ticket

 sales declined.  Employment fell

slightly, but wage growth accelerated.

Retailers continued to indicate that the

federal minimum wage increase was

leading them to reduce their workforce.

Respondents noted that retail prices rose

more slowly in October.  Contacts

continued to expect slightly higher prices

and modestly lower demand for their

products over the next six months.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Service sector activity

expanded at a faster rate in October as

revenues, average wages, and employment

grew more rapidly than in September.

Several contacts to a survey noted that the

minimum wage hike would cause them to

trim employment in coming months.

Service prices rose more slowly in

October, and respondents expected larger

price increases and greater product

demand over the next six months.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Growth in the

manufacturing sector increased slightly in

October.  Respondents to a survey

indicated that, compared to September,

shipments edged higher and new orders strengthened

somewhat.  Employment growth changed

little, and contacts indicated that labor

shortages were somewhat more

widespread.  Several firms reported that

they had difficulty finding workers to

replace those lost through normal attrition.

Manufacturers indicated that prices for

finished goods and raw materials grew at

slightly faster rates than in September.

However, some textile and primary metal

manufacturers reported that foreign

competition, aided by a strong dollar,

caused them to lower their prices.

Respondents continued to expect finished

goods and raw materials prices to rise

slightly during the next six months.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Tourism
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Tourist activity rebounded in

coastal areas, and continued to show

strength at mountain resorts in October.  A

Virginia Beach hotelier noted that his

business improved from last year, when

federal furloughs hampered tourism.  A

respondent from a popular mountain

resort in Virginia stated that tourist

spending in October surpassed the levels of

previous years and remained strong

during early November.  Contacts reported

that fall bookings were about the same as

those of last year.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Port Activity
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Representatives at District

ports indicated that import and export

levels were higher in October than in

September.  Most port contacts expected

import levels to rise during the next six

months, but expected little change in

exports.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Temporary Employment
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Reports of strong

demand for contingent workers persisted,

and agencies indicated that employers

were now seeking workers across a

broader range of job categories and skill

levels.  Contacts to a phone survey noted

that wage pressures were more

pronounced than in September.

Respondents indicated that it had become

increasingly difficult to find "decent" help,

even with offers of higher wages.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Finance
             </strong>
             <br/>
             District banks reported steady

consumer lending and modest gains in

commercial and mortgage lending.  An

increase in company acquisitions pushed

commercial loan demand higher.  Lower

interest rates led many borrowers to

refinance their home loans.  Several

contacts attributed the increase in

refinancings to homeowners switching

from adjustable-rate to fixed-rate

mortgages.  One respondent reported that

fixed-rate mortgages now represented

three-quarters of his lending activity--up

from one half.  Lenders faced increased

nonbank competition for consumer

financing; one respondent said that she

couldn't match the low interest rates

offered by auto dealers.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Residential Real Estate
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Residential real estate

activity fell slightly during October and

early November.  Customer traffic, as well

as home sales and prices, declined; housing

starts and permits were steady.  Many

contacts across the District reported that

lumber prices soared.  Some builders in

competitive markets like the Washington,

D.C., suburbs reported that these higher

prices squeezed their profit margins.  In

less competitive areas such as

Charlottesville, Va., builders indicated that

they were able to pass the price increases

through to homebuyers.  Builders

continued to report skilled-labor shortages.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Commercial Real Estate
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Commercial real

estate activity accelerated in recent weeks.

Office, industrial, and retail leasing

activity remained at a high level, except in

North Carolina, where activity escalated.

One commercial leasing agent there

reported that business was "incredible."

Commercial vacancy rates declined

further, and rents rose throughout most of

the District.  The availability of prime

office space continued to tighten.  Many

contacts reported increases in speculative

office construction in their areas.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 State Revenues
                </strong>
                <br/>
                State tax collections

generally increased faster in

October than in September.  Individual

estimated payments rose at a faster rate

and real estate recordation tax receipts

increased in all jurisdictions except West

Virginia.  In contrast, sales tax collections

decreased and withholding and corporate

income tax collections grew more slowly.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Agriculture
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 The pace of harvesting and

small grain planting activity picked up

during late October and early November.

In the Carolinas and Maryland, drier

weather allowed farmers to get planting

and harvesting activity back on schedule.

However, in Virginia and West Virginia,

harvesting progress continued to lag

somewhat behind the five-year averages

because of unfavorable weather.
