       Contacts indicate that economic activity in the Eighth District 
                has remained soft in recent weeks. In manufacturing, there are 
                continued reports of plant closings, layoffs, and cutbacks. Retailers 
                report that sales were relatively flat compared with last year 
                and attribute sluggish consumer spending to colder weather and 
                a late Easter, but some are optimistic about spring sales. Home 
                sales are still up in most of the District, while commercial real 
                estate markets continue to be sluggish. Total loan demand at small 
                and mid-sized District banks has weakened throughout the first 
                quarter of 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A broad-based recovery of the Eighth District manufacturing sector 
                continues to be problematic as new reports of plant closings, 
                cutbacks, and layoffs remain commonplace. Manufacturers in the 
                electrical, furniture, wire and cable, paper, health-care, trucking, 
                food, and tool industries are among those who have recently announced 
                plant closings and layoffs. Contacts note that problems faced 
                by the manufacturing sector continue to include low orders and 
                profits, increased international competition, high operating costs, 
                and a weak economy. Despite the reports of cutbacks, however, 
                a few firms plan to move to or expand within the District, including 
                some in the auto parts industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       General retail sales in the District were mostly flat in March 
                compared with 2002 levels. Some contacts note that colder weather 
                and a late Easter are to blame. Several are optimistic about spring 
                sales. Auto dealers report that, while March sales were an improvement 
                from February, they were still down from March 2002 levels, despite 
                the continuation of aggressive incentives. Contacts in the trucking 
                industry note that profits shrank because of March's increase 
                in fuel prices. To reduce costs, the airline industry has announced 
                more cutbacks, which will affect employment in the District.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Home sales are still doing well in most of the District. The Memphis 
                area saw an increase in total home sales of about 13 percent in 
                February 2003 compared with February 2002. Similarly, northern 
                Kentucky saw an increase of 26 percent. Contacts in St. Louis 
                and northwest Arkansas reported that home sales were still strong 
                in January. February year-to-date permit levels were lower in 
                most of the District's metropolitan areas. Contacts in Memphis 
                expect this to be a great year for residential construction. Residential 
                construction has remained steady in Louisville, and housing starts 
                are still doing well for first-time homebuyers in the $100,000-$150,000 
                range. In the St. Louis area, year-to-date single-family housing 
                permits were down 6 percent compared with the same period last 
                year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate markets are still sluggish in most of 
                the District. Contacts reported an increase in vacancy rates in 
                the office and industrial markets in downtown St. Louis for the 
                fourth quarter of 2002. Office vacancy rates also continued to 
                increase in Louisville. A recovery in the Memphis area office 
                market is not expected until mid-year 2003. Commercial construction 
                is still slow in most areas. Contacts in Pine Bluff reported that 
                several projects are in process at area colleges but that the 
                prognosis for future funding is bleak. Commercial construction 
                is lagging in Memphis, while there has been an increase in small 
                construction projects in central Kentucky.

        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District 
                banks were down 0.59 percent between early January and early April. 
                This decline stemmed mostly from loans to individuals, which were 
                down 2.3 percent over the same period. Commercial and industrial 
                loans increased 2.6 percent, but real estate loans decreased 0.2 
                percent. At the same time, total deposits at these banks were 
                up by 2.1 percent.

       Most farmers have begun preparing land for planting, while some 
                have planted already. The most progress has been with corn in 
                Arkansas, Mississippi, and southeastern Missouri, where farmers 
                have planted between 57 percent and 70 percent of their corn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Planting intentions for soybeans and wheat declined on average, 
                while prospective corn, cotton, and sorghum plantings increased. 
                In Mississippi, Kentucky, and Arkansas, farmers planted between 
                13 percent and 40 percent less winter wheat in 2002 to 2003 than 
                in 2001 to 2002. Contacts say that this decline is due to wet 
                fall weather that inhibited planting. In Illinois and Indiana, 
                wheat plantings increased 18 percent and 29 percent, respectively, 
                possibly marking the beginning of a turnaround from declining 
                plantings since 1996. Farmers who were unable to plant wheat in 
                the fall may well plant other crops this spring; corn planting 
                intentions increased by 8 percent on average, while prospective 
                cotton and sorghum plantings increased 7 percent and 9 percent 
                respectively.
