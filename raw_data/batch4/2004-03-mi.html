      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       March 3, 2004
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      From early January through late February the overall Ninth District economy showed firm growth. Residential real estate, manufacturing, consumer spending, mining and tourism were up, while commercial real estate, energy and agriculture were mixed. District employment grew slightly. Wage and price increases were generally modest; however, significant price increases were noted in steel, health insurance and home heating.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction activity was mixed. In Duluth, Minn., a 
              property listing service representative said the office market has 
              recently stabilized after office vacancy rates increased to 17 percent. 
              In contrast, a representative of an economic development office 
              in the Eau Claire, Wis., area noted that there wasn't a lot of open 
              office space. According to a report by a commercial real estate 
              firm, industrial development activity is expected to be somewhat 
              slow in 2004, while retail building is expected to be active for 
              the Minneapolis-St. Paul area; however, development won't be as 
              strong as in 2003.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing permit activity was strong, but sales slowed. A representative 
              of a contractors association in Montana reported that residential 
              building remains healthy, especially high-end homes in resort areas. 
              Permits for new housing construction in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
              area were up 15 percent in January compared with a year ago, but 
              recent construction slowed due to cold and snowy weather. The number 
              of closed home sales was down 20 percent in January in the Minneapolis-St. 
              Paul area, with the median price 5 percent greater than in January 
              2003.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall consumer spending grew moderately. A major Minneapolis-based 
              retailer reported same-store sales during January were 5 percent 
              higher than a year ago, while February sales were at the high end 
              of plans. A mall manager in the Minneapolis area reported solid 
              traffic during January and early February, with particularly strong 
              traffic on Valentine's Day weekend. Retail sales were strong during 
              January and early February at a mall in North Dakota, including 
              a 14 percent increase the week of Valentine's Day compared with 
              last year. Traffic at a Montana mall was up 7 percent in January 
              and 4 percent for the first part of February compared with last 
              year, according to the mall manager.
     </p>
     <p>
      Traffic and sales were noticeably down at Minnesota auto dealerships 
              in January and early February compared with last year, according 
              to a representative of a car dealers association.
     </p>
     <p>
      Substantial snowfall in late January and early February boosted 
              winter tourism activity in many parts of the district. A Minnesota 
              ski hill reported near capacity ski crowds in early February. Mountain 
              snow packs through January were 30 percent to 40 percent deeper 
              than last year in Montana; one large resort reported skier numbers 
              up 10 percent. However, a tourism official in the Upper Peninsula, 
              which often reaps the benefit of being one of the few areas with 
              snow, reported that recent activity was slower than last year because 
              most Midwest areas have snow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity increased. Preliminary results from a survey 
              of district manufacturers conducted in late January and early February 
              by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department 
              of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) revealed that businesses 
              expect production, productivity and profits to increase in the first 
              half of 2004 from a solid second half of 2003. In addition, a January 
              survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) 
              indicated overall improved manufacturing activity in the Dakotas 
              and Minnesota. Two meat processors in Minnesota plan to expand plants. 
              A construction equipment manufacturer noted that recent strong orders 
              are putting pressure on production capacity. A lumber mill plans 
              to add a facility in western Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy sector was mixed, and the mining sector grew. 
              Mid-February district oil and natural gas exploration amounts decreased 
              slightly from early January levels; however, a refinery in Minnesota 
              plans to spend $325 million to $400 million for upgrades. Most major 
              district operating iron ore mines continue to produce at capacity, 
              and prices for taconite are up significantly. In Montana, a mining 
              official noted steady activities with several mining companies planning 
              expansions or "kicking the tires" of potential sites. Prices remain 
              strong for many metals and minerals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural activity was mixed. Results of the Minneapolis Fed's 
              Survey of Agricultural Credit Conditions revealed that a third of 
              lenders expect above average farm income during the first quarter 
              of 2004 compared with 20 percent that expect below average income. 
              Grain and soybean prices remained strong while beef prices stabilized. 
              However, the number of cattle on feed dropped for many district 
              states. The discovery of avian flu in some U.S. flocks caused several 
              countries to close their borders to imported poultry, which brought 
              some distress to district turkey producers. Meanwhile, several snowstorms 
              across the district eased drought conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District employment increased slightly. Increases in employment 
              include 60 job openings at a mine and 90 new positions at a state 
              university in Montana. A Montana bank director noted a tight labor 
              pool for entry-level positions. In Minnesota, a pork processing 
              plant plans to hire at least 300 more employees over the next four 
              years, and an insurance and benefits group recently announced plans 
              to add 100 employees in the state. A Minnesota director reported 
              a significant pick up in recruitment of information technology professionals 
              in all sectors. Preliminary results of the survey of district manufacturers 
              conducted by the Minneapolis Fed and DEED showed that 28 percent 
              of respondents expect to increase employment over the next six months; 
              14 percent expect to decrease staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to a recent survey of Minnesota businesses across industry sectors conducted by DEED, 82 percent of respondents expect employment to remain the same for the first half of 2004, while 13 percent expect to hire new workers. An informal survey of businesses in southwestern Minnesota during early February showed that two-thirds of respondents expect flat employment while the remaining third expect modest increases in staff levels. Employment reductions include over 120 employees recently laid off at a bus assembly plant in North Dakota. A Minnesota-based retailer will eliminate 70 positions at its headquarters and distribution centers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increases in wages were moderate. Recent wage increases have generally stayed within 2 percent to 3 percent, according to a bank director. Labor representatives in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area noted that health care benefits are the top issue in collective bargaining talks.
     </p>
     <p>
      While overall price increases were modest, significant increases were reported in steel, health insurance and home heating. According to preliminary results of the survey of district manufacturers, 31 percent of respondents expect to increase prices, and 10 percent expect to decrease prices. A steep hike in some steel prices was noted, including a 30 percent climb in steel wire and tubing. A bank director noted that health insurance rate increases remained in the double digits. Prices for heating homes in the Upper Peninsula were reported as high as 50 percent above year-ago levels.
