       Economic activity in the Fifth District grew modestly in January and the first 

  three weeks of February, with a slight improvement in services and manufacturing 

  conditions offsetting a listless retail sector. Services businesses reported 

  generally steady to slightly higher demand, and some contacts cited higher orders 

  for coming months. District manufacturing activity expanded somewhat faster, 

  as shipments and new orders rose sharply in January and early February. In contrast, 

  retail sales were little changed from our previous report, and retailers continued 

  to trim payrolls. Price inflation remained modest according to contacts. In 

  the real estate sector, District home sales rose at a solid rate, but commercial 

  leasing activity slowed as war prospects unsettled potential lessees. In agriculture, 

  unusually cold and snowy weather hampered field preparation and led to the abandonment 

  of still-unharvested crops in some areas of the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District retailers reported generally flat sales over the past six weeks. A 

  major winter storm over the Presidents Day weekend led many District businesses 

  to close for a day, and lingering snow curtailed sales. According to a department 

  store manager in Annapolis, Md., sales growth and customer traffic there had 

  been unchanged in recent weeks. And in Richmond, Va., where the winter storm 

  closed several malls, a contact said that store sales were off but that some 

  of the slack might have been made up through increased Internet sales. A manager 

  at a builders supply store told us even though customer traffic was lower because 

  of the recent storm, his store experienced a run on duct tape and other items 

  recommended for use in the event of domestic terrorism. In Virginia Beach, Va., 

  retailers reported a slight decrease in customer traffic as military deployments 

  continued in that area. Car dealers in Washington, D.C., and Charleston, W.Va., 

  said business was very slow, with manufacturers incentives shoring up sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most services businesses said customer demand was steady to slightly higher 

  in January through late February, but firms that do business with the federal 

  government reported decreased revenues. A contact at a financial services firm 

  in Baltimore, Md., said business was stable and that there was less of a "negative 

  feel" in the local economy. In West Virginia, a caterer said her bookings had 

  been slow the past few weeks but noted that her calendar for late spring and 

  summer was filling. Most firms indicated that their employment levels have been 

  steady. An executive search firm in the District of Columbia said they have 

  had to "market a little harder," and a health club also in District of Columbia, 

  said they were seeing more clients. An engineering firm in Charlotte, N.C., 

  reported a shortage of qualified, licensed engineers in the area but a glut 

  of business managers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity strengthened in January and early February. 

  Shipments and new orders rose sharply at District factories, led by a pickup 

  in the chemicals, paper, and textiles industries. A textiles manufacturer in 

  North Carolina told us that aggressive price reductions were enabling his company 

  to gain market share. Furniture manufacturers noted that sales were strong in 

  early January, although inclement weather later in the month tempered growth. 

  Despite the recent uptick in demand, a number of manufacturers expressed concerns 

  about rising oil prices and the possibility of war. A producer of plastic products 

  in North Carolina told us, "Things are very uncertain now; business isn't getting 

  any worse, but there will likely be no sign of a real pickup in activity until 

  the Iraq situation is cleared up." A tire manufacturer in Virginia noted that 

  70 percent of his firm's raw materials were derived from oil. He said that the 

  rising costs of oil and natural gas were pushing up the prices of raw materials 

  but that he could not pass the higher costs through to his customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts at District financial institutions said that loan demand changed little 

  in January and February. Commercial lending remained weak, in part because of 

  the uncertainty over Iraq, but there were some encouraging signs that demand 

  for commercial loans may be ticking up. A banker in Charlottesville, Va., said 

  that he had made a few more business loans in recent weeks and noted that some 

  of his clients were beginning to expand business. In contrast, a lender in Richmond, 

  Va., reported that commercial lending was "no better, no worse" than it was 

  late last year and that her clients were "doing well to just keep from losing 

  business." Residential mortgage lending remained strong as mortgage rates drifted 

  lower, and most contacts said that the growth in mortgage lending matched December's 

  pace. Residential refinancing continued strong, accounting for 60 percent to 

  75 percent of home mortgage lending in many cases. A mortgage lender in Richmond, 

  Va., said that interest in refinancing was still strong, observing that "every 

  1/8 percent to 1/4 percent drop in mortgage rates brings in new people."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential realtors generally reported that home sales were solid in January 

  and February. An agent in Greenville, S.C., said local sales were the best he 

  had seen in forty years. He commented that sales were so good he was afraid 

  to say too much "for fear of jinxing them." A realtor in Odenton, Md., also 

  reported strong sales in January, adding that properties put on the market in 

  her area did not last long. In Richmond, Va., an agent said that the remarkable 

  string of monthly sales advances in that area remained intact. In a less rosy 

  assessment, real estate agents in the District of Columbia said sales had been 

  somewhat slower in recent weeks--in part because of inclement weather in the 

  region. Across the District, homes in the low-to-middle price range were selling 

  best, but a few realtors said that interest in higher price homes was picking 

  up. Home prices were reported to be rising modestly in most locations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial realtors reported slower growth in leasing activity in recent weeks 

  as potential lessees in the office sector adopted a "wait and see" attitude 

  in light of political developments internationally. A realtor in Raleigh, N.C., 

  captured the mood of many with the observation that "people are just waiting 

  on the sidelines." The leasing of retail space picked up--a realtor in Richmond, 

  Va., for example, experienced "very high" growth over the past six weeks in 

  retail leasing. But office and industrial space leasing was sluggish. Vacancy 

  rates for retail space remained low, while office vacancy rates edged higher. 

  Rents for retail space held firm, but edged lower for office space. Realtors 

  in Washington, D.C. and Charlotte, N.C., noted that some tenants had recently 

  renegotiated their leases, obtaining lower rents and other concessions. New 

  commercial construction was generally flat across sectors--several realtors 

  in the Carolinas reported a shift to refurbishing older buildings in lieu of 

  building new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Tourist activity strengthened since our last report. Contacts at several District 

  ski resorts told us that abundant snow in February rejuvenated interest in skiing. 

  They noted that bookings over the Presidents Day weekend were much higher than 

  last year and predicted that the ski season would be extended through late March. 

  Coastal tourism was also reported to be stronger. A contact from Myrtle Beach, 

  S.C., said that Presidents Day weekend had been extremely busy, adding that 

  it was difficult to get into a local restaurant without a reservation. Looking 

  ahead, contacts expressed concern that rising gas prices and continued talk 

  of war could hamper the spring tourist season.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Temporary Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts at District temporary employment agencies reported lukewarm demand 

  for workers in recent weeks. An agent in Washington, D.C., reported that he 

  had expected a better start to the new year but said, " Business is still very 

  soft, and demand for extra workers is slower than expected." While overall demand 

  for temporary workers was flat, continued strong residential mortgage lending 

  resulted in higher demand for temporary workers in that sector. In addition, 

  there were scattered reports of a pickup in hiring in manufacturing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Frigid weather in January and heavy snowfall in early February impeded field 

  preparation and limited late small-grain plantings in much of the District. 

  Farmers in Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia abandoned some remaining corn 

  and soybean fields in January because of the cold weather and anticipated poor 

  yields. The cold weather also curtailed development of pastures and winter grazing 

  crops--farmers were feeding livestock full time and trying to stretch hay supplies. 

  Although some areas in South Carolina continued to experience moderate drought 

  conditions, contacts in most areas of the state reported that small-grain crops 

  were in good condition.
