      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 7, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district economy continued to grow at a moderate pace 
during the past month. Retail sales increased modestly, 
manufacturing and construction activity remained strong, and 
activity in the energy industry picked up. In the farm economy, 
however, continued financial losses in the cattle industry held down 
farm income, despite strong crop prices. Labor markets stayed tight 
for both entry-level and skilled workers, although reports of rising 
wages remained widely scattered. Overall retail prices were steady, 
even though prices rose for some materials used in manufacturing and 
construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report sales improved modestly during the 
past month and remained above last year's level. Sales of apparel 
were strong, while sales of appliances and other electronic products 
were weak. Retailers generally expect sales to remain strong the 
next couple of months before slowing somewhat near the end of the 
year. Although most retailers were satisfied with their current 
inventory levels, some were trimming inventories. Automobile dealers 
report increased sales last month that stayed well above last year's 
level. Sales are expected to remain strong in the months ahead. 
Dealers indicate automobile inventories were generally smaller than 
desired, due to the transition to the new model year and to 
continued strong demand for light trucks and sport utility vehicles. 
While dealers report that high consumer debt has lowered the quality 
of applications for automobile loans, they indicate that overall 
credit quality appeared stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers continued to operate their plants at 
high levels of capacity use, and some plants report an increase in 
overtime work. None of the manufacturers, however, indicate capacity 
constraints caused production bottlenecks. Manufacturing materials 
were readily available with normal lead times, although some 
manufacturers report temporary difficulty in obtaining steel. 
Manufacturers were generally satisfied with their inventory levels, 
although some were reducing inventories slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most builders report housing starts held steady last month 
but at a much faster pace than last year's. Single-family homes 
accounted for most of the construction activity, although 
construction of multifamily units remained brisk. Builders expect 
construction activity to remain strong through the end of the year. 
Sales of new homes picked up slightly last month and remained well 
above last year's pace, despite a relatively low inventory of unsold 
homes. Prices of new homes held steady, staying somewhat higher than 
last year's level. While building materials were readily available, 
prices rose slightly, especially for lumber and roofing materials. 
Most mortgage lenders expect mortgage demand to remain strong 
through the end of the third quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks generally report total loans grew somewhat faster 
than deposits last month, slightly boosting loan-deposit ratios. 
Most banks report gains in home mortgage and home equity loans. Home 
construction loans, commercial real estate loans, and commercial and 
industrial loans held steady, while consumer and agricultural loans 
declined. Banks also report gains in demand deposits, NOW accounts, 
and MMDAs. Security investments held steady while large CDs, small 
time and savings deposits, and IRA and Keogh accounts declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      All respondent banks held their prime lending rates steady last 
month, although a third of the banks expect to increase their prime 
rate in the near future. Half of the respondents raised their 
consumer lending rates slightly last month, and a few banks expect a 
further increase in the near future. Lending standards were 
unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the district energy industry picked up in June. 
Prices of crude oil and natural gas stayed well above last year's 
level. As a result, the number of drilling rigs operating in the 
district rose 15 percent above last year's level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's winter wheat harvest is nearly complete. 
As expected, wheat yields ranged from normal to poor, due to the 
unusually dry winter and spring in Oklahoma and Kansas. Recent 
rains, however, have brightened prospects for the district's corn 
and soybean crops, which are generally in good to excellent 
condition. While recent improvements in crop growing conditions have 
pushed crop prices down, prices remain much higher than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cattle feedlots and ranches continue to operate at a loss, due to 
high feed costs and weak cattle prices. Agricultural bankers report 
that district feedlots have cut production, with many operating at 
only half to three-fourths of capacity. In addition, ranchers have 
trimmed herds by selling older, less productive cows. Overall, 
little improvement is expected in district farm income this year, as 
continued financial losses in the cattle industry largely offset 
financial gains by crop producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although supplies of both entry-level and skilled 
workers remained tight in much of the district, reports of rising 
wages were widely scattered. Retailers report a tight supply of 
minimum-wage workers, and some retailers believe the recently 
legislated increase in the minimum wage will eventually push up 
retail costs. Manufacturers indicate that most kinds of workers were 
in short supply, including welders, machinists, and clerical 
workers. One manufacturer paid more overtime instead of raising 
wages, and some manufacturers increased wages slightly. Prices rose 
for some manufacturing materials, especially steel, some paper 
materials, and some plastics. Prices generally held steady at the 
retail level, with retailers expecting little change in prices in
the months ahead.
