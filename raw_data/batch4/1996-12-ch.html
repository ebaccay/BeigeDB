      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <center class="style1">
      <p>
       <strong>
        December 4, 1996
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="style1">
       The Seventh District economy, as in our last report, expanded
  
at a moderate rate in October and early November, while price pressures remained largely
  
in check.  Consumer spending appeared to have rebounded from a sluggish September,
  
and regional retailers reported that they were aggressively seeking seasonal workers.
  
Housing activity continued to slow moderately, although most contacts continued to rate
  
the market as strong.  Manufacturers were operating at very high levels and indicators
  
suggest a near-term pickup.  Banking activity remained strong despite some softening in
  
commercial and industrial lending.  Very tight labor markets persisted, while overall job
  
growth in the District lagged that of the nation.
       <p class="style1">
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        While still above year-ago levels, retail sales
  
remained relatively flat in early November, following October?s improvements.  Several
  
large retailers attributed overall sales gains to strength in apparel sales, aided partly by
  
the onset of cold weather.  Home appliance and electronic sales were soft compared to
  
earlier months, but retailers expect a pickup in December.  Inventory levels were
  
considered to be in good to excellent shape by retailers.  Several retailers noted that there
  
will be a big push in promotional activity ahead, mainly because November sales targets
  
will be hard to achieve with Thanksgiving coming so late in the month.  One retailer,
  
trying to maintain market share, reported plans to increase their price-discounting
  
promotions.  Most retailers, however, appeared to be focusing on boosting advertising to
  
attract customers as early in the holiday season as possible.  Retailers contacted remained
  
very optimistic about sales during the holiday selling season (despite fewer shopping
  
days), with Midwest sales expected to outperform other regions of the country.  One
  
major retailer felt that sales for the holiday selling season as a whole would not be
  
affected by the late Thanksgiving because many consumers start their holiday shopping
  
around mid-December.
        <p class="style1">
         <strong>
          Housing/Construction
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Housing activity continued to slow in the District,
  
but most contacts reported that the market remained very strong.  One of the region?s
  
largest realtors reported that October?s existing home sales had decreased from the torrid
  
pace earlier in the year, but it was still their second best October ever.  New home sales
  
also declined in October and early November in most areas but, again, remained at very high
  
levels.  A national survey of home builders suggested that the Midwest?s early November
  
sales continued to decline slightly from the late summer?s weather-delayed gains.
  
Builders noted a sharp drop-off in foot traffic, causing several builders to lower their
  
expectations for the remainder of 1996 as well as the first quarter of 1997.  Among
  
building material suppliers, one major wallboard producer reported that shipments to the
  
Midwest remained very strong, noting that there is about a three-month lag between
  
changes in housing starts and wallboard shipments.  This producer reported that the
  
industry was able to push through a modest price increase in September and has
  
announced another for December.  If it holds up, as the industry expects, it would be the
  
first time in several years that the industry was able to push through an increase this late
  
in the year, a sign which this contact said indicates the strength in the market.  Activity
  
on the commercial side of the real estate market picked up slightly in recent weeks, due
  
in large part to declining interest rates.  One contact also reported that commercial
  
refinancing activity was increasing.
         <p class="style1">
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Despite some disruptions from the auto strikes,
  
manufacturing activity remained strong in October and early November, with some reports
  
suggesting a slight pickup in the pace of expansion.  Several purchasing managers'
  
surveys indicated moderate increases in October and November from already high levels
  
of overall activity in September.  New orders were particularly strong, but inventory
  
building was also evident.  However, prices paid remained relatively flat and, in one area
  
surveyed, delivery times were shortening.  A sharp increase in new orders of heavy-duty
  
trucks was reported by the industry for October, with orders strength continuing into
  
November.  Heavy ordering occurred from the major haulers, something that was absent
  
a year ago due to already huge backlogs at that time.  A producer of heavy construction
  
equipment reported that unit sales for the industry in October were slightly above year-
  
ago levels.  Appliance shipments, which declined in September on a year-over-year basis,
  
rebounded in October and appeared to be holding up in November.  Steel orders into the
  
first quarter are strong, but new capacity coming online (albeit more slowly than the
  
industry expected) is holding down price increases.  Although a slowdown in auto
  
production from the third quarter was widely expected, several auto suppliers reported a
  
drop in their shipments related to auto production cutbacks during the GM strikes.  A
  
major supplier of chemicals noted a plateauing of demand in recent weeks that was at
  
least partly linked to the auto strikes.  Despite solid sales growth so far this year, this
  
producer also reported that they have staunchly resisted price
  
increases from their raw material suppliers.
          <p class="style1">
           <strong>
            Banking
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Lending activity remained strong in October and early
  
November, but growth in most areas of the District has plateaued.  On the commercial
  
side, several large regional banks described loan demand as flat to slightly down.  Most
  
of the recent activity has been driven by mergers and
  
acquisitions, with little currently going to
  
new plant and equipment purchases.
  
However, some increase in inventory
  
financing was also noted.  On the consumer
  
side, lending activity was still increasing,
  
but at a slower pace than two months ago.
  
Several medium-sized banks reported that
  
home equity and home improvement lending
  
was accounting for much of their activity.
  
However, several area bankers cited
  
lengthening terms on auto loans and less
  
equity being put into loan transactions as an
  
indication that consumers were getting
  
stretched out.  A consumer finance
  
institution reported a rise in revolving credit
  
balances, which also was interpreted as a
  
potential sign of an increasingly debt-
  
constrained consumer.  However, this
  
contact emphasized that overall credit
  
quality in the Midwest remained very good.
  
Several financial institutions reported some
  
tightening of standards, but also indicated
  
that much less was required in their
  
Midwest markets.
           <p class="style1">
            <strong>
             Labor Markets
            </strong>
            <br/>
            The District?s labor markets
  
remained very tight in October and early
  
November, with shortages in some sectors
  
becoming particularly acute.  Retailers have
  
been finding it especially difficult to attract
  
holiday help this year.  A recent direct-mail
  
promotion in Michigan advertising a retail
  
"jobs fair" received a minuscule one percent
  
response rate.  Retailers in the state have
  
teamed up with the state employment agency
  
in a promotional effort to recruit seasonal
  
workers.  In addition, a temporary help
  
agency in one of the District?s large metro
  
areas reported that orders were already
  
coming in for tax help (accountants,
  
business analysts, etc.) in mid-November, a
  
month earlier than in past years.  Perhaps
  
because of historically low unemployment
  
rates, most sectors? job growth was well
  
below the national average (retail trades
  
being an exception).  Construction
  
employment remained strong, while home
  
builders in several areas reported that
  
shortages of skilled labor persisted.
  
Manufacturing employment levels
  
continued a pattern of bouncing up and
  
down slightly from month to month, with no
  
trend evident in either direction.  However,
  
a national survey of hiring plans indicated
  
that more manufacturers in the Midwest
  
plan to increase their payrolls in the first
  
quarter of 1997 than was reported a year
  
ago.  A contact at a national temporary help
  
agency reported that margins were being
  
squeezed in the Midwest due to demands for
  
higher wages from workers and lower
  
prices from clients.
