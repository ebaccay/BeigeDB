       Contacts in the Eighth District indicate 
                that the region's economy is showing modest signs of improvement. 
                Favorable reports in the manufacturing and services industries 
                suggest that economic activity increased since the last survey, 
                although announcements of plant closings, downsizing, and layoffs 
                remain. Retail sales increased in September compared with 2002 
                levels, but auto sales declined over the same period. Home sales 
                rose in most of the District in August, while commercial real 
                estate markets remained weak. Loan demand increased over the past 
                three months at a sample of small and mid-sized banks in the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The Eighth District's manufacturing sector appears to be expanding. 
                Reports of plant openings, product-line expansions, increased 
                spending on research and marketing, and new jobs created continued 
                to appear since the last survey. Manufacturers in the automobile 
                and automotive parts, motor, fuel processing, hand tools, sealing 
                products, photography, food, clothing, medical devices, health, 
                and beauty industries were among those who announced such moves. 
                In the services sector, firms in the banking, communications, 
                entertainment, and hotel industries announced improvement in business 
                activity and plans for expansion. Despite the positive outlook, 
                there have also been several announcements of plant closings, 
                downsizing, and layoffs. Affected industries include utilities, 
                electrical transformers, packaging, shipping and transportation, 
                chemicals, hardware, plumbing, brass, steel, fabrics, furniture, 
                food, and airlines. A troubled auto plant has received state aid 
                to limit local job cuts. Firms in the food, health care, and beauty 
                industries recently were granted tax freezes for several years 
                in return for job creation in the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       General retail sales in the District improved 
                slightly in September compared with the same month last year, 
                with several retailers reporting increased in-store traffic. Strong-selling 
                products included clothing, appliances, discount items, furniture, 
                and back-to-school items. Among the products that were not moving 
                were seasonal merchandise and cookware. Auto dealers report that 
                sales have increased slightly in recent weeks, but they are still 
                below 2002 levels. They attribute this increase to a higher use 
                of rebates, deep discounting, and better finance terms. Contacts 
                report, however, that they will offer fewer incentives on 2004 
                models. Recent sales of imports, SUVs, trucks, and used cars have 
                increased, while sales of domestic, passenger, and new cars have 
                decreased. Several contacts report that their inventories are 
                higher than desired, particularly for used cars. Both general 
                retailers and car dealers appear optimistic that sales will improve 
                over the rest of the year.

       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Sales of single-family homes through August continued to increase 
                in most of the District. August year-to-date sales in northern 
                Kentucky increased by 18.0 percent compared with those in the 
                same month last year. In the Memphis area, year-to-date sales 
                increased by 9.7 percent, with an increase of 6.1 percent between 
                July and August 2003. In the northeast Mississippi area, however, 
                the stock of homes for sale was at historic highs. In August, 
                year-to-date single-family housing permits were up in most of 
                the District's metropolitan areas compared with August of last 
                year. In the greater St. Louis area year-to-date permit levels 
                increased by 1.0 percent. Housing starts were up in southern Indiana 
                and northeast Arkansas. Residential construction was also strong 
                in western Tennessee and northeast Arkansas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The office and industrial real estate markets 
                are still sluggish in most of the District. Contacts in the St. 
                Louis area anticipate a slight decrease in office and industrial 
                vacancy rates in the third quarter. Commercial construction activity 
                is slowly improving in most of the District. New shopping malls 
                and movie theaters are being built in central Kentucky, and contacts 
                in southern Indiana and the Memphis area report that commercial 
                construction is improving.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Total loans outstanding for a sample of small and mid-sized District 
                banks were up 3.5 percent between early July and early September. 
                This increase stemmed mostly from real estate loans and leases, 
                which increased by 4.9 percent. Loans to individuals increased 
                by 1.9 percent, while loans to commercial banks decreased by 1.0 
                percent. Over the same period, total deposits at these banks were 
                up by 0.7 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Natural Resources
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Recent weather has had mixed effects on agriculture. While rains 
                slowed row crop maturity in some areas, damaged some tobacco during 
                the harvest in Kentucky, and pushed back harvesting of hay and 
                cotton, recent drier conditions have aided corn and soybean maturity 
                and provided favorable conditions for quickening the harvest. 
                Current reports indicate that, except for sorghum, the majority 
                of crops lie in the good-to-excellent range. Improved by recent 
                rains, more than 50 percent of pastures and hay also lie in this 
                range.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corn yields appear good, but harvesting is still 
                behind its average pace. Soybean maturity and harvest lag nearly 
                50 percent behind average in Illinois and Missouri, while they 
                are at a better-than-average pace in Mississippi. Sorghum maturity 
                and harvest are behind average by over 70 percent in Illinois. 
                Cotton harvest lags by nearly 50 percent due to previous wet conditions, 
                while hay and rice crops are roughly on schedule. Farmers are 
                now beginning to plant winter wheat. The condition of livestock 
                continues to be good, as are soil moisture levels.
