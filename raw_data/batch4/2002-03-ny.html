      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       March 6, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Second District have 
              been mixed since the last report, with hiring remaining weak but 
              housing quite strong. Retail sales, which had been a bit lean in 
              January, were generally reported to be back above plan in February. 
              Retailers indicate that selling prices have been steady in early 
              2002. Purchasing managers report mixed business conditions in January, 
              though a survey of manufacturers across New York State suggests 
              ongoing improvement in general business conditions in early February.
      <p>
       Housing markets appear to have gained further 
              momentum since the last report, in both metropolitan New York City 
              and parts of upstate New York. New York City's office market has 
              shown signs of bottoming out, though suburban markets have slackened 
              further. Manhattan hotels experienced less of a seasonal slowdown 
              than normal in January. Finally, bankers report some weakening in 
              demand for consumer loans and home mortgages, ongoing tightening 
              in credit standards, and a slight up-tick in consumer delinquency 
              rates.
       <p>
        <b>
         Consumer Spending
        </b>
        <br/>
        Major retail chains report that January sales were constrained by 
              lean post-holiday inventories, but most indicate that business was 
              back on or above plan in February. Comparable-store sales in recent 
              weeks have been little changed from a year earlier, with brisk sales 
              of home goods offsetting sluggish apparel sales--particularly men's 
              apparel. In general, discounters continue to fare better than department 
              stores. Similarly, small retailers across New York State indicate 
              that business has been little changed from a year ago, but, in most 
              cases, this was better than had been expected. Selling prices are 
              reported to be flat, though the lack of clearance merchandise in 
              January translated into less discounting.
        <p>
         According to Siena College's latest monthly survey 
              of New York State residents, confidence was little changed around 
              the District in January. More recently though, the Conference Board 
              reports that consumer confidence in the Middle Atlantic region tapered 
              off in February.
         <p>
          <b>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </b>
          <br/>
          Commercial real estate markets remained generally weak in early 
              2002, though conditions in Manhattan appear to have stabilized. 
              While availability rates in Lower Manhattan continued to climb in 
              January, rates in Midtown retreated noticeably. Asking rents in 
              both areas were down substantially from a year earlier, and the 
              drop in contract rents is said to have been even more pronounced. 
              Office markets in New York City's suburbs, though, slackened considerably 
              in recent months--particularly in southwestern Connecticut and northern 
              New Jersey. Markets in New Jersey are being dampened by a substantial 
              amount of sublease space, mainly from telecommunications firms, 
              and by a large volume of space recently completed and under construction. 
              Across the metro area in general, asking rents were slightly higher 
              at the beginning of this year than in early 2001, but landlords 
              are reported to be offering more concessions. Despite the sluggish 
              leasing market, sales transactions are described as fairly strong 
              across the metropolitan area.
          <p>
           In contrast, the residential market has continued 
              to gain momentum. A leading New York City housing appraisal firm 
              and a major brokerage both report a substantial pickup in the co-op 
              and condo market in January and early February. Apartment sales 
              activity has been brisk in recent weeks, with selling prices up 
              modestly from a year earlier and transactions volume up substantially. 
              In addition, the inventory of available homes is back down, and 
              bidding wars are, once again, increasingly common.
           <p>
            The single-family housing market has also been 
              quite strong. Homebuilders in northern New Jersey report a brisk 
              rebound in demand and indicate that a supply shortage is again buoying 
              home prices. Similarly, existing home sales prices in late 2001 
              were up on the order of 10 percent across most of the District, 
              while sales volume was up slightly.
            <p>
             <b>
              Other Business Activity
             </b>
             <br/>
             A major New York City employment agency reports a slight improvement 
              in hiring activity in January and February, compared to the fourth 
              quarter of last year, but no significant momentum. This contact 
              indicates a deluge of resumes from technical people but very few 
              such openings. The strongest labor demand is still reported to be 
              coming from the legal industry, but there has been some pickup from 
              a smattering of small firms in creative fields, such as public relations, 
              advertising, and film.
             <p>
              Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates posted 
              a normal seasonal decline in January. After adjusting for seasonal 
              movements, January's occupancy rate was 78 percent, virtually the 
              same as in December, and down only 4 points from a year earlier. 
              The average room rate was down about 15 percent from a year earlier 
              in January, compared with declines of 20-25 percent in the fourth 
              quarter of 2001. Industry contacts note that business remained relatively 
              favorable in February, buoyed by the World Economic Forum meetings.
              <p>
               There are indications of improvement in New York 
              State's manufacturing sector. A rising proportion of manufacturers 
              across New York State report improvement in general business conditions 
              and a sizable majority express optimism about the near-term outlook, 
              based on a survey conducted in early February. However, surveys 
              of purchasing managers offer more mixed results. New York City area 
              purchasing managers report some weakening in business conditions 
              in January--particularly in non-manufacturing sectors. Buffalo-area 
              purchasers indicate that both production and new orders continued 
              to decline in January, though declines were less widespread than 
              in December. However, Rochester-area purchasers report modest improvement 
              in business conditions in January, following a sharp pickup in December. 
              Purchasers in the New York City area report fairly widespread declines 
              in input prices, while those in the Buffalo area indicate moderate 
              increases.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Financial Developments
                </b>
                <br/>
                According to the latest survey of small to medium-sized Second District 
              banks, overall loan demand receded somewhat since the last report, 
              driven largely by the consumer side. Nearly half of those surveyed 
              report slower demand for both consumer and residential mortgage 
              loans, but demand remained stable for commercial and industrial 
              loans. Fairly widespread declines were reported in refinancing activity. 
              Bankers reported continued tightening in credit standards for all 
              types of loans. In particular, while none reported an easing of 
              standards, roughly one in four bankers reported tighter standards 
              on both nonresidential mortgages and commercial and industrial loans. 
              Loan rates were steady to lower, while deposit rates decreased. 
              Delinquency rates were reported unchanged for all types of lending 
              except for consumer lending, where there was a moderate increase.
