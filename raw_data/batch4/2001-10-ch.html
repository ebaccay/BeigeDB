      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 24, 2001
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, economic activity in the Seventh 
            District slowed further in September and early October. Reports indicated 
            that the tragic events of September 11 had an immediate negative impact, 
            but many related business disruptions had been alleviated by the weekend. 
            Consumer spending continued to soften, with sales of nondurable goods 
            doing better than sales of most durable goods and services. Residential 
            construction and real estate markets slowed some, but low mortgage 
            rates kept buyers in the market. Commercial real estate markets weakened 
            noticeably, with businesses becoming more uncertain about investment 
            plans. Manufacturing activity continued to slow, and increased business 
            caution further dampened capital expenditures. Lending activity was 
            mixed, with demand for business loans falling and mortgage refinancing 
            surging. Labor demand softened and there were few reports of intensifying 
            upward wage pressures. There were virtually no reports of upward price 
            pressures and several reports of falling transaction prices. Most 
            contacts were satisfied with their current inventory levels. The fall 
            crop harvest was generally progressing well, with good yields reported 
            in the southern and eastern parts of the District, though there were 
            indications of "spotty" and "disappointing" yields in the north and 
            west.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was somewhat softer in September and early October, 
              after temporarily dropping off significantly during the period immediately 
              after September 11. Contacts noted that by late September and early 
              October, fundamental economic factors--rising unemployment and falling 
              stock prices adversely, and low inflation and interest rates positively--affected 
              retail sales more than terrorist fears. Sales results of discount 
              stores continued to outperform those of department and specialty 
              stores, and in some cases the spread widened. One contact reported 
              that retailers were canceling or delaying orders for the holiday 
              season. Promotional activity was generally slower, though there 
              were some reports of small retailers boosting advertisements. In 
              general, sales of nondurable goods were better than sales of durable 
              goods, but there were exceptions. While clothing sales were soft, 
              appliance sales were beginning to see year-over-year gains, excluding 
              a few days after September 11. District vehicle sales have been 
              very strong since automakers announced zero percent financing programs 
              in late September; one dealer reported that 35-50 percent of their 
              September sales came in the last weekend of the month. Contacts 
              in the casual dining industry reported that activity in the District 
              was weak. Spending on services, such as air travel, hotels, auto 
              repair, and rental cars, generally was weak, though business at 
              a District movie theatre chain was described as "steady." Contacts 
              in the air travel industry reported that passenger load factors 
              were below normal, but up from when air travel initially resumed 
              in mid-September. One contact at a regional airport indicated that 
              load factors on flights at smaller airports were in worse shape 
              than those at larger ones. There were no reports of inflationary 
              price pressures on the retail level. Most contacts reported that 
              consumers were increasingly price conscious and there were many 
              reports of price discounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate and construction activities generally softened notably 
              in the weeks after September 11. Office vacancy rates continued 
              to rise in most areas and rents were said to be flat to declining. 
              Reports of anxiety among occupants of some of Chicago's trophy office 
              properties became more frequent. According to one contact, "more 
              than one" tenant of a prominent office tower in the city were looking 
              to leave the building, for fear of losing workers left skittish 
              by the World Trade Center attacks. Some tenants noted that workers 
              in high-rise buildings were less productive because of security 
              distractions. One hotel operator reported that vacancy rates were 
              rising and many room bookings had been lost since September 11, 
              including 30 percent of the company's convention business. Vacancy 
              rates were also said to be rising on industrial properties in some 
              areas, and there were scattered reports of light industrial projects 
              being put on hold. Contacts in commercial real estate reported that 
              their clients had become decidedly more pessimistic since September 
              11. Residential activity also slumped immediately after September 
              11, but picked up later in the month as low mortgage interest rates 
              kept buyers in the market. One Chicago-area realtor indicated that 
              traffic through existing homes had picked up to about 85 percent 
              of early September levels; however, according to other District 
              contacts, traffic through new models had not picked up to the same 
              extent. Both realtors and builders noted that demand remained soft 
              for high-end homes, and may have softened further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity at District manufacturers continued to weaken in September 
              and early October, and there was no mention of bottoming as there 
              had been in our previous Beige Book report. Contacts generally reported 
              that orders and shipments were down by double-digit percentages 
              from a year earlier. Reports almost universally indicated that the 
              events of September 11 had an immediate negative impact, but the 
              extent and length of that impact varied. Contacts reported some 
              supply chain disruptions due to increased security at U.S. borders, 
              but as the problems eased in a few days, none had any plans to increase 
              inventories to prevent any future potential shortages. In the week 
              following September 11, nationwide light vehicle sales dropped around 
              50 percent, but zero percent financing programs by domestic automakers 
              contributed to a sales surge late in the month that continued into 
              early October. Contacts were unsure whether the incentives were 
              only taking sales away from future months, rather than generating 
              new sales, though one noted, "We are planning for the worst, hoping 
              for the best." There were some reports of rental car companies reducing 
              their fleets and orders for new vehicles. Plant shutdowns on September 
              11 and subsequent delays in receiving parts from Canada and Mexico 
              led to significantly larger-than-planned vehicle production losses. 
              Heavy truck sales continued to languish, but it was difficult for 
              contacts to determine how much the tragedies on September 11 affected 
              sales. Steel shipments and production were down significantly, with 
              production declines larger in the Midwest than the rest of the nation. 
              Orders for machine tools declined and one industry contact noted, 
              "This is the worst business environment I have seen in my 29-year 
              career." Shipments of heavy machinery continued to fall, with somewhat 
              larger declines seen following September 11. Construction equipment 
              suffered the most, while farm equipment demand was flat and demand 
              for coal mining equipment was solid. A representative from one equipment 
              maker in the District lamented that the overwhelming uncertainty 
              in the current economy was "the enemy of capital spending." Contacts 
              reported that prices for most manufactured products, materials, 
              and inputs were down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall lending activity was mixed in recent weeks, as uncertainty 
              about the near-term economic outlook increased. Bankers suggested 
              that business lending slowed as firms appeared to be putting major 
              decisions on hold. In addition, reports indicated that some businesses 
              were weighing future capital spending against increased investment 
              in security. Loan officers at some banks were reportedly "spending 
              more time combing through existing accounts than mining for new 
              business." Commercial loan quality deteriorated further in recent 
              weeks, but there were no reported changes in standards and terms 
              for business loans. On the household side, mortgage refinancing 
              activity surged in recent weeks as homeowners took advantage of 
              lower interest rates. One banker noted that refinancing activity 
              was near record levels and would most likely exceed them in coming 
              weeks. Demand for new mortgages was reportedly mixed, but relatively 
              strong. One lender stated that "if you have the need, there is no 
              better time" to take out a mortgage. Credit quality continued to 
              deteriorate slightly, with delinquencies increasing on many types 
              of loans, including mortgages and home-equity loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets softened further after September 11. Year-over-year 
              increases in initial unemployment insurance claims surged in the 
              weeks following the attacks. Tourism and travel firms in some larger 
              metro areas were quick to trim payrolls as business fell off significantly 
              after September 11. One aircraft engineering firm in the District 
              has sharply cut back its hiring needs and has begun laying off workers. 
              Some reports suggested that retailers' fall hiring will be slower 
              than in recent years as expectations for the holiday shopping season 
              weakened. At least one national retail chain was already reported 
              to be shedding workers. Some high-tech services firms continued 
              to lay off workers and at least one also cut top executives' pay. 
              There were reports of automakers shedding or considering layoffs 
              of some white-collar workers in a new attempt to cut costs. A national 
              survey showed that fourth-quarter hiring plans of Midwest employers 
              were the lowest since 1994. There were no reports of intensifying 
              upward pressure on wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Soybean and corn harvests were progressing rapidly in District states. 
              Harvest in the southern and eastern reaches of the District neared 
              completion. The USDA's October 12 Production Report revised upward 
              (from September) estimated soybean and corn production in District 
              states. The soybean harvest was expected to be up more that 4 percent 
              from last year while corn production was expected to be down about 
              3-1/2 percent. Some District contacts were surprised by the upward 
              revisions. They noted that, as expected, the "best crops" were in 
              the southern and eastern portions of the Corn Belt. However, recorded 
              yields were dropping off sharply as the harvest moved north and 
              west. They expected that average yields would fall below the latest 
              USDA estimates. Most crop prices at the farm gate remained at low 
              levels--corn slightly above a year ago and soybeans well below a 
              year ago. Beef and pork prices weakened recently. However, milk 
              prices were at or near their highest levels in a decade.
