      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fifth District economy continued to expand moderately in late 
November and December, despite a sharp slowdown in the manufacturing 
sector. Service sector growth picked up in recent weeks and retail 
sales growth remained healthy. In the financial sector, lower 
interest rates boosted demand for home mortgages, while demand for 
consumer and commercial loans was steady. Housing activity was 
mixed; home sales were somewhat higher but housing starts were flat. 
The commercial real estate sector remained generally robust, 
although new construction activity continued to be modest in most 
areas. Labor markets were tight throughout the District. Wage growth 
picked up in the retail sector, but contacts reported only scattered 
wage pressures otherwise. Prices in the retail, services, and 
manufacturing sectors grew at somewhat slower paces than in our last 
report.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Fifth District retailers reported that sales growth remained strong 
during late November and December. Late November sales rose 
substantially, but contacts said that aggressive discounting was 
required to keep cash registers ringing in December. Retail prices 
increased more slowly than in our last report. Although retailers 
continued to report difficulties finding qualified workers,
seasonally-adjusted employment in the sector edged higher and wage 
growth accelerated.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Activity in the service sector grew at a somewhat faster rate since 
our last report. Contacts indicated that revenues grew more quickly. 
Employment growth held steady during November, but picked up in 
December. The overall rate of wage growth remained strong. Looking 
ahead, service producers remained optimistic about demand in coming 
months, though perhaps less optimistic than in our last report.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The pace of manufacturing activity in the Fifth District slowed 
considerably since our last report. Shipments edged lower, and new 
orders and order backlogs fell sharply in December. Several textile 
producers indicated that their orders had been trimmed by increased 
Asian competition, but other manufacturers saw no Asian influence on 
their orders. Raw materials and finished goods inventories grew more 
rapidly and remained well above manufacturers' desired levels. 
Employment and wage levels changed little. Many contacts continued 
to express frustration over shortages of skilled labor; others, 
however, suggested that labor availability had become less of a 
problem in recent weeks. Price growth for both raw materials and 
finished goods moderated. Manufacturers' outlook for the next six 
months continued to be optimistic; with orders and shipments 
expected to rise.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Tourism
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Tourist activity was mixed during December and early January. 
Several sources from coastal areas indicated that unseasonably warm 
weather in early January boosted their business, while respondents 
from mountain areas reported that the recent "heatwave" and heavy 
rains hampered their business. One contact from a popular ski resort 
in Virginia noted that business was down 20 to 25 percent from a 
year ago. In West Virginia, however, the weather was more seasonable 
and bookings at ski resorts remained strong and in Washington, D.C., 
record visits at the Smithsonian Institute were noted.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Ports
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Activity at District ports was unchanged to slightly lower since our 
last report. Decreased shipments of agricultural products, steel, 
and synthetic rubber pushed exports down somewhat, while reduced 
inbound shipments of tobacco, steel, and lumber products limited 
gains in import levels. Port operators indicated that developments 
in Asia had not noticeably affected export or
import volumes.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Temporary Employment
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Growth in the demand for temporary employees was slightly stronger 
during late November and December. Sources said that although some 
employers normally take a "breather" in their hiring at this time of 
the year, demand remained "surprisingly strong" compared to past 
years. Despite this, only scattered wage pressures were reported, 
mostly for jobs requiring a high degree of technical skill.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Finance
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Mortgage lending rose moderately in recent weeks but commercial and 
consumer loan activity was little changed. Bankers reported that 
lower mortgage rates had spurred greater interest in home 
refinancings and fixed-rate mortgages. While competition for 
commercial loan accounts, particularly in the Carolinas, remained 
intense, contacts indicated that pricing spreads have been
maintained. However, a Charleston, S.C., banker remarked that the 
intensively competitive environment had led his bank "to be more 
accommodating with loan covenants."
             <p>
              <strong>
               Residential Real Estate
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Housing activity across the District was mixed since our last 
report. Realtors in Richmond, Va., Greensboro, N.C., and Greenville, 
S.C., reported that home sales picked up, in part because of new 
companies moving into their areas. Sales of higher-priced homes were 
said to be particularly strong in some areas; a Virginia realtor 
noted that "baby boomers want all the frills in their dream
homes." Homebuilders, however, saw little change in housing starts 
and reported increased buyer interest in lower-priced houses. A West 
Virginia builder characterized his local market as one of "mostly 
bottom-feeders"-- individuals interested in purchasing lower-priced 
homes. In contrast, a contact from North Carolina said that prices 
of starter homes in that area had recently soared.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Commercial Real Estate
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Since our last Beige Book, commercial real estate activity remained 
strong. Low vacancy rates persisted in many urban areas. Contacts 
continued to report only modest amounts of new construction in most 
areas, much of it small, pre-leased offices. But a few big projects 
were set to begin. In Richmond, Va., a $3 billion computer chip 
plant received the green light after being on hold for several 
years. In the office sector, both Washington, D.C. and Maryland saw 
a tightening of Class A space. To help accommodate the demand for 
premier space in those areas, contacts noted that some Class B and C 
space was being renovated. In addition, a West Virginia realtor 
reported the conversion of older buildings to offices in his area.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Agriculture
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Generally dry weather allowed District farmers to make significant 
headway in their fieldwork in December. Crop harvesting neared 
completion in most areas according to District contacts, although 
there were scattered reports of corn and soybeans remaining in 
fields. With harvesting nearly complete, analysts believed that 
yields of most crops would fall short of 1996 levels. As of
late December, winter wheat emergence was only slightly behind the 
five-year average, and small grains were said to be in generally 
fair to good condition. In the livestock sector, fourth quarter hog 
inventories fell in several District states; a North Carolina 
analyst attributed the decline to increased shipments rather than to 
planned reductions.
