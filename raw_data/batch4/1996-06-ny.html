      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Second District economic conditions have shown some signs of 
improvement in recent weeks. Retail sales strengthened in May and 
were generally above plan, though they retreated in early June. 
While there has been some softening in New York City's commercial 
real estate market, the District's housing market has improved. The 
District's manufacturing sector accelerated sharply in May, 
according to purchasing managers in the New York City and Buffalo 
areas. Tourism remains exceptionally strong. There are some signs of 
price firming in a number of different sectors. Finally, banks 
report declining delinquency rates and steady growth in loan demand 
in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales in the district strengthened in May and were generally 
ahead of plan for the month, though business slowed noticeably in 
early June. There continued to be wide variation among the retailers 
surveyed in May, with same-store sales gains ranging from less than 
1 percent to more than 10 percent, versus a year earlier. In 
general, upscale product lines continue to sell better than lower-
end merchandise. Much of May's pickup was in seasonal merchandise 
(air conditioners, fans, swimwear, etc.) and was attributed to warm 
weather following an unusually cool April. It is unclear how much of 
the early-June slowdown was weather related.
     </p>
     <p>
      A few retailers reported that inventories were a bit lean at the end 
of May, but with the early-June sales slump, inventories are 
generally back on or close to target. Virtually all retail contacts 
report that they are making fewer and smaller mark-downs on 
merchandise than last year, which has translated into a modest rise 
in effective selling prices. With little or no change in merchandise 
costs, this has boosted profit margins somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction &amp; Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate markets in the New York metro area weakened 
slightly in May. After holding steady in April, office vacancy rates 
edged up in May, due to a drop in leasing activity and to new space 
coming on the market. Midtown Manhattan's vacancy rate rose from 
14.2 percent to 14.8 percent (a 2-year high) at the end of May, 
while downtown's climbed from 24.6 percent to 24.9 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's residential real estate markets have improved, on 
balance, though new construction activity remains at a low level. 
Realtors in New York state report that sales of existing homes 
picked up substantially in April, following a sluggish first 
quarter, while selling prices rose modestly. Permits to build new 
homes, particularly multi-family structures, are up sharply from a 
year ago-albeit from a very low base. Housing demand continues to be 
stronger downstate than upstate. Manhattan's residential rental 
market is particularly tight: vacancy rates are exceptionally low 
and rents on unregulated apartments have reportedly increased by 
more than 10 percent over the past year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors in northern New Jersey report that the market for existing 
homes is improving slowly but steadily, with both unit sales and 
average prices increasing at a 3-5% rate. However, homebuilders in 
northern New Jersey report that market conditions were weak in April 
and May-"in the pits", as described by one contact. With inventories 
of unsold homes at a relatively high 13 months worth of sales in 
May, builders have stopped virtually all speculative building. At 
the lower end of the market, which includes mostly existing homes, 
traffic and sales have been fairly good. In contrast, most newly 
built homes are higher priced and are moving very slowly. Concern 
over job security is viewed as the overriding constraint on demand 
for higher-priced homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional surveys of purchasing managers indicate a strong 
acceleration in manufacturing activity in May. Purchasing managers 
in Buffalo report that production activity, new orders, and 
employment all accelerated sharply in May, while commodity price 
pressures increased. Similarly, purchasers in metropolitan New York 
report a sharp improvement in manufacturing-sector conditions. The 
composite diffusion index signaled the strongest pace of growth in 
more than a year and a half, although there was only a modest 
increase in price pressures. (A separate diffusion index covering 
purchasing managers in New York City's non-manufacturing sectors 
signals continued moderate growth).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's labor market was stable in April. New York state's 
unemployment rate edged down from 6.5 percent to 6.4 percent, while 
New Jersey's edged up from 6.4 percent to 6.6 percent. Payroll 
employment growth slowed in April, following above-trend job 
creation in the first quarter. While part of this slowdown is due to 
an acceleration in job losses in manufacturing and government, much 
of it reflects a temporary statistical quirk: the survey week 
coincided with schools' spring break.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism continues to boom, with hotel occupancy rates in New York 
City holding at 16-year highs through April, and average daily room 
rates posting double-digit gains over the past year. Two major 
transportation infrastructure projects were recently completed in 
northern New Jersey: a monorail system connecting Newark airport's 
three terminals, and a new rail link that facilitates the commute to 
midtown Manhattan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand continued to increase, according to a survey of senior 
loan officers at small and medium sized banks in the District. 
Demand for commercial and industrial, as well as nonresidential 
mortgage loans, accelerated slightly in May, with demand higher at 
nearly 30 percent of the banks and steady at approximately 60 
percent. However, demand for consumer loans grew at a slower pace 
than in April. Refinancing activity for all types of loans continued 
to dwindle, declining at approximately 40 percent of the banks and 
holding steady at close to 55 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan delinquencies decreased across all segments in May. Just 8 
percent of the banks reported rising delinquency rates, down from 19 
percent in April. At nearly all of the banks surveyed, loan officers 
report that credit standards have not changed and that they are at 
least as willing to lend as they were two months ago. Average loan 
rates are higher or stable at almost all of the respondent banks. 
The spread between the average lending rates and deposit rates 
widened at close to 30 percent of the banks and held steady at 35 
percent.
