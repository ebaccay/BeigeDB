      Third District businesses on the whole reported little or 
            no improvement in July compared with June. In some sectors activity 
            was below year-ago levels. Manufacturers reported declines in shipments 
            and orders during the month. Retail sales were mixed. General merchandise 
            sales were flat compared with June and down from July of last year, 
            but sales of automobiles increased from June to July. Bank loan volumes 
            edged down during the month, but mortgage refinancing remained strong. 
            Tourism activity throughout the District has been slower this summer 
            than last, and business travel has declined sharply from a year ago.
      <p>
       Businesses in the District generally expect some slight 
            improvement in the fall. Manufacturers forecast an increase in orders 
            within the next six months, although they are planning only small 
            increases in employment and working hours. Retailers look for a pickup 
            in sales in the fall, but most do not anticipate significant gains. 
            Bankers expect lending in all major credit categories to be virtually 
            flat for at least several more months.

         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        Third District manufacturing activity continued to decline in July. 
            Shipments from plants in the region fell, and new orders edged down. 
            The falloff in orders was slight in most manufacturing sectors, but 
            declines were widespread among producers of transportation equipment, 
            metal products, and wood products. Manufacturing firms in the region 
            continue to experience declining demand from foreign countries. Several 
            noted significant easing in orders from Europe. Firms that supply 
            the telecommunications industry with a variety of products continued 
            to report very weak demand from that sector. On balance, manufacturers 
            scaled back working hours and reduced employment during July. Manufacturers 
            indicated that prices of inputs were nearly steady in July, and prices 
            for the products they make moved down. Nearly six out of ten of the 
            firms polled in July reported that their inventories were above desired 
            levels. Four out of ten indicated that their inventory levels were 
            satisfactory. Excess inventories appeared to be especially prevalent 
            among producers of wood products, furniture, industrial materials, 
            and primary metals. Overall, firms in the region plan to reduce inventories 
            in the next six months by keeping production low and shipping from 
            inventory.
        <p>
         Manufacturers expect business conditions to improve 
            during the next six months. Firms in nearly all of the major manufacturing 
            sectors in the region expect demand for their products to increase, 
            although makers of wood products, industrial machinery, and instruments 
            anticipate further declines in orders. Area manufacturers forecast 
            a rise in order backlogs in the next six months, but they plan only 
            slight increases in employment and working hours, on balance.
         <p>
          <b>
           Retail
          </b>
          <br/>
          Retail sales in the Third District in July were generally steady, 
            but down from the level in the same month last year. Overall, retailers 
            contacted for this report indicated that their sales have been flat 
            in recent weeks. Merchants said customer traffic has been slow and 
            shoppers have curtailed impulse purchasing. Reports from stores in 
            the region indicated that, on balance, general merchandise sales in 
            the region in July were about 5 percent below the year-ago rate, in 
            current dollars. Several stores reported steeper year-over-year declines. 
            Some merchants noted that summer merchandise had not been in strong 
            demand for most of July because the region's weather had been cooler 
            than normal. Higher temperatures toward the end of the month did little 
            to boost sales, however, and stores have begun their usual clearance 
            sales of summer goods. Store officials have been cautious in sales 
            plans since spring, and they have generally kept inventory levels 
            from becoming excessive.
          <p>
           Store executives see few signs that sales might strengthen significantly. 
            Most of those contacted for this report anticipate a slow recovery 
            in sales during the fall selling season. Stocking of fall merchandise 
            has been restrained, and some retailers expressed concern that planned 
            inventories might not be adequate if consumer demand increases strongly.
           <p>
            Auto dealers generally indicated that sales picked 
            up a bit in July compared with June. Sales of imported automobiles 
            have been relatively stronger than sales of domestic automobiles. 
            Manufacturers' incentives continue to support a relatively high sales 
            rate in most parts of the region, but some dealers in areas where 
            unemployment has increased reported recent declines in sales.
            <p>

             <br/>
             Total loan volume outstanding was edging down in July at Third District 
            banks contacted for this report. Bank lending officers indicated that 
            there had been some growth in commercial and industrial lending, but 
            declines in consumer and real estate lending. Some bankers indicated 
            that a significant portion of their new business loans were for buyouts 
            or reorganizations of local firms rather than for expansion. Consumer 
            lending of all types has moved down, although mortgage refinancing 
            activity has continued at a fairly high level.
             <p>
              Bankers in the Third District expect overall loan volumes 
            to be nearly flat for at least the next few months. Commercial bank 
            lending officers expressed heightened caution with respect to the 
            creditworthiness of potential business borrowers. Nevertheless, some 
            banks are actively seeking new opportunities to extend credit to well-capitalized 
            businesses in all industries, including commercial real estate.
              <p>

               </b>
               <br/>
               Travel and tourism officials in the Third District reported that tourist 
            and recreational business throughout the region has edged down from 
            last year. Lodging occupancy has not achieved last year's levels in 
            most resort areas. Reports from hotels and other lodging businesses 
            in some areas indicated that advance bookings of rooms have been declining 
            since the summer vacation season began. Travel and visitor bureaus 
            in the region generally noted significant declines in business travel 
            compared with last year. In particular, attendance at recent conventions 
            and other business meetings has fallen below anticipated levels.
