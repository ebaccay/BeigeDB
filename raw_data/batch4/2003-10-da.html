       Overall Eleventh District economic activity 
                showed signs of slowly improving in September and early October. 
                While reports were uneven in many sectors, there continues to 
                be cautious optimism that the recovery is strengthening. Still, 
                most companies indicated a reluctance to expand their payrolls 
                without the certainty of a permanent pick-up in demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturing activity was improved, with some 
                industries reporting increased sales and optimism. Signs of strengthening 
                demand were also appearing in the service sector, although reports 
                are mixed. Contacts say that retail sales are slowly and erratically 
                improving. There was little change in the energy industry, financial 
                services, or construction and real estate markets. Overall agricultural 
                conditions remain in good shape despite some weather-related crop 
                damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall price pressures were mixed. Overcapacity and weak demand 
                has led to falling prices for paper and boxes, which are now at 
                a 20-year low. Most energy prices were lower, but remain at fairly 
                high levels. Crude oil prices fell steadily in September from 
                $32 to $27 per barrel, adding back a dollar or so in late September 
                after OPEC surprised the world with a cut in production. The production 
                cut was equal to Iraq's current production, and many saw OPEC's 
                action as making room for Iraq's return to OPEC. Crude inventories 
                were about 10 percent below normal through much of the period, 
                and held steady in the last couple of weeks despite a decline 
                in refinery demand due to seasonal maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blackout in the northeast knocked out six 
                U.S. refineries or about 3 percent of U.S. production and caused 
                a brief jump in wholesale gasoline prices. The loss of production 
                came at a critical moment, with gasoline inventories about 6 percent 
                below year-earlier levels and Labor Day looming as the biggest 
                driving day of the year. The spot price rose from $.95 to $1.12, 
                but has since fallen back to $.90 or below. Pump prices have fallen 
                back as well. Heating oil prices have fallen steadily throughout 
                the period, as inventories of distillates have returned to healthy, 
                year-ago levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural gas prices softened in recent weeks from 
                $5 per thousand cubic feet to $4.50, as larger than normal increases 
                in inventory kept the industry on track to refill storage to normal 
                levels by the start of the heating season on November 1. Consumption 
                of natural gas continued to decline, and contacts believe natural 
                gas is being diverted to storage. Most observers continue to see 
                gas production capacity shrinking one to three percent this year. 
                Petrochemical prices mostly fluctuated with feedstock costs. Plastic 
                product prices were mixed, with polyethylene and polypropylene 
                up because of increased demand, and polystyrene down due to weaker 
                demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some prices are higher. The high and rising cost 
                of health insurance was mentioned by many industries, and was 
                noted as one of many deterrents to hiring. Prices are higher for 
                some food products despite steep competition because higher input 
                costs are being passed along to consumers. Some manufacturers 
                indicated concerns about the high cost of utilities. Steel producers 
                say that selling prices are beginning to rise despite stiff competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity was mixed but optimism continued to improve 
                for some firms. Sales have picked up for most construction-related 
                products, including lumber, stone, brick and fabricated metals. 
                Demand is slower, however, for primary metals and paper products. 
                Demand for food products is unchanged and below the level of a 
                year ago. Contacts attribute the weaker than normal demand to 
                declining orders from restaurants. One contact explained that 
                upscale restaurants were scaling back last year and now all are 
                ordering less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many high-tech manufacturers reported that production, 
                orders and sales have continued to grow at the good pace set in 
                the second quarter. Demand was reported to be strongest from the 
                Asian and U.S. markets. Inventories were reported to be very lean, 
                as desired. Most respondents expect growth to continue at a good 
                pace over the next six months with one respondent saying that 
                for the first time in a long time his outlook is for "reasonable, 
                sustainable growth."
      </p>
      <p>
       Refiners' margins spiked along with wholesale 
                prices for gasoline, but margins have fallen back along with price 
                to some of the lowest levels of the year. The lower margins should 
                lead refiners to schedule routine maintenance over the next few 
                weeks, pulling about 3 percent of U.S. production off line at 
                any given time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petrochemical producers reported little change 
                in basic petrochemicals, as demand was slightly weaker, overcapacity 
                persisted, and profits were weak. Basic chemical producers report 
                losing export markets due to higher costs associated with high 
                natural gas prices, making it difficult to judge domestic demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the service sector continues to show signs of improvement 
                but remains uneven. Demand gains for temporary staffing have been 
                inconsistent, but contacts say the outlook is more optimistic 
                and feel that intentions to hire are improving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transportation firms reported mixed activity. 
                Airlines reported higher load factors but lower profits. Trucking 
                firms reported slower activity. The rail industry reported a marked 
                increase in shipments of grain (exports)--the result of good crop 
                yields in the U.S. and poor harvests overseas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legal firms reported some improvement but with 
                continued caution about the outlook. In the last month, contacts 
                report a steady stream of litigation and bankruptcy work and a 
                noticeable increase in transactional and venture capital work. 
                Accounting firms also say activity increased in the past month, 
                primarily for tax work but with some improvement on the transactional 
                side.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report signs of gradual improvement, but sales growth 
                remains uneven. Some contacts said that there was a noticeable 
                slowing of sales after the tax payments were spent. Others indicated 
                some worsening of the indicators they use to measure the financial 
                viability of consumers. Department stores noted improved sales 
                of women's apparel. Competition remains stiff, and two large retailers 
                report that selling prices are down about 2 percent from a year 
                ago. Automobile sales remained soft and are mostly driven by incentives, 
                rebates and low-cost financing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Financial Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Financial service contacts reported similar conditions to the 
                last report. Contacts continued to report gradually improving 
                attitudes and expectations, but only a moderate increase in lending 
                activity because many potential borrowers remain cautious about 
                going forward. Mortgage lending, including refinancing, remained 
                strong, partly because borrowers rushed to close as rates edged 
                upward. Most contacts expected this rush to slow by now, but say 
                it is still pushing mortgage lending volumes up. Commercial and 
                industrial lending is mildly positive. Interest and traffic is 
                up but customers remain cautious and are still unwilling to pull 
                the trigger. Mergers and acquisitions activity is also picking 
                up leading to higher fee income. Larger banks with more ties to 
                financial markets are experiencing growth in this area, which 
                is positively impacting earnings. Contacts say that asset quality 
                is stronger, and deposit growth continues to be strong
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Construction and Real Estate
         </strong>
         <br/>
         There was little change in construction and real estate markets. 
                The single-family market recorded steady demand, with August sales 
                of existing homes reaching record highs in several Texas markets. 
                Single-family builders noted that while demand for new homes was 
                still at good levels, more incentives were being offered to lure 
                new buyers. Without a pickup in job growth, many builders don't 
                expect the current pace of demand to be sustained.
        </p>
        <p>
         The apartment market remained weak. Properties 
                that were in the pipeline before the downturn are still being 
                built, and demand is low. Occupancy rates are flat to down, and 
                rent concessions continued. Contacts in the office market noted 
                increased "activity" but said it was mostly due to local companies 
                re-negotiating leases or moving to new space within a city. Any 
                significant improvement in the office market will depend on a 
                markedly improved job picture, according to contacts.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Energy
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The energy industry reported little change from the last Beige 
                Book. Domestic demand has flattened out in recent months along 
                with the U.S. rig count and remained flat in recent weeks. Contacts 
                say the level of activity is high but disappointing compared to 
                expectations of earlier this year. Exploration expenditures are 
                up 33 percent this year over last, but they continue to be weaker 
                than might be expected with the current price of oil and natural 
                gas. Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, a critical area for U.S. 
                gas supplies, has remained near 100 working rigs or near the low 
                of the last drilling downturn. International activity continues 
                to improve slowly, providing good revenues for U.S. producers 
                and service companies.

         <br/>
         Harsh weather dramatically reduced the cotton crop in some parts 
                of Texas. Recent cooler weather and rains have improved topsoil 
                conditions for some remaining row crops and pastures, however. 
                Vegetable producers in South Texas reported that heavy rains had 
                delayed fall planting. Pasture conditions for livestock have improved 
                in recent weeks. In addition, cattle producers are enjoying record 
                high prices, which should result in increased profitability this 
                year.
