      Economic activity in the Eighth District continues to expand slowly.  Reports of stronger orders, plant openings, and expansions in the manufacturing and services sectors have all increased since our previous report.  Retail sales declined slightly in December and January over year-earlier levels.  Car sales also decreased slightly over the same period.  Residential real estate markets are still doing well, but commercial real estate markets remain weak in most of the District.  Overall lending activity at a sample of District banks experienced little change over the past three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that retail sales in December and January were 
              slightly down, on average, over year-earlier levels. More than 50 
              percent of the retailers surveyed noted that sales levels met their 
              expectations. About 33 percent of the contacts reported that sales 
              were below what they had anticipated. Jewelry, personal and home 
              electronics, laptop computers, decorative items, seasonal items, 
              toys, and furniture were strong sellers, while computer hardware 
              and software, small home furnishings, lawn and garden items, home 
              audio equipment, and apparel were moving more slowly. About two 
              thirds of the retailers surveyed noted that inventories were at 
              desired levels. Most of the remaining contacts reported that inventories 
              were lower than desired. Retailers appear optimistic about the next 
              two months, with most of the contacts expecting sales to increase 
              over 2003 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, 
              sales in December and January were slightly down, on average. About 
              half of the car dealers surveyed reported increases in sales, while 
              the other half reported decreases. More than 40 percent of the car 
              dealers surveyed noted that sales of used and low-end cars had increased. 
              About 25 percent of the contacts reported increased use of rebates, 
              while 68 percent reported no change. About 25 percent of contacts 
              surveyed reported a decrease in the acceptance rates of finance 
              applications, while 17 percent reported an increase in acceptance 
              rates. More than 35 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported 
              that their inventories were at desired levels, while 50 percent 
              noted that their inventories were too high. A slight majority of 
              the car dealers surveyed are optimistic about the next two months 
              and expect sales to increase over 2003 levels.

      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Eighth District's manufacturing sector continues to show signs 
              of improvement. Reports of stronger orders, plant openings, and 
              expansions have all increased since our previous report. Manufacturers 
              in the aerospace, automotive parts, metal parts, furniture, and 
              electronics sectors reported recent plant openings, expansions, 
              and relocations to the District, with plans for increased employment. 
              Although manufacturers in the food processing sector generally reported 
              plant closings and layoffs, a meat processing firm has announced 
              plans to open a new plant early this year. Despite the generally 
              positive outlook, some District manufacturers reported decreased 
              orders, layoffs, and plant closings. Plant closings have affected 
              manufacturers in the food processing, appliance, mineral enrichment, 
              and iron fabrication sectors. While automotive-related sectors generally 
              reported expansions throughout the District, one large auto assembly 
              plant announced plans to layoff employees in the second quarter 
              of 2004. Contacts have reported a rapid increase in steel prices 
              since the steel tariffs were rescinded last December. Steel-using 
              manufacturers attribute this rise to increasing costs of raw materials 
              for domestic steel production; they also note that a weak U.S. dollar 
              and rising ocean freight costs are preventing them from buying foreign 
              steel to compensate. Some contacts even report that steel suppliers 
              are placing them on allocations and are canceling existing contracts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's services sector also continues to show signs of 
              improvement. Firms reporting facility openings, expansions, and 
              new hires include those in the banking, insurance, health care, 
              technology, tourism, and airline services sectors. While firms in 
              the services sector seemed generally optimistic, some firms reported 
              facility closings, employee transfers, and layoffs. Firms reporting 
              facility closings and layoffs include those in the financial and 
              transportation services sectors. Reports from the telemarketing 
              sector were mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Eighth District's residential real estate market had a strong 
              year in 2003. Memphis home sales set a record in 2003, with a gain 
              of 9.2 percent over 2002. December year-to-date home sales increased 
              by 11.6 percent in the greater Louisville area and by 1.3 percent 
              in Little Rock. Residential construction continues to do well in 
              the Eighth District. December 2003 permits for single-family homes 
              were up in all of the District's metropolitan areas compared with 
              December 2002. In the greater St. Louis metropolitan area, permits 
              increased by 2.0 percent. Residential construction remains strong 
              in central Kentucky, and homebuilders in Louisville are very optimistic 
              about 2004. Contacts report that construction has also been brisk 
              in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Commercial real estate continues to lag 
              behind the residential market in most of the District. The office 
              vacancy rate in downtown St. Louis was up by 14.0 percent in December 
              compared with December 2002. The office vacancy rate in the greater 
              Louisville area fell to 17.7 percent from 20.2 percent in midyear 
              2003, while the industrial vacancy rate decreased by 1.2 percentage 
              points in the fourth quarter. Construction has slowed down somewhat 
              in west Tennessee, but continues to do well in Danville, Kentucky. 
              Contacts in northeast Arkansas expect market conditions to improve 
              in 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A recent survey of senior loan officers at a sample of District 
              banks indicated little change in the overall lending activity in 
              the past three months. During this period, credit standards and 
              demand for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged for 
              both large and small firms. Credit standards and loan terms for 
              commercial real estate loans remained basically unchanged in the 
              past three months, while demand for commercial real estate loans 
              was moderately stronger. Meanwhile, both the credit standards and 
              the demand for residential mortgage loans, credit cards, and other 
              consumer loans were generally unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop yields improved in 2003 over 2002 for most District states. 
              During 2003, total production of corn in the District states increased 
              by about 20 percent, while total production of sorghum and winter 
              wheat increased by about 10 percent and 25 percent, respectively. 
              In contrast, total production of soybeans declined by at least 15 
              percent in each of the three largest producing states in the District--Illinois, 
              Indiana, and Missouri--leading to an overall decline of about 9 
              percent. Caused in part by December's case of mad cow disease, prices-received 
              for beef cattle decreased from December to mid-January by at least 
              5 percent in all District states, except Tennessee, which had a 
              smaller decline.
