      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Southeastern economic activity continues to expand at a moderate 
pace, according to business contacts. Merchants report that sales 
have met their expectations, which were above levels of a year ago. 
Home sales have been boosted by low mortgage interest rates, but 
weather problems have limited building in some parts of the region. 
Nonresidential construction spending remains healthy, with new 
speculative building underway. Factory activity is mixed, with 
weakness in some sectors balanced by strength in others. The tourism 
and hospitality industry continues to post impressive numbers. 
Consumer and commercial loan demand is growing moderately. Contacts 
expressed concern over labor shortages for skilled and unskilled 
workers; however, reports of escalating wages are infrequent. 
Overall, prices remain stable.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       According to retail contacts from across the District, retail sales 
were up year-over-year in both January and February; however, 
February sales were slightly weaker than January's. Most retailers 
agreed that recent sales had met their expectations, and inventories 
are in good shape. Apparel continues to be a strong seller. Sales 
during the first quarter are expected to exceed last year's sales 
slightly.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Reports from real estate contacts indicate that both new and 
existing home sales were stronger in February than a year ago. These 
contacts say low mortgage rates are boosting sales in most areas of 
the region. Home construction activity has been subdued in some 
parts of the District because of inclement weather. However, 
inventories remain generally in balance. Several contacts noted that 
lower priced or starter homes are the strong sellers in their 
market. Looking forward, a slight majority of builders expect new 
home construction will be up compared with last year in the first 
and second quarters; most real estate agents agree.
        <p>
         Commercial real estate markets remain healthy throughout the region. 
Most suburban and central business district office markets are 
recording rising occupancy rates and rentals, and a considerable
amount of speculative office construction is underway. The 
industrial sector has begun to show some signs of slowdown, as new 
supply and vacancy rates move up in several markets. Retail markets 
remain healthy across most of the region. Overall, both developers 
and real estate agents' outlooks remain optimistic for the year.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Factory activity varied by industry. Contacts note further slowing 
in the region's apparel sector, with the closure of one large plant 
and declining orders for others. A few small apparel companies that 
have found a market "niche" are reportedly doing well. Some contacts 
note that apparel companies are feeling negative "Asian effects," 
with slower sales to foreign markets. More positively, the outlook 
has improved for a plywood producer and a manufacturer of building 
products that experienced the factory workweek and shipments 
weakness not long ago. In Louisiana, oil field projects are 
maintaining a steady pace, and there is an overall optimistic 
outlook for the industry. Chemical producers are reportedly more 
concerned with the regulatory climate than that of the Asian 
situation, as many plant expansions are underway.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Tourism and Business Travel
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The tourism and hospitality industry remains robust, according to 
most contacts. Theme park expansions, along with a number of hotels 
currently under construction, or in the planning stages, are 
indicators of the positive outlook for central Florida's tourist 
industry. Although the weather in the Northeast has been unusually 
warm, south Florida contacts report that March bookings have been 
strong. Louisiana's Department of Tourism expects 1998 to be another 
good year and is stepping up encouragement of foreign airlines to 
expand flights into the state. Revenues for Mississippi's tourism 
and hospitality industry rose substantially in 1997, and the state's 
tourism and hospitality official reports double-digit increases in 
inquiries.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Financial
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Banking contacts report that loan demand has been expanding 
moderately throughout the Sixth District. Consumer and commercial 
loan demand are growing, and mortgage-refinancing activity continues 
to be brisk. Auto loan demand remains healthy, especially in the 
luxury car segment.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Wages and Prices
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Wage pressures remained constrained, according to most contacts, but 
labor shortages are a cause for concern. Along the Mississippi Gulf 
Coast, job fairs in casinos and department stores are becoming 
frequent in order to help ease labor shortages. Employers in 
Louisiana's shipbuilding industry are frustrated by their inability 
to find qualified workers. In Tennessee, technical centers have 
contracted with several industries and are beginning apprenticeship 
programs to help provide a continuing supply of skilled workers. 
Contacts also say that workers skilled in the construction trades 
are in demand as are general laborers. The majority of retail 
merchants report that labor costs have risen between zero and 4 
percent, year-over-year.
             <p>
              Prices remain mostly stable as businesses struggle to keep costs 
down. Some contacts report that improved productivity from computers 
and high-tech goods are helping employers to hold the line on price 
increases. Some firms are pushing for lower benefits for workers as 
a result of rising benefit and medical costs. One contact reports 
that the "Asian crisis" is benefiting his suppliers by allowing them 
to make purchases at significantly reduced prices, although others 
note that multi-year pricing agreements are keeping costs stable.
