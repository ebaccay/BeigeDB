      <p>
       Contacts reported that economic activity in the Sixth District remained lackluster 

  in January and February. Retail sales were sluggish, while manufacturers noted 

  continued weakness outside of defense and auto-related production. The District's 

  tourist sector continued its gradual improvement. Labor markets displayed a 

  modest improvement in January and February; employers reportedly remained reluctant 

  to add permanent staff but increased their use of overtime and part-time workers. 

  The District's single-family housing market remained strong, but commercial 

  real estate markets continued to suffer from low demand for space. Most contacts 

  indicated that geopolitical concerns and higher fuel prices were weighing on 

  near-term expectations for the District's economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The majority of District retail contacts reported that January and February 

  sales were about the same as they were a year earlier. Aggressive discounting 

  remained prevalent, especially among apparel merchants that were clearing out 

  winter clothing. Most retailers contacted indicated that inventories were balanced, 

  and some noted that stocks were lower than this time last year. Several national 

  retail chains announced planned store consolidations in the District. Automobile 

  industry contacts reported mixed light-vehicle sales in January and February, 

  while the demand for used-car sales remained soft.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Low mortgage rates continued to propel District housing markets in January and 

  February. The strongest reports in the District were from Florida, while contacts 

  reported that home sales and construction elsewhere were mostly stable. High-end 

  homes remained difficult to sell in most parts of the region. Reports noted 

  that commercial real estate markets remained weak in January and February. Vacancy 

  rates increased in some metropolitan markets, and new construction was largely 

  limited to public works projects. Several contacts noted that generous lease 

  incentives were prevalent, but absorption remained at low levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall, factory activity remained lackluster in January and February. Most 

  manufacturing firms reported no significant increases in demand. Inventories 

  remained lean, and capital spending plans were subdued. Petrochemical and ammonia 

  plants in Louisiana have announced job reductions because of high natural gas 

  prices. Production has been scaled back at a steel plate plant in Alabama because 

  of slack industrial demand. The District's timber and forest products industry 

  continued to experience low prices and stiff competition from imports from Canada, 

  Europe, and South America. Contractors for NASA in Florida and Louisiana expressed 

  concern that activity may slow following the Columbia tragedy. The most positive 

  reports came from firms supplying the new vehicle assembly plants in the District 

  and from defense contractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism and Business Travel
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Tourism contacts reported a gradual improvement in business conditions in January 

  and February. In Florida, reports suggested that the level of activity still 

  lagged behind that of early 2001 but exceeded year-ago levels. The number of 

  visitors to Miami over the past few months was boosted by the success of several 

  special events in the city and particularly inclement weather in the North. 

  Cruise activity remained strong through Florida ports. Gaming revenue was characterized 

  as exceptional for Louisiana casinos over the holidays, but the pace dropped 

  off in January.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Responses from the banking sector were mostly positive in January and February. 

  Residential loan demand and refinancing activity continued to be strong overall, 

  although there were reports of increasing mortgage default rates in some areas. 

  The vast majority of commercial loan activity was among businesses refinancing 

  existing loans. Banking contacts reported ongoing moderate deposit growth. Venture 

  capital investment activity remained low in most of the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most business contacts continued to report that they were reluctant to increase 

  permanent staffing levels. However, a number of firms noted that they had increased 

  the use of overtime and part-time workers during January and February. Local 

  and state governments were cutting back on hiring plans because of budget constraints. 

  The main areas of employment growth were in the health-care sector and at newly 

  expanded vehicle production facilities in the District. Insurance costs continued 

  to escalate throughout the District, and while most reports indicated little 

  change in output prices, input costs related to oil and gas increased significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Some crops in southern Florida and south Louisiana received moderate frost damage 

  in February, but most areas emerged largely unscathed from recent cold snaps. 

  Winter rains have helped reduce drought conditions in several District locations.
