      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 1, 1995
     </strong>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts, the Southeast economy continued to grow 
through mid-October, although there were some signs of slowing. In 
particular, retail sales for September were described as below 
expectations. Goods production generally held steady, while tourism 
and business travel was again a bright spot in most of the District. 
New home construction remained stable but healthy in most of the 
District, while contractors working on commercial and multifamily 
projects reported good growth over year-ago levels. Bankers saw 
overall loan demand as flat. Most contacts said there was little 
change in wage and price pressures compared with the last time we 
spoke to them.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to retailers throughout the District, sales during 
September were below expectations, although volumes were up slightly 
over year-ago levels. Most merchants reported that inventories were 
heavy with fall merchandise, but they were hopeful that cooler 
weather would spur consumer buying. However, many retailers have 
revised downward their expectations for the upcoming holiday 
shopping season. Hurricane Opal closed stores in the panhandle of 
Florida for three days, dampening early October sales. Auto sales 
remained flat in most of the District, although some dealers 
reported that they had been constrained by low supplies because of 
the recent strike in the hauling industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to manufacturers, goods production was little changed from 
the last Beigebook. Shipments and new orders remained flat, and most 
contacts expect only a moderate increase over current production 
levels in the near term. As a result, a majority of firms contacted 
do not expect to increase their payrolls in the near future. Factory 
inventories of finished goods have risen recently, but contacts 
generally felt that these accumulations would only be temporary. 
Several trucking firms reported a reduction of the number of loads 
that they are shipping from regional factories. Layoffs in the 
apparel industry continue to be recorded in many parts of the 
District. However, job gains in other sectors, such as electronics 
and food processing, have apparently been large enough to offset 
these losses, leaving overall manufacturing employment levels 
essentially unchanged. Several factory managers in Georgia reported 
that renewed strength in exports has helped boost their shipments, 
while many building supply firms expect to see a boost in new orders 
and production as a result of the rebuilding that will occur in the 
aftermath of hurricane Opal. The energy extraction industry is 
showing signs of revival; a large regional, oil rig construction 
company will hire 350 workers over the next year. Paper producers 
and automotive suppliers reported relatively weak levels of new 
orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business travel and tourism continue to do well in most of the 
District. Fall bookings are said to be running well ahead of year-
ago levels in central Florida. In: addition to the development of, 
new attractions, the recent announcement of expansions at several 
existing recreational facilities in central Florida is expected to 
further boost tourism to the area. Reflecting this strong recent 
showing, the hotel industry in central Florida reports good 
occupancy rates despite the addition of large number of new rooms in 
the last year. Contacts report that Miami's cruise industry has been 
adversely affected by hurricane damage inflicted upon the 
destination resort islands of St. Thomas and St.Croix. Tourism 
related to the casino and gambling industry continues to surge on 
Mississippi's Gulf Coast, although in New Orleans two floating 
casinos were closed recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Realtors described single-family home sales in the District as 
stable but healthy in September and early October. Home sales and 
new construction remained strongest in the Atlanta and Nashville 
markets. Building in the New Orleans area continued to be dominated 
by the remodeling and restoration projects that were necessitated by 
late-spring flooding. Inventories of homes for sale continue to be 
low in several local markets, but sales prices appear to have 
stabilized in most of the region. Contractors in the panhandle of 
Florida expect to be quite busy in the next few months repairing the 
nearly 18,000 homes that were partially or completely destroyed by 
hurricane Opal. Generally, both Realtors and builders are optimistic 
about their prospects through the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate contacts across the District again reported gains in 
commercial and multifamily construction. Most office and retail 
projects continue to be build-to-suit, but contacts said that some 
speculative projects have gotten underway in recent months. Low 
vacancy rates continue to spur new apartment development in many 
local markets. Real estate professionals anticipate that both 
commercial and multifamily construction will remain vigorous through 
the end of 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A majority of the bank representatives contacted in the last month 
characterized overall loan demand as steady. Commercial lending 
continues to be the source of loan growth in much of the District. 
Several bankers reported that commercial real estate and company 
buyouts were two of the stronger areas of demand for financing. 
Consumer loan demand, particularly the financing of automobile 
purchases, remains soft in most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage increases generally were reported to be stable, although wage 
pressures are still reported in areas that continue to experience a 
shortage of workers. According to industry spokespersons, 
construction workers, machine operators, and food service workers 
are the sectors in which demand for labor has been greatest. Most 
contacts reported little change in the prices they received for 
finished goods or in the prices they paid for raw materials.
