      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       March 3, 2004
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy continued to grow in January and February.  Manufacturing activity expanded further, and retail sales excluding autos were up moderately.  Housing and energy activity generally maintained a brisk pace, and agricultural conditions remained favorable overall.  On the negative side, auto sales fell slightly, and commercial real estate remained weak.  Labor markets also remained slack, although some increases in hiring were noted.  Wage and price increases were generally minimal, but rising costs of materials appeared to be putting some upward pressure on manufacturers' output prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Non-auto retail sales in the district were solid in January and 
              February, as most stores reported moderate increases from a year 
              ago. Among product categories, sales were particularly strong for 
              most kinds of apparel and home improvement items. With the recent 
              solid sales, most store managers were satisfied with inventory levels 
              and planned typical increases in stocks heading into spring. Most 
              managers remain optimistic that solid year-over-year sales growth 
              will continue in coming months, and some stores plan modest increases 
              in hiring. In contrast to non-auto retail sales, sales of motor 
              vehicles weakened somewhat in January and February and were below 
              year-ago levels in much of the district. With the weaker-than-expected 
              overall sales, inventories at most dealerships were higher than 
              desired. On the positive side, some dealers reported a pick-up in 
              used vehicle sales, and nearly all dealers expect total vehicle 
              sales to improve in coming months. Tourism activity in the district 
              was generally strong. Rocky Mountain ski areas reported increased 
              out-of-state visits in February, and activity was especially brisk 
              over the President's Day weekend. Airport traffic also increased 
              further in most cities. Heading forward, travel agents generally 
              report solid bookings for spring leisure travel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity expanded further in January and 
              February, although rising input costs were putting increased pressure 
              on many firms' profit margins. Plants generally reported higher 
              levels of capacity utilization than in previous surveys, and shipments 
              remained well above year-ago levels. Factory employment and hours 
              were also reported to be slightly higher than in previous surveys. 
              Firms remained quite optimistic about future production, due in 
              part to persistent order backlogs and low levels of finished goods 
              inventories. In a change from past surveys, contacts in the aircraft 
              manufacturing sector were also cautiously optimistic. Most manufacturing 
              materials remained generally available, and managers expect few 
              changes in lead times heading forward. Many plant managers, however, 
              expressed considerable concern about the effects of recent sharp 
              increases in the price of steel and some energy-based products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity continued at high levels in January 
              and February, while commercial real estate markets remained weak. 
              Although single-family housing starts edged down in most district 
              cities, starts generally remained near last year's strong levels. 
              Moreover, most builders expect home construction to strengthen somewhat 
              through the spring, over and above the normal seasonal increase. 
              Realtors reported that home sales were flat to slightly higher in 
              most district cities following modest declines in late 2003. Home 
              prices were basically unchanged from previous surveys. Realtors 
              generally expect continued improvement in home sales and moderate 
              increases in home prices in coming months. Mortgage lenders reported 
              a modest rise in mortgage demand, as demand for both new home purchase 
              loans and refinancings increased slightly. Lenders expect mortgage 
              demand to continue to edge higher through the spring. Commercial 
              real estate activity in the district remained weak in January and 
              February. Office vacancy rates and prices for office space were 
              largely unchanged in most district cities. On the positive side, 
              however, sales of office space were up slightly in some cities, 
              and commercial realtors generally expect modest improvements in 
              office markets in 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers report that loans and deposits both held steady since the 
              last survey, leaving loan-deposit ratios unchanged. Demand for home 
              mortgage loans stabilized after falling in the last two surveys, 
              and demand for other loan categories was also little changed. On 
              the deposit side, slight increases in liquid accounts and small 
              time deposits were offset by a decline in large CDs. All respondent 
              banks left their prime lending rates and consumer lending rates 
              unchanged. A few rural banks tightened lending standards, citing 
              concerns about local business activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District energy activity maintained a brisk pace in January and 
              February. The count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region 
              was unchanged from the previous survey and still 30 percent above 
              year-ago levels. Some producers reported that a shortage of qualified 
              rig crews was constraining expansion of drilling. Most energy contacts 
              expect slow but sustained growth in drilling activity in coming 
              months, as energy prices are expected to remain high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural conditions generally remained solid in January 
              and February, although the drought continued to have some adverse 
              effects. District bankers reported minimal financial impact on producers 
              from the mad cow incident last December, and credit reviews generally 
              showed improvement in farm loan portfolios during the past year 
              due to strong cattle and grain prices. Farmland values also remained 
              high in most parts of the district. On the negative side, the winter 
              wheat crop remained dry. Also, while ample hay supplies kept forage 
              plentiful, lingering drought conditions caused most cattle producers 
              to continue to delay expansion of their herds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage and price increases generally remained modest in January and 
              February, but there were more signs of upward price pressures in 
              manufacturing. As in the previous survey, hiring announcements by 
              district firms exceeded layoff announcements. Nevertheless, reports 
              of labor shortages remained relatively scarce outside of the health 
              care, energy, and trucking industries, and most firms continued 
              to offer only cost-of-living wage increases. Most retailers reported 
              flat prices compared with previous surveys and expect little change 
              in their prices heading forward. Builders reported rising costs 
              for some materials, including lumber, sheetrock, and steel products, 
              and they expect continued increases through the spring. In the manufacturing 
              sector, firms noted sharp cost increases for steel and some energy-based 
              products. To cover these cost increases, a sizable number of firms 
              either increased selling prices or plan to do so in coming months. 
              A couple of firms said they would have to raise output prices just 
              to stay in business. A few other firms, however, reported they were 
              able to increase productivity enough to offset the higher costs.
