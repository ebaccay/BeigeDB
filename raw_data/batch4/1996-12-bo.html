      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The New England economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Most First

District manufacturers are posting solid gains, retailers report scattered pick-ups in activity, and

personnel supply firms continue to grow, but at a less hectic pace than in the recent past.  The

region's residential real estate markets are steady and growth continues at money management firms.

Prices remain generally stable, contacts say, while wages are rising 2 to 6 percent and some

employers note selective hiring difficulties.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most retail contacts in the First District report a pick-up in sales activity for some

period during October and the first half of November.  They attribute these improvements, in some

cases temporary, to colder weather, early holiday shopping, or increased promotions.  Overall results

for the six weeks vary, however, ranging from 10 percent sales declines to gains of 13 percent

compared with a year earlier.  Most respondents detect a rise in consumer confidence and view the

economy as "OK but not exciting."   They predict 2 to 6 percent sales growth in December; growth

will be restrained because four fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas could cut

gains by as much as 3 to 5 percentage points.
       <p>
        Vendor and customer prices remain stable, although one respondent cites continued

declines in  apparel prices.  Lumber prices have stabilized, following a significant rise and fall earlier

this year.  Retailers have intentionally trimmed inventories compared with a year ago to avoid last

January's overstock.  Most contacts are posting increased profits and gross margins, which they

attribute to better inventory management.  Only one retail chain noted major increases in capital

spending and employment.  Merchants plan to increase wages 2 to 5 percent in 1997.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Most First District manufacturing contacts report continued 5 to 15 percent growth

in revenues and/or orders from year-ago levels, and they are at least cautiously optimistic about

future business.  Demand for furniture, appliances, other consumer durables, and medical and

computer equipment is said to be strong.  Contacts are experiencing moderate to rapid growth in

automotive-related business, but some express concern about a possible slowdown late next year or

thereafter.  Aircraft-related orders are picking up significantly, mostly as a result of improved

profitability of commercial airlines.  The semiconductor industry remains in a slump.   One maker

of consumer durables expects to raise production in order to replenish depleted inventories.  Some

of the remaining contacts express a desire to reduce inventories as part of an overall cost containment

strategy.
         <p>
          Materials costs and selling prices remain fairly stable.  A recent drop in component

costs has led to a larger-than-normal drop in computer prices.  Contacts report slight increases in the

cost of selected metals, furniture-grade lumber, and chemical products, but falling costs for paper and

packaging.
          <p>
           Just over half the respondents report fairly stable U.S. employment levels; most

others have increased employment.  A couple of manufacturers indicate difficulties finding production

workers, but an equal number indicate ample applicants.  Companywide pay increases range from

2.5 to 6 percent.  In the Boston area, compensation packages to attract key technical employees are

said to be escalating rapidly.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Temporary Employment Firms
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Personnel supply contacts in the First District report solid growth into the fourth

quarter of 1996.  The outstanding growth that earlier characterized the industry leveled off for most

firms in the third quarter:  revenues are now expanding 10 to 20 percent annually, down from 20 to

30 percent in 1995 and the first half of 1996.
            <p>
             Industrywide consolidation has increased contacts? reliance on partnerships and

subcontracts with other personnel supply firms.  Vendor-on-premises operations dominate, hurting

smaller local temp firms and favoring national companies large enough to meet the full range of

employment demands of clients.
             <p>
              Demand for highly skilled temporary workers continues to outpace supply, especially

in technical and clerical fields.  Wages have risen 8 to 10 percent over the past year, but this reflects

primarily an influx of workers from higher-paying sectors rather than expanding wages of individual

workers.  Tightness in the labor market has forced temp agencies to adopt more aggressive recruiting

techniques, including automated resume retrieval, personal networks, and the Internet, as well as

enhanced pay and benefit packages.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Residential Real Estate
               </strong>
               <br/>
               The residential real estate market in most of New England was stable in the third

quarter.  Sales volumes have been constant in most states, and contacts report no significant changes

in prices.  Contacts in Rhode Island, Vermont, and Maine report that buyers have a large selection

of houses to choose from in all price ranges.  However, no price reductions have been observed so

far.  Low-end houses have been selling better than higher-priced ones.
               <p>
                The market in Massachusetts is doing better.  Sales have gone up throughout the

state, especially in the condominium and new construction markets.  Massachusetts had the highest

increase in existing home sales in the country in both the second and third quarters.  Despite the

increase in activity, inventory grew slightly during the third quarter.  While median sales prices rose

moderately in most of the state, the increases largely reflect a shift in mix as people trade up to more

expensive homes.
                <p>
                 Overall, most contacts predict that the market will remain steady over the next few

months.  While low interest rates and a generally positive economic outlook should stimulate sales,

activity usually slows in the winter.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Nonbank Financial Services
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  Investment management firms report substantial increases in assets under management

since the beginning of the third quarter of 1996.  Inflows into stock funds were high in September

and slowed somewhat in October.  Bond funds experienced inflows in September but were in net

liquidation in October.  Most respondents increased employment in the third quarter.  Salary increases

are reported to be about 5 percent, the same as last year.
