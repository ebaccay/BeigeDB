      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 17, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy continues to move forward, but activity 
in some sectors is feeling a chill. Several factors remain positive. 
Continued tightness in labor markets indicates that many firms are 
not experiencing any slackening in activity. Farm income and 
spending show improvement, and petroleum exploration and metal 
mining are strong. Winter tourism businesses are reaping the 
benefits of favorable weather for snowmobiling and skiing. There are 
few indications of price pressures.
      <p>
       But while the economy continues to grow, the rate of growth 
apparently is slowing due to weakness in a number of areas. 
Builders' order books are getting thinner. Consumer spending on 
vehicles and general merchandise is subdued. Manufacturers describe 
diminishing orders for a variety of goods. Output of paper and other 
forest products is slowing in response to lower demand.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        "Builders have some work, but there is no backlog any more," is how 
one Minnesota lumber dealer characterizes the construction sector. 
While it is difficult to quantify trends in the trough of the winter 
slowdown, the consensus across much of the Minneapolis district is 
that the 1996 construction season will be somewhat slower than in 
the preceding three years. However some areas, particularly Fargo, 
N. D., and western Montana, report brisk construction activity.
        <p>
         Natural resource industries
Natural resource industries are generally robust, with the exception 
of the forest products sector. Oil and gas exploration continue to 
boom. The drilling rig count of 19 in North Dakota in early January 
is double that of a year ago and over three times that of early 
1994. Output at iron, copper and gold mines shows only seasonal 
slowing.
         <p>
          But forest product production is slowing. "A number of paper mills 
are scheduling some selected downtime," says the head of one 
Minnesota logging firm. Paper prices are dropping for the first time 
in two years and many mills are slowing production. Reduced demand 
reportedly is slowing output in other forest product areas. Lumber 
output has slowed, but oriented-strand board producers generally 
continue to produce at capacity. They face lower prices which 
industry sources attribute to a combination of new capacity in other 
regions of the country and to somewhat reduced building activity 
compared to a year earlier.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Agriculture
           </strong>
           <br/>
           As farmers plan for the 1996 season, there is general optimism about 
crops, but the outlook for livestock remains somber. Bankers 
responding to a Minneapolis Fed survey of agricultural credit 
conditions for the final quarter of 1995 generally described farm 
income and spending as up from earlier in that year, but still 
somewhat below normal levels. A majority expected higher crop prices 
to prevail into 1996, and many expected continued improvement in 
farm spending in early 1996. However, bankers in areas where cattle 
production is important stress the continuing financial pressures on 
their customers, and expect little improvement in the new year.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Manufacturing
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Other developments in agriculture include 10 to 40 basis point 
declines in farm interest rates from the preceding quarter. Land 
prices are generally up 2 percent to 4 percent over year-earlier 
levels. Many sources cite continuing uncertainty about federal 
agricultural programs as a disincentive to longer-term planning and 
investment by farmers. In midwinter, soil moisture levels are 
favorable and the winter has not been unduly hard on livestock.
            <p>
             "We are sort of treading water, and we don't see it getting better 
very soon," says a business analyst at an electronic device 
manufacturer in Minnesota. The outlook is even less positive for a 
maker of components for trucks and heavy equipment: "Our new orders 
are just falling off a cliff," says the company's CEO. The bloom is 
definitely off the rose for many manufacturers; earnings of publicly 
traded corporations are slowing and industrial electrical use in 
Minnesota and South Dakota is falling below five-year trends in 
several categories. Nonelectrical machinery production seems 
particularly slow.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Consumer spending
              </strong>
              <br/>
              "In a word, it's been difficult," says a representative of one 
Minneapolis-based retailer in describing a lackluster holiday sales 
season. Several other large retail chains echo that view, and the 
consensus for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area is holiday season sales 
of general merchandise sales were below retailers' plans and only 
modestly above 1994 levels. But news from some smaller cities across 
the district is more positive. Sioux Falls, S. D., Marquette, Mich., 
and Billings, Mont., all report strong holiday sales. There also 
seems to be variation by product category. Apparel is described as 
particularly slow and toy sales somewhat below expectations, while 
stores selling home computers and electronic items fared somewhat 
better. Some reports indicate that smaller specialty stores did 
somewhat better than mass merchandisers, as consumers spent less but 
more selectively.
              <p>
               Auto sales show little change from late fall, generally slow with 
some regional variation. Sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks 
show the most strength; conventional sedan sales are the weakest.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Tourism
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Snowmobilers and skiers have been out in force as early snow boosted 
tourism in the eastern part of the district. Business at tourism 
establishments is up 5 percent to 6 percent in the Upper Peninsula 
of Michigan for the last quarter of 1995 compared to a year earlier, 
according to one official. A northern Wisconsin town saw a 50 
percent increase in tourism activity in December compared to 1994 
when snow was sparse. Business at a ski resort in northern Minnesota 
is up 10 percent to 15 percent for the season. An executive of a ski 
resort in Montana reports a slightly softer market due in part to 
the Canadian exchange rate. "People are tightening a little," she 
says. Montana businesses adjacent to Glacier and Yellowstone 
national parks complain that the federal government shutdown of most 
park activities is hurting their winter business.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Employment, wages and prices
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 "It is still hard to get good workers," reports a North Dakota plant 
manager expressing a common sentiment in the district. Unemployment 
rates remain well below national averages, and many businesses 
employing skilled technicians or entry-level workers find it 
particularly difficult to fill all positions. Few employers report 
large across-the-board wage increases but some are extending 
benefits to previously uncovered workers.
                 <p>
                  News of price decreases outnumbers that of increases. Reductions in 
paper and packaging prices are reported for the first time in 18 
months. Ferrous and nonferrous metals are also reportedly down from 
a year ago and there are no problems in deliveries. Grain prices 
remain high, and soybean prices have increased since harvest, but 
continuing low livestock prices have kept food price increases low. 
Gasoline and other motor fuels continue about 5 cents per gallon 
below year-earlier levels.
