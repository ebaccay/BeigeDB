     Economic conditions in the Southeast were mixed 
            during December and early January. According to contacts, retail sales 
            were mediocre, and vehicle sales declined for some makes and models. 
            Residential real estate markets remained solid, but weakness in commercial 
            real estate markets persisted. The manufacturing sector also remained 
            weak, but there were indications of a modest pickup in orders for 
            some industries and more stability in employment levels. Bank loan 
            activity was still concentrated in the consumer sector, although a 
            modest increase in demand for financing of mergers and acquisitions 
            was noted. Travel activity improved further from the lows experienced 
            after September 11, but hotel occupancy was still below normal. An 
            early January snowstorm temporarily disrupted economic activity in 
            parts of the District. Inflation indicators were mostly subdued.
     <p>
      <b>
       Consumer Spending
      </b>
      <br/>
      Deep discounting was widespread during the holiday season as retailers 
              struggled to make sales. Sales results were mixed across product 
              types, and discount stores continued to fare better than other types 
              of retailers. Apparel sales were difficult because of unusually 
              mild weather in early December. Sales of home electronic and other 
              home-related products were generally strong. According to contacts, 
              post-holiday traffic was down compared with recent years, although 
              some also noted that the amount of clearance merchandise available 
              was also lower.
      <p>
       December vehicle sales were mixed. Car sales were 
              reported to have declined sharply for some makes and models, but 
              there were gains in light truck segments and for popular SUV models. 
              Meanwhile, used car dealers reported large inventories and weak 
              prices.
       <p>
        <b>
         Real Estate and Construction
        </b>
        <br/>
        The District's single-family home markets continued to perform well 
              in December. The demand for low- to mid-priced homes was strong, 
              while the demand for high-priced homes remained soft in several 
              markets. Contacts suggested that home sales may have equaled or 
              surpassed year-ago levels in December, while the pace of new home 
              construction was near the level of a year ago.
        <p>
         Commercial real estate markets have changed little 
              since our last report, with conditions remaining weak in most areas. 
              Vacancy rates increased in some markets, and the increasing abundance 
              of sublease space across the District kept absorption low. Construction 
              levels have slowed considerably over the year, and current commercial 
              construction is dominated by build-to-suit and government projects.
         <p>
          <b>
           Manufacturing
          </b>
          <br/>
          Factory activity remained weak in December, and further job cuts 
              were announced in several industries. Some companies reported reductions 
              in part-time workers and the elimination of extra shifts. However, 
              reports were also more mixed than in recent months. Several firms 
              noted a modest pickup in new orders and were rehiring some of their 
              recently laid-off staff. Also, while one large auto manufacturer 
              was considering cutting capacity at a District assembly plant, some 
              other auto producers in the District were working overtime to keep 
              up with demand. The District's defense contractors continued to 
              benefit from contracts for a variety of projects, and a producer 
              of health-care products announced plans to expand capacity because 
              of continued strong demand.
          <p>
           <b>
            Tourism and Business Travel
           </b>
           <br/>
           Travel activity continued to improve in December from the lows experienced 
              following September 11, but hotel occupancy was still below normal 
              in several locations. In south Florida, occupancies remained held 
              down by the decline in international tourists. The size of the price 
              discounting for hotel rooms, cruises, and rental cars has lessened 
              in markets where traffic has nudged higher. Activity at Mississippi 
              Gulf Coast casinos remained solid. The New Orleans economy will 
              benefit from hosting the Super Bowl in early February, and early 
              bookings for the Carnival season are encouraging. An unexpectedly 
              severe snowstorm in parts of the District in early January disrupted 
              travel activity.
           <p>
            <b>
             Financial
            </b>
            <br/>
            Loan activity remained mixed. The consumer sector was robust in 
              most parts of the District. Refinancing and home equity loan activity 
              was "booming," according to some contacts. Delinquency rates on 
              consumer loans continued to increase but remained at low levels 
              overall. Commercial loan demand remained soft, but banks reported 
              some increase in merger and acquisition activity in the District.
            <p>
             <b>
              Wages and Prices
             </b>
             <br/>
             Wage and price pressures were subdued in the District. According 
              to some reports, the size of year-end bonuses or pay increases for 
              salaried workers was lower than in recent years. Hospitals continued 
              to hire aggressively and offer large signing bonuses. Reports again 
              suggested that recent price increases have been limited to health-care 
              costs, security costs, and insurance premiums. Home price increases 
              continued to moderate, while previous sharp declines in prices for 
              hotel accommodations and other travel-related services abated in 
              areas where demand has recovered. Low energy prices continued to 
              moderate gas and oil extraction activity in Louisiana.
             <p>
              <b>
               Agriculture
              </b>
              <br/>
              Crop producers in the District remain pressured by low market prices. 
              Prices were well below year-ago levels for cotton, soybeans, and 
              peanuts. However, lower crop prices have helped reduce feed costs 
              for the District's large poultry industry as well as cattle producers. 
              Early indications suggest that the 2001 sugar harvest will fall 
              short of last year because of recent drought conditions, but prices 
              for Florida's citrus products continued to improve on reports of 
              weaker growing conditions in Brazil.
