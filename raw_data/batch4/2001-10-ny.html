      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 24, 2001
      </strong>
     </p>
     Economic conditions in the Second District have 
            weakened since the last report. It is unclear how much of the weakening 
            may be attributed to the material disruptions and aftermath of the 
            September 11 terrorist attack. The disaster's impact was particularly 
            evident in Manhattan real estate, retail trade and tourism. Many businesses 
            in the District are facing downward price pressures from weakening 
            demand and lower commodity prices. Labor markets have shown signs 
            of deteriorating since the last report. Department stores report that 
            sales fell well below plan during the week of the attack, though they 
            have recovered modestly in each of the past few weeks.
     <p>
      Home sales in and around New York City have slowed 
              drastically since the last report, and both apartment prices and 
              rents have fallen by an estimated 10 percent. In general, contacts 
              note that the high end of the market has been the most affected. 
              Contrary to initial post-attack expectations, Manhattan's office 
              market has not tightened--availability rates at the end of September 
              were slightly higher than a month earlier. Hotels, taxi drivers, 
              and Broadway theaters experienced a steep falloff in business in 
              mid-September, but activity has reportedly recovered somewhat in 
              the weeks since. Finally, bankers again report weaker loan demand, 
              tighter credit standards, and moderately higher delinquency rates 
              in the latest survey, taken in early October.
      <p>
       <b>
        Consumer Spending
       </b>
       <br/>
       General merchandise retailers report that sales were well below 
              plan in September and early October, though discount and home improvement 
              chains describe sales as close to plan. Department store sales in 
              the region fell sharply during the week of September 11--particularly 
              at Manhattan stores--but have recovered steadily in subsequent weeks. 
              Still, as of early October, sales remained lower than a year ago 
              and well below plan. For the month as a whole, sales at Manhattan 
              stores were said to be 20-30 percent below normal, while comparable-store 
              declines in the rest of the region ranged from 4 to 13 percent. 
              Broad-based weakness was reported across major merchandise categories, 
              although some contacts note relative strength in furniture and lawn 
              and garden supplies. Most contacts report an overhang of inventories 
              and are responding with steep markdowns. Most major chains have 
              scaled down Christmas-season sales expectations, to varying degrees. 
              On average, dollar sales volume is expected to be down 1-2 percent 
              from last year.
       <p>
        Discount chains, which have a very limited presence 
              in New York City, report that sales in the region were only modestly 
              below plan, boosted by home entertainment merchandise (DVDs, etc.) 
              and security-related merchandise (alarms, etc). One contact notes 
              some shift in business from weekends to weekdays and says that consumers 
              have grown increasingly budget-conscious in recent weeks.
        <p>
         Major retail chains report that some stores closed 
              for most of the day on September 11 but that all re-opened on the 
              following day. Scattered delivery and shipping delays were reported--mostly 
              at border crossings--but no major problems were reported. A large 
              number of retail outlets in the World Trade Center complex were 
              destroyed, and virtually all major stores in Lower Manhattan were 
              closed for at least a week--a major department store and a leading 
              electronics store remain closed indefinitely.
         <p>
          <b>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </b>
          <br/>
          Manhattan's office market was thrown into turmoil by the destruction 
              of the World Trade Center (3 percent of Manhattan space), as well 
              as damage to adjacent structures (another 4 percent), most of which 
              should be habitable within 2 to 9 months. However, market conditions 
              have not tightened as expected--availability rates at the end of 
              September were slightly higher than a month earlier. Leasing activity 
              has picked up dramatically, as displaced firms secure new space--mostly 
              in Manhattan, but also in northern New Jersey and, to a lesser extent, 
              in the outer boroughs and eastern and northern suburbs. Still, many 
              of the displaced firms have diminished space needs. Moreover, on 
              the supply side, firms outside the damaged area placed excess space 
              on the market. The net result was the slight increase in Manhattan's 
              availability rate. By early 2002, as most of the damaged properties 
              re-open, availability rates are expected to rise even further.
          <p>
           Housing markets in and around New York City have 
              clearly weakened further since the last report. A leading Manhattan 
              rental real estate firm reports that the market has slowed significantly 
              in recent months but notes that it is difficult to assess the impact 
              of the terrorist attack versus cyclical forces. After accounting 
              for increased concessions--such as a free month--Manhattan rents 
              (north of Canal Street) appear to be averaging about 10 percent 
              lower than a year ago. In Lower Manhattan, demand has fallen off 
              sharply, and it is difficult to assess current market rents.
           <p>
            Similarly, contacts in the apartment appraisal 
              and brokerage industries note that co-op and condo transactions 
              ground to a halt during the week of the attack and have edged up 
              only moderately in recent weeks, while prices have fallen by roughly 
              10 percent. Even prices stipulated in a number of signed contracts 
              have been renegotiated. As in the rental market, Lower Manhattan 
              is said to be particularly sluggish, but market conditions appear 
              to be holding up relatively well uptown, with a few reports of multiple 
              offers on apartments.
            <p>
             Homebuilders in northern New Jersey report some 
              softening at the high end of the market. Some buyers are said to 
              have shelved deals on construction not yet begun (pre-contract). 
              However, one contact still notes that there remains a shortage of 
              housing, and people that need to move are still buying, though typically 
              with fewer amenities. Separately, a realtor in northern New Jersey 
              reports that there were virtually no sales transacted in the three 
              weeks following the attack, and that it is difficult to gauge price 
              trends.
             <p>
              <b>
               Other Business Activity
              </b>
              <br/>
              A major New York City employment agency says that the local job 
              market has slackened noticeably since the last report, with particular 
              weakness in financial services; however, demand from law firms remains 
              strong. Wages are said to have leveled off and are little changed 
              from a year ago.
              <p>
               Tourism-related industries experienced a steep 
              drop-off in activity in September, though there has been some improvement 
              in early October. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates, 
              which had already been slumping for most of this year, fell 25 percent 
              below normal in September, and many hotels have slashed room rates. 
              New York City taxi drivers have reportedly experienced a steep drop-off 
              in business; income was reported to have fallen by as much as 50 
              percent in the weeks following the terrorist attack. Broadway theaters 
              report some rebound in attendance in October, following a dramatic 
              falloff in mid to late September.
               <p>
                On a more positive note, there are some signs 
              of stabilization in the region's manufacturing sector. New York 
              State manufacturers report some pickup in general business conditions 
              and new orders in September and early October, but express increased 
              pessimism about the six-month outlook--largely reflecting concern 
              about the residual effects of the terrorist attack. Manufacturers 
              continue to report downward price pressures, though to a lesser 
              extent than in the last report.
                <p>

                  Financial Developments
                 </b>
                 <br/>
                 According to the latest survey of small to medium-sized Second District 
              banks--conducted in early October--demand for most types of loans 
              fell noticeably over the past two months, except in the residential 
              mortgage category, where demand picked up moderately. Widespread 
              increases were also reported in refinancing activity. On the supply 
              side, banks again tightened credit standards for all types of loans 
              except home mortgages, where standards remained stable. Virtually 
              all respondents reported declines in both loan rates and deposit 
              rates. Delinquency rates rose for consumer, residential mortgage 
              and commercial loans, but were little changed for commercial mortgages.
