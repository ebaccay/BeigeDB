      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy continued to expand in late January 
and February but at a slightly slower pace. Manufacturing orders 
rose, and activity at business service firms remained very strong. 
Retail sales slowed, however, and some contacts said that Texas 
sales were among the weakest in the nation. Construction activity 
was steady as an increase in commercial construction offset a 
decline in homebuilding. Loan demand continued to rise. Energy 
activity declined seasonally and remained below last year's levels. 
Agricultural production was better than expected. Despite the growth 
in the district economy, respondents in several industries said 
expectations of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and uncertainty over 
the effects of the Mexican peso devaluation had reduced their 
optimism.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District respondents continued to report price and wage 
pressures in some industries, but several manufacturers expected 
price pressures to ease in the coming months. In the service 
industry, fees continued to rise for temporary, consulting and legal 
services. Trucking fees were down because Texas intrastate trucking 
deregulation resulted in increased competition. In manufacturing, 
selling prices were up for paper products, raw timber and cement. 
Contacts in the petrochemical, fabricated metals and glass 
industries said prices had likely peaked and expected prices to 
soften in the spring. Retailers said prices were flat to down 
despite increased cost pressure from suppliers. Oil prices were up 
slightly while natural gas prices had stabilized at a low level. In 
agriculture, cotton prices were up and livestock prices remained 
low. Because of recruiting difficulties, wage pressures rose in the 
temporary services, trucking and fabricated metals industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing orders continued to rise, but respondents expressed 
less optimism that economic activity would continue to increase at 
the current pace. Demand continued to be strongest for electronics, 
paper, petrochemicals and construction-related materials, while 
apparel orders weakened. Semiconductor and computer-related orders 
rose at a strong pace and selling prices remained stable. The demand 
for paper and boxes continued to increase despite falling orders 
from Mexican customers. Orders for construction-related 
manufacturing products picked up as commercial construction 
increased. Fabricated metals producers reported very strong demand 
and were finding it difficult to hire qualified workers. Cement 
orders rose due to warmer-than-usual weather and significant 
construction backlogs. Demand for lumber remained unchanged overall, 
but orders from commercial contractors were up. Excluding jeans, 
apparel orders softened, a result of slower retail sales. Contacts 
said higher prices for cotton and paper products had raised costs, 
although only a small portion was passed on to customers. Garment 
finishers said that business was steady. Orders for food products 
rose at a moderate pace and sales of low-fat products were strong. 
Demand continued to be extremely strong for petrochemicals but 
additional capacity had dampened price pressures. Demand for refined 
products was robust, with sales of gasoline and other products 
running at levels above a year ago. The exception was fuel oil which 
did not sell well because of warm winter weather in the Midwest and 
Northeast. Refiners shifted production toward gasoline which drove 
down prices and kept margins thin. Orders for oil-field machinery 
were reported to be good, although the rig count slipped as drilling 
declined seasonally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity at business services firms continued to rise at a 
robust pace. Demand for temporary services was strong and 
respondents said that recruiting problems remained. Demand for 
management/consulting services rose as companies streamlined 
computer systems and prepared to enter international markets. Legal 
firms said activity associated with mergers and acquisitions and 
initial public offerings was still strong, but litigation business 
was flat. Transportation service respondents said that air cargo 
volume rose and trucking demand was flat despite reduced shipments 
to Mexico.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales slowed in February, and sales along the Texas-Mexico 
border continued to decline. Several national retailers said that 
Texas sales were among the weakest in the country. Sales growth was 
reported to be slower than expected, and contacts said they were 
less optimistic than a few weeks ago. One retailer said the weak 
Mexican peso appeared to be affecting sales throughout Texas. 
Selling prices were reported to be stable or lower, despite 
increased cost pressure from suppliers. Auto sales were also slower 
in February, and respondents said inventories were too large.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity in the Eleventh District was steady, as rising 
commercial activity continued to offset declines in single-family 
construction. Home builders cut back on construction in January and 
February as they tried to keep the supply of new homes in line with 
lower buyer demand. Despite the cutback in building activity, 
inventories of new homes were rising. Commercial construction 
remained robust and border contacts said that many projects are 
still in the works despite the Mexican peso devaluation. Rising 
demand for industrial, retail and office space helped boost 
commercial builders' expectations of growth in 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District bankers said overall loan demand grew steadily. 
Higher interest rates continued to curb demand for residential 
construction projects, but lending for industrial projects picked 
up. Competition from alternative credit sources kept consumer 
lending flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      District energy producers said activity was generally unchanged. The 
domestic rig count fell seasonally and remained below year-ago 
levels, but international activity improved with better oil prices. 
Oil prices were between $18 and $19 per barrel over the past month 
which is slightly higher than reported in the last beige book. 
Natural gas prices stabilized at about $1.40 per Mcf.
     </p>
     <p>
      Favorable weather boosted the agricultural harvest. District farmers 
said the yields and quality of most crops were good. Cotton 
production was raised by strong domestic demand, although higher 
prices curbed international orders somewhat. Cattle prices remained 
low, keeping profit margins just above break-even levels.
