       Despite disruptions from Hurricane Isabel, economic 
                growth advanced at a modest pace in the Fifth District in late 
                August and September as ongoing moderate expansion in the services 
                sector was partially offset by continued contraction in the manufacturing 
                sector. Hurricane Isabel disrupted retail and services businesses 
                in several District states in mid-to-late September, although 
                relatively few establishments outside of coastal regions experienced 
                significant property damage. Along the coast, tourists were on 
                the move in advance of Isabel's arrival on September 18, but decreases 
                in tourism activity in those areas were partly offset by increases 
                at inland locations as tourists relocated and out-of-region utility 
                crews arrived for repair and clean-up efforts. With the exception 
                of hurricane-related purchases, such as generators, plywood, and 
                batteries, retail sales were generally flat in September. District 
                manufacturing activity weakened since our last report as shipments 
                declined again and employment at factories contracted. Adding 
                to the weaker tone, a small number of manufacturers reported prolonged 
                shutdowns and/or substantial damage resulting from the hurricane. 
                In the housing sector, growth in home sales slowed, but realtors 
                said that activity remained at a high level. In agriculture and 
                fishing, heavy rain and high winds from the hurricane damaged 
                fishing boats and crops and disrupted the feeding of livestock 
                in areas lying in the storm's path.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Fifth District retailers reported generally steady sales over 
                the last six weeks. Only a few contacts, however, reported increased 
                hiring. Many retailers in North Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, 
                D.C., closed on September 18 and for several days thereafter because 
                of power outages in the aftermath of the hurricane. Hardware stores 
                in those areas saw increased sales of chain saws and generators 
                after the storm, and grocers did brisk business as a result of 
                lengthy power outages. Most retailers said that sales lost because 
                of the storm were quickly made up and that the hurricane caused 
                just "a blip" in their monthly sales figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Services businesses reported moderately higher revenues in the 
                weeks since our last report. Executive search firms in the Washington, 
                D.C., area said demand for their services picked up, and a contact 
                at a Baltimore financial services firm said customer demand was 
                strong enough to warrant increased hiring. Effects of Hurricane 
                Isabel were specific to particular services businesses-electric 
                utilities brought in thousands of workers, tree removal companies 
                in central Virginia gained "phenomenal" business, and insurance 
                companies brought in disaster-relief specialists to assess and 
                settle claims. Restaurants were busier than usual as households 
                waited days for electric power to be restored. Also, air traffic 
                and trucking were disrupted by the storm. In the public sector, 
                federal government offices closed for two days because of the 
                hurricane.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The District's manufacturing sector contracted in September: shipments, 
                new orders, capacity utilization and employment fell. Contacts 
                in the chemicals, lumber, and textiles and apparel industries 
                noted particularly sharp declines in shipments. A machinery manufacturer 
                said that they were already half way through September and hadn't 
                put enough [sales] on the book to make the payroll much less pay 
                other expenses. Several textile and apparel manufacturers told 
                us that foreign manufacturers continued to gain market share to 
                the detriment of U.S. textile and apparel companies. Manufacturers 
                overall noted a substantial decline in hiring and modest wage 
                growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hurricane Isabel caused relatively few disruptions 
                to manufacturing operations, though adverse impacts were noted 
                by some District lumber mills. A contact at a North Carolina lumber 
                mill told us that their plant shut down for several days and noted 
                that there would be much lower volumes of standing timber available 
                for sale for years to come. On a brighter note, a counterpart 
                at a Virginia lumber mill said that while his company's orders 
                had dropped because of the storm he felt that there would be a 
                surge in business after roads were cleared and power was restored 
                to the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District loan officers said that growth in overall lending activity 
                declined as residential mortgage refinancings slowed in the weeks 
                since our last report. Residential mortgage refinancing dropped 
                substantially in August and early September as mortgage interest 
                rates climbed well above 6 percent. In addition, new home loan 
                originations grew more slowly as the pace of house sales cooled. 
                Commercial lending, however, showed signs of picking up in some 
                areas. A Richmond, Va., banker, for example, said that businesses 
                were beginning to expand their capital spending and borrowing 
                funds again. In her words, businesses had "put off spending long 
                enough." Commercial lenders in other areas, however, suggested 
                that most business decision makers continued to keep expansion 
                plans on hold, "waiting to see what will happen to the economy."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Although growth in home sales slowed somewhat in several areas 
                of the Fifth District residential realtors continued to report 
                generally strong housing markets. A realtor in Odenton, Md., reported 
                slower growth, but added that the market had been "so insane" 
                in recent months that the slowdown was welcomed. A contact in 
                Washington, D.C., said that the market there was still robust, 
                as was the neighboring market in Prince George's County, Md., 
                where increased gentrification was driving house prices higher. 
                A North Carolina contact reported that although the Greensboro 
                real estate market was still doing relatively well, customer interest 
                had ebbed somewhat in recent weeks. Home prices were reported 
                to be rising moderately in most areas of the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       District realtors reported no major changes 
                in commercial real estate conditions in recent weeks. While there 
                continued to be pockets of improvement, contacts said that the 
                lack of job growth had made many companies cautious and hesitant 
                to commit to new projects. By sector, the leasing of retail space 
                remained steady in most markets, while activity continued to be 
                flat in office and industrial space. Commercial rents dipped and 
                vacancies held firm. Commercial construction activity continued 
                to be "very slow." Looking ahead, realtors expected stronger growth 
                in the fourth quarter--a contact in Columbia, S.C., said he was 
                "cautiously optimistic" regarding activity for the remainder of 
                the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Tourist activity remained mixed in September. Hurricane Isabel 
                battered coastal areas along the Outer Banks of North Carolina 
                and much of Virginia in mid-September causing damage to some coastal 
                hotels and widespread cancellations of hotel reservations. However, 
                one hotel's loss was another's gain in some cases as tourists 
                relocated out of the storm's path. A contact at Emerald Isle, 
                N.C., on the southern Outer Banks told us that bookings there 
                had picked up as the storm passed further to the north. A hotelier 
                at Virginia Beach said that Isabel caused severe damage to some 
                oceanfront resorts resulting in increased business in the better-protected 
                inlet area. Mountainous areas in Virginia and West Virginia also 
                fared well as thousands of people headed west after evacuating 
                from the Virginia Beach and Williamsburg, Va., areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Temporary Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District temporary employment agencies reported increased demand 
                for workers since our last report. Contacts in Hagerstown, Md., 
                and Northern Virginia reported a definite upturn in business activity. 
                Likewise, a Raleigh, N.C., agent reported an increase in corporate 
                confidence and a better response to his agency's marketing efforts. 
                Administrative assistants and customer service representatives 
                were among the occupations in highest demand. There was also a 
                large influx of temporary workers involved in repair and cleanup 
                in the aftermath of the hurricane.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Fishing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Hurricane Isabel brought heavy rain, strong winds, and flooding 
                in low-lying areas in the storm's path. With the exceptions of 
                South Carolina and Washington, D.C., farmers in most areas of 
                the District incurred varying degrees of storm-related crop damage. 
                In Maryland, corn, fruit trees, and soybeans were damaged from 
                flooding. Corn, tobacco, tomatoes, and strawberries were damaged 
                by both water and high winds in northeast North Carolina and in 
                Virginia. Sustained power outages and lack of water were a concern 
                in North Carolina as farmers tried to dry corn, cure tobacco, 
                and provide feed and water to livestock. Scattered losses of cattle 
                were reported and thousands of chickens were lost because of wind 
                damage to poultry houses and a lack of power. District orchards 
                were also hard hit--agricultural officials estimate that a sizeable 
                proportion of the apple crop in Virginia was destroyed. The hurricane-related 
                wind and storm surge also damaged fishing boats, nets, and other 
                equipment along coastal areas. Contacts in the fishing industry 
                expect some long-term damage to the crab and fish populations 
                as a result of the storm.
