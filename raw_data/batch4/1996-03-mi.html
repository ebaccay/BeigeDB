      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, economic activity in the Ninth District economy remains 
  moderate, but there is widespread feeling among businesspeople that 
  the pace of growth is slowing. On one side of the coin, construction 
  continues strong and builders expect another active season. Rising 
  grain prices have generally increased optimism in the agricultural 
  sector, in spite of the squeeze that such prices put on ranchers and 
  on farmers who raise livestock as well as grain. Tourist businesses 
  in eastern areas of the district report good activity, but Montana 
  and the Dakotas have had a disappointing season. Metal mining output 
  remains strong, but some profit margins are eroding as prices for 
  nonferrous and precious metals soften. Labor markets remain tight 
  and unemployment rates low, but there are few reports of wage or 
  price pressures.
      <p>
       On the other side of the coin, manufacturers continue to report 
  slackening orders. Retailers are experiencing sluggish sales of a 
  wide range of durable and nondurable goods. With the exception of a 
  few areas, auto dealers describe sales as slow. There are increasing 
  reports of paper mills cutting production. Agricultural bankers in 
  towns where cattle ranching predominates express alarm about the 
  degree of price declines for feeder cattle and expect that some 
  ranchers will choose or be forced to liquidate their operations.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        "It's just like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps going and going," 
  is how one South Dakota builder's spokesman describes residential 
  and commercial building in his area. That characterization is valid 
  for nearly all of the Minneapolis district as construction 
  approaches a fourth consecutive strong season. Residential building 
  demand, which had slackened somewhat in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
  area in mid-1995, appears to be regaining strength, reportedly in 
  response to lower mortgage interest rates. Sioux Falls, S. D., and 
  Missoula, Mont., anticipate a booming construction season in 1996. 
  Fargo and Grand Forks, N.D., also expect a high level of residential 
  building, although perhaps somewhat down from the fevered pace of 
  1994 and 1995. Dickinson, in western North Dakota, has near-zero 
  available housing as a result of oilfield activity and expects its 
  strongest construction season in years. "Motel construction booms" 
  is the headline in a Rapid City, S. D., newspaper, and Montana 
  sources report that "big box" store building continues despite slow 
  retail sales. Large, publicly let contracts apparently are about 
  level with last year.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Natural resource industries
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Ninth District iron mines shipped 47 million metric tons in 1995, 
  the highest level in over a decade, and expect a strong year in 
  1996. Increasing amounts of taconite pellets are being shipped by 
  rail, reducing the usual winter slowing. Nonferrous mine output is 
  stable in spite of copper prices some 15 percent below year-ago 
  levels and recent slight drops in gold prices. Oil and gas 
  exploration remains active through the winter. Paper mills are 
  slowing output and discounting output prices. Little change is 
  reported in lumber and building board production.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Agriculture
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Record corn prices and much higher wheat prices have brought greater 
  optimism to crop farmers, according to a mid-February survey of 
  agricultural bankers. The mood in grain producing areas is 
  reportedly the most optimistic in more than a decade. Seed corn 
  sales are hitting records, and orders for other inputs such as 
  fertilizers and pesticides are strong. There is some increase in 
  demand for tractors and implements, and good used equipment is 
  reportedly selling well. Uncertainty about federal farm legislation 
  continues, but several sources note that most farmers expect passage 
  of some version of the "Freedom to Farm Act" and no annual acreage 
  set asides or planting restrictions in the next few years.
          <p>
           However, this optimism on the crop side is at least partially offset 
  by depressed livestock prices. The problems of livestock producers 
  have been exacerbated by rising grain prices; the hog-to-corn and 
  cattle-to-corn price ratios are at their most unfavorable levels in 
  decades. Cow-calf producers are the end of the whip that is being 
  cracked, as higher feed costs drive down prices for feeder cattle. 
  Western South Dakota and ranching areas of Montana are particularly 
  hard hit. Bankers and ranchers in these areas expect the level of 
  voluntary and forced liquidations to rise dramatically in 1996.
           <p>
            As the winter ends, winter wheat conditions in Montana and South 
  Dakota are generally good, and soil moisture levels in most areas 
  are excellent. A few areas in the eastern Dakotas continue to suffer 
  from excess moisture and localized flooding.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Manufacturing
             </strong>
             <br/>
             "Orders have been lagging in the first six weeks of 1996, and we 
  expect to turn out less product this year than last," says the owner 
  of a North Dakota manufacturing firm. His sentiments are echoed by 
  the CEO of a Minnesota manufacturer of industrial painting and 
  lubrication equipment. "Business is soft and getting softer," he 
  says. Other sources report that business is still good for medical 
  equipment and computer component manufacturers, but orders are 
  slowing. These reports and other indicators, such as industrial 
  electricity use, generally point to significant slowing in 
  manufacturing. One exception seems to be the printing industry.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Consumer Spending
              </strong>
              <br/>
              "People seem to have a wait-and-see attitude," a Montana retailer 
  reported in mid-February. Her view is corroborated by lackluster 
  sales reports from large retail chains. "Traffic is OK but not 
  great," says a South Dakota mall manager. A Minnesota department 
  store manager notes that small items are selling normally but that 
  buyers seem reluctant to move on washers, refrigerators and other 
  big ticket items.
              <p>
               Automobile sales are similarly slack in most areas. A western 
  Montana dealer reports that 1995 sales were down 12 percent from 
  1994 and that "our outlook for 1996 is very cautious." Some areas 
  report better sales; oil and wheat producing areas of North Dakota 
  and Montana seem to have stronger-than-average vehicle sales. A 
  Minneapolis-St. Paul dealer, however, describes business as "so-so." On balance, consumer buying seems to be quite slow.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Tourism
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Many ski resorts in northwest Montana are having a slow season due 
  to an unfavorable Canadian exchange rate and poor snow conditions, 
  according to a resort executive. The government shutdown hampered 
  visitations to national parks and monuments in South Dakota. A ski 
  resort in northern Minnesota reports level sales compared to last 
  year and looks forward to a strong March. Good snow conditions in 
  northern Wisconsin have boosted snowmobiling and cross-country 
  skiing for January and February compared to a year earlier.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Employment, wages and prices
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 "The shortage of labor has driven up wages a bit," comments a 
  building union official from western Wisconsin. "Our area has been 
  phenomenal in the last two years and there is a shortage of 
  qualified labor." A North Dakota business owner reports "the labor 
  shortage is an ongoing battle." Unemployment rates remain well below 
  national averages. Opinion is divided on which types of labor are 
  scarcest. There are many reports of difficulty in filling entry 
  level positions, and "Help wanted" signs remain ubiquitous, but one 
  manufacturer says, "White collar help is harder to get than assembly 
  line." Reported wage increases continue in the 2 percent to 4 
  percent range.
                 <p>
                  Many Ninth District commodities, including copper, paper, lumber and 
  livestock, have decreased in price. Grains are the strong exception. 
  Because slaughter livestock prices continue low, there is little 
  evidence that sharp increases in grain prices have had effects at 
  the consumer level. But some voices of concern are heard. "I just 
  can't believe the press isn't following these grain prices," says a 
  commodity analyst for a major Minnesota food manufacturer. "We 
  potentially face a supply situation much worse than 1973-74."
