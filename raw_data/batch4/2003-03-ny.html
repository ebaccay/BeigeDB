      <p>
       The Second District's economy has generally softened since the last report, 

  with the notable exception of housing, which appears to have regained some momentum. 

  Signs of weakness are particularly evident in the labor market. While business 

  contacts report increased cost pressures, mainly for insurance and energy, these 

  pressures show no signs of feeding into finished-goods prices. The Presidents 

  Day snowstorm had a large effect on the retail sector but little disruptive 

  effect on manufacturing or shipping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers note that sales were below plan in recent weeks, particularly during 

  and after the blizzard. Selling prices and merchandise costs were described 

  as steady to lower than a year ago, while retail inventories were said to be 

  in fairly good shape. Manufacturers indicate mixed but generally softer conditions 

  in recent weeks; they also note increased upward cost pressures but flat to 

  declining selling prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Home construction and the housing market generally have picked up since the 

  last report, though the upper end of the market remains weak. Manhattan's office 

  market has been stable to slightly weaker in early 2003, with rents continuing 

  to fall. Conditions in New York City's financial industry have reportedly deteriorated 

  since the last report. Finally, bankers report some weakening in consumer loan 

  demand, a modest upturn in consumer delinquency rates, and tighter lending standards 

  on commercial borrowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report that sales were generally below plan in January and the first 

  three weeks of February. Most contacts were not too concerned with January, 

  which is considered a clearance month. However, the Presidents Day snowstorm 

  had a substantial effect on February sales, and contacts generally do not expect 

  to recoup those sales for quite some time. The storm shut down a number of stores 

  on what is typically a busy sales day and continued to depress business for 

  two to three days. February same-store sales are expected to range from 3 percent 

  to 15 percent lower than last year, mainly due to the snowstorm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparel sales were generally described as weak, though outerwear again performed 

  better than other categories; a number of contacts noted particularly strong 

  sales of jewelry. Demand for home furnishings and appliances was described as 

  mixed. Despite the recent weakness in sales, most retail contacts say that inventories 

  are in good shape. Retailers report that selling prices are flat to down moderately 

  and describe the pricing environment as highly competitive. Merchandise and 

  labor costs are said to be little changed, but retailers report steep increases 

  in utility and insurance costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regional surveys of consumer confidence have given mixed but generally weak 

  signals. Siena College's monthly survey of New York State residents showed confidence 

  rebounding from a cyclical trough in January, led by the New York City area. 

  However, the Conference Board reports that confidence in the Middle Atlantic 

  states--New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania--fell to a new cyclical low in 

  January.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate markets have shown signs of regaining steam since the 

  last report, while commercial markets remain soft but stable. New York State 

  realtors report that sales of single-family homes rebounded in December, while 

  selling prices continued to run more than 10 percent ahead of a year earlier, 

  with the steepest gains in the New York City area. Contacts report that sales 

  of Manhattan co-ops and condos picked up in January and early February and that 

  selling prices have been stable in recent months. The high end of the market, 

  however, continues to lag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both single-family and multifamily housing permits in the District rebounded 

  in December, after drifting down in the prior two months. More recently, homebuilders 

  in northern New Jersey report that demand remains strong for homes selling for 

  under $1 million, but note that demand has weakened further at the top end of 

  the market, particularly in areas near New York City. An industry contact notes 

  that labor and material costs are not a problem but that liability insurance 

  coverage is increasingly difficult--builders are more concerned about availability 

  than the rising cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manhattan's commercial real estate market was steady to slightly weaker in 

  January. Lower Manhattan's availability rate inched up, after improving slowly 

  but steadily in the second half of 2002. However, rates held steady in Midtown 

  and edged down in Midtown South. Still, asking rents throughout the city continued 

  to decline; they have fallen by roughly 20 percent from their early-2001 peaks, 

  and industry experts note that the decline in actual rents has been much steeper. 

  On the supply side, there is a moderate amount of new office space currently 

  under construction in Manhattan: roughly 3 million square feet is scheduled 

  for completion this year and another nearly 4 million in 2004. Together, this 

  represents slightly over 1 percent of the total stock, and all of this new space 

  will be in Midtown.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A major New York City employment agency, specializing in midlevel office jobs, 

  reports that that hiring activity, which appeared to be on the rise in late 

  2002, dropped off in January and February. The market for temps is also described 

  as slack. Legal firms are still hiring, and there has been some pickup at magazine 

  publishers; however, there has been very little activity from the usually dominant 

  financial sector. Moreover, a large and growing number of unemployed financial 

  industry workers are looking for jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       A contact in New York City's securities industry reports that conditions have 

  deteriorated noticeably since the last report. In addition to increased weakness 

  in the financial markets, stock issuance, and mergers and acquisitions, recent 

  litigation settlements and increased liability have further affected securities 

  firms' bottom lines. Bonus payments are estimated to be down 20 percent to 30 

  percent from last year's levels, and there is no indication of a pickup in hiring 

  on the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manufacturing sector has given mixed signals since the last report. Purchasing 

  managers in both the Buffalo and Rochester areas report some pickup in manufacturing 

  activity in January but further declines in employment levels; they also note 

  widespread increases in input prices. New York City-area purchasers report that 

  manufacturing sector conditions were flat in January, after broad improvement 

  in December, and indicate little change in input prices; while they express 

  increased optimism about the near-term business outlook, a majority anticipates 

  staff cutbacks in the industry in 2003. More recently, our February survey of 

  New York State manufacturers indicates some leveling off in business conditions, 

  following three months of improvement. Manufacturers note increased upward pressure 

  on input costs but downward pressure on selling prices. Respondents also expressed 

  less optimism about the near-term outlook than in recent months. While the survey 

  was taken prior to the Presidents Day blizzard, there has been no indication 

  that the storm had any substantial effect on production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Separately, a major freight shipping firm reports that the snowstorm had little 

  disruptive effect at the seaports during the subsequent workweek, causing only 

  scattered minor delays. More generally, this contact characterizes shipping 

  activity as very strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Small to medium-sized Second District banks report a further decline in demand 

  for consumer loans, which appears to be partly seasonal, but steady demand in 

  other segments. In particular, 31 percent of bankers indicated lower demand 

  for consumer loans, compared with only 3 percent indicating higher demand. Bankers 

  reported no change in overall refinancing activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the supply side, bankers continue to report tightening credit standards 

  for commercial borrowers--roughly one in six bankers reports tighter standards 

  for commercial and industrial loans, while none reports an easing of standards. 

  Credit standards for residential mortgages and consumer loans remained little 

  changed. Both loan rates and deposit rates continued to decline across the board. 

  Lenders report an upturn in delinquency rates on consumer loans, which cannot 

  be attributed entirely to seasonal fluctuations--twice as many respondents indicate 

  that they are rising as rates are declining. Delinquency rates are reported 

  to be stable in the other categories.
