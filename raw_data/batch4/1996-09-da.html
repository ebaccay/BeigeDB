      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity strengthened in August from 
July's moderate pace. Despite relatively strong demand and desired 
inventory levels for most products, there were only scattered 
reports of price pressures since the last survey. Manufacturing 
orders accelerated in August, with strong demand for construction- 
and energy-related products. Back-to-school retail sales were good, 
and sales continued to pick up along the Texas-Mexico border. An 
increase in commercial construction offset slower new home 
construction, and Eleventh District loan demand remained steady. 
Energy activity continued to strengthen, and heavy rains improved 
agricultural conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There were scattered reports of price pressures. Prices were up for 
oil field machinery, apparel, lumber and some paper products. In 
addition, crude oil prices remained relatively high, despite 
approval for Iraqi entry into the market. Real estate prices 
continued to firm up as low office, warehouse, and apartment 
vacancies pushed up rents. Nevertheless, prices continued to fall 
for electronic products--such as memory chips, telecommunication 
products, and computer components-where inventories were still too 
big, according to contacts. Brick producers said prices were steady 
to slightly lower after rising strongly earlier in the year. Also, 
natural gas prices fell to six month lows, a result of milder 
weather and rising storage levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      There were some reports of wage pressures in the past six weeks. 
Contacts in the energy industry said labor shortages for workers 
with certain oil-related skills were pushing up wages. Several 
contacts in the high-tech sector noted wage pressures for skilled 
development engineers. Furthermore, some manufacturing respondents 
noted a lack of qualified, entry-level applicants, which has been a 
recurring observation throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing orders accelerated in August following slow growth in 
July. Several respondents in the electronics industry said unit 
demand for semiconductors was flat in August after falling since 
early this year. Despite the recent improvement, contacts did not 
expect a sustained increase in overall chip orders until the first 
half of 1997. Demand for telecommunications products held steady at 
July's healthy levels, and unit computer demand picked up slightly, 
although contacts in both industries said inventories were too high. 
Most construction-related producers said orders remained strong and 
inventories were slightly tighter than desired, especially those 
supplying commercial contractors. Lumber orders continued to rise, 
with much of the strength stemming from increases in commercial 
construction and home remodeling. Brick producers said demand was 
steady, with fewer orders from homebuilders but rising orders from 
commercial and apartment builders. Demand for metal products 
remained steady at good levels, with much of it related to the 
construction of industrial warehouses. Paper manufacturers said 
orders had improved, and demand was also up for corrugated box 
producers. Apparel orders were up slightly. Strong energy activity 
caused oil field equipment orders to strengthen further, and some 
contacts noted that demand was outstripping available capacity. 
Chemical orders remained strong, the only exception being for 
products tied to synthetic fibers. Refiners noted a slight 
improvement since the last survey, but overall, low product prices 
and high crude oil prices continued to squeeze margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail and Auto Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers reported good back-to-school sales, although in 
general, department stores reported better August sales than 
discount stores. Some retailers said Texas sales growth was not as 
strong as in the rest of the nation despite improvement along the 
Texas-Mexico border. Auto sales were flat over the past six weeks, 
as the 1996 models became "picked over" but the 1997 models were not 
yet in stock.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand was mostly steady since the last survey. The exception 
was residential refinancings, which continued to decline. Demand for 
other residential loans was mixed, according to contacts. Demand for 
consumer, business and commercial real estate loans was unchanged at 
good levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity was mixed, with rising commercial building 
offsetting slower new home construction. New and existing home sales 
have softened from the record-setting pace of the second quarter, 
but contacts remained optimistic about the rest of the year. Strong 
rental demand for office space coupled with low vacancies continued 
to push up rents, and several office projects are slated to break 
ground by year-end, according to contacts. Warehouse and retail 
construction activity picked up, while apartment construction held 
steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity continued to rise over the past six weeks. Offshore 
drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico was reported to be strong, 
and some contacts in Texas and Louisiana said a lack of skilled 
workers was making it difficult to form drilling crews. Strong 
domestic demand for oil products kept crude oil prices relatively 
high. Despite a decline in natural gas prices, natural gas still 
accounts for the majority of drilling activity, according to 
contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Heavy rains improved agricultural conditions across most of the 
District, although drought remains a problem. Subsoil moisture and 
pasture conditions are better, and haying activity has increased. 
Still, cotton and corn production are expected to be roughly 30 
percent below last year, and livestock liquidation continues, albeit 
at a slower pace.
