      <p>
       The Tenth District economy showed some signs of weakening in 
                March and early April, due in part to the onset of war. Retail 
                sales as a whole edged down, and manufacturing activity softened. 
                In addition, commercial real estate remained in a slump. On the 
                positive side, residential real estate activity maintained its 
                strong pace, and energy activity continued to expand. In the farm 
                economy, recent rain and snow eased drought conditions in some 
                areas. Wage and price pressures remained largely subdued across 
                the District, although prices for some manufacturing materials 
                continued to rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales in the District fell slightly in March and early 
                April after improving earlier in the year and were lower than 
                a year ago at most stores. Many retailers said sales in early 
                March were soft and that both traffic and sales slowed further 
                after the onset of war in Iraq. Some stores in the District's 
                Rocky Mountain states, however, reported a rebound in sales in 
                recent weeks as local weather conditions improved after heavy 
                snows in mid-March. Among product categories, apparel sales appeared 
                to be weakest. Most managers were hopeful that consumer confidence 
                would improve with the conclusion of the war, resulting in stronger 
                sales. However, stores were keeping inventories lean, and many 
                managers expect to trim stock levels in coming months. Motor vehicle 
                sales were weak in March but began to pick up slightly in early 
                April after the expansion of some manufacturer incentives. As 
                in previous surveys, demand for SUVs remained solid, but sales 
                of most other types of vehicles were sluggish. Most dealers expect 
                further gradual improvement in sales by early summer and plan 
                to increase inventories accordingly. In the tourism industry, 
                the Rocky Mountain ski resorts posted strong attendance figures 
                in late March and early April, as fresh snowfall appeared to offset 
                travelers' hesitancy caused by the start of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity weakened somewhat in March and 
                early April. Although some contacts attributed the softening to 
                the onset of war, the majority of firms reported that the war 
                was having no effect on their business. Production and shipments 
                fell slightly below year-ago levels after rising in recent months, 
                and many factories continued to shed employees. Indeed, nearly 
                all of the large layoff announcements in recent weeks have been 
                from manufacturers. Inventories of finished goods rose moderately 
                as some customers delayed their purchases. Despite the recent 
                slowing, manufacturers maintained their optimism about future 
                production and were increasing inventories of raw materials. Expectations 
                for future hiring also remained positive. On the other hand, expectations 
                for future capital spending eased somewhat after improving in 
                February.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate activity in the District continued to 
                show strength in March and early April, although commercial real 
                estate activity remained weak. Single-family housing starts increased 
                further in most District cities, with builders reporting little 
                effect from the onset of war. Much of the increase continued to 
                be for lower-priced homes, although several contacts mentioned 
                some pickup in higher-end homebuilding as well. Builders generally 
                expect typical seasonal increases in home construction through 
                early summer. Home sales across the District remained relatively 
                steady in March and early April, although inventories of unsold 
                homes were higher than a year ago in most cities. Many realtors 
                reported good buyer traffic in recent weeks and expect solid sales 
                to persist into the summer months. Mortgage demand continued to 
                be quite strong throughout the District, and lenders generally 
                expect demand for both new home loans and refinancings to hold 
                steady. In contrast to the residential market, commercial real 
                estate activity remained weak across the District in March and 
                early April, with some cities experiencing further difficulties. 
                Office vacancy rates edged up in Denver and Kansas City, and prices 
                of office space in those cities fell slightly. Absorption rates 
                were fairly constant across the District, however, and commercial 
                realtors generally do not expect further deterioration of office 
                markets in coming months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Bankers report that loans declined and deposits rose since the 
                last survey, reducing loan-deposit ratios. Demand increased for 
                home mortgage loans and home equity loans but fell for other categories, 
                especially commercial and industrial loans. On the deposit side, 
                all types of accounts rose except large CDs, which held steady. 
                Some respondents attributed the increase in liquid accounts to 
                a flight to safety. All respondents left their prime lending rates 
                unchanged since the last survey, but half of them reduced their 
                consumer lending rates slightly. Lending standards were generally 
                unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District energy activity continued to expand in March and early 
                April. By mid-April, the count of active oil and gas drilling 
                rigs in the region had risen almost 10 percent from early March 
                and nearly 40 percent from the beginning of the year. Although 
                energy prices have declined from recent peaks, they remain relatively 
                high in comparison to previous years. Natural gas prices are expected 
                to stay above average through the summer as companies replenish 
                unusually low inventories. In addition, significant new gas pipeline 
                capacity from the Rocky Mountains is scheduled to open in coming 
                weeks. As a result of these factors, drilling activity is expected 
                to remain solid in 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In the District's farm economy, recent rain and snow have eased 
                drought conditions in some areas. The precipitation has helped 
                pastures, but the damage sustained from the drought will take 
                time to overcome. Spring planting conditions have also benefited 
                from the moisture. Recent credit reviews suggest that farm borrowers 
                were still experiencing some deterioration in their finances in 
                drought-stricken areas. Most District bankers remain cautious, 
                and some have tightened their farm lending standards. If moisture 
                conditions continue to improve, farm balance sheets are expected 
                to strengthen this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Wage and price pressures remained generally muted across the District, 
                although high energy prices continued to squeeze some manufacturers' 
                profit margins. Labor markets were still very slack in March and 
                early April, and managers reported few problems finding workers. 
                However, the pace of layoff announcements continued to ease after 
                rising last fall. Wage pressures were virtually nonexistent, and 
                some employers have sought to control costs by eliminating matching 
                funds for retirement plans. Retail prices continued to ease due 
                to promotional discounting, and retailers expect prices to be 
                flat to slightly lower in coming months. Manufacturers continued 
                to report rising prices for some petroleum-based products, but 
                the easing in gasoline prices in recent weeks has led to reductions 
                in suppliers' transportation surcharges. Several manufacturers 
                also reported that finished goods prices have declined since the 
                previous survey after showing signs of firming earlier in the 
                year. As in previous surveys, prices for construction materials 
                were largely unchanged and are expected to remain flat through 
                early summer.
