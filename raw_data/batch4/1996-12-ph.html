      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Third District

was up modestly in November according to

reports from the region?s businesses.

Manufacturers noted increases in orders and

shipments, although employment in this sector

appeared to be just steady.  Retailers said

customer traffic increased near the end of the

month and sales picked up seasonally.  Auto

dealers reported that sales for the month were

steady and at a healthy pace.  Inventories at both

manufacturers and retailers appeared to be in line

with sales.  Bankers generally said overall loan

growth continued during November but the pace

of growth slowed.  Consumer and real estate

lending remained on an upward trend, but

commercial and industrial lending was flat.
       <p>
        Looking ahead, Third District business

contacts see further improvement, but they do not

expect strong gains.  Manufacturers forecast

increasing demand for their products that will

lead to some stepped-up hiring in the next six

months.  Retailers forecast about a 5 percent

increase in the dollar value of sales this

Christmas season compared to a year ago.  Auto

dealers expect sales to continue at their current

rate.  Bankers expect consumer and real estate

lending to continue moving up, although they

anticipate some slowing in the growth of

consumer lending, especially credit cards, as they

implement somewhat tighter credit standards.

They expect business loan volumes outstanding to

remain near current levels.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Manufacturing activity in the Third

District moved up slightly in November,

according to reports from plants in the region.

About three of ten of those polled noted gains in

orders and shipments while two of ten reported

declines.  Most of the drops were reported by

manufacturers of durable goods, while producers of nondurable

goods generally experienced improved business

in November compared to October.  Despite the

apparent lower demand for durable goods, firms

in this sector reported declining inventories, on

balance, and little change in working hours.

Producers of nondurable goods gave similar

reports.  Total employment at Third District

manufacturers in all sectors was steady during

the month.
         <p>
          Industrial prices in the region were

mainly steady, according to comments from

manufacturers.  Eight of ten said both their input

costs and their own selling prices were unchanged

in November compared to October.  Two-thirds of

the firms contacted for this report expect prices to

remain level during the next six months,

although one-third anticipate increases in the

costs of the goods they purchase and one-fifth plan

to raise the prices of the products they make.
          <p>
           Nearly half of the manufacturers polled in

November expect demand for their products to

increase during the next six months while fewer

than one-fifth expect demand to decline.  One-third of

the surveyed companies plan to hire more

workers over the period, twice the number of

firms planning employment cutbacks.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Retail
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Most of the Third District merchants

surveyed in November said customer traffic had

increased sharply recently and the seasonal

upswing in sales had begun.  Department stores,

in particular, noted a higher sales rate in

November compared to October, although some

store executives cautioned that promotional

pricing was responsible for a significant share of

the gains.  For all types of stores, inventories were

generally described as consistent with the current

sales rate.
            <p>
             While some merchants expressed concern

that there will be fewer shopping days than usual

between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year,

most said consumer confidence appears to be

high and they do not expect calendar effects to

have a negative impact on sales.  Retailers

forecast increases in the dollar value of sales for

the Christmas shopping period of about 5 percent,

on average, above last year?s level.  Retailers of

apparel, toys, books, and recorded music expect to

match or exceed the gains they have posted in

recent years while some stores specializing in

consumer electronic products anticipate lower

annual increases this season than in past years.
             <p>
              Auto dealers in the region indicated that

sales were steady and at a healthy pace in October

and November.  They expect a seasonal slowing in

December and January, but generally anticipate

that sales will return to their current rate after

that.  While some dealers expressed concern that

rising consumer debt levels may begin to trim

auto sales, others cited continuing high measures

of consumer confidence in support of optimistic

expectations for sales in the near future.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Finance
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Most of the Third District bankers

interviewed for this report said loan volumes

were growing slowly as consumer and real estate

lending moved up while commercial and

industrial loan levels were mostly flat.  Credit

card and direct personal loan volumes increased

at most of the banks in the region in November.

As bankers implement more restrictive credit

standards to stem the increase in consumer loan

charge-offs that they have experienced recently,

they expect some slowing in the growth of

consumer lending, absent seasonal factors.

Despite such limitations, bankers continue to

focus on consumer markets for new business, for

both loans and investment products.
               <p>
                Lending to businesses remains very

competitive as nonbank lenders and banks not

based in the region continue to solicit local firms.

Bankers also said the market for real estate

lending, both residential and commercial, is

competitive on rates; they added, however, that

commercial real estate borrowers are expected to

have substantial equity interests in their

properties.
