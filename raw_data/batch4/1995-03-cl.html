      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       General Business Conditions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There has been some slowing in the growth of District business 
activity, although outright declines are rare and most industries 
are still reporting high levels of production. Capital goods 
producers continue to pace industrial growth, led by a strengthening 
in export markets. Employment conditions may have actually improved 
somewhat, and unemployment in most regions is substantially below 
the national average. Nevertheless, significant wage pressures are 
not reported. And while industrial materials costs are continuing to 
rise at an above-average rate, few manufacturers indicate that these 
increases are spilling into finished goods prices in any notable way.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's industrial sector remains strong, with perhaps some 
modest slowing in auto and auto-related manufacturing. Capital goods 
producers continue to report orders growth, especially from foreign 
customers. Indeed, a slight slackening in domestic demand for 
capital goods has been more than offset by an acceleration in 
exports.
     </p>
     <p>
      A steady or slightly rising proportion of manufacturers are 
reporting higher employment levels; only a small and declining 
number indicate reductions. In many industries and regions, 
companies are having difficulty finding skilled laborers, and 
indeed, unemployment rates in the District are among the nation's 
lowest. Several respondents also reported higher rates of labor 
turnover. Nevertheless, signs of wage pressure are difficult to 
find, and most companies are still reporting wage growth at, or 
perhaps slightly below, the rate of inflation. A major commercial 
real estate firm reports a shortage of industrial space, and 
industrial construction activity appears to be on the rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several manufacturers report a moderation in the rise in industrial 
commodity prices, although the number of goods whose cost has 
increased is still very large and ranges from wood products (lumber, 
paper, and wallboard), to plastics (polyester and PVC), to metals 
(aluminum, copper, and steel).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retailers
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although February is traditionally a slow month, District retailers 
were nonetheless disappointed in this year's performance, and many 
are now reporting higher-than-desired inventories. Most notable are 
the excess stocks of winter outer wear, a reflection of unseasonably 
mild temperatures. While a few large chain stores indicate solid 
sales gains, most report flat or declining receipts, and specialty 
stores, such as women's apparel and furniture establishments, are 
down significantly. Some (if not most) retailers point to higher 
interest rates as a key to the slowdown in durable goods sales, 
although much of the slippage has reportedly come through a 
softening housing market. Retail market analysts are cautious about 
the near-term outlook, in part because of the uncertain significance 
of the recent sales slowdown. Moreover, they suggest that March 
sales will be negatively influenced by a late Easter.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the District's largest furniture sellers reports that many 
suppliers will not quote prices on orders more than 30 days in 
advance because of the uncertain cost of wood and other furniture 
construction materials. However, price competition remains severe 
and retailers say that it is virtually impossible to pass price 
increases through to consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Autos
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fourth District auto dealers report a downturn in new light vehicle 
sales between late January and the end of February. The recent 
weakness may have actually begun in November and has become more 
pronounced since the beginning of the year. However, demand for some 
light trucks and sport/utility vehicles remains strong, and one 
market analyst observed an improving market for used vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Slower auto sales have resulted in a considerable unplanned 
inventory buildup - a dramatic turnaround from the shortages that 
dealers complained about through the third quarter of 1994. The 
buildup of vehicle stocks combined with higher interest rates, has 
reportedly caused a surge in floor plan costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers also point to higher interest rates as a pivotal 
development in the new-car market although bad weather in February 
may also have hurt sales. Still other sources my that rising 
interest rates for new-car loans are not reducing sales as much as 
are the restraining income effects of higher mortgage rates on 
disposable incomes. These higher rates have virtually eliminated 
home refinancing while boosting mortgage payments for households 
with variable-rate agreements. Fourth District auto dealers remain 
hopeful that sales will improve in the months ahead, but few believe 
that the gains will rival last spring's performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases for 1995 new-car models were bumped marginally 
higher early this year. However, incentive plans are becoming 
increasingly common, helping to offset the higher costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Credit
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand remains strong, especially in the commercial lending 
categories. Business borrowing has recently broadened to include 
mergers and acquisitions, although credit for capital expansion and 
inventory floor plans is also rising. While some slowing in the 
growth of consumer borrowing is noted, it appears to be centered in 
new-auto credit. Household borrowing in other non-real estate 
categories is still strong Perhaps the most significant drop-off in 
lending activity has been in the mortgage area, where refinancing 
activity has slowed to a standstill and new-mortgage extensions are 
down substantially from last fall.
