      <p>
       The Tenth District economy continued 
                  to expand in late August and September. Manufacturing strengthened 
                  further, and more firms than in previous surveys reported increased 
                  hiring and investment. Retail sales excluding autos rose slightly, 
                  housing activity remained strong, and the farm and energy sectors 
                  improved. On the other hand, auto sales fell after rising earlier 
                  in the summer. Commercial real estate markets also remained 
                  weak, although they showed some signs of stabilizing. Wage and 
                  price increases were generally modest, but some materials prices 
                  rose sharply.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Excluding autos, retail sales in the district continued to edge 
                  higher in late August and September and were at or above year-ago 
                  levels at most stores. Among product categories, sales of shoes, 
                  men's and children's clothing, and most home items were strong, 
                  while sales of women's apparel and electronics were somewhat 
                  sluggish. Nearly all retailers expect sales to continue to increase 
                  slightly, although several managers reported they would not 
                  be confident about fourth quarter sales until consumer sentiment 
                  improved somewhat. Most stores were satisfied with inventory 
                  levels and plan typical seasonal increases to stocks in coming 
                  months. In contrast to sales at retail stores, sales of motor 
                  vehicles in the district fell somewhat in late August and September 
                  after increasing earlier in the summer and were below year-ago 
                  levels in most states. Auto sales in Colorado were particularly 
                  weak, although dealers there reported a slight pick-up in buyer 
                  traffic near the end of September. Most dealers expect new car 
                  sales to improve in October. Despite slower auto sales since 
                  the previous survey, most dealers reported that inventories 
                  of unsold cars remained manageable, due to cautious inventory 
                  building in recent months. Several dealers also reported that 
                  used car prices have firmed recently, as fewer leased cars have 
                  been coming back on the market. Reports on late summer tourism 
                  activity at mountain resorts in the district were generally 
                  positive, and convention business in Denver was strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity increased considerably in late 
                  August and September, and managers remain optimistic about future 
                  output. Plants generally reported higher levels of capacity 
                  utilization than in the previous survey, and the volume of new 
                  orders continued to rise. In addition, several firms reported 
                  further increases in hours and a modest expansion of employment. 
                  Moreover, capital spending rose above year-ago levels, as several 
                  firms added new production space and increased their purchases 
                  of machinery and IT equipment. On the negative side, contacts 
                  in the aircraft manufacturing industry reported that their shipments 
                  and orders continued to slide. Several other contacts reported 
                  difficulties obtaining steel plate and tubing. Looking ahead, 
                  most manufacturers expect continued expansion of production 
                  and orders for the remainder of the year, along with modest 
                  increases in employment. In line with these expectations for 
                  stronger factory activity, firms also anticipate some building 
                  of inventories of raw materials in coming months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate activity in the district remained strong 
                  in late August and September, and commercial real estate markets 
                  showed signs of bottoming out. Single-family housing starts 
                  maintained a rapid pace in most district cities, although some 
                  builders reported a slight easing in activity. Starts of entry-level 
                  homes continued to be particularly strong. Most builders expect 
                  single-family construction to stay solid for the remainder of 
                  the year, provided mortgage rates remain low. Several builders 
                  reported difficulty obtaining plywood, but other building materials 
                  remained generally available. Home sales were steady in late 
                  August and September and above year-ago levels throughout the 
                  district. Most realtors expect sales to remain flat for the 
                  rest of the year and anticipate only modest increases in home 
                  prices. Mortgage lenders reported a sharp drop in refinancing 
                  activity. Inquiries about refinancing picked up slightly at 
                  the end of September, but lenders generally expect refinancings 
                  to continue to slow. Demand for home purchase loans is expected 
                  to hold steady. Most commercial real estate markets in the district 
                  showed some signs of firming in late August and September after 
                  weakening earlier in the summer. Sales of office space increased 
                  slightly in some cities, while absorption and vacancy rates 
                  were largely unchanged. However, realtors do not expect much 
                  improvement in office markets for the foreseeable future, as 
                  most markets have at least some excess supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Bankers report that both loans and deposits increased slightly 
                  since the last survey, leaving loan-deposit ratios largely unchanged. 
                  Demand edged up for residential construction loans, home equity 
                  loans, and consumer loans. Demand for other loan categories 
                  was little changed, with increased demand for home purchase 
                  mortgages helping offset the slowing in refinancing activity. 
                  On the deposit side, gains were widespread across categories. 
                  All respondent banks held their prime lending rates steady, 
                  and most banks also left their consumer lending rates unchanged. 
                  No changes in lending standards were reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District energy activity continued to expand moderately in late 
                  August and September, as energy prices remained relatively high. 
                  Although natural gas prices fell slightly in September, they 
                  were still 50 percent higher than a year ago and are expected 
                  to remain elevated in coming months. The count of active oil 
                  and gas drilling rigs in the region continued to edge higher 
                  in September and was well above year-ago levels. The increase 
                  in activity led to greater demand for skilled rig workers, and 
                  energy contacts generally expect drilling activity to remain 
                  solid through the winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural activity in the district improved in late August 
                  and September, boosting prospects for farm income this year. 
                  Cattle profits made a strong rebound after prices reached an 
                  all-time high in early September, and yields on the district's 
                  corn harvest were better than a year ago. Also, recent moisture 
                  has provided excellent planting and growing conditions for the 
                  winter wheat crop in many areas. Farmland values throughout 
                  the district remain strong, and bankers report higher repayment 
                  rates and lower renewals and extensions in their farm loan portfolios. 
                  On the negative side, early yields on the district's soybean 
                  crop have been below average due to the effects of this summer's 
                  drought, and financial concerns persist for farmers located 
                  in areas of prolonged drought.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Wage and price increases were generally modest in late August 
                  and September, although some materials prices rose sharply. 
                  Labor markets were still quite slack around the district. However, 
                  the rate of layoff announcements slowed to a three-year low, 
                  and more businesses than in previous surveys said they were 
                  increasing their hiring plans. Most firms were offering only 
                  cost-of-living increases in wages, while benefit costs continued 
                  to rise rapidly. Some retailers reported discounting prices 
                  to clear out back-to-school merchandise. Otherwise, retail prices 
                  were unchanged and are expected to be flat to slightly higher 
                  in coming months. Manufacturers reported some firming in finished 
                  goods prices, but they continued to lack the ability to fully 
                  pass input cost increases through to customers. Among manufacturing 
                  and construction materials, prices for steel, petroleum-based 
                  products, and plywood rose considerably. Manufacturers expect 
                  some materials prices to continue to rise and anticipate only 
                  modest increases in their pricing power.
