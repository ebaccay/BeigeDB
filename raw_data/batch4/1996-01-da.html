      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 17, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy expanded at a slightly slower pace in 
late November and December, restrained in part by weak retail sales 
and sluggish orders in several manufacturing industries. 
Construction activity continued to increase, due to lower mortgage 
rates and strong demand for commercial space, and loan demand rose 
at a steady pace. Demand for business services accelerated, with 
strong demand from high-tech, real estate and lending companies. 
Energy markets improved as colder weather caused a surge in prices; 
however, the higher prices are not expected to be permanent. Farm 
income improved slightly as prices for crops and beef cattle rose.
      <p>
       Despite recent increases in energy and agricultural prices, there 
were few reports of price pressures among respondents. Retailers 
reported significant discounting, and prices were reportedly falling 
for paper products, petrochemicals, semiconductors and lumber. Wage 
pressures remained prevalent in the Eleventh District, although most 
contacts said they had not been passed on in the form of higher 
prices. Service industry contacts said labor shortages remained for 
electricians, engineers, software developers, accountants, temporary 
workers and long-haul truck drivers. In addition, many district 
manufacturers cited a lack of adequately skilled workers as a major 
concern.
       <p>
        Orders were somewhat weaker for some district manufacturers in the 
past six weeks. Contacts in the high-tech sectors said orders 
continued to rise at strong rates overall, but semiconductor 
manufacturers noted a slight deceleration from the torrid pace of 
growth noted in previous reports. Orders for construction-related 
products were flat to up, with steady growth in orders for brick but 
flat demand for residential lumber products. Lumber producers in the 
Eleventh District said lower prices for Canadian imports were 
reducing their market share. Orders for paper products continued to 
soften, and respondents expected selling prices to fall further as 
they try to reduce inventories. Apparel producers said demand 
remained flat due to soft retail conditions in recent months. Food 
industry contacts said demand was up slightly, with the exception of 
orders for low-fat products which continued to increase strongly. 
Commodity chemical markets continued to weaken, with production and 
consumption down in the fourth quarter. Refiners, however, pushed 
output to maximum levels in the last two months to take advantage of 
a recent surge in gasoline and fuel oil prices. Demand for oil field 
equipment and machinery remained flat at good levels.
        <p>
         Demand for business-related services, such as temporary, accounting 
and legal services, picked up in recent weeks. Respondents cited 
real estate, banking and high-tech industries as sources of 
increased demand. Hiring increased at legal and temporary firms but 
was only flat to slightly up at accounting firms because of 
shortages of entry-level and experienced CPAs. Temporary firms 
reported a tighter labor market for semi-skilled workers, with 
rising wages cutting into profit margins but not leading to higher 
fees. Nonetheless, respondents remained optimistic about near-term 
business conditions.
         <p>
          Contacts in the transportation services industry reported flat 
demand overall, although a seasonal rush in December boosted cargo 
volume at some firms. Heavy competition in the trucking industry and 
an unstable Mexican economy continued to be cited as sources of 
weakness.
          <p>
           Eleventh District retail sales remained weak in December, and heavy 
discounting hurt profits, according to most contacts. Department 
store and discount store contacts said sales picked up before the 
Christmas holiday, but were not enough to offset slow sales earlier 
in the month. Most retailers said the Texas/Mexico border region 
continued to be one of the poorest performing areas in the country. 
Outlooks for 1996 were guarded, and several respondents said they 
may scale back the number of new store openings this year. Auto 
sales rose in November and early December, and contacts expected 
1995 year-end sales to be up moderately over 1994.
           <p>
            Eleventh District financial institutions reported steady growth in 
loan demand over the past six weeks. Demand for residential real 
estate loans was flat, and contacts said many consumers are waiting 
for mortgage rates to bottom out before refinancing. Commercial real 
estate loans increased significantly, and several contacts said 
consumer loans had risen. Contacts were positive in their outlook 
for 1996.
            <p>
             Construction and real estate contacts reported steady growth over 
the past six weeks. Demand remained strong for commercial space, and 
there were a few reports of speculative construction, mostly for 
industrial warehouse space. Demand for office space continued to 
rise and several respondents expected improvement in downtown areas 
in 1996 due to a lack of contiguous space in suburban areas. In 
addition, contacts expected hotel construction to pick up 
significantly in 1996. Lower mortgage rates kept demand for new and 
existing homes at good levels, but some contacts said buyer traffic 
had slowed recently, most likely a seasonal result. Respondents said 
apartment occupancies remained at very good levels; however, 
concerns of overbuilding had caused some contacts to curtail plans 
for new projects.
             <p>
              Eleventh District energy conditions improved in November and 
December as colder-than-normal November weather and a series of 
December winter storms combined to push energy prices up. After 
hovering between $17 and $18 per barrel for the previous five 
months, the price of crude oil moved to a range between $18 and $20 
per barrel in late November and December. Fuel oil and natural gas 
prices were similarly pushed up by cold weather.
              <p>
               According to contacts, agricultural conditions improved over the 
past six weeks, and prices rose for most farm products. Respondents 
said livestock conditions were good. On a less positive note, dry 
weather and insect problems hurt the wheat crop. The Texas All Farm 
Products Price Index rose 3 percent from October to November, with a 
strong increase in beef cattle prices.
