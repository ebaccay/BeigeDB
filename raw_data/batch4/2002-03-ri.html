      Beige Book Report: Richmond

     </p>
     Fifth District economic activity advanced at 
            a moderate pace in January and February, led by somewhat stronger 
            growth in the retail and manufacturing sectors. Services firms reported 
            modest increases in revenues, and sales growth at retail establishments 
            rebounded in February after sagging in January. Manufacturers reported 
            that shipments grew more rapidly and new orders increased substantially. 
            In contrast, activity at residential and commercial real estate firms 
            was little changed. Bankers reported steady demand for residential 
            mortgages but somewhat sluggish growth in commercial lending. Employment 
            fell in the manufacturing and retail sectors, but temporary employment 
            agencies reported that the demand for workers picked up. In agriculture, 
            warm and dry weather aided field preparation but stressed pastures 
            and triggered supplemental feeding of livestock.
     <p>
      <b>
       Retail
      </b>
      <br/>
      District retailers said that seasonally-adjusted revenues fell in 
              January but rebounded in the first three weeks of February. Big-ticket 
              sales were generally higher, although automobile dealers gave mixed 
              reports on customer traffic and vehicle sales in February. A number 
              of retailers told us that they had trimmed inventories; a big-box 
              retailer and a manager at a home improvement center said they were 
              carrying lower inventories because of the sluggish economy. Retail 
              employment edged downward in recent weeks while average wages increased 
              at a moderate pace. Prices in the retail sector were reported to 
              be rising at less than a two percent rate.
      <p>
       <b>
        Services
       </b>
       <br/>
       Services businesses reported modestly higher revenues in the weeks 
              since our last report. A manager at a fitness center in Charlotte, 
              N.C., said customer demand had picked up in recent weeks, while 
              a travel agent in Greenville, S.C., reported an increase in both 
              business and pleasure travel. Also in Charlotte, an engineering 
              firm reported a jump in orders for both government and private sector 
              projects. But a financial services firm in Baltimore, Md., said 
              stock market investors were concerned that there may be more bad 
              news regarding corporate accounting methods and remained "in a holding 
              pattern." Employment in this sector declined in January but rose 
              modestly in February.
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        District manufacturing activity strengthened in January and February, 
              led by solid growth in shipments and new orders. Contacts in the 
              electronics, furniture, paper, tobacco, and transportation industries 
              generally reported moderate growth in shipments in recent weeks. 
              A paper company in Richmond, Va., introduced a new product and accordingly, 
              February appeared to be "a very good month" for orders and shipments. 
              In addition, a producer of plastic products in North Carolina noted 
              that January was "a good, active month" and that shipments were 
              higher. While uncertain whether this was "truly the beginning of 
              the recovery," he nevertheless anticipated that shipments in coming 
              months would be higher. The level of manufacturing employment declined 
              since our last report, but manufacturing wages and the average workweek 
              rose. Looking forward, most manufacturers remained very optimistic 
              about business prospects six months from now, expecting higher shipments, 
              new orders, and capacity utilization.
        <p>
         <b>
          Finance
         </b>
         <br/>
         District loan officers reported that lending activity was little 
              changed since our last report. Growth in commercial lending activity 
              continued to be constrained by sluggish demand for business loans. 
              Several commercial lenders noted that some of their borrowers continued 
              to have weak profits and were not looking to expand their business 
              operations at this time. While commercial lenders reported little 
              change in credit standards, several said they were taking a closer 
              look at financial statements before extending loans, particularly 
              for companies restating earnings. Residential mortgage lenders said 
              that refinancing activity had declined in recent weeks, but that 
              overall demand for mortgages was holding steady. A Greenville, SC, 
              banker described demand for residential mortgages as "steady, but 
              not great," despite a dip in mortgage interest rates in recent weeks.
         <p>
          <b>
           Real Estate
          </b>
          <br/>
          Residential real estate activity was mixed since our last report. 
              Several realtors reported that home sales were exceptionally strong 
              in their areas. A contact in Chevy Chase, Md., said that sales in 
              his area were "hot"--he had an "enormous number of buyers" but not 
              enough inventory. A realtor in Richmond, Va., reported that houses 
              were selling quickly there and that the "spring market" had begun 
              earlier than usual this year. In addition, a homebuilder in the 
              Tidewater, Va., area said the market was the most robust he had 
              seen in his 25 years in the business. But other contacts described 
              slowing home sales. A Realtor in Baltimore, Md., noted a "slight 
              softening" in the market there, while a Realtor in Columbia, SC, 
              characterized home sales as "quiet." While most Realtors continued 
              to report that sales were strongest in the lower price ranges, a 
              builder of homes in the Carolinas said that the upper-end market 
              was "making a comeback."
          <p>
           Commercial Realtors across the District reported 
              little change in leasing and construction activity since our last 
              report. Leasing activity rose slightly in the industrial sector, 
              but was flat in the office and retail sectors. Vacancy rates continued 
              to edge up across all sectors and a number of District contacts 
              noted the persistence of a "wait and see" attitude among clients. 
              Rents stabilized in the retail and industrial sectors, but declined 
              further in the office sector. The rate of new sublease space coming 
              onto the market declined across the office and retail markets. A 
              Northern Virginia Realtor reported that the office-sublet market 
              was finally starting to "firm up" and that vacant space was being 
              absorbed by "a variety of users." Although a smattering of new projects 
              were reported, new construction activity remained generally flat 
              across the District.
           <p>
            <b>
             Tourism
            </b>
            <br/>
            District tourist activity continued to be mixed in recent weeks. 
              A manager at a ski resort in West Virginia told us that the pace 
              of business had picked up considerably in February and that record 
              attendance was expected in March. A counterpart at a resort in Virginia, 
              however, reported that business was off 30 percent from a year ago--unseasonably 
              warm and dry weather had caused a shortage of water reserves essential 
              for making snow. But mild weather boosted tourist activity at coastal 
              resorts. A contact on the Outer Banks of North Carolina said that 
              bookings during Valentine's Day and the Presidents' Day holiday 
              weekend were much better than a year ago, which she attributed in 
              part to patrons taking holidays closer to home because of ongoing 
              concerns with air safety. Looking ahead, tourism industry contacts 
              were encouraged by the strong pace of spring bookings, with some 
              areas being booked to capacity through June.
            <p>
             <b>
              Temporary Employment
             </b>
             <br/>
             Temporary employment agencies in the District reported continued 
              strengthening in the demand for workers in recent weeks. Employment 
              agents in Northern Virginia, Richmond, Va., and Rockville, Md., 
              told us that demand for workers had risen in recent weeks and that 
              they expected demand to continue to rise over the next six months 
              as the economy rebounds. A contact in Hagerstown, Md., said that 
              demand was "somewhat weak" at her firm, but noted that she was beginning 
              to see "hopeful signs of increased customer activity." Light industrial 
              workers and customer service representatives were among the most 
              highly sought employees in the District.
             <p>
              <b>
               Agriculture
              </b>
              <br/>
              Mild weather in January and much of February allowed District farmers 
              to make good progress in field preparation. Dry conditions, however, 
              persisted in many areas of the District. Some areas of North Carolina 
              and Virginia will require several months of above-normal rainfall 
              to fully replenish soil moisture. In North Carolina and West Virginia, 
              sparse rainfall prompted earlier feeding of livestock and hauling 
              of water in some areas, while in South Carolina supplemental feeding 
              of livestock continued because of poor pasture conditions. Small 
              grains in most areas of the District were reported to be progressing 
              well despite the arid soil conditions. Agricultural analysts noted, 
              however, that additional precipitation was needed to keep small 
              grain crops in good condition.
