      Beige Book Report: San Francisco

      <strong>
       July 28, 2004
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from contacts indicate that the District economy continued to expand 

  at a solid pace from early June through mid-July, although growth appeared to 

  have slowed slightly compared with the previous survey period. Compensation 

  and final prices rose modestly in general; however, there were scattered reports 

  of increased wage pressures for selected types of workers. Consumer demand for 

  retail items moderated compared to the previous survey period, while demand 

  for most services remained strong. Manufacturing output continued to expand, 

  but the pace slowed compared with earlier this year. Sales were brisk for most 

  agricultural products. Demand for residential real estate remained robust, and 

  demand for commercial real estate was stable or up a bit. District banks reported 

  solid demand for all loan categories and good credit quality.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Wages
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District contacts reported modest price inflation during the survey period. 

  Fuel and energy prices fell back somewhat, but rising prices for steel, cement, 

  and some raw materials boosted production costs in some industries. Some contacts 

  noted increased pricing power relative to earlier in the year, but in general 

  vigorous competition still limited firms' ability to pass cost increases on 

  to final prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wage and salary pressures were modest overall. However, shortages of qualified 

  job applicants and increased outside competition for existing employees generated 

  notable wage and salary increases for skilled occupations in a number of industries, 

  including construction, manufacturing, financial services, and technology services. 

  Contacts noted that where wages have been rising, productivity gains generally 

  have been adequate to hold constant or reduce labor costs per unit of output. 

  There were a few exceptions, notably for some firms in the banking, health-care, 

  and construction industries, where productivity growth did not keep pace with 

  wage gains and rising labor costs were absorbed into profit margins or passed 

  on to final prices. Some contacts noted recent or anticipated slowing in the 

  pace of productivity gains in their industries. Respondents in all sectors reported 

  that rising health insurance costs made a significant contribution to increases 

  in overall compensation costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported slight moderation in retail sales compared with the previous 

  survey period. Automobile sales fell in June. The decline was centered on domestic 

  makes, for which inventories reached very high levels. However, overall sales 

  recovered somewhat in early July. In retail, a contact from a major department 

  store chain noted that "sales have softened" compared with earlier in the year, 

  although other retail contacts reported further sales increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Service providers saw strong demand throughout the District. Robust sales were 

  reported for providers of advertising, communications, entertainment, and health-care 

  services. Shipping traffic through District ports expanded, spurred by vigorous 

  international trade flows. District travel and tourism activity strengthened 

  further. Hawaii's tourist traffic has been growing at a double-digit pace compared 

  with a year earlier, and hotel occupancy rates there recently regained their 

  highs from the year 2000. Hotel occupancy rates also rose in San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturers reported generally solid demand for their products, although 

  growth slowed in some sectors. Semiconductor sales grew at a slower pace and 

  manufacturers' inventories rose slightly, but capacity utilization in the industry 

  remained high. Demand was strong for some categories of communications equipment, 

  including items used for high-speed Internet access and office computer networks. 

  Metal fabricators, transportation equipment makers, and manufacturers of wood 

  products operated at high levels, although new orders slowed slightly. Demand 

  remained strong for apparel and textile products.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported brisk sales for District agricultural products. Demand for 

  beef cattle and other livestock has been especially strong, reportedly pushing 

  prices to unusually high levels. Berry crop yields were very high in the Pacific 

  Northwest, but solid demand kept prices firm. Similar strength was evident for 

  the California nut and grape crops, although sales reportedly were weak for 

  some other fruit crops in that state. Demand for dairy products remained strong, 

  and one contact noted that milk prices were at five-year highs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for residential real estate remained vigorous, and reports indicated 

  modest further improvement on the nonresidential side. Sales of new and existing 

  homes were rapid in most areas, especially in Southern California and Hawaii, 

  where demand growth noticeably outstripped supply growth and rapid price appreciation 

  continued. However, reports indicated that the pace of home sales and construction 

  starts has leveled off in some parts of the District, including Utah and the 

  Seattle area. Demand for residential rental properties weakened slightly in 

  the Los Angeles area. On the commercial side, demand for office space improved 

  a bit further in some areas, although prices and rental rates remained largely 

  flat. In the population centers east of Los Angeles, demand for commercial real 

  estate was very strong, with prices on industrial space reportedly up 40 percent 

  from a year earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District banking contacts reported strong loan demand and good credit quality 

  on existing loans. Business loan demand increased further in most areas, although 

  contacts in a few areas noted a recent drop due to reduced business optimism 

  about the likely payoff to capital improvements. Lending for new residential 

  mortgages fell somewhat but remains quite high. Several contacts noted significant 

  increases in venture capital funding and planned initial public offerings.
