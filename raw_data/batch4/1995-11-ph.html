      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 1, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District were mixed in October. 
Manufacturers reported continuing gains in orders and shipments. 
General merchandise retailers noted a slowdown in the pace of sales, 
extending from September into October. Auto dealers generally 
indicated that sales were steady but that the rate in recent weeks 
was below the rate set in late summer. Lending by commercial banks 
was moving up, with gains in commercial and industrial loans and 
credit card loans. Most of the commercial and residential realtors 
contacted for this report described real estate activity as steady. 
Commercial construction activity was not strong, and some reports 
indicated that residential building was slowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, manufacturers expect business to continue to improve. 
Retailers are apprehensive that the current slow pace of sales may 
persist, but auto dealers anticipate some improvement in the weeks 
ahead as they take delivery of new models. Bankers said that growth 
in credit card lending might ease. Realtors expect demand for 
commercial space to remain relatively flat and they expect the 
supply of homes for sale to remain large relative to demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from Third District manufacturers in October indicated that 
industrial activity was rising. New orders were moving up, and 
production appeared to be keeping pace with demand as shipments were 
also on the rise while order backlogs were steady. Employment and 
working hours also were steady, and manufacturers reported almost no 
change in inventories during the month. Firms producing electrical 
machinery, metals and metal products, and glass and glass products 
reported relatively stronger business, while apparel and furniture 
makers indicated that their business had eased.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, manufacturers in the region expect the current upward 
trend to persist in the months ahead. They forecast further gains in 
orders and shipments, with perhaps a slight increase in order 
backlogs. Some firms are planning a slight lengthening of the 
workweek in the next six months, and some intend to step up capital 
spending during the last quarter of this year and the first quarter 
of 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers interviewed in mid-October generally said 
that the pace of sales had eased in recent weeks. Some major apparel 
and appliance stores in the region reported substantial declines in 
their business. The slowdown was even affecting discount stores that 
had been experiencing stronger business than other types of stores 
in late summer and early fall. Store executives expressed surprise 
at the recent weakness but said they were planning to keep 
inventories lean in case sales do not rebound soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the region also reported a drop in the rate of sales 
since the summer, although they generally said that the pace had 
been steady in recent weeks. Dealers believe that the end of model 
closeout incentives dampened sales, and several said the supply of 
vehicles had been interrupted due to manufacturers' shutdowns for 
model changeovers and a strike at firms that transport new vehicles. 
Consequently, inventories have not risen and dealers expect at least 
some pickup in sales when new models become available in the weeks 
ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending at major Third District banks has moved up in recent weeks, 
largely due to increased borrowing by businesses. Some bankers 
reported that large national firms have stepped up usage of credit 
lines. In contrast, these bankers indicated that local middle-market 
companies have been reluctant to expand operations and therefore 
have not taken on new debt. Consumer borrowing has increased 
somewhat in the District, mainly due to credit card lending; other 
types of personal borrowing have not been strong. Several bankers 
said they believe the growth of total consumer borrowing could ease 
in the near future. They anticipate this as a result of possible 
deterioration in consumer confidence and tightening of credit 
standards by banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from commercial real estate firms in the Third District 
suggest that the market has been relatively steady in the past 
month, with little change in office vacancy rates. Effective rental 
rates appear to have eased a bit recently, and property prices have 
remained at what realtors characterize as low levels. Contacts in 
the commercial real estate industry foresee no major increase in 
demand for space on the immediate horizon, and they anticipate that 
new construction will be minimal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from residential realtors have been mixed, but the overall 
state of residential markets in the District appeared to be steady 
in October. New homes were selling somewhat better than existing 
homes in some markets, although there were reports that land 
development and construction efforts were being scaled back by some 
builders. Most of the realtors providing information for this report 
said there continues to be a large a supply of homes for sale and 
that demand for homes in the higher price ranges was relatively 
weak.
