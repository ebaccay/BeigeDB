      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      From mid-October to mid-November,

Eleventh District economic

activity rebounded from sluggish growth

in September and early October. Several

industries reported a general firming in

prices after reporting falling prices in the

last Beige Book, and contacts continued to

report that labor market tightness was

leading to some wage pressures.

Rebounding home sales led a pick up in

construction, which helped stimulate

demand for some construction-related

manufactured products. The electronics

industry also reported rebounding sales

and, overall, manufacturers were more

optimistic about the sales outlook than

reported in the last Beige Book. Retailers

reported "good" sales growth over the past

six weeks, while high prices continued to

boost demand for oil services. The

financial services industry reported a

decline in the demand for loans. Continued

rainfall improved agricultural conditions

overall.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Several industries reported a

general firming in prices after reporting

falling prices in the last survey. Prices

were stabilizing with a downward trend

for semiconductors (including memory

chips), after falling precipitously earlier

this year. Prices remained very

competitive with a downward trend for

personal computers and

telecommunications products. Retailers

were pleased that prices were mostly

holding steady, and a few noted that they

are now able to pass on cost increases that

they had eaten in the past. Still, retailers

said that the market remains very

competitive limiting price increases. Auto

dealers said prices on new models are

expected to be slightly higher "but nothing

unusual." Low inventories are causing

energy prices to swing with the weather.

Crude oil prices weakened to $22.50 in

early November but rebounded to near $25 per

barrel after a cold spell in the Northeast.

Heating oil and natural gas prices also fell

and then rebounded, as low inventories are

contributing to weather-related price

volatility. Scrap metal prices continued to

fall.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Wages
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Hiring difficulties in several

manufacturing and service industries

continued to lead to upward wage

pressures for specialized skills and some

low-wage workers.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Sales of manufactured

products rebounded slightly, and

manufacturers were generally more

optimistic about the sales outlook than

reported in the last Beige Book. Demand

was up for most electronics and a few

construction-related products, such as

fabricated metals and brick, while

equipment sales to the energy industry

continued to be very strong. Contacts in the

electronics industry seemed relieved to

report a seasonal increase in orders for

semiconductors, computers and

telecommunications equipment, and were

more optimistic about the outlook for the

industry than they were earlier this year.

Electronics inventories were reported to

be in better shape than earlier this year,

although several contacts said inventories

were still too large. Apparel

manufacturers said sales were up over the

past month, partly as a result of increased

sales to Mexico. Oil machinery companies

continue to report extremely strong

demand. Demand for corrugated boxes

and packaging supplies increased

seasonally, as expected, and most contacts

said inventories were appropriate.

However, packaging contacts were less

optimistic than earlier this year about the

outlook for sales. Petrochemical

producers are being hurt by higher prices

for natural gas liquids and oil. Demand

remains strong, but not strong enough to

pass through all of the increased feedstock

costs. Refiners have seen profit margins

improve with

higher gasoline and heating oil prices, but

regard margins to not be high on a

historical basis. Food and cement

manufacturers said there was no change

in demand for their product. Lumber sales

were down slightly, although contacts

were more optimistic about the outlook

than six weeks ago. Scrap metal sales

continued to fall.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Retail Sales
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retailers reported "good"

sales growth over the past six weeks. Most

contacts were more optimistic about

holiday sales, despite some nervousness

about the shorter holiday season.

Inventories were in line with

expectations, and some contacts suggested

there will be less pressure to discount

prices than last year. Sales were reported

to be particularly strong for better men's

and women's apparel. Consumer

electronics retailers reported sluggish

personal

computer sales, although demand for

peripheral equipment remained strong.

Auto dealers reported continued sluggish

sales. Dealers do not expect sales growth to

improve for the next few months "with

nothing to make the market snap given

that interest rates are pretty low already."
          <p>
           <strong>
            Financial Services
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Lending activity was

weaker than six weeks ago, led by a drop in

demand for commercial and industrial

loans, and residential real estate loans in

San Antonio and Houston. Refinancings

continued to decline. Consumer auto loan

demand was up in Dallas. Contacts remain

cautious about the outlook for lending,

although some respondents are looking for

a pickup in residential real estate loan

demand over the next year.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Construction and Real Estate
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Contacts said

demand for construction and real estate

was up since the last Beige Book. Home

sales rebounded after a drop in September

and early October. Apartment construction

continued to increase at a steady

pace, and the construction of extended-stay

hotels was strong in Dallas. Contacts said

the office market continued to improve,

especially in Dallas, where a lack of vacant

space in the suburban market continues to

drive rents upward.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Energy
             </strong>
             <br/>
             High prices continued to boost

demand for oil services, and contacts

continued to report that there is no excess

capacity of equipment or services available

anywhere on a global basis. Contacts

reported a shortage of land rigs, and said

the availability figures for land rigs are

greatly overstated "if you want a decent

piece of equipment." One contact said that

their backlogs are so long that they are not

taking any new orders.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Agriculture
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Continued rainfall

improved agricultural conditions. Harvest

was being completed across the District

and most producers were reporting good

yields for soybeans, peanuts and corn.

Frost damaged some cotton and late-planted

sorghum but facilitated harvesting

and provided needed relief from

bollworms and armyworms. Livestock

conditions were rated good overall.

Supplemental feeding picked up as cooler

temperatures arrived, but hay supplies are

good.
