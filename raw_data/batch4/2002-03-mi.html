      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 6, 2002
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall economic activity in the Ninth District 
            appears to have edged up in recent months. Residential construction 
            and mining activities are up slightly. The commercial construction, 
            tourism and energy sectors have slowed. Meanwhile, the consumer spending, 
            manufacturing and agriculture sectors are mixed. From early January 
            to mid-February, labor markets loosened slightly, while overall wages 
            and prices were stable. However, decreases in some construction materials 
            prices and increases in home prices and insurance premiums were noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction activity is soft. Contracts awarded for 
              heavy construction projects decreased 22 percent in the three-month 
              period ending in January compared with the same period last year. 
              A representative of a commercial construction company said that 
              the market has bottomed out in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Vacancy 
              rates in the industrial markets of some Minneapolis suburbs are 
              as high as 17 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      District home building is solid. Home permits 
              in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were up 7 percent in January compared 
              with a year earlier, with strength particularly noted in multi-family 
              construction. According to residential construction officials in 
              Sioux Falls, S.D., home builders are expected to be busy in 2002, 
              but the year is likely to finish somewhat slower than the previous 
              two record-breaking years. A contractor in Bismarck, N.D., expects 
              to build 25 percent more housing in 2002 compared with a year earlier. 
              Bank directors reported that the outlook for residential construction 
              is optimistic for the upcoming year, with softness noted in the 
              high-end housing market in Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending is mixed. A major Minneapolis-based department 
              store retailer reported that overall same-store sales in January 
              were up 6 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minneapolis area 
              mall manager estimated that sales increased about 4 percent in February 
              compared with a year ago. In North Dakota a mall manager expects 
              February sales to finish up 3 percent to 5 percent compared with 
              last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, a St. Paul area mall manager noted 
              slightly less traffic in January and February compared with last 
              year. A Helena branch bank director reported slow February traffic 
              at a Montana mall compared with a year ago. A Minnesota-based leather 
              products retailer said that same-store sales in January were down 
              17 percent compared with last year. Auto sales in Minnesota slowed 
              in January and February, according to a representative of an auto 
              dealers association.
     </p>
     <p>
      Little snowfall and warm weather has halted winter 
              tourism activities in many areas. Some businesses in the Upper Peninsula 
              of Michigan expect the season to be off as much as 40 percent to 
              50 percent due to poor snowmobiling conditions. A tourism official 
              in South Dakota estimated ski activity down 45 percent and snowmobiling 
              down 70 percent this year compared with a year ago. However, traffic 
              at Mount Rushmore, considered a "fair weather" attraction, set monthly 
              attendance records from October through January. A ski resort in 
              Montana reported good snow conditions this year and an increase 
              in visits over last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is mixed. Preliminary results of a February 
              survey of Minnesota manufacturers reveal that production in the 
              first half of 2002 will be higher than the levels of the last half 
              of 2001. However, a January survey of purchasing managers by Creighton 
              University indicated slight decreases in manufacturing activity 
              in Minnesota and South Dakota and slight increases in North Dakota. 
              In Minnesota, a factory that produces industrial abrasives plans 
              to severely curtail output. However, a data storage producer in 
              North Dakota plans to expand output and employees this spring, and 
              a new pasta plant is expected to begin production in April. In addition, 
              a new dairy plant is scheduled in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 
              A Montana steel producer plans to expand output to meet demand for 
              a new short-distance rail line, according to a Helena bank director.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mining and Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy sector is down somewhat, while mining is 
              up slightly. Mid-February district oil and natural gas exploration 
              and production levels were slightly behind the levels of early January. 
              Meanwhile, the iron ore industry is up slightly in the first two 
              months of this year compared with November and December of last 
              year. Production at a large mine in northern Minnesota returned 
              to more normal levels and another mine expects to resume production 
              in March. Mining production is stable to up slightly in Montana, 
              according to a state mining official.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dry and warm weather conditions have favored livestock and dairy 
              producers but have hampered crop producers. Livestock producers 
              report little stress on their herds, due to the unseasonable warm 
              weather across the district. Meanwhile, the Montana Agricultural 
              Statistics Service reported that winter wheat producers are increasingly 
              concerned about the lack of snow cover to protect from cold temperatures 
              and gusty winds. Winter wheat snow cover was rated at 69 percent 
              very poor, while wind damage was rated at 28 percent heavy. Freeze 
              and drought damage was rated at 41 percent heavy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some layoff announcements were cited since the last report. A large 
              computer maker will cut more than 500 positions at two South Dakota 
              plants. A high-tech manufacturer announced job cuts that may include 
              closing a St. Paul plant, affecting 86 workers. A Minnesota-based 
              airline will cut 64 mechanics positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a marker of looser labor markets, a Minnesota 
              company recently reported a 70 percent acceptance rate of offers 
              made to applicants for open positions, an increase from a historical 
              average of 50 percent. Initial claims for unemployment insurance 
              in Minnesota were up 28 percent in January compared with a year 
              earlier, including a large increase in claims from the construction 
              sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, a computer company is planning to 
              hire 100 employees in North Dakota. Furthermore, U.S. Customs will 
              add 39 jobs at North Dakota's border with Canada. A call center 
              in northern Minnesota will add 65 more workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases are modest. St. Paul public school 
              teachers recently agreed to a 2 percent increase in pay; the overall 
              wage and benefit package was considered average compared with recent 
              contracts, according to a union official. In contrast, according 
              to the results of a December St. Cloud Area Quarterly Business Report 
              survey, 55 percent of respondents in central Minnesota expect increases 
              in employee compensation by June.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases are moderate, with price decreases 
              noted in some construction materials and increases in home prices 
              and insurance rates. Recent steel and cement prices have decreased 
              slightly from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the median price of homes 
              recently sold in Minneapolis-St. Paul is up 12 percent compared 
              with a year earlier. Some home insurance premiums during the past 
              two months are 10 percent to 30 percent higher than last year in 
              North Dakota, according to an official.
