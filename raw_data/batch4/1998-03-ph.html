      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Third District in February and early 
March were mixed but positive overall. Manufacturers reported 
continued increases in shipments and orders. Retailers said sales 
were moving up, but auto dealers said sales had eased. Bankers 
reported some slowing in overall loan demand as lending to 
individuals declined, but they were generally posting gains in real 
estate and business lending. Both commercial and residential real 
estate markets were described as healthy by real estate agents and 
home builders. Commercial construction was said to be increasing, 
and residential construction was characterized as steady at a fairly 
strong rate. Contacts in the retail and real estate sectors cited 
mild weather as a boost to current activity, but fundamental 
conditions were also considered to be good, and further gains are 
anticipated in the spring.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturers reported continued improvement in business in February 
compared to January. Shipments were up at one-third of the firms 
surveyed, and four out of ten said new orders had increased, twice 
the number reporting decreases. Firms in nearly all major industry 
sectors reported improvement; however, several companies commented 
that orders from Asian customers were declining. The industries most 
affected were machinery, chemicals, and high-technology products.
       <p>
        On balance, Third District manufacturers boosted employment in 
February. Around 20 percent of the firms contacted added jobs in the 
month; 75 percent held employment steady. Industries with employment 
increases were textiles, machinery, transportation equipment, and 
instruments. Employment eased among food processors and producers of 
primary metals. In other industries, mainly consumer goods 
manufacturing, employment was steady.
        <p>
         Industrial prices in the region remain nearly steady. More than 
three-fourths of the manufacturers contacted for this report said 
the prices of the goods they buy were unchanged from January to 
February, and nine-tenths said the prices they charge for their 
products have been level. Some firms said prices of the commodities 
they use have fallen recently, reducing their input costs, and 
several firms noted they were installing new equipment to increase 
production efficiency and reduce operating costs in order to keep 
output prices competitive.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Retail
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Retail sales in the Third District have been moving up since the 
start of the year, according to merchants polled in early March. 
Based on these retailers' comments, sales in the region have been 
running approximately 4 percent above last year's pace, on a current 
dollar basis. Store executives believe mild weather boosted sales in 
January and February, but they said the usual spring pickup, 
especially in sales of apparel, appeared to be occurring in early 
March.
          <p>
           Auto dealers generally reported a slowdown in sales during February 
and an increase in inventories except for some popular models. Sales 
of both cars and light trucks have eased from January's rate. 
Despite the current slowdown, most of the dealers contacted expect 
sales to improve this spring.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Finance
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Most of the Third District banks contacted for this report indicated 
that their loan volumes outstanding were falling slightly. In recent 
weeks, real estate lending and lending to businesses have been 
increasing, but consumer lending has been declining. Both 
residential and commercial real estate lending were moving up at the 
region's financial institutions. Bankers noted increases in purchase 
mortgages and home equity loans. Although commercial real estate 
lending has increased, bankers said they were becoming increasingly 
selective, turning down prospective borrowers who have requested 
loans of higher amounts in relation to property values than has been 
the norm recently. Banks are actively soliciting new commercial and 
industrial loans, especially among middle market firms.
            <p>
             Much of the slowdown in consumer lending has been in auto financing. 
Banks have been cautious in lease financing in response to declining 
residual values. According to some reports, auto manufacturers' 
finance subsidiaries have taken more of the lease financing 
business.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Real Estate and Construction
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Commercial real estate agents reported that office vacancy rates 
declined from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 1997 and 
rents rose. According to recent surveys by commercial real estate 
companies in the region, office vacancy rates dropped around 1 
percentage point during the last quarter of 1997 to around 14 
percent in central Philadelphia and 10 percent, on average, in 
suburban markets. Vacancy rates for Class A buildings were lower, 
but real estate agents said vacancy rates for less than Class A 
buildings were significantly higher and rents were lower. Demand for 
industrial space, primarily distribution facilities, remained high. 
Some speculative construction of offices and industrial buildings 
was under way in the region. Commercial realtors generally agreed 
that current rents and vacancy rates justify construction of more 
buildings, but some were concerned that an oversupply of space could 
develop if economic growth in the region eases.
              <p>
               Residential realtors and home builders said sales of existing and new homes 
              have been steady in the past month at fairly high levels. There 
              has been some price appreciation for existing homes and increased 
              demand for higher-priced new homes, although both realtors and builders 
              said price increases have not been great. Realtors said some of 
              the strength in home sales this winter, compared to last year, has 
              been due to the mild weather, but they added that healthy employment 
              conditions and the rising stock market have boosted buyers' willingness 
              to make home purchases.
