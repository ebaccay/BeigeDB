      Beige Book Report: New York

       September 3, 2003
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has given mostly 
                positive signals since the last report. The mid-August power outage 
                evidently had a minimal effect on overall economic activity-some 
                impact was reported on retailers and contract employers. Retail 
                sales, which were above plan in July, were close to plan, on balance, 
                in the first three weeks of August; inventories were generally 
                reported to be at desired levels. Manufacturing activity continued 
                to improve in July and early August, and there was a noticeable 
                pickup in port traffic.
      <p>
       Housing markets have continued to show strength, 
                although some contacts view brisk summer activity as an artifact 
                of rising mortgage rates. New York City's office market continued 
                to improve in July, with particular strength in the Class B segment, 
                and city hotels report increased business. Finally, bankers in 
                the district report stable loan demand, little change in credit 
                standards, and increased delinquency rates on commercial loans 
                but decreased rates on home mortgages.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Major retail chains report that sales in the District were generally 
                above plan in July, but were more mixed in the first three weeks 
                of August. Three retail chains report that the blackout adversely 
                affected sales. One reports that sales are ahead of plan despite 
                the outage, but the other two describe sales as slightly below 
                plan, primarily due to the outage, and do not expect all of the 
                shortfall to be made up by the end of the month. Overall, year-over-year 
                changes in comparable-store sales ranged from up 2 percent to 
                up 7 percent in July, and from down 3 percent to up 6 percent 
                in August. In general, sales of back-to-school merchandise were 
                described as strong-women's apparel, lawn and garden, and home 
                furnishings and appliances were also reported to be especially 
                brisk. The pricing environment remained weak. Most retailers say 
                inventories are in good shape.
        <p>
         Manhattan hotels report that business was fairly 
                strong in July and early August: while room rates were down about 
                3 percent from a year earlier, occupancies were up nearly 5 percent. 
                As a result, total revenues were up, on a year-over-year basis, 
                for the first time this year. While two major New York City hotels 
                had to evacuate during the blackout, most were fully occupied-some 
                offered discounts and even free rooms.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          The housing market has remained robust in recent weeks. New Jersey 
                home-builders report that housing demand has been unusually strong 
                for August, as rising mortgage rates have reportedly spurred a 
                sense of urgency among buyers. Construction is lower than in 2002, 
                mainly due to a dearth of available land, and selling prices are 
                said to be leveling off but still higher than a year ago. Buffalo-area 
                realtors indicate that home sales were strong in July and that 
                selling prices were up roughly 10 percent from a year earlier. 
                Across most of New York state, compared with a year earlier, there 
                were fewer sales transactions but median selling prices posted 
                double-digit gains. Manhattan's co-op and condo market was described 
                as unusually busy during the first half of August; selling prices 
                were steady but still noticeably higher than a year ago. Apartment 
                rental markets have been mixed but generally sluggish. In Manhattan, 
                while rents remain moderately below a year earlier, they are said 
                to have firmed modestly since the end of 2002. In contrast, New 
                Jersey's Hudson riverfront rental market has experienced persistently 
                high vacancy rates and little or no rebound in rents.
          <p>
           Manhattan's office market showed continued improvement 
                in July, led by strong leasing activity in the Class B segment, 
                largely from small to medium-sized firms. Overall, vacancy rates 
                declined moderately in Midtown and Midtown South; Lower Manhattan's 
                rate inched up but is still substantially lower than at the end 
                of the first quarter. Asking rents appear to have leveled off 
                this year but are still roughly 8 percent lower than a year ago.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Other Business Activity
            </strong>
            <br/>
            A major New York City employment agency reports more than the 
                usual seasonal slowing in hiring activity in recent weeks, following 
                a strong June and July, but suggests that the August lull is probably 
                temporary, reflecting a growing trend toward concentrating vacations 
                in August. This contact also notes that the pace of layoffs has 
                slowed noticeably in recent months and anticipates a brisk rebound 
                in hiring after Labor Day. The blackout had a noticeable but short-lived 
                effect on contract employment: lost hours and wages for temp workers 
                and reduced fees and commissions for the agency.
            <p>
             The manufacturing sector has shown continued positive 
                momentum in July and early August. Our monthly survey of New York 
                State manufacturers shows continued improvement in conditions 
                in early August. Buffalo-area purchasers report a strong snapback 
                in manufacturing-sector conditions in July, following a brief 
                slowdown in June. Similarly, Rochester purchasers report improved 
                business conditions in both manufacturing and other sectors. Finally, 
                New York City area purchasing managers report continued improvement 
                in the manufacturing sector in July; there was some leveling off 
                outside of manufacturing, where New York City respondents had 
                been reporting weakening throughout the first half of the year. 
                Purchasing managers in all three metropolitan areas report an 
                upturn in input prices.
             <p>
              A major freight shipping terminal reports a noticeable 
                increase in volume (mostly imports from Asia) since the beginning 
                of August; total volume is reported to be up roughly 10 to 13 
                percent from a year earlier, and largely represents holiday-season 
                retail merchandise. Part of the pickup reflects a trend toward 
                more "all-water" services to the East Coast ports from Asia, and 
                is spurring increased warehousing and distribution in New Jersey. 
                The power outage at the port lasted less than four hours and had 
                a minimal effect.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Financial Developments
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Small to medium-sized Second District banks report relatively 
                stable loan demand in the latest survey. Demand for residential 
                mortgages was mixed, with nearly half of bankers indicating lower 
                demand, but a similar proportion reporting higher demand. Widespread 
                declines were reported in refinancing activity. On the supply 
                side, over 90 percent of bankers in each category report no change 
                in credit standards.
               <p>
                Interest rates rose for all types of loans-in particular 
                more than three in four bankers report higher rates for residential 
                mortgages, and more than half report an increase in rates for 
                commercial mortgages. However, average deposit rates declined, 
                with over half of bankers reporting lower rates, as opposed to 
                one in six reporting higher rates. Bankers report that delinquency 
                rates increased for commercial and industrial loans but decreased 
                for residential mortgages.
