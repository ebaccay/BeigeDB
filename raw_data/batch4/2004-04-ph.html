      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia

      <b>
       April 21, 2004
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District expanded in March and 
              the improving trend continued into April. Manufacturers reported 
              increases in orders and shipments in March and further gains in 
              early April. Retail sales of general merchandise in March were above 
              the level of the prior year, and early April results indicated ongoing 
              upward momentum. Auto and light truck sales rose from February to 
              March but were lower than in March of last year. Bank lending has 
              been moving up slowly in the past few weeks. Investment companies 
              have been posting strong increases in business. Service sector firms 
              reported growth, although the strength of the gains has been mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District business community is generally 
              optimistic, although the pace of improvement is not expected to 
              pick up appreciably. Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments 
              and orders during the next six months. Retailers anticipate a moderate 
              increase in sales for the spring season compared with a year ago. 
              Bankers expect business and consumer lending to increase, but have 
              mixed views on the course of residential mortgage activity. Service 
              companies anticipate continued moderate growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Manufacturing
      </b>
      <br/>
      Third District

manufacturers reported gains in activity in early April, maintaining the upward

momentum from March. Nearly half of the manufacturing companies contacted said

their orders and shipments were on the rise, and less than one-fifth said orders

and shipments were declining. On balance, order backlogs at area plants

leveled off in April after modest increases during the winter. Firms in all of

the major manufacturing sectors in the region except transportation equipment

generally indicated that business conditions were improving. Increases in

demand were especially strong for firms producing lumber products, petroleum

products, industrial materials, and metal products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing firms in

the region continued to report rising prices in April. Goods whose prices were

frequently mentioned as high or rising include natural gas, oil, steel and

other metals, plastics, lumber, and various building materials. Additionally,

several manufacturers indicated that steel and iron supplies are limited.
     </p>
     <p>
      The region's

manufacturers expect business activity to remain on an upward trend. More than

half of the firms contacted for this report expect increases in shipments and

orders, and less than one in five expect decreases during the next six months.

Area manufacturing firms are scheduling increases in capital spending and are

planning to add employees and extend working hours in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District

retailers surveyed in early April generally reported that sales were rising

compared with the sales of March and April of last year. Some merchants said

cold and rainy weather at the start of April slowed the rate of sales growth,

but the majority of retailers indicated a steady pace of growth in store

traffic and sales. Some store executives noted that the average customer

purchase has increased, and some reported that sales of luxury items have

risen. Sales of spring apparel increased in line with merchants' plans, and

sales of jewelry were also on the rise. Retailers generally described

inventories as appropriate for the current sales rate, with most spring

merchandise delivered. Some store executives said they were continuing to

implement efficiencies in the supply chain that were permitting further

reductions in delivery times and lower average inventory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District

retailers expect sales for the spring season to be above the same period last

year. Most store executives said the gain will be moderate, but some have

revised their forecasts up slightly. Several retailers noted that the costs of

building maintenance and construction have begun to increase noticeably,

although most reported that the costs of goods have been mostly steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers reported a

rise in sales in March from February, but a slight decline from March a year

ago. Dealers indicated that sales of most foreign nameplates have been rising

compared with domestic makes, although some imports appeared to be losing

ground. Dealers generally expect sales to continue around the current rate for

most of this year, but some are growing concerned that it will be difficult to

maintain the high sales rate of the past several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Finance
      </b>
      <br/>
      Outstanding loan volume

at Third District banks was moving up slowly in April, according to banks

contacted for this report. Commercial and industrial loans were on the rise as

the credit needs of middle-market firms in the region have risen. Residential

real estate lending continued on an upward trend. Consumer credit has been

expanding, as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the

District generally expect lending to grow moderately this year, although some

believe a slight pickup in the rate of growth is possible. They expect

business lending to increase further, although several indicated that

competition among lenders is limiting loan income. Bankers expect consumer

lending to expand also. Although demand for residential mortgage lending is

currently high, bankers are uncertain that the recent pace of growth in

mortgage lending will persist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Investment

companies in the District reported that cash inflows have been strong since the

beginning of the year, and they expect high rates of investment by individual

and institutional investors to continue through the rest of the year.

Executives at investment companies said investor confidence appears to be

rising, and that recent adverse publicity about some mutual funds does not

appear to be damping the public's interest in stock and bond funds in general.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Services
      </b>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third

District service firms contacted in April reported improving business, although

the scale of gains varied. Information technology firms have had some

accelerating increases in activity. Contacts said system upgrades and

maintenance, business applications, and information security measures have been

the primary areas in which demand for information technology services has been

growing. Among other business services, there has been an increase in

consulting activity and very slight gains in building services and basic

business support services. Trucking firms report steady growth in activity.

Most service sector contacts expect business to continue to advance at around

its current growth rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Temporary and permanent

employment agencies in the region reported an increase in demand for workers

since the winter months. The increase in hiring is coming in construction,

trade, services, and finance. Placement offices at colleges and universities

in the region reported that recruitment is up compared with last year.

Industry sectors that are more active this year are finance, real estate,

media, healthcare, information technology, and architectural services.
