      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of economic growth in the Twelfth District picked up a bit 
in early summer, although some signs of weakness remained. Retail 
sales generally continued to be weak, and the earlier dropback in 
construction continued to hold down manufacturing production of 
construction materials. However, manufacturers of some other 
products reported higher rates of resource utilization. Residential 
real estate and construction activity reportedly experienced a 
slight uptick in early summer, with the exception of parts of 
California. District agricultural production has been hampered by 
abnormal weather. The banking sector reports further growth of loan 
demand in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Sentiment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Twelfth District business leaders generally expect national economic 
growth over the next year to stabilize at about its long-run average 
pace. Also, about one-half of the survey respondents expect the 
national unemployment rate to exhibit little change or to improve 
slightly over the next four quarters. Within the region, housing 
starts and growth in consumer spending are expected to continue at 
about the pace of the prior four quarters, and business investment 
is expected to accelerate somewhat. Business sentiment is 
particularly optimistic in Oregon and Utah. California respondents 
generally expect business investment and consumer spending to 
continue expanding at a moderate pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales are weak for some products and in some geographic 
areas. District retailers report continued weak sales at automobile 
dealers and food stores, and sales of soft goods at department 
stores are reportedly falling short of last year's trend. Sales of 
both new and used motor vehicles were weak recently. Some retailers 
in California and Utah reportedly have tempered price increases out 
of fear of hurting their sales, given continued evidence of weak 
consumer confidence. Relative to a yew earlier, retail sales are way 
off in the Riverside area of Southern California.
     </p>
     <p>
      District service industries generally report continued moderate 
expansion of demand. In California, the demand for 
telecommunications services is growing moderately. The tourism 
industry is doing relatively well in San Diego. More generally, 
business activity near the border with Mexico reportedly has been 
stimulated by a proliferation of maquiladora  factories just across 
the border. In Oregon, demand for business services is increasing, 
owing, an part, to additional outsourcing by major corporations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity is mixed. Some respondents report 
continued high production levels, strong orders from their 
customers, and a lengthening of delivery times by suppliers. In 
contrast, manufacturing of construction-related materials continues 
to be weak, despite a recent uptick in orders for some materials. 
For example, wood products orders and prices reportedly have 
increased since early June, reflecting some revival of housing 
construction. However, manufacturers' sales of paint and coatings 
have not experienced any uptick and remain well below year earlier 
levels. In Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon, the rapid expansion by 
manufacturers of advanced technology products reportedly is boosting 
job growth. In Washington, an electronic components manufacturer 
reports that its suppliers are experiencing capacity constraints for 
the first time in this business cycle. Deliveries of farm equipment 
and parts also have been delayed, and heavy truck manufacturing 
remains at a high rate of capacity utilization.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural producers noted that unusual weather this year 
has hurt yields and boosted prices for several commodities. Abnormal 
weather reportedly is moving grain prices higher, knocking tree 
fruit yields down 25 percent, and delaying harvest of the cotton 
crop. However, cattle production reportedly continues at high 
levels, and harvests of most types of seafood we going well. 
Elsewhere, the mining industry in the Intermountain states 
reportedly is stable or improving, with an upswing in gold mining in 
Nevada.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In many areas residential real estate and construction activity 
experienced a slight uptick in early summer, but in some localities 
these sectors have deteriorated further. Housing sales and 
construction are reported to be firming in Arizona, Nevada, ad 
Oregon. Within California, the residential real estate market in the 
San Francisco Bay area recently improved, according to some 
accounts; however, in Sacramento, residential building permits and 
existing home sales are reported down sharply, and respondents 
reported concern about the impact of the closure of McClellan Air 
Force Base. Residential construction also continues to slump in the 
Central Valley and Riverside areas of California, and local housing 
markets are weak in eastern Washington.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate activity in the District 
generally has been flat to improving. In Oregon, construction awards 
have increased, as the multiplier effects began to resonate from a 
string of expansions by high-technology product manufacturers and 
from earlier rapid population growth. Nonresidential construction 
activity also continues to be strong in southern Nevada.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banks generally report further growth of loan demand. In 
Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, strong business loan demand prevails, and 
residential loan demand is reported to be rising, after slumping 
earlier. In recent months, large California banks have continued to 
see strong overall loan growth in the state as a whole, led by 
increases in commercial and industrial loans. However, in parts of 
Southern California loan demand continues to be weak.
