       March 6, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicated 
            a pickup in economic activity in January and early February. Respondents 
            reported steady prices for most consumer goods and services and little 
            pressure on wages. Consumer spending reportedly exceeded expectations 
            in recent weeks and travel spending improved slightly, but sales remained 
            below year-earlier values for both retailers and travel-related businesses. 
            Demand for high-tech manufactured goods reportedly strengthened further 
            in January and February, with contacts noting improvements in both 
            sales and orders. District agricultural producers reported little 
            change in conditions in recent weeks. Demand for low-to-medium priced 
            residential real estate remained fairly strong, although slightly 
            weaker than in previous months. In contrast, commercial real estate 
            markets continued to weaken. Bank contacts reported a drop-off in 
            borrowing in response to greater economic uncertainty and stricter 
            loan terms.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <p>
      <b>
       Prices and Wages
      </b>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported little change in consumer prices in the 
              recent survey period but noted some downward pressure on input costs, 
              especially energy. Falling input prices reportedly helped boost 
              profit margins in a number of sectors. Ongoing weakness in labor 
              markets further eased wage and salary pressures in the District 
              during the most recent survey period. Wage increases were scant 
              across sectors, and some contacts noted that some firms have suspended 
              bonus programs until the economy improves.
      <p>
       <b>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </b>
       <br/>
       District respondents reported better-than-expected retail sales 
              in January and early February. Still, nominal sales growth reportedly 
              remains flat to negative relative to a year earlier. Contacts reported 
              that retail inventories generally were in balance but that many 
              retail outlets were cutting jobs to bring staffing in line with 
              current requirements. Automobile sales slowed considerably relative 
              to the fourth quarter of 2001 as many zero percent financing programs 
              came to an end.
       <p>
        Respondents in the services sector noted that 
              the demand for professional services such as financial counseling, 
              advertising, and public relations fell in recent weeks. In contrast, 
              demand for communications services reportedly improved in January 
              and February. Travel and tourism also picked up slightly, although 
              demand remained well below year-earlier levels, creating excess 
              capacity at hotels, rental car agencies, airlines, and cruise ships.
        <p>
         <b>
          Manufacturing
         </b>
         <br/>
         District contacts noted further signs of stabilization in the high-tech 
              manufacturing sector, with improvements in new orders and sales 
              and continued success in drawing down inventories. Despite these 
              positives, high-tech manufacturing contacts reported that firms 
              continued to reduce employment.
         <p>
          Outside the high-tech sector, respondents reported 
              little improvement, with falling orders and excess capacity continuing 
              to depress output and earnings. Weakness was especially apparent 
              in the District's aerospace sector, where the impact of reduced 
              demand for air travel is beginning to show through to employment 
              at aircraft and parts manufacturers. Numerous manufacturing contacts 
              reported that the strong dollar and weak foreign economies continued 
              to damp export demand for manufactured goods.
          <p>
           <b>
            Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
           </b>
           <br/>
           District agricultural conditions reportedly changed little from 
              the previous survey period, with excess supply and low prices characterizing 
              markets for most products. On a positive note, cattle farmers and 
              growers of field crops worked down inventories, and saw improvements 
              in prices. The long period of low prices reportedly has prompted 
              producers of some products to engage in supply control programs. 
              For example, prune growers reportedly have taken measures to reduce 
              supply and stabilize prices. Several respondents noted that in the 
              context of the strong dollar, there was increased competition from 
              new global market players in South America, Northern Europe, and 
              China. Lastly, respondents in the energy sector noted that warmer 
              than normal weather has depressed demand for heating oil and natural 
              gas and slowed growth in the fuel transportation business.
           <p>
            <b>
             Real Estate and Construction
            </b>
            <br/>
            Conditions in real estate have remained mixed so far this year, 
              with commercial markets weakening further and residential markets 
              remaining stable. Respondents throughout the District noted further 
              increases in vacancy rates and declines in lease rates for commercial 
              property in recent weeks. Accordingly, construction on ongoing and 
              new commercial projects slowed substantially, with many builders 
              pausing until the economy improves.
            <p>
             In contrast, residential real estate markets in 
              the District remained solid. Respondents noted that sales of low-to-median 
              priced homes were strong, with many listed properties receiving 
              multiple offers. In California, markets in the San Francisco Bay 
              Area improved in January and February adding to ongoing strength 
              in Southern California and the Central Valley. Across the District, 
              the market for high-end homes remained weak, with sales and prices 
              declining relative to the previous survey period.
             <p>
              <b>
               Financial Institutions
              </b>
              <br/>
              District contacts reported that loan demand continued to fall on 
              net in January and early February. Contacts noted that some of the 
              drop-off in borrowing likely was due to the uncertain economic environment, 
              while stricter borrowing requirements have priced some businesses 
              out of the market. Respondents noted that consumer loans were more 
              readily available with respect to price and loan terms than were 
              business loans.
