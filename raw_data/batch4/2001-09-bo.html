      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 19, 2001
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continues to be slow in New England. 
            First District business contacts report sales or orders during the 
            summer months even with or below year-earlier levels. Some respondents 
            in manufacturing, temp help, and software say business appears to 
            be stabilizing at low levels, but others in those industries and retailing 
            continue to see deterioration. None of the contacted firms expect 
            conditions to improve until next year, a rather "bleak" consensus 
            outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Retail
      </b>
      <br/>
      Most retail contacts report that sales were either flat or declining 
            during the June through August period compared with a year earlier. 
            While department stores, firms in the tourism sector, and stores selling 
            furniture, building materials, computer and office technology products, 
            and consumer electronics report flat or declining demand, back-to-school 
            apparel sales were up from last year. An inverse barometer of the 
            economy, sales of surplus merchandise exhibited very strong growth.
      <p>
       Employment levels are reported to be either flat or 
            declining, with wage rates mostly rising at a 2 to 3 percent pace. 
            Retail contacts say that they are discounting prices in order to move 
            inventories; as a result, profit margins are being eroded. Retailers 
            expect more of the same - flat to negative growth - for the next 12 
            months. They expect no turnaround in the economy until third quarter 
            2002. One retailer describes the outlook as "grim."
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing and Related Services
        </b>
        <br/>
        First District manufacturing contacts report that recent business 
            is slow. Most say sales or orders in the current quarter are down 
            from a year earlier. Although some detect signs that business may 
            be beginning to stabilize, respondents say overwhelmingly that they 
            or their customers are still seeking to reduce inventories. Thus, 
            most manufacturers expect recovery to be gradual and to be deferred 
            until the first half of 2002; some in technology-dependent sectors 
            anticipate further delay.
        <p>
         Makers of consumer goods are anxious about the upcoming 
            holiday season. They say that consumers appear hesitant to make discretionary 
            purchases and that retailers are ordering very sparingly in order 
            to avoid the costs associated with excess stocks. A manufacturer of 
            consumer instruments is responding to these conditions by not adding 
            any temporary production help to gear up for its heaviest quarter 
            of the year. However, one firm supplying computer printer components 
            is encouraged by signs of fairly robust customer projections for the 
            holidays, following weak sales for the year to date.
         <p>
          Makers of capital goods continue to report weakness. 
            They cite a lack of purchases by the semiconductor, steel, domestic 
            automotive, and telecommunications industries in particular and a 
            general tightness in capital budgets because of economic uncertainty 
            and a desire to conserve cash. New orders relate mostly to sectors 
            that are relatively strong - such as biotech, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, 
            and oil and gas - and to customers developing improved products. However, 
            contacts in semiconductor-related industries cite a lack of successful 
            new technology products as a major obstacle to their recovery.
          <p>
           Respondents say their selling prices and materials 
            costs generally are flat or down. They cite downward pricing pressures 
            as a result of intensified use of Internet-based auctions, competition 
            from imports, and customer-initiated contract renegotiations. Energy 
            costs are said to be higher than a year ago but stabilizing or coming 
            down. Manufacturers continue to keep a tight lid on labor and capital 
            costs, although in some cases they feel they have already made appropriate 
            reductions. About three-quarters of contacts see employment holding 
            at current levels through the end of the year, while only one-quarter 
            anticipate layoffs or furloughs. About one-half of respondents have 
            intensified efforts to reduce capital expenditures since last contacted 
            for the Beige Book.
           <p>
            <b>
             Software and Information Technology Services
            </b>
            <br/>
            Most software and IT respondents report some improvement in demand 
            for their products in the current quarter. For some firms, demand 
            is leveling after a few quarters of softening; for others, demand 
            slowed less rapidly in the most recent quarter. Respondents' opinions 
            are mixed on whether sales have hit bottom or still have a few quarters 
            before they level off. A few contacts report that products targeted 
            for middle to small firms are performing much better than those for 
            large corporations. Respondents who report rising demand generally 
            say their results reflect specific client industries or product initiatives, 
            not the economy as a whole. Although some contacts are downbeat about 
            the near term, almost all feel that the long-term outlook is positive.
            <p>
             Software and IT respondents report level employment 
            and capital spending. Most do not expect to reduce employment further 
            in the near future. They are waiting for improvements in demand before 
            going ahead with expansion plans.
             <p>
              <b>
               Temporary Employment
              </b>
              <br/>
              Most contacts in the temporary employment industry continue to report 
            very slow business. Overall revenues in this or the previous quarter 
            are said to have dropped 30 to 40 percent from a year ago, with more 
            severe declines for permanent placements. Contacts indicate that demand 
            fell more steeply between February and May than since June. Most respondents 
            say demand has been flat since June, but some firms that provide temporary 
            office support and light industrial workers report a pickup.
              <p>
               In high tech sectors such as IT, manufacturing, engineering, 
            and telecom, large layoffs and hiring freezes continue; very few clients 
            are hiring tech workers. Office support and accounting are doing better 
            than high tech, but most contacts report negative growth in these 
            areas as well. Many contacts report increasing pressure from clients 
            to lower prices and mark-ups, and hourly rates for IT workers are 
            down. Finding workers is not a problem; contacts are flooded with 
            resumes. But some clients are demanding more specific skills and requirements, 
            making matches more difficult. Many contacts are cutting costs aggressively 
            and some have laid off up to 25 percent of their own staff, especially 
            recruiters.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Commercial Real Estate
                </b>
                <br/>
                Commercial real estate markets continue to slow. Contacts report that 
            the most desirable office locations, such as downtown Boston and Portland, 
            are still faring relatively well; vacancy rates are higher than a 
            year ago, but at reasonable levels. However, suburban Boston and Cambridge 
            vacancy rates have increased considerably, driven in part by the contraction 
            of both large and small high-tech firms. The acquisition market is 
            in a wait-and-see period, with many customers on the sidelines. Most 
            contacts expect commercial markets to remain slow until at least second 
            quarter 2002.
