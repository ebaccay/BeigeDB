      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that 
national economic activity continues to expand, but at the somewhat 
slower pace reported in the last beige book. Most district banks 
indicated little change from the last report; however, Cleveland and 
New York reported slower growth, and Chicago reported moderating 
growth in manufacturing. Many districts noted that retail sales 
appeared stronger in early November following widespread weakness in 
October. Districts reporting on initial holiday sales found mixed 
conditions. Dallas and New York said sales were lower than expected, 
while Atlanta, Chicago and Cleveland reported encouraging holiday 
results. Most reports of auto sales were weaker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing production continued to rise, with strong demand for 
high-tech products in the Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis and San 
Francisco districts. However, several district banks reported 
slowing in some manufacturing industries. Single-family construction 
activity was mixed, but commercial real estate and construction 
activity remained a bright spot in many districts. Loan demand 
increased in most Federal Reserve districts, with strong demand for 
commercial and industrial loans. Demand for most business services 
remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rising crop prices boosted farm income in Chicago, Kansas City and 
Minneapolis, yet higher feed costs and low cattle prices continued 
to squeeze margins for ranchers in some districts. Energy activity 
was mostly unchanged, despite a cold snap in the Midwest and 
Northeast that caused prices for natural gas, heating and crude oil 
to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Federal Reserve districts reported tight labor market 
conditions for both skilled and unskilled labor. Several districts, 
including Chicago, Dallas and Minneapolis, reported rising wage 
pressures for entry-level positions. There were a few reports of 
price increases in intermediate goads, but very few for final goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many districts reported weak retail sales in October, but most said 
sales appeared stronger in early November. Initial holiday sales 
were mixed. Of the districts that reported on day-after-Thanksgiving 
sales, Dallas and New York said contacts were somewhat disappointed 
that sales did not meet expectations, while Atlanta, Chicago and 
Cleveland said sales had met or exceeded retailers expectations. 
Sales of apparel and other soft goods continued to be weaker than 
sales of hard goods. Contacts in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, 
Minneapolis and Philadelphia said sales were strongest for 
computers, electronic equipment and related goods. Discounting and 
promotions were common across districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicle sales weakened over the past six weeks according to several 
district banks. The Kansas City and St. Louis districts said a 
shortage of popular models constrained sales. Auto dealers in 
Philadelphia said sales of new model cars have not met expectations, 
and dealers in Chicago noted sports/utility vehicle sales were 
outperforming auto sales. Dallas was the only district reporting 
improved sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most district banks said production rose during the past six weeks. 
Most notable was an increase in orders for high-tech products--such 
as computers, telecommunications equipment, semiconductors, 
electrical equipment and medical products--reported by the Boston, 
Dallas, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts. There were some 
reports of slower growth in a few industries, however. Several 
districts, including Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia aid St. Louis, 
noted weaker orders for apparel. Boston and Dallas also said demand 
for packaging products slowed. The Bosom and San Francisco districts 
reported softer orders for some construction-related products. 
Chicago said new orders had slowed in all industries except those 
related to auto manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In those districts reporting on the service sector, contacts 
suggested continued strength in demand for business services. Some 
districts indicated increased demand for temporary services, and 
contacts in Chicago, Dallas and Richmond said they were having 
difficulty filling temporary positions. After strong growth 
throughout the year, demand for accounting and legal services in the 
Dallas district eased somewhat, according to contacts. Tourism 
remained strong in the Atlanta district, despite hurricane-damaged 
beach properties in the Florida Panhandle and the recent closing of 
New Orleans' land based casino. San Francisco also reported strong 
tourism but said the warm weather may hurt ski areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real estate and construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Housing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family construction activity was mixed. New home sales and 
construction were strong in the Dallas and Minneapolis districts. 
Residential activity was mixed among states in the Boston, New York 
and San Francisco districts. The pace of home sales slowed in the 
Chicago district after strengthening in recent months. The Richmond 
and St. Louts districts reported declines in home construction since 
the last beige book report.
     </p>
     <p>
      A few districts reported increases in multifamily construction. In 
the Atlanta district, low vacancy rates and higher rents were 
boosting new apartment development. The Kansas City and St. Louis 
districts also reported a pickup in apartment construction over the 
past six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate markets strengthened across much of the 
country in October and November, and were a bright spot for several 
districts. High demand and low vacancies boosted nonresidential 
construction in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Louis 
districts. Strong demand for prime office space pushed up rents in 
the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond districts. New York was the only 
district bank that reported weaker commercial real estate 
conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Leasing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      activity fell in downtown Manhattan in October, and the midtown 
vacancy rate rose slightly as continued strong leasing activity 
failed to offset a sharp rise in available space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand continued to increase in most Federal Reserve districts 
in late October and early November. Lending was strongest in the 
Dallas, Kansas City and Philadelphia districts. Most district banks 
said commercial and industrial lending remained strong and some said 
mortgage refinancings had picked up. The exceptions were the 
Cleveland, New York and St. Louis districts which reported a slight 
moderation in loan demand growth. There were some reports of rising 
past due loans and consumer delinquencies in these districts, but 
bankers said current levels were not worrisome.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and natural resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although several districts reported below normal crop yields, strong 
export demand and higher crop prices suggest improvement in farm 
income. Corn and soybean yields remained below last years levels in 
Chicago and Kansas City, and dry weather in the Dallas and Kansas 
City districts impeded the growth of some crops such as winter 
wheat. The San Francisco district said sales of agricultural 
products were high and that exports were above last year's levels. 
Higher grain prices pushed up feed costs, squeezing margins for 
ranchers who continue to suffer from low beef cattle prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Dallas and Kansas City districts reported little change in 
energy markets, despite a weather-related rise in natural gas, 
heating oil and crude oil price in recent weeks. Natural gas spot 
prices rose from $1.70 per thousand cubic feet in mid-October to 
$2.10 per thousand cubic feet by late November. Wholesale heating 
oil prices rose by 5 cents per gallon as colder weather hit the 
Midwest and East Coast. The price increases were not enough to 
encourage new drilling activity, however. Mining and drilling 
contacts in die Minneapolis district were pleased with current 
levels of activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor markets and wage pressures
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Federal Reserve districts reported tight labor market 
conditions for both skilled and unskilled workers. San Francisco 
reported shortages of construction workers. Chicago, Dallas and 
Richmond cited difficulty filling temporary service positions. 
Boston, Cleveland and Dallas noted a shortage of workers in high-
tech jobs such as software development, systems analysis and 
electrical engineering. Richmond said there was a general scarcity 
of labor, particularly in skilled manufacturing positions. There 
were widespread reports across the districts of labor shortages for 
unskilled workers, and entry-level compensation was reportedly 
rising in the Chicago, Dallas and Minneapolis districts. Only the 
Atlanta district noted subsiding wage pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Price pressure
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There were a few reports of rising prices for intermediate goods 
from district banks, but overall price pressures were minimal. San 
Francisco reported higher prices for industrial equipment and 
machine tools, while Kansas City and Minneapolis said prices were 
rising for aluminum and packaging materials. However, paper 
producers and corrugated box manufacturers in Dallas said they were 
lowering selling prices, and Boston noted a recent decline in paper 
prices. Petrochemical and steel prices continued to come down 
according to some district reports. Retailers in several districts 
reported heavy discounting for the holiday season. Contacts in the 
temporary services industry said despite wage pressures they could 
not raise fees because of fierce competition.
