      Growth in the Tenth District 
                economy showed some signs of moderating in late July and August, 
                although business contacts remained generally optimistic about 
                future economic activity. Consumer spending was not quite as strong 
                as earlier in the year, the recovery in manufacturing appeared 
                to lose some momentum, and some commercial real estate markets 
                weakened further. On the positive side, residential construction 
                remained solid, and energy activity held on to previous gains. 
                In the farm economy, corn and soybean crops were in bad condition 
                due to the drought. As in previous surveys, wage and retail price 
                pressures were virtually nonexistent, while prices for some manufacturing 
                materials continued to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the district reported that sales were flat to slightly 
                  lower in late July and August compared with earlier in the summer. 
                  On a year-over-year basis, sales were largely unchanged in most 
                  places. Among merchandise categories, home furnishings and apparel 
                  were strongest, while sporting goods continued to show some 
                  weakness. Store managers generally reported that inventory levels 
                  were in line with expectations. Nearly all managers remained 
                  optimistic about sales in coming months and were preparing to 
                  increase stock levels for the fall season. Motor vehicle sales 
                  held steady in August after picking up following the reintroduction 
                  of financing incentives in July. However, most dealers reported 
                  that sales were slightly below year-ago levels. Looking ahead, 
                  dealers expect sales to increase modestly with the start of 
                  the new model year and will build inventories accordingly. Travel 
                  and tourism remained solid in most of the district but slowed 
                  in Colorado, where a slump in business travel has held down 
                  hotel occupancy rates in Denver and the recent rash of wildfires 
                  has reduced out-of-state tourist visits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The recovery in district manufacturing activity appeared to 
                    pause in late July and August, with factory activity showing 
                    fewer signs of improvement than in previous surveys. Production 
                    and shipments remained a little below year-ago levels following 
                    steady increases during most of the first half of the year. 
                    Most firms were operating at moderate levels of capacity, and 
                    plant managers said they expected factory activity to increase 
                    over the next six months. However, firms continued to show little 
                    enthusiasm for new hiring or capital spending, saying they were 
                    waiting for further signs of improvement in the overall economy 
                    before making any major new commitments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity remained solid in late July 
                      and August, but some commercial real estate markets declined 
                      further. Single-family construction in most places continued 
                      to be above year-ago levels, with starts stronger for entry-level 
                      houses than for higher-priced homes. Most builders expect home 
                      construction to continue on a steady pace for the remainder 
                      of the year and do not expect any significant difficulties in 
                      obtaining materials. Home sales remained solid in most of the 
                      district in late July and August, although the inventory of 
                      unsold homes was up in Denver. Sales were particularly strong 
                      for entry-level homes. Most realtors expect a slight slowdown 
                      in activity in coming months due to increased caution on the 
                      part of buyers. Mortgage lenders reported a sizable increase 
                      in demand for home loans, particularly for refinancings. Lenders 
                      reported that, compared with the previous survey, more refinancings 
                      were for the purpose of taking cash out than for reducing the 
                      amount or term of the loan. Mortgage demand is generally expected 
                      to remain solid in coming months. Commercial real estate activity 
                      in district cities either remained weak or contracted further. 
                      Realtors reported that sales and prices of office space declined 
                      again in Denver and Tulsa, while vacancy rates continued to 
                      edge up in several places. Some "build-to-suit" office projects 
                      continued to come online across the district, but speculative 
                      building was virtually nonexistent. Commercial realtors expect 
                      office conditions to remain weak for the foreseeable future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported that loans and deposits both held steady since 
                        the last survey, leaving loan-deposit ratios unchanged. Demand 
                        rose somewhat for home equity loans, edged down for commercial 
                        real estate loans, and was generally unchanged in other loan 
                        categories. On the deposit side, increases in liquid accounts 
                        such as demand deposits and money market deposit accounts were 
                        offset by decreases in large CD's and small time deposits. All 
                        respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged, and 
                        most banks also held their consumer lending rates steady. Banks 
                        did not report any changes in lending standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity in the district remained strong in late July 
                          and August. The count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in 
                          the region held steady after rising earlier in the summer. Oil 
                          prices rose and natural gas prices in most of the district were 
                          largely unchanged since the last survey. Natural gas prices 
                          in Wyoming, however, remained depressed and are expected to 
                          stay low until a new pipeline to California is completed next 
                          spring. Looking ahead, most district energy contacts expect 
                          slow, steady growth in energy demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The district's corn and soybean crops were in poor condition 
                            due to the drought. As a result, district bankers expect crop 
                            insurance payments to be a significant source of income for 
                            producers this year. Conditions for winter wheat planting were 
                            generally poor because of the lack of moisture, which could 
                            result in reduced acreage. Poor pasture conditions have forced 
                            many ranchers to buy hay and other feedstuffs sooner than normal 
                            and at rising prices. Across the district, corn was being harvested 
                            early for forage rather than grain. Some cattle producers were 
                            placing young cattle in feedlots earlier than normal and still 
                            others have been forced to sell part of their breeding herd. 
                            Rural bankers indicated small business activity was sluggish, 
                            especially in predominantly agricultural areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage and price pressures were virtually nonexistent across the 
                              district in late July and August. Labor markets remained soft, 
                              with most employers having no problems finding quality workers. 
                              As in previous surveys, labor shortages were reported for only 
                              a few select occupations. However, some contacts reported labor 
                              negotiations were slightly more difficult than in the recent 
                              past, and layoff announcements fell sharply in August after 
                              rising steadily in the spring and early summer. Wage pressures 
                              remained very subdued across the district, but many contacts 
                              expressed concern about the cost of rising health care premiums. 
                              Retail prices were largely unchanged from previous surveys and 
                              are expected to remain flat in coming months. Some stores, however, 
                              reported smaller markdowns than during past summer clearance 
                              seasons. Builders reported generally flat materials prices in 
                              late July and August. As expected, lumber prices leveled off 
                              after rising earlier in the summer, and builders do not expect 
                              any significant price increases in the fall. Some manufacturers 
                              reported further rises in materials prices, including steel 
                              products and petroleum-based chemicals. Many plant managers 
                              expect moderate materials price increases to continue through 
                              the fall.
