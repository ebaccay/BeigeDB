      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity has increased since the last report. Most 
contacts report stronger growth recently relative to the first two 
months of the year. Noticeable cost pressures are reported for 
several industries because of tight labor markets and substantial 
increases in fuel and feed grain prices. Residential and 
nonresidential construction have picked up after a slow January. 
Home sales have also improved in most parts of the District. Recent 
District loan growth is on par with that of last year, and many 
respondents report strong loan demand and aggressive competition for 
loans. A large percentage of the District's weather-damaged winter 
wheat crop will be plowed under and replanted with other crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District contacts are more upbeat than they have been 
in the past few months. Expansions and new plant openings are 
leading to increased employment, and, once again, reports of tight 
labor markets are prevalent. Some firms have cut back production, 
however, usually because of company consolidation or cost cutting.
     </p>
     <p>
      A snack food maker is expanding into northeast Arkansas where it 
will initially hire 200 to 400 workers by early next year. A large 
Missouri manufacturer of chemicals and related products reports a 
noticeable uptick in demand for materials used in the housing and 
auto sectors; an even larger increase is noted for agricultural-
related products. A bank card processing center is expanding to 
southwest Missouri, bringing 750 jobs by year's end. A new Tunica 
County, Miss., casino has already hired 600 workers and is looking 
for 3,000 more. A concern, though, is that there are not enough 
workers in the area to satisfy this demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other contacts also report tight labor markets. Restaurant and other 
food service establishments are having a difficult time finding 
staff. One restaurant delayed its opening for two months because it 
could not find enough help, and a Tennessee hotel had to hire labor 
from overseas. The temporary employment industry is also 
encountering staffing problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production has slowed at some firms, though, usually because of 
company consolidation or cost cutting. A national railroad is 
shutting a diesel shop in Missouri to cut costs; most of the 240 
workers will be offered transfers, however. A contact in the paper 
industry reports that production of coated paper has been halted 
because of excess inventory. Sales of bleached paper, used in milk 
and juice cartons, are strong, though.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts continue to report increasing costs for raw materials and 
labor. In contrast to previous reports, however, some contacts have 
indicated that these higher costs are being successfully passed 
along to consumers. Most of the cost increases are between 2 and 3 
percent. One contact notes that his firm is able to increase prices 
now because the government has restricted foreign competition and 
his firm's major domestic competitor has left the market. 
Substantial increases in wheat and feed grain prices have caused 
most large poultry producers in the District to curtail planned 
production by about 7 percent. Because stocks of poultry meat are 
already high, retail price increases are not expected in the near 
term. The recent uptick in oil prices has boosted fuel costs for the 
transportation industry and increased consumer gasoline prices. An 
industry analyst notes that, through negotiated contracts, some 
trucking firms have been able to pass along a portion of this 
additional cost. A large manufacturer of synthetic materials reports 
that there has been a modest rise in petrochemical prices over the 
last month or so; however, it has been unable to pass along this 
price increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After a slowdown in January because of bad weather, residential 
construction activity picked up in February and March. In some parts 
of western Kentucky, there is still a backlog of houses under 
construction, which is keeping contractors busy. Most contacts 
report that sales activity has also picked up; in some cases, 
existing homes are selling better than new homes. Mid-priced homes 
($125,000 to $165,000) are the strongest sellers in most markets. 
Average sale prices in most District areas have remained stable, 
though. Contacts in most parts of the District continue to report 
strong nonresidential construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total loans outstanding at 11 large District banks increased 2 
percent between mid-February and mid-April, just slightly less than 
the increase in the same period last year. Commercial and industrial 
loans declined 0.1 percent, and consumer loans declined 0.8 percent, 
while real estate loans rose 3.6 percent. District banking contacts 
still describe loan demand as moderately strong and competition as 
aggressive, with one noting that loan pricing is "predatory." 
Several contacts note a slight increase in nonperforming consumer 
loans, but indicate that current levels are not troublesome.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Harsh winter weather conditions caused substantial damage to much of 
the District's winter wheat crop, with the crops in Illinois, 
Indiana and Missouri generally in poor to very poor condition. 
Reports from Illinois suggest that as much as half of the state's 
crop will be plowed under and planted with corn, soybeans or milo, 
while a quarter or more of the Missouri crop will be replanted. An 
early spring freeze in Arkansas caused an estimated 50 to 75 percent 
loss of the peach crop. Corn planting is generally proceeding ahead 
of schedule. Heavy rainfall across Missouri, southern Illinois and 
southern Indiana in late April caused isolated flooding in low-lying 
areas and along minor rivers and streams. As a result, some farmers 
may be forced to replant portions of their corn crops.
