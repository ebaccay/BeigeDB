       Business contacts in the First 
                  District report improving conditions at the end of the third 
                  quarter and early in the fourth quarter. While results are mixed 
                  from month to month, retailers cite fairly consistent sales 
                  increases from a year earlier. Contacted manufacturers and software 
                  firms indicate that demand seems to be improving. While retailers 
                  and manufacturers mention only scattered employment increases, 
                  most staffing firms report growing demand for labor. Contacts 
                  express concern with increases in input prices and other business 
                  costs such as insurance, while selling prices are generally 
                  level.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District retailers cite mixed month-to-month changes in 
                  September and October, but most of the surveyed merchants report 
                  year-over-year gains, ranging from 5 to 9 percent. A contact 
                  from the office supply sector reports particularly strong sales 
                  of durable goods, such as computers and office furniture, and 
                  expects technology-based products to be big sellers in the upcoming 
                  months. A surplus merchandise respondent notes that a pickup 
                  in big-ticket sales, such as furniture, compensated for a decline 
                  in customer count in October. According to auto dealers, imported 
                  automobile sales are strong, while domestic sales are mixed. 
                  Many dealers expect manufacturers' incentives to spur domestic 
                  sales growth this winter season. Most retail respondents indicate 
                  that they are maintaining lean inventory levels. Several contacts 
                  report increases in headcount with the opening of new stores 
                  and some respondents plan to hire seasonal workers in the upcoming 
                  months. Wages are reportedly steady. Selling prices and vendor 
                  prices are mostly even, though one contact expresses concern 
                  about upward price pressure due to increasing costs in transporting 
                  products once new trucking regulations are implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consensus among contacted 
                  retailers is that sales will improve moderately in the next 
                  six months. Several store executives said they expect sales 
                  this Christmas season to surpass those of last year, while one 
                  respondent expects the upcoming season to be very "promotional."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and 
                  Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A majority of First District manufacturing contacts note signs 
                  of recovering demand in the third and fourth quarters. Semiconductor 
                  manufacturers indicate a solid upward trend in sales, boosted 
                  by customers' upbeat projections of demand for PCs, printers, 
                  and cell phones. Military purchases are reportedly rising at 
                  a double-digit rate. Some consumer goods makers are selling 
                  more than a year ago as a result of promotional efforts or restocking 
                  at retail. However, other firms report that business is choppy 
                  or remains in the doldrums. For example, a paper company is 
                  taking selected downtime, a manufacturer of commercial aircraft 
                  is keeping production low, and a beverage firm says November 
                  sales are coming in lower than a year earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers report that rising 
                  demand is leading-or will soon lead-to higher prices for certain 
                  inputs such as metals, silicone wafers, and hardwoods. Fuel 
                  surtaxes and plastics costs remain high, and insurance costs 
                  continue to increase. Equipment manufacturers say that their 
                  selling prices continue to decline. Paper companies and some 
                  consumer goods manufacturers are offering discounts in order 
                  to boost sales. Apart from these cases, other materials costs 
                  and selling prices are generally flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the contacted manufacturers 
                  expect to hold domestic employment fairly flat in coming months, 
                  although some are adding engineers and temporary factory help. 
                  Base pay increases for 2004 are projected to be 2.5 to 4 percent. 
                  Companies are about equally divided as to whether they will 
                  be increasing capital spending in the U.S. or keeping it steady. 
                  Several respondents are planning overseas expansions, particularly 
                  in Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In discussing the sales outlook 
                  for the holiday season and 2004, manufacturing contacts tend 
                  to be more upbeat than they were earlier in the year. Most firms 
                  predict rising revenues for 2004. However, they say they are 
                  guarding against increasing production too much in response 
                  to positive projections, and they continue to make concerted 
                  efforts to use their working capital and other resources as 
                  efficiently as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Temporary Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A majority of responding temporary employment agencies in New 
                  England report growing labor demand in Q4 2003. While reports 
                  on year-over-year revenue growth are mixed, a sizable majority 
                  of contacts say revenues are higher than three months ago. Some 
                  respondents report an increase in permanent placements. Gains 
                  in information technology, software, and other technical openings 
                  were greatest, with respondents also noting demand improvements 
                  in manufacturing, light industrial, administrative, construction, 
                  and financial employment. Labor demand grew most along Route 
                  128 in Massachusetts, in southern New Hampshire, and southern 
                  Maine, while Vermont remains weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some respondents believe labor 
                  supply is tightening. Bill rates and pay rates are stable. Non-payroll 
                  related costs are said to be under control, except for medical 
                  insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Respondents are more optimistic 
                  than three months ago, with most anticipating that growth in 
                  labor demand will be sustained through 2004. While contacts 
                  are pleased by rising labor demand, the performance of the stock 
                  market, and recent GDP and payroll employment reports, they 
                  express concern about shifts in IT employment abroad, rising 
                  healthcare costs, federal budget deficits, and terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial Real 
                  Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The Boston area office market is not showing any signs of recovery. 
                  Vacancy rates are very high and rental rates remain low. Because 
                  there has been almost no new construction, vacancy rates have 
                  not risen. Notwithstanding low rents, the market for office 
                  building sales is very strong. Downtown Boston office towers, 
                  in particular, command very high prices per square foot, with 
                  sale prices substantially above replacement cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of New England is stable. 
                  Contacts report little activity in commercial markets. Office 
                  vacancy rates have increased somewhat in the Portland area, 
                  and dropped slightly in Providence. Elsewhere, vacancy and rental 
                  rates remain steady. The retail sector is relatively strong 
                  throughout the region (in greater Boston, the only new development 
                  is in the suburban retail sector). Contacts do not anticipate 
                  that commercial markets will rebound for at least a year, and 
                  some believe that the Boston office market will not improve 
                  until 2007 or 2008, when most leases will be rewritten.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Software and Information 
                  Technology Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for software products has improved since August 2003. 
                  Companies selling software development tools and custom application 
                  software, as well as medical, human resources and telecom software 
                  firms report various degrees of improvement from the second 
                  to the third quarter, although software sales in the telecom 
                  sector remain below last year's levels. Companies with the steepest 
                  revenue growth continue to hire, with a few other firms citing 
                  flat employment. One respondent reports a 35 percent increase 
                  in his company's capital budget, while the majority of interviewed 
                  firms have kept their capital expenses flat. After heavy capital 
                  budget cuts, the telecom sector continues to restrain capital 
                  spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook of software and IT 
                  services firms has moved from cautious to optimistic, even for 
                  companies who previously said they were uncertain about the 
                  economy's future course. While revenue expectations for the 
                  first quarter of 2004 range from flat to double-digit increases, 
                  the prevailing opinion is that gradual improvements in the software 
                  sector will persist.
