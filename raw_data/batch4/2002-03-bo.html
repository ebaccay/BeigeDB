      Beige Book Report: Boston

       March 6, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions are improving in the First 
            District. Manufacturers and retailers report more positive results 
            in mid-February than they did at the beginning of the year, and software 
            contacts say business is picking up. The commercial real estate market 
            is said to be on the bottom, no longer moving down, and staffing firms 
            are seeing some improvement, but business is still very slow. Most 
            contacts expect activity levels to improve very modestly later this 
            year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Retail
      </b>
      <br/>
      Retailers report generally improving sales results in early 2002. 
              Sellers of furniture, lumber and home improvement products, shoes, 
              and surplus merchandise indicate that sales through mid-February 
              were above year-earlier levels, though mostly by small amounts. 
              Even a computer retailer with sales down 20 percent from a year 
              earlier says business in recent weeks has been "less bad than it 
              was."
      <p>
       Employment is reported to be stable at most retail 
              firms; head counts are generally level with year-earlier. One company 
              with "major, major" layoffs in the last year is not currently planning 
              further cuts. Wage trends are mixed, with one firm planning "the 
              usual" 3 percent pay hike this summer, another seeing costs jump 
              because of a rise in the minimum wage, and a third instituting a 
              wage freeze.
       <p>
        Retailers say vendor prices are fairly stable. 
              In most cases, their selling prices are also steady, although one 
              firm is raising prices on selected products. The computer retailer 
              reports that the pace of price declines increased in the last half 
              of last year but has attenuated in the last three months.
        <p>
         Contacted retailers are expecting the economy 
              and their businesses to improve in 2002. One respondent says he 
              foresees "something between dead flat and the beginning of a very 
              modest recovery." Most see the improvement concentrated in the second 
              half and none expects a strong upturn.
         <p>
          <b>
           Manufacturing and Related Services
          </b>
          <br/>
          Most First District manufacturing contacts report that revenues 
              in the fourth quarter of 2001 and early 2002 were fairly flat relative 
              to a year ago. By exception, demand for biopharmaceutical equipment 
              and supplies remains on a solid growth path. Manufacturers indicate 
              that discretionary spending by business customers remains depressed. 
              This weakness affects sales of a variety of products, from corporate 
              gift and promotional items to major office equipment. To the extent 
              that their business has improved of late, manufacturers describe 
              the changes as limited. For example, a firm in the semiconductor 
              industry attributes the pickup in orders since mid-January to a 
              replenishment of stocks by distributors--not (yet) to a rise in 
              final demand. A manufacturer of paper products reports that some 
              of its customers seem to be enjoying resumed sales growth, but others 
              are simply restocking.
          <p>
           Contacts report that selling prices and materials 
              costs are generally flat. In a variety of industries, respondents 
              indicate that they are not even considering higher price quotes 
              because they would not stick. Contacts continue to express concern 
              about steep increases in insurance rates.
           <p>
            Manufacturers remain intent on controlling costs. 
              They are avoiding higher input costs by pressuring their vendors 
              or shifting to lower-cost sources. Most contacts reduced employment 
              in 2001, and most anticipate that their headcounts will be steady 
              or drifting downward in the remainder of 2002. Pay raises will be 
              nonexistent at some firms and limited to 2 to 3 percent at others. 
              Most contacts reduced inventories last year and are contemplating 
              no buildup from current levels. In describing capital spending plans, 
              manufacturers expressed a "do with what we have" mentality, especially 
              with respect to technology investments. Many say they will focus 
              on maintaining their existing capital and investing to develop new 
              products.
            <p>
             Revenue expectations for 2002 generally are muted. 
              Although the consensus continues to be that business will improve, 
              manufacturers remain doubtful that they will see any substantial 
              pickup until sometime in the second half of the year.
             <p>
              <b>
               Temporary Employment
              </b>
              <br/>
              Respondents in the staffing industry report mixed results in the 
              first quarter of 2002 (to date), but most are performing better 
              now than in the fourth quarter of 2001. Some contacts say that the 
              current market is the worst they have seen; others are more upbeat 
              because orders are starting to come in. Almost all report lower 
              revenues than a year ago. Even with some signs of a pickup for temporary 
              work, permanent placement is still lackluster. Responding firms 
              in northern New England are doing better than those located in Massachusetts 
              and Connecticut. On the supply side, temp firms continue to be inundated 
              with job seekers. Most contacts predict a modest turnaround later 
              this year.
              <p>
               <b>
                Commercial Real Estate
               </b>
               <br/>
               Commercial real estate markets in New England have maintained their 
              slow pace over the past quarter. Vacancy rates remain high and rents 
              have declined somewhat, although contacts report that "the worst 
              is behind us," and the pace of deterioration has slowed markedly. 
              The Greater Boston market is still in "bad shape," but vacancy rates 
              have stopped increasing and contacts predict that "we have reached 
              the bottom." The level of activity is much slower than a year ago, 
              but has not changed much over the past quarter. Other parts of New 
              England have been stable, with no noticeable changes in vacancy 
              or rental rates. Contacts in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maine 
              report increased activity levels relative to the last quarter of 
              2001. Most contacts do not anticipate any significant improvement 
              before the end of 2002.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Software and Information Technology Services
                </b>
                <br/>
                A majority of technology respondents are beginning to see signs 
              of improving demand for software products and services. Respondents 
              who provide infrastructure software report particularly strong fourth 
              quarters, while those who provide products more closely related 
              to consumer services are not faring as well. Large customers are 
              said to have activated plans and finalized agreements that they 
              had put on hold for almost a year, while small companies are still 
              holding back on some technology investments. Contacts servicing 
              the healthcare and insurance industries have particularly strong 
              sales. The improving technology environment has made most of the 
              respondents more optimistic than in the recent past, but they are 
              still very cautious regarding the future. One of the best performing 
              respondents still believes that the technology industry is "scary 
              as hell." Most contacts plan to keep employment level until their 
              prospects are more certain; only one company expects to increase 
              its workforce significantly. A couple of respondents report plans 
              to upgrade their job mix while keeping their headcounts constant 
              by increasing the number of research and development workers while 
              reducing customer service positions and installers. Capital and 
              technology spending also appears to be level for most respondents.
