      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 17, 1999
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy is still operating at a high level and growing 
moderately. Weakness in the agricultural sector is the only notable 
exception. The District's position as a distribution center 
continues to solidify, as UPS and FedEx attract more businesses to 
their hubs. District auto production is expected to increase because 
of a new line at a Ford plant. According to Manpower's second-quarter employment outlook survey, firms in the District's four 
major cities have upped their hiring expectations significantly from 
the previous survey. Most District metropolitan areas ended 1998 
with more residential building permits issued than a year earlier; 
in several instances, it was a record year. Nonresidential real 
estate markets have been mixed. Total loans at large District banks 
have been down since the beginning of the year, with consumer loans 
seeing the biggest decline. Most major crop and livestock prices 
trended modestly lower since our last report.
      <p>
       <b>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </b>
       <br/>
       Most District contacts continue to see growth in sales and 
employment. Although reports of tight labor markets have tapered off 
somewhat, other market indicators suggest that, rather than there 
being a real change in market conditions, contacts have just stopped 
mentioning it. Energy producers and agricultural areas of the 
District, especially the southern states, have been hit extremely 
hard by falling prices.
       <p>
        The District continues to attract new businesses that see it as a 
distribution hub, especially in the Louisville and Memphis regions. 
The presence of UPS and FedEx and their geographic locations are 
most often cited as reasons for firms picking these areas. Several 
firms have announced that they have chosen the St. Louis region for 
their new service-response (calling) centers. The District furniture 
industry is seeing more mixed results recently. Larger, more 
efficient plants report continued strong sales, while smaller, less 
efficient plants are struggling due to cost disadvantages. District 
auto production will grow as Ford adds a line to produce its new 
sport-utility vehicle to the Louisville truck plant. Employment in 
St. Louis will receive a boost as Boeing consolidates its missile 
production there.
        <p>
         Several other reorganizations and consolidations, however, mean job 
losses. Declining domestic demand for cigarettes has led Philip 
Morris to announce it will close its Louisville plant. The ever-
dwindling District apparel sector is seeing additional fallout: Levi 
Strauss is closing a plant because of slack demand for jeans, and a 
shirt manufacturer is shuttering its plant because of overseas 
competition. Some contacts mentioned a falloff in their exports 
because of the devaluation of the Brazilian real.
         <p>
          <b>
           Employment Outlook
          </b>
          <br/>
          Current labor market conditions, while solid, are expected to 
improve further, according to Manpower's February employment outlook 
survey. Labor demand in the District's four major cities is expected 
to be even greater during the March-June 1999 period than was 
anticipated in the previous survey taken in November 1998. In 
particular, the current survey shows that, on net (percentage 
reporting increase less percentage reporting decrease), 24 percent 
of the surveyed firms in the District's major cities plan to 
increase employment. This is a sizable uptick from the 8 percent net 
reported in the November 1998 survey, but identical to the 
percentage noted in the February 1998 survey. Employment gains in 
the second quarter are expected to be strongest in Little Rock, 
Louisville and Memphis, with somewhat less strength 
evident in the St. Louis market.
          <p>
           <b>
            Real Estate and Construction
           </b>
           <br/>
           By the end of 1998, ten of the District's 12 metropolitan areas had 
issued more residential construction permits than they had in 1997. 
In all, four metro areas had record years for total residential 
construction in 1998, and six metro areas had built more single-family homes than ever before. This pace seems to have continued into 1999. District real estate agents report continued strong sales (adjusted for the season) and moderate price gains. Nonresidential markets are more mixed. Several agents have noted a softening in the 
office market and mildly increasing vacancy rates in central business districts. Commercial and industrial markets, however, remain relatively strong in most parts of the District.
           <p>
            <b>
             Banking and Finance
            </b>
            <br/>
            Total loans on the books of a sample of large District banks have 
declined 2.5 percent since the start of the year. All loan 
categories have dropped from their 1998 year-end levels, with 
consumer loans posting the sharpest decline at 2.4 percent, followed 
closely by real estate loans with a 2.1 percent decline. Commercial 
and industrial loans, however, are essentially unchanged, declining 
just 0.1 percent. One year ago, total loans at these banks increased 
2.4 percent during the same period.
            <p>
             <b>
              Agriculture and Natural Resources
             </b>
             <br/>
             Crop and livestock prices generally trended downward during the past 
month and a half, paced by a more than 14 percent decline in soybean 
prices. At the other end of the spectrum, cotton prices rallied a 
bit after falling to a five-year low in February, and feeder cattle 
prices continue to rally from their lows posted last September. Two 
major surveys of U.S. cotton farmers' 1999 planting intentions show 
a modest increase in acreage from a year earlier. In the mid-South 
region, however, a major trade organization expects cotton acreage 
to dip modestly this year. Indeed, reports from contacts in the 
southern part of the District suggest that some farmers plan to 
devote more acres to soybeans this year, a flexibility offered by 
the recent Freedom to Farm legislation.
