      <p>
       The pace of business activity in the Third District was virtually steady in 

  February, as some sectors improved slightly and others slowed. Manufacturers 

  reported a small increase in new orders for the month compared with January, 

  but shipments were flat and order backlogs declined. Retail sales of general 

  merchandise and auto sales eased in February from January and from February 

  of last year. Bank lending has been rising slowly, with most of the growth coming 

  from consumer loans, although some banks reported recent increases in business 

  lending. Commercial real estate market conditions have shown little change. 

  Vacancy rates have been nearly steady, but effective rents have edged down. 

  Residential real estate sales have been steady at a fairly brisk pace, and builders' 

  backlogs remain high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking ahead, contacts in the Third District business community expect some 

  improvement, although they do not foresee a strengthening in growth. Manufacturers 

  forecast some increases in shipments and orders during the next six months, 

  but their level of optimism has waned somewhat since the start of the year. 

  Retailers anticipate a slow improvement in sales, but they are being very conservative 

  in their sales plans for the spring. Auto dealers expect a pickup in sales as 

  winter comes to an end, but they do not expect to match last year's sales rate. 

  Bankers expect slight gains in lending, but they have become increasingly concerned 

  that loan growth could stall if the pace of business activity in the region 

  does not improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District manufacturers reported steady shipments and slight gains in new 

  orders, on balance, in February. However, despite the rise in new orders, order 

  backlogs declined at area plants. Manufacturers continued to report declining 

  inventories, and some firms characterized them as historically low. Also, some 

  manufacturing companies indicated that their customers were maintaining very 

  low inventories and placing orders only on an as-needed basis. By major industry 

  sector, conditions appeared to be relatively better for makers of apparel and 

  furniture and for some producers of industrial equipment and materials. Conditions 

  were relatively slower among makers of paper products and fabricated metal products.
      </p>
      <p>
       On balance, the region's manufacturers forecast improvement during the next 

  six months, although they have not been quite as optimistic recently as they 

  were at the start of the year. About half of the firms surveyed in February 

  expect increases in shipments and orders by midyear, but one-fifth anticipate 

  decreases. Area manufacturers' capital spending plans call for increases, on 

  balance, with about one in four scheduling increased outlays and one in ten 

  planning cuts. Most of the firms that are limiting or reducing capital spending 

  for 2003 indicated that they are doing so because demand for their products 

  remains weak, but a significant number mentioned geopolitical uncertainties 

  as a negative influence on their capital spending decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District retailers generally reported that sales in February were somewhat 

  off compared with a year ago, and most of the stores contacted for this report 

  indicated that sales slowed in February compared with January. Store traffic 

  has also declined. Store executives said cold weather and winter storms have 

  hampered shopping, but they also said that fundamental consumer demand has eased. 

  Retailers said sales of home furnishings and electronics have been holding up, 

  but sales of many other types of merchandise, particularly apparel and jewelry, 

  have weakened. Some merchants also noted that there has been a sharp decline 

  in purchases by younger consumers. Discounting continued to be extensive, with 

  many special sales and coupon promotions being offered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the retailers contacted for this report expect sales to move up sluggishly 

  as the year proceeds. They are being very cautious in inventory planning, and 

  many store executives said they will be trimming promotional spending, particularly 

  for advertising. It appears that retail companies operating in the region will 

  also reduce capital spending this year, but most of the store executives surveyed 

  said the cuts will not be as large as they were last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto sales in the District slipped in February from the January pace, with 

  declines for nearly all makes. Dealers reported that sales fell as some manufacturers 

  scaled back incentives and dropped further when snowstorms disrupted travel 

  in the region. Dealers said the outlook is uncertain. They expect sales to rise 

  by the spring, although they anticipate results for this year as a whole will 

  be below last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks was rising slowly in late January 

  and early February. Much of the growth was in consumer lending, including credit 

  cards and other installment loans. Residential real estate lending continued 

  to move up as well. Some banks noted recent increases in commercial and industrial 

  lending, primarily to small and medium-sized businesses. The gains in business 

  lending were slight, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers generally said there has been some slippage in credit quality recently 

  among both business and consumer borrowers. Most of the banks contacted for 

  this report said loan delinquencies have increased, but some noted that the 

  increase in their charge-offs has been proportionately lower than the increase 

  in their loan portfolio's delinquency rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking ahead, bankers in the Third District expect slow growth in total lending, 

  at best. Some expressed concern that, unless the economic recovery picks up 

  speed, growth in business and consumer lending will stall. Furthermore, several 

  bankers said marginal borrowers are beginning to have difficulty servicing their 

  current debt, and they anticipate more firms and households will experience 

  financial pressure if business activity and employment do not improve soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There has been little change in conditions in Third District commercial real 

  estate markets in recent months. Surveys by area real estate firms indicated 

  that overall vacancy rates have been nearly steady, with slight increases in 

  some locations and slight decreases in others. The office vacancy rate in the 

  Philadelphia central business district was recently estimated at around 13 percent. 

  The vacancy rate in suburban areas varied. In markets where new buildings have 

  been completed the rate was around 20 percent, but in other markets it was lower. 

  Quoted rents remained fairly stable, but effective rental rates have fallen 

  as landlords have raised tenant improvement allowances and offered rent-free 

  periods. Leasing activity has picked up as many tenants have negotiated new 

  or renewed leases to take advantage of landlord concessions. Although a number 

  of new buildings have been proposed, contacts say construction activity has 

  been easing and is likely to fall further until firms in the region add substantial 

  numbers of new employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential real estate agents and homebuilders generally reported steady rates 

  of sales in January and February at a fairly strong pace. Price appreciation 

  continued to be strong in many parts of the region, although instances of multiple 

  offers have diminished. Real estate agents expect sales of new and existing 

  homes for the year as a whole to be a few percentage points below last year's 

  level. Builders reported little or no decreases in backlogs, which have been 

  kept up by strong sales while construction has been delayed by adverse weather. 

  Residential construction contractors generally indicated that land prices continue 

  to rise, but materials and labor costs have been mainly steady.
