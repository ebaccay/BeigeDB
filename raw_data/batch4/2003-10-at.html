       Reports from Sixth District contacts suggested 
                that business activity continued to expand during September. District 
                residential housing markets continued to post steady growth, whereas 
                commercial real estate markets displayed small improvements. Factory 
                activity showed further signs of stabilizing and transportation 
                contacts reported increased freight volumes in September. The 
                pace of retail and auto sales moderated somewhat, although several 
                reports noted that sales for the month exceeded expectations. 
                Commentaries on the District's tourism and hospitality sector 
                were mixed: reports from South Florida were mostly upbeat, but 
                others were more subdued. Responses from the banking industry 
                noted steady deposit flows and a further drop-off in mortgage 
                refinancing. Overall, employers appeared to be reluctant to add 
                to payrolls, and wage increases were modest in most sectors. Environmental 
                conditions were favorable for the District farmers' in September.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail contacts indicated that sales growth moderated somewhat 
                in September from the strong pace set in August, but activity 
                still managed to exceed retailer's expectations in many cases. 
                Contacts noted that apparel sales improved in September and electronics 
                and home-related products continued to sell well. Overall, inventories 
                were described as balanced. Reports noted that the retail outlook 
                for the fourth quarter remained positive, and some regional consumer 
                confidence measures showed a modest improvement in September from 
                August. Meanwhile, District auto dealers reported weaker sales 
                in the first part of September than in August.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District single-family housing markets were generally stable in 
                September. Homebuilders continued to report that new home construction 
                and sales were flat to up slightly during September. Reports from 
                District real estate agents mirrored those of builders. Most contacts 
                appeared more optimistic regarding single-family housing through 
                year-end than they had in the last report. Higher mortgage interest 
                rates have apparently not curtailed activity as much as had been 
                initially expected. The region's commercial real estate markets 
                continued to show only small, isolated improvements, and contacts 
                reported that vacant space continued to fill slowly. Commercial 
                construction remained at low levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing production in various industries picked up or was 
                stable in September, although there were some reports of layoffs. 
                Many firms were still reportedly planning to limit the extent 
                of new capital spending and hiring in the near term. However, 
                factory contacts in Tennessee saw a pickup in orders for machine 
                tools and equipment as their customers' sort to improve productivity. 
                Florida contacts noted stabilization in manufacturing activity, 
                but saw little evidence of a rebound. An Alabama steel producer 
                indicated that business was improving, but capacity utilization 
                rates remained low. A manufacturer in Georgia reported that the 
                weaker dollar was helping exports, but a textile producer noted 
                smaller sized orders. Further layoffs were announced in the District's 
                chemical industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism and Business Travel
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from the District's hospitality and tourism sector were 
                mixed. Although early fall is traditionally a slow period for 
                tourism in south Florida, visitor traffic was better than expected 
                and restaurant business was reported to be quite brisk. In contrast, 
                the international market remained weak and the sluggish demand 
                for lodging in central Florida reportedly forced the closing of 
                at least two hotels there. As before, hotels throughout the District 
                catering to business travelers reported low-occupancy levels. 
                Convention attendance in Atlanta, Nashville, New Orleans, and 
                Miami continued to suffer from restrained business spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most reports indicated a steady flow of deposits into banks and 
                that the rate of loan delinquencies remained manageable. Reports 
                also noted a drop in demand for mortgage refinancing because of 
                higher interest rates. Some loan officers reported that they were 
                receiving more business loan requests for projects aimed at reducing 
                costs or increasing productivity. However, overall business loan 
                and venture capital investment activity remained low.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Transportation
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reduced capacity combined with higher than normal seasonal demand 
                for shipping services led to improved conditions for the District's 
                transportation sector. Trucking firms reported increased freight 
                volumes and stable rates in September. In Georgia, an increase 
                in shipments of pulp and paper for the packaging industry was 
                noted.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported that labor markets were stable overall in September, 
                although the demand for additional permanent staff was rising 
                in only a few sectors and was notably absent in manufacturing. 
                Some factory contacts, however, reported that they had increased 
                the amount of overtime as production turned up. Part-time and 
                temporary workers also continued to be in demand. Some businesses 
                noted that they were reluctant to hire permanent employees because 
                of the associated benefit costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices for most goods and services remained 
                stable in September. However, the rising cost of healthcare and 
                pension benefits were holding down salary and wage increases according 
                to some contacts. Local lumber prices were reportedly the highest 
                in several years because of wet weather, fires in the West, and 
                recent high demand for plywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Rains and cooler weather produced favorable conditions for most 
                of the District's agriculture sector in September. Some commodity 
                prices moved higher in September. Local poultry growers were encouraged 
                by the new U.S.-Russia market access agreement that should lead 
                to additional poultry exports to Russia.
