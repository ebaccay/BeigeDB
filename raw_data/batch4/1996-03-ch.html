      <strong>
       March 13, 1996
      </strong>

       <strong>
        Summary
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Economic activity in the Seventh District remained at 
  relatively high levels in January and February, although growth 
  remained slow and was uneven across sectors and sub-regions. Despite 
  adverse weather in February, retail sales improved somewhat from a 
  soft January. Housing and construction activity remained relatively 
  strong in the District, buoyed by a pickup in first and second-time 
  home buyers. Manufacturing and banking activity, however, has become 
  increasingly mixed since the beginning of the year. Job creation in 
  the District continued to outperform the nation as a whole in early 
  1996 and labor markets remained very tight, while increases in wages 
  and prices remained subdued.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail sales
         <br/>
        </strong>
        Retail sales were generally described as soft in 
  February, but better than January. Several large retail chains 
  reported that February sales for their Midwest stores were slightly 
  above the company-wide average, with one retailer showing the region 
  as its second strongest market. Sales of durable goods and 
  electronics are still leading other market segments, although one 
  large retailer cited a shift toward soft goods, particularly in 
  women's apparel. A general manager at a Chicago area shopping mall 
  stated that their retailers were still experiencing double-digit 
  growth in sales, but felt that their stores' sales were better than 
  the regional average. Weather conditions in February slowed sales in 
  the region and, in some cases, led to some stores being temporarily 
  closed. A survey of small independent retailers in Michigan showed 
  that retail sales continued to be slow in January, but retailers' 
  optimism for the spring season remains high. A recent report also 
  showed that supermarket sales in both the Chicago and Detroit areas 
  were growing faster than for the nation as a whole over the last two 
  quarters. A consumer finance company reported an increase in 
  consumer bankruptcies, but consumers in the District appear to be in 
  better financial shape than those in other regions of the country. 
  Several auto dealerships reported that sales had been improving over 
  the last several weeks, but a dealer noted that used car sales had 
  softened.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Housing/Construction
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Housing and construction activity remained 
  relatively strong during January and February despite severe winter 
  weather. Realtors and bankers across the District reported that 
  sales of existing homes in January were up considerably in year-
  over-year comparisons and that this trend had carried over into 
  February. Homebuilders also reported that sales of new dwellings 
  were up markedly from January last year, and a national survey 
  showed both increased traffic and sales in the Midwest region for 
  February. Several contacts attribute the continued high demand for 
  housing to strength in the labor markets and low mortgage interest 
  rates. Sales have been strong in lower and medium-priced homes, led 
  by first and second-time buyers; sales at the upper end have been 
  slow for several months. Several contacts reported that industrial 
  real estate demand was quite strong in early 1996 and prospects for 
  construction opportunities were increasing. Capacity utilization at 
  factories that supply materials to the construction industry 
  remained at historically high levels in January and February, but 
  growth appears to be flat. One cement producer in the District 
  reported that the industry continues to add capacity in expectation 
  of increased public construction and steady demand from residential 
  construction. Despite continued high demand, sources reported that 
  prices remain in check at both the producer and consumer levels.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing Activity
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Manufacturing activity in the District was 
  mixed in February. Purchasing managers' surveys from around the 
  District varied, with the Chicago area showing contractions among 
  the its key components (including prices) and Milwaukee continuing 
  to show fairly solid expansion. A diversified producer of equipment 
  and basic materials reported that machinery orders and backlogs in 
  January generally were up from a year ago, but food machinery orders 
  have been weak and signs of weakness are emerging in chemical 
  markets. Several auto suppliers reported that sales were down in 
  January and February, but one supplier attributed part of the 
  weakness to its strong sales in December and noted that it was 
  expanding capacity to support expected orders over the rest of the 
  year. After a sharp decline in December, an appliance industry 
  analyst noted that sales in January were flat year-over-year, with 
  small appliances accounting for much of the recent slowing. A heavy 
  construction equipment producer indicated that sales through 
  February were about in line with an expected slowdown that has been 
  underway since mid-1995. Several steel producers, however, reported 
  orders for both sheet and structural steels to be quite strong, with 
  one mill receiving orders at a rate 10% above its capacity through 
  the second quarter.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Banking
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Banks generally reported that the level of lending was 
  quite strong, but the patterns of growth varied by location and 
  market segment. A large bank in the Chicago area reported that loan 
  demand was still increasing across most market segments. Several 
  Michigan banks described lending activity as strong, but C&amp;I; lending 
  (especially to auto suppliers) was off from peak levels last year. 
  Also, global and large corporate markets were strong, while middle 
  markets have slowed since January. However, a western Illinois bank 
  reported strong growth in total loan demand, with its commercial and 
  consumer loan volume up significantly. Most banks indicated that 
  mortgage lending was increasing, although as much as one-half or 
  more of the activity was in refinancing. Several banks cited lending 
  to retailers as their only weak market, with several small retailers 
  in the process of going out of business.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Labor markets
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Labor markets remained tight through January and 
  February, although job growth appears to be less robust than the 
  same period last year. Labor market analysts in most of the 
  District's metropolitan areas detect little change in employment 
  numbers from late 1995 outside of normal seasonal variations, 
  although a downturn was evident in average weekly hours worked in 
  those areas dependent on durable manufacturing industries. Help-
  wanted advertising ticked up in January, although it remained below 
  last year's high levels. A national survey of hiring plans suggested 
  that employers in the Midwest region were the most optimistic in the 
  nation for job growth heading into the second quarter of 1996, with 
  gains anticipated in the nondurable manufacturing, wholesale and 
  retail trade, and service industries. Durable manufacturers were 
  less optimistic about job growth in this survey. Temporary help 
  agencies reported that labor shortages continued to be their major 
  concern. Most sources reported that upward wage pressure was modest.
