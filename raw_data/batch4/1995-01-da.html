      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 18, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy continued to grow at a solid pace in 
late November and December. Increasing strength was reported in the 
service sector, and manufacturing orders continued to rise at a 
steady rate. Strong commercial construction activity offset a 
further decline in the single-family sector. Retail sales growth 
slowed after the Thanksgiving holiday and Christmas sales were lower 
than expected. Growth in loan demand continued at a strong pace, but 
competition between banks for customers squeezed margins. District 
energy activity remained unchanged but was slightly below last 
year's levels. Year-end agricultural production was up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in several manufacturing industries, including 
petrochemicals, paper and steel, reported price increases resulting 
from strong demand. Apparel and food contacts said that higher 
costs-especially for packaging-were raising price pressures in their 
industries. Service sector respondents reported continued wage and 
price pressures resulting from labor shortages and strong demand. 
Retailers said competition kept prices at or below last year's 
levels. Oil prices held steady, but warm winter weather depressed 
natural gas prices. Sharp declines in livestock prices led to a 
decline in a regional index of agricultural prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers reported continued growth in orders with 
strong growth in the demand for paper products, electronics, apparel 
and chemicals. Orders increased modestly for construction-related 
products. Domestic and foreign sales of packaging materials, boxes 
and paper products continued to rise. Prices were up for all types 
of paper products and contacts expected further price increases in 
1995. Despite additional capacity, electronics orders outpaced 
supply leading to lower inventories. Electronics prices were 
reported as no longer falling, resulting in higher profits for 
manufacturers, A December surge in orders for jeans led to hiring in 
apparel manufacturing. Demand for construction-related products 
edged up. Lumber producers reported lower sales of residential 
lumber but increased orders from commercial builders. Demand for 
concrete and cement increased with improving weather. Glass sales 
were at a record high due to rising commercial construction and 
robust auto production. Orders for primary and fabricated metals 
accelerated, and producers reported that demand for steel had picked 
up recently in anticipation of near-term price increases. Food 
manufacturers reported steady demand and had increased hiring 
because of strong growth earlier in the year. Petrochemical orders 
remained extremely strong, and despite added capacity, inventories 
were low and prices continued to rise. Improved business overseas 
kept demand for oil and gas machinery steady at high levels, but 
respondents expressed concern over low domestic natural gas prices. 
Unseasonably warm weather lowered fuel oil costs, reducing refining 
margins to record lows. Several refiners said they plan to shut in 
capacity until margins improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business services grew at a slightly faster pace. Legal 
firms reported a pickup in demand associated with real estate 
transactions, mergers and acquisitions, and initial public 
offerings. Growing labor market tightness for experienced 
accountants increased upper level salaries in the accounting 
industry. Demand accelerated for temporary placement services. Both 
trucking and temporary service firms continued to report increasing 
wage pressures associated with strong demand and a shortage of 
qualified workers. Demand for business communications and 
advertising services slowed slightly from their previous fast pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seasonally adjusted, retail sales growth slowed slightly after 
Thanksgiving and many retailers said Christmas sales did not meet 
expectations. Holiday sales were reported to be strongest for 
electronics, jewelry, toys and other hard goods. Sales of 
fragrances, cosmetics and most fashion apparel were less than 
expected. Heavy discounting and competition kept selling prices 
unchanged or below a year ago. Scores along the Mexican border said 
that sales dropped following the peso devaluation and are not 
expected to pick up for at least 3 to 4 months. Contacts in the auto 
industry reported that sales growth had slowed somewhat in December 
after an extremely strong November. Popular car models were said to 
be in short supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the construction and real estate industry reported that 
higher mortgage rates continued to cause a decline in single-family 
construction. Commercial construction-especially for retail space-
remained strong, but contacts voiced uncertainty about the year 
ahead. Demand for suburban office and retail space remained at high 
levels, and the apartment market was reported to be tight despite a 
number of recently completed projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers reported that loan demand continued to increase at a strong 
pace, but said higher interest rates and competition had squeezed 
margins. Consumer lending remained very competitive, and strong 
demand for commercial loans had offset the decline in residential 
mortgage lending activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      District energy producers reported that activity was unchanged. 
Strong global demand kept oil prices between 17 and 18 dollars per 
barrel, but warm winter weather pushed natural gas prices below last 
year's level. The district rig count was slightly below that of a 
year ago, but drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico was still at 
good levels, according to contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most district agricultural producers reported higher production than 
expected. Livestock conditions were reported to be well above 
average across the district. Although prices for cotton, wheat, 
sweet corn and lettuce were higher, lower livestock, corn and 
soybean prices pushed the Texas All Farm Products Index down 6.2 
percent from a year ago.
