      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      As winter sets in, the Ninth District

continues to enjoy moderate economic

growth with few problem areas. 

Unemployment remains low, and

indications of very tight labor markets are

widespread.  In spite of reports of  labor

market tightness and of some wage

increases, there are few reports of price

increases for raw materials, consumer

goods or services. Construction is brisk in

many areas.  Iron mining and oil drilling are

very strong and paper production displays

some signs of recovery from the slump

experienced over the last year.  Retail sales

of general merchandise apparently are

picking up, and increased strength in vehicle

sales continues. The 1996 crop was

excellent in most respects, the profitability

of livestock production has recovered

somewhat, and farmers reportedly are

increasing their spending on household and

capital items.  Manufacturing shows

moderate growth.  Tourism is the weakest

sector,  continuing a pattern set earlier in

1996.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages, and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       "Stores shop for workers," headlined a South

Dakota news article describing the extra

efforts retailers are making to secure

needed seasonal workers in an extremely

tight labor market.  Labor scarcity continues

as the most-cited problem confronting

businesses in the district.  Reports of

increases in pay or benefits to attract

entry-level workers or skilled technical

specialists remain frequent, but many

employers say there is no generalized

upward pressure on compensation.                                    

Notwithstanding reports of compensation

increases for entry-level and certain

specialist employees, there are few reports

of increases in the prices for goods and

services.  Petroleum products are one

exception.  Increased fuel prices are cited as

a major cost increase for trucking firms and

a Minnesota-based airline.  One Minnesota

chemical product manufacturer cites

increases in the cost of all chemicals derived

from petroleum or natural gas or whose

production is energy intensive.  At the

consumer level, milk prices increased

sharply from late September into November,

but farm level milk prices were falling

sharply in late November, and retail prices

are expected to follow shortly.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction and Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        "There are quite a few new motels going up

in Sioux Falls."  "The 'nuclear winter' is over

in downtown St. Paul commercial real

estate market."  "Construction in western

Wisconsin has been at record levels for six

months."  "Twin Cities building permits up

15 percent from a year ago."  Reports such as

this are widespread, revealing a

construction and real estate sector that still 

has stamina after four years of expansion. 

The strength is broad-based across

residential, commercial, light industrial and

public infrastructure projects.  Regionally,

there are some reports of a slowing pace of

residential construction in western

Montana and eastern North Dakota, areas

that had been strong for three years.

Realtors in Minneapolis-St. Paul report good

business for both residential and

commercial property.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Natural Resource Industries
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Iron ore mining and oil drilling continue at

the brisk pace that has prevailed for several

months, and industry spokespersons expect

that pace to continue into 1997.  An advisory

council member from Michigan's Upper

Peninsula describes increased production at

a paper mill in his area.  Other paper

industry contacts also describe some

expansion of output, but production has not

returned to the high levels experienced two

years ago.  Building board producers in the

eastern portion of the district continue

producing near capacity.
         <p>
          One exception to this pattern of strong

activity in natural resources industries is

traditional sawmills in western South

Dakota and Montana, where output

reportedly is stagnant or declining, largely

due to reduced federal timber sales. 

Environmental concerns have blocked the

partial reopening of a Michigan copper mine

closed last year.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Manufacturing
           </strong>
           <br/>
           "Sales are really pretty good, a bit slow in the

summer, but getting better steadily in the

fall," says one Minnesota electronics

manufacturer.  "We are seeing a lot of small

factories coming in, mostly metal

fabrication," says a utility manager from

Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  On the whole,

manufacturing in the Ninth District appears

healthy, with good orders and growing

output, but with few bottlenecks or input

shortages.  Contacts report generally normal

inventories and no  delays or difficulties in

securing raw materials.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Agriculture
            </strong>
            <br/>
            "Prices are somewhat better than we had

expected," comments a South Dakota

rancher who believes that the price trough of

the beef cycle was passed last spring and that

both fat and feeder cattle prices will trend

upward in 1997.  Higher prices for feeder

cattle are due in part to lower feed costs as

favorable grain yields have put downward

pressure on prices.  Grain producers

generally have completed harvesting in most

areas, and yields were excellent and better

than had been expected through the growing

season.  Winter wheat seeded in South

Dakota and Montana is generally in good

condition.  But the late harvest and early

onset of very cold weather prevented much

fall tillage, and farmers in Wisconsin,

Minnesota and South Dakota will have to

rush to catch up next spring.  Overall

production of sugar beets and potatoes in

North Dakota and northwest Minnesota was

also good.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Consumer Spending
             </strong>
             <br/>
             There are some indications that consumer

spending has increased in late fall and early

winter.  Vehicle sales are described as good

in many areas, with sales of pickup trucks

reportedly very robust in North Dakota,

South Dakota and much of Minnesota.  

A large national retailer based in Minnesota

reported improved earnings for the third

quarter compared to somewhat sluggish

performance earlier in 1996.  A regional

department store chain also describes

improved sales in October and November. 

Reports from advisory council members

around the district indicate general

optimism among retailers in regard to the

holiday season.  Some sources indicate

sluggish sales of major                         

appliances, but say that sales of apparel and

consumer electronics are stronger than in

the first two quarters.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Tourism and Recreation
              </strong>
              <br/>
              "Tourism has been down 11 percent this

year," reports a motel owner from Rapid

City, S.D.  He is echoed by sources in other

regions, who sketch a general pattern of

lackluster tourist and recreation business

continuing through the year.  Western

Wisconsin, where tourism has grown to

match that of better-known scenic areas of

the state, is one exception.  The pheasant

hunting season in South Dakota was about

even with 1995.  Early snow in northern

areas has been encouraging to businesses

serving cross-country skiers and

snowmobilers.
