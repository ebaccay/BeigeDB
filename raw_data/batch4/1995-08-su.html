      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most districts continue to report economic expansion, although in 
some areas the rate of expansion has moderated recently. The Upper 
Midwest, Southeast and West continue to expand. Other areas are 
experiencing little or no growth. Expansion of retail sales also 
varies by geographic region, with the center of the country 
generally doing somewhat better than other areas. Manufacturing, 
particularly the auto and construction-related industries, continues 
to slow in many districts. However, orders are up in some districts, 
and inventories generally are considered to be at acceptable levels. 
Reports of tight labor markets come from many districts, but few 
report increased wage pressures. Three-quarters of the districts 
continue to report higher prices for raw materials, but the rate of 
increase is decelerating. Retail prices are generally unchanged or 
up modestly. In most areas of the country, residential and 
commercial real estate markets are picking up; loan demand is steady 
or strengthening. Weather concerns dominate reports from most 
agricultural-producing districts, while livestock producers face 
reduced profits because of lower selling prices and higher feed 
grain prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Compared with one year ago, retail sales are up slightly in the 
Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, New York and St. Louis districts, 
while the remaining districts report sluggish or declining sales. 
The Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City and New York districts report 
strong growth in apparel sales, while the Boston and Dallas 
districts report either declining or steady apparel sales. Boson 
also notes that sales of durables are below retailers' expectations. 
The Philadelphia district reports that discount stores are doing 
well and that the recent heat wave increased the demand for air 
conditioners, fans, outdoor furniture and lawn equipment In general, 
though, retailers in this district are experiencing their usual 
seasonal slowdown. The Kansas City and New York districts note that 
sales of home furnishings and home improvement goods are weak, while 
retailers in the Atlanta district have seen a recent uptick for 
these products. Most districts report that retailers' inventories 
are at acceptable levels. Contacts in the Atlanta district expect a 
good back-to-school season, while St. Louis contacts are somewhat 
more pessimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on auto sales are mixed, ranging from sluggish in the 
Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts, to above last 
year's levels in the Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City districts. In 
the Philadelphia district, increases in auto sales are leveling off 
from their higher rates earlier in the year, and dealers in the St. 
Louis district report flat to moderately strong growth. In the 
Chicago district, auto leasing is very strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing production continues to slow in most districts. The 
Boston, Cleveland. Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond and 
St Louis districts report some slowing, while New York and San 
Francisco have mixed reports from their contacts. Some districts 
note that the auto and construction-related industries have slowed 
recently, with accompanying effects on firms that supply these 
industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Atlanta, Chicago and Kansas City districts report some gains in 
overall production, with Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco noting 
increases in orders. The demand for machinery has jumped 
significantly in the Boson district. Computer and electronic firms 
in the Atlanta district indicate that recent increases in orders are 
adding to their backlogs. Heavy truck manufacturers in the Cleveland 
district report that a backlog of orders is sustaining their
business. The Chicago district notes a decline in steel demand, 
while St. Louis is experiencing an expansion in the steel industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Exporters in the Boston district report that even though sales to 
European markets have been sluggish, demand from developing 
countries has grown substantially. Inventories at firms in the 
Cleveland and Kansas City districts are at desired levels, but firms 
in the Atlanta district report that levels remain below those posted 
earlier in the year. Small high-tech firms in the Minneapolis 
district note expanding activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions vary across and within districts. Contacts 
in the Philadelphia district note that they have trimmed payrolls 
and reduced hours. Similarly, contacts in the St. Louis district 
note that the need for temporary workers or overtime has diminished 
greatly. The New York district says that announcements of employment 
gains have been mostly offset by recent layoffs. Temporary 
employment agencies in the Boston, Dallas and Richmond districts, 
however, report strong demand. Firms in more than half of the 
districts continue to report difficulty hiring and retaining both 
skilled and entry-level workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all districts note that price pressures remain on materials 
and supplies, with reports of increasing prices generally 
outnumbering reports of flat or declining prices. Overall, though, 
the rate of increases appears to be moderating. Despite reports of 
minimal wage pressures, there are some reported exceptions. In the 
Dallas and Richmond districts, for example, wages for temporary 
workers have been accelerating while in the Chicago and Minneapolis 
districts, upward pressure on wages for entry-level employees 
continues. Retail prices in the Kansas City and New York districts 
are generally unchanged to up slightly, although individual 
districts report declining apparel and computer prices. Some 
retailers in the San Francisco district are now tempering their 
price increases for fear of hurting sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Input price increases at the manufacturing level are more widespread 
and appear to be more prevalent for raw materials like paper and 
wood products, chemicals and certain metals. Nine districts report 
higher input prices; of those nine, two-Boston and Cleveland-expect 
to see higher prices of cotton goods and furniture, respectively, 
later this year. In the Dallas district, on the other hand, recently 
announced increases in chemical prices have been rescinded, and in 
the Chicago district, prices for steel and resin have actually 
declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial real estate markets have improved 
somewhat in most districts. Contacts in the Atlanta, Chicago, 
Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia and San Francisco districts report 
recent increases in single-family home construction or sales, while 
New York and St. Louis report slack activity. Despite recent 
increases, year-to-date residential construction is still below the 
records set in many districts in 1994. Recent reductions in mortgage 
interest rates are credited for the pick-up in new construction and 
sales. Real estate agents in the Philadelphia district report a 
large inventory of homes for sale, but contacts in the Atlanta 
district complain of a low inventory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in commercial real estate markets, especially industrial 
markets, continues to increase or hold steady across all reporting 
districts. Commercial vacancy rates have declined in the Minneapolis 
and Richmond districts, while holding steady in the Dallas and 
Philadelphia districts. The multifamily sector is strengthening in 
the Atlanta, Boston and Dallas districts. New residential 
construction is reported in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and 
Minneapolis districts and in selected portions of the Richmond and 
San Francisco districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand appears to be steady or rising in a majority of 
districts. Both the Atlanta and St. Louis districts note that 
competition among lenders on price ad credit terms is fierce. 
Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis 
ad San Francisco report strong commercial and industrial loan 
demand. Consumer loan growth is reported to be up in the Cleveland, 
Dallas, Kansas City ad St. Louis districts. The Atlanta, Cleveland, 
Dallas, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts report 
increased residential mortgage lending because of home sales, 
refinancings or both. Commercial real estate lending is reported to 
be steady in the Dallas and Kansas City districts and weaker in the 
Atlanta and New York districts. Loan delinquencies remain low in the 
Cleveland, New York ad St. Lows districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crops conditions are generally favorable across the nation. Most 
districts, however, report some form of adverse weather that has led 
to heightened concerns about the size and quality of many crops, 
which stem in part from this year's unusually late spring plantings. 
For example, Kansas City reports that weather will need to be ideal 
for the remainder of the season to produce normal yields for corn ad 
soybeans. Elsewhere, hot, dry weather has affected crops in the 
Dallas ad St. Louis districts, while Chicago, Minneapolis and 
Richmond report some heat-related losses for poultry ad cattle 
producers. Increasing feed grain prices and lower livestock prices 
have diminished profit levels for livestock producers in the Kansas 
City and Minneapolis districts; some producers in the Kansas City 
district plan to reduce the size of their breeding herds in 
response. With the wheat and small grain harvest complete in many 
areas, yields are reportedly smaller and of lower quality in the 
Kansas City district and parts of the St. Louis district. On the 
other hand, record or near-record yields are reported in the 
Richmond district ad in other parts of the St. Louis district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy production has changed little despite lower oil prices. A 
marked decline in crude oil price has not prevented an increase in 
oil drilling activity in the Kansas City district. Despite lower 
natural gas prices in the Dallas district, drilling activity for 
natural gas is reportedly higher. Minneapolis reports robust growth 
in its natural resources industries. In particular, copper and wood 
products producers are operating at capacity, while activity in the 
San Francisco district's mining industry is increasing.
