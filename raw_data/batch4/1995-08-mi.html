      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <strong>
      August 9, 1995
     </strong>
     <p>
      At mid-year,  moderate, broad-based economic growth continues in the 
Ninth District with a number of sectors improving from spring to 
summer. Construction is once again an engine of growth as strong 
non-residential activity more than compensates for any reduction in 
home building. Manufacturers, particularly of high-tech products, 
continue to report good business. Oil and gas leasing and drilling 
is at the highest level so far this decade, and oil production is 
increasing after several years of slow decline. Mines are busy, and 
the continued boom for paper producers counterbalances some slowing 
in lumber output. Banks and investment firms report good to record 
earnings. General merchandise sales are stable overall, with 
vehicles selling somewhat better than in the spring. Tourist 
business improved from spring into summer along with the weather.
Employment continues to grow moderately and unemployment rates 
remain well below national averages. Wage increases are small and 
few price increases are apparent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agriculture remains a problem sector due to persistent low livestock 
prices and adverse weather. But crop prospects have improved 
substantially since mid-spring and the 1995 crop will likely be 
good, though well below 1994's record.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real estate and construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "It's tighter than a drum," is one senior agent's description of the 
commercial and industrial real estate marker in the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul metro area where vacancy rats are down to about 5 percent and 
rents are reportedly rising sharply. This tight market is the fire 
under the boiler for the 1995 construction season. Commercial and 
industrial projects planned or underway for 1995 in Minneapolis-St. 
Paul are the highest in 10 years and 40 percent above last year's 
active pace. Publicly let government and private contracts through 
June for the states of Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota are 
3 percent above year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      This strength in non-residential construction is more than 
compensating for the slight slowing of residential work. As 
evidence, construction employment in Minneapolis-St. Paul is up 8 
percent from a year ago. For Minnesota as a whole and for North and 
South Dakota, employment in the sector is up 1 percent to 2 percent 
in spite of some slowing of single-family home building in many 
areas. Some residential builders report strengthening sales of new 
homes in mid-summer and restored buyer confidence in the economy, 
although they do not expect a return to 1994's record levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Our residential business has really picked up since mid-winter 
although it is still below 1993 and early 1994," says a Minnesota 
regional manager for a major realtor. And one major mortgage lender 
reports strong increases in new loan and refinance business in early 
summer, although competing firms claim little change.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "This is a very good year for us, but our order book is not as full 
as it was last fall," reports a Minneapolis manufacturer of 
industrial equipment. That generally characterizes manufacturing in 
much of the Minneapolis district. Industrial electrical demand in 
late spring rose over 1994 by only slightly more than long-run 
trend. Manufacturing employment grew similarly. But some sectors 
continue to experience strong growth. Industry sources report that 
small to medium high-tech firms have very good business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Natural resource extraction is at its strongest level in this 
decade. North Dakota oil production has increased about 7 percent 
over year-earlier levels, the first uptick in a decade, and oil 
leasing is reportedly very active in northeastern Montana. Copper 
producers are generally running full out in response to near-record 
prices. The iron mining season is the strongest in at least three 
years in terms of output and employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lumber mills have been whipsawed by gyrations in lumber prices, but 
output remains generally stable. For loggers, any decreases in work 
for sawmills is being offset by pulpwood cutting for paper mills. 
Paper producers continue as capacity and pulp and paper prices are 
at record levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The mood among farmers brightened considerably from late spring into 
mid-summer as fears of a crop failure diminished with more favorable 
weather. Progress of all major crops continues to lag five-year 
average as a result of late planting, but the lag has diminished, 
particularly for corn and soybeans. Certain regions, particularly 
eastern North Dakota and east-central South Dakota, which were 
particularly hard hit by excess rain in the spring are likely to 
have short crops. But conditions are more favorable in Minnesota, 
Wisconsin and Montana. Grain prices, especially wheat, are up in 
response to low carryover and poor crop prospects.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to the improved situation for crops, livestock 
production continues to have severe problems. Cattle and hog prices 
remain depressed and the recent runup in grain costs is further 
squeezing producers. Periods of extreme heat in mid-July slowed 
livestock gains and caused severe death losses for district turkey 
producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "All appear headed for another year of record earnings," is one 
Minnesota newspaper's description of performance at major Minnesota-
based banking, finance and investment companies. Strong profits 
generally characterize banks of all sizes across the district. Small 
agricultural banks in livestock-dependent areas are an exception; 
their managers expressed concerns about loan losses and 
profitability in a survey of agricultural credit conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending and tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "We are having to work harder and harder to keep sales up to 
projections," says the CEO of a chain of appliance and electronics 
stores. Other retailers agree that they have increased expenditures 
on advertising, specials and promotions in efforts to maintain 
sales. In midsummer, general merchandise sales show only modest 
increases over year-earlier levels. Discount chains and lower-price 
mass merchandisers generally report better results than do 
traditional department and full-price specialty stores. In spite of 
this slowing, new retail construction is underway in eastern 
Montana, North and South Dakota and urban areas of Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales numbers remain slightly below 1994 levels, but the 
gap closed somewhat in early summer according to new registration 
data. Dealer association representatives also report improved 
dealership traffic and buyer interest in many areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      As the weather improved from mid-spring to mid-summer, so did 
tourist business in many areas, although the 1995 season is not 
expected to set any records. Sources in Montana report mixed 
conditions, with higher-altitude areas such as Glacier National Park 
suffering from cold, wet conditions well into July. But western 
South Dakota destinations report improvement. Camps and lake resorts 
in northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan 
had good business in July as urbanites fled extreme heat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While the pace of employment growth is slightly lower than a year 
ago, it is still positive and in the range of 1 percent to 2.3 
percent over year-earlier levels. Unemployment rates remain well 
below national averages. Firms continue to report difficulty in 
securing both skilled and entry level workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on wages and prices are mixed. Pressure to raise entry-level 
wages clearly continues. One South Dakota grocery distributor had to 
raise hourly starting wages for data entry and warehouse workers 
from $5 to $7 in order to fill jobs. But wage contract settlements 
at many firms continue to be in the 1 percent to 3 percent range.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once again paper is the most visible culprit in product prices. 
Prices of many printing and packaging grades are at historic levels. 
Copper, brass and aluminum are also more expensive and, in some 
cases, on backorder. Lumber prices have been volatile but generally 
well below a year ago. Gasoline and diesel prices were several cents 
above 1994 levels, but this spread has diminished in recent weeks.
