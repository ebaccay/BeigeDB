      Beige Book Report: Richmond

       March 3, 2004
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of Fifth District economic growth quickened somewhat in January and the first three weeks of February as the expansion of manufacturing picked up and growth in other sectors remained moderate. Factory shipments and new orders expanded faster at many manufacturing firms, including some in the beleaguered textile and furniture industries. Outside of manufacturing, District retail and services firms recorded moderately higher revenues and employment in recent weeks. In real estate markets, residential activity remained at an elevated level and commercial leasing activity was flat in most markets. District bankers reported only modestly higher loan demand as businesses' capital spending remained light. In agriculture, unusually cold and icy weather slowed the development of small grain crops and pastures in some areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers generally reported stronger sales growth since 
              our last report, despite periods of snowy weather. A general merchandise 
              retailer with stores throughout the District said sales growth was 
              at the high end of their projected range. Electronics and spring 
              apparel sold briskly and shoppers who redeemed gift cards typically 
              spent more than the card amount. According to a contact at a large 
              home-improvement chain, their sales growth continued to exhibit 
              momentum. A hardware store contact in central Virginia said he had 
              also seen an increase in demand. But contacts in some areas noted 
              sluggish activity. Sales at department stores in central North Carolina 
              and coastal South Carolina were unchanged over the last six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District services firms reported steady to somewhat improved business 
              conditions in recent weeks. Contacts at two North Carolina healthcare 
              organizations said demand had been unchanged over the past six weeks; 
              one described the local economy as "steady, but tenuous" because 
              of the large number of unemployed textile workers in the region. 
              Information technology businesses in South Carolina and West Virginia 
              reported a slight increase in business, while an IT firm in Maryland 
              characterized demand as flat. Adding to the positive tone, nationwide 
              freight haulers headquartered in the Fifth District reported some 
              increase in demand. Although most services businesses said they 
              had not increased hiring in recent weeks, professional recruitment 
              firms in the Washington, D.C., area reported boosting their staffs 
              because their clients were "coming out of hibernation."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity picked up in January and early February. 
              Shipments rose at a quicker pace and new orders expanded further, 
              led by increases in the chemicals, furniture, industrial machinery 
              and textile industries. A textile producer in North Carolina said 
              that business improved in January noting that--despite operating 
              their plants six days a week--his firm's inventories could not keep 
              pace with orders. A furniture manufacturer in North Carolina told 
              us that orders for residential furniture were somewhat stronger, 
              but noted that commercial business remained soft. Despite a general 
              rise in factory output in January, manufacturing employment in the 
              District declined again. On the price front, several textiles and 
              apparel producers indicated that raw materials prices were rising, 
              but said their ability to pass on price increase to customers was 
              limited because of import price competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bankers reported only modest growth in loan demand in January 
              through mid-February. Demand for commercial loans picked up in a 
              few areas, but bankers noted that with lackluster capital spending, 
              businesses continued to have little need to borrow. A Richmond, 
              Va., banker, however, reported increased borrowing for merger and 
              acquisition activity and noted that borrowing by defense contractors 
              had increased appreciably. A dip in mortgage interest rates stimulated 
              residential mortgage lending, including some refinancing activity. 
              A mortgage lender in Richmond, Va., reported that loan demand was 
              fairly strong in recent weeks and that housing was "doing well" 
              in the area. A banker in Greenville, S.C., however, was less upbeat, 
              noting that recent job layoffs had cooled mortgage lending in that 
              market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District realtors continued to report a generally strong housing 
              market, although the pace of growth in some areas slowed since our 
              last report. A realtor in Odenton, Md., said home sales had been 
              brisk, albeit a "little quieter than before," while a contact in 
              Greenville, S.C., characterized sales as "slowing, but still above 
              average." In contrast, several markets in Virginia remained exceptionally 
              strong. A realtor in Virginia Beach, Va., said the market was "still 
              hot" and an agent in Fairfax, Va., reported that houses for sale 
              continued to receive multiple offers; in one case 30 offers for 
              a single listing. In Fairfax County, Va., prices "shot up another 
              5 percent" in just the past few weeks. Residential builders in the 
              Baltimore, Md., and the Tidewater, Va., areas noted that land prices 
              were rising rapidly and said that area builders were searching for 
              more affordable land outside their primary markets. A contact in 
              Charlotte, N.C., said new infrastructure had to be added to allow 
              home construction in some areas, causing land prices to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to commercial realtors, leasing activity in the Fifth District was flat outside of a couple of metropolitan markets. Contacts in Baltimore, Md., Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C., and Richmond, Va., reported no significant change in industrial, office, or retail leasing during recent weeks. In contrast, realtors in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area said they had been "extremely busy" since the holidays. Office leasing was particularly brisk in the D.C. metropolitan area, driven largely by firms undertaking long-awaited expansions. Commercial realtors in Roanoke, Va., also enjoyed a busy beginning to 2004. A contact there reported that "office activity was up for the first time in fifteen months" and that retail leasing had been particularly strong. Overall in the District, rents for all types of commercial space were stable and vacancies generally unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism strengthened further since our last report. Contacts at 
              several District ski resorts told us that unusually frigid weather 
              in January and February resulted in a wonderful ski season. They 
              said that bookings for the Presidents' Day weekend were somewhat 
              stronger than last year and noted increased spending at restaurants 
              and for recreational equipment. Tourism along the coast was also 
              stronger. A hotelier at Virginia Beach reported that they were completely 
              booked over the holiday weekend. A contact in Myrtle Beach, S.C., 
              added that hotels there were at 90 percent capacity even with the 
              bad weather and that the local airport had its busiest January ever.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District temporary employment agencies generally reported modest 
              increases in the demand for workers since our last report. Agents 
              in Raleigh, N.C., and Hagerstown, Md., said that demand for customer 
              service and sales staff was particularly high and that demand for 
              workers would likely rise over the next few weeks because of an 
              improving economy. The Hagerstown, Md., contact expected upward 
              pressure on wages for temporary workers if economic growth continues 
              to strengthen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Frigid temperatures coupled with ice and snow limited grazing on 
              District pastures during late January and early February. As a result, 
              farmers in Maryland and Virginia increased the feeding of hay and 
              grain to their livestock. Hay supplies were described as sufficient 
              but the quality was below average. In Virginia, contacts noted that 
              late planting, inadequate topsoil moisture, and extremely cold temperatures 
              impeded the growth of small grain crops. In contrast, small grains 
              were generally in fair to good condition in Maryland and the Carolinas.
