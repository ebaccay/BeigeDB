      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 9, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District were mixed in July. 
Manufacturers continued to report declines in orders for their 
products, and the weakening demand for manufactured goods has led to 
some reductions in employment at area factories. Retailers said they 
were entering the usual summer slow period while posting modest 
year-over-year gains. Most merchants said their inventories were in 
line with plans. Auto dealers said sales picked up in recent weeks 
in response to aggressive incentive programs by car makers, but 
dealers are skeptical about prospects for continued improvement. 
Bankers reported some recent gains in commercial and industrial 
lending, and they continued to describe competition for new business 
loans as strong. Consumer lending was generally described as near 
steady. Real estate lending has picked up a bit as home sales in the 
region increased in June and July. Realtors said the increase was 
moderate, however, and the inventory of homes for sale remains 
large. Commercial real estate conditions appeared be steady. Office 
vacancy rates--about 17 percent in the Philadelphia central business 
district and 15 percent in the suburbs--have changed little since 
the beginning of the year, according to realtors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers in the region reported further slowing in business in 
July. Four in ten of those contacted for the month said orders for 
their products had slipped from the June level, an equal number said 
orders were steady, but only two in ten said orders had increased. 
On balance, order backlogs at Third District factories declined in 
July; half of the firms surveyed reported drops in unfilled orders 
while just one in ten posted gains. Several firms that produce 
transportation equipment and parts for the auto industry said their 
business was softening due to declining production rates in the 
automobile industry, but the slowdown in manufacturing activity in 
the Third District economy has affected nearly all the major 
industrial sectors of the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      In line with the slackening pace of business, Third District 
manufacturers have trimmed payrolls and reduced working hours. 
Declining demand for their products apparently has also affected 
pricing; surveyed companies indicated that they have kept prices for 
their own products steady, on balance. While area firms continue to 
report increased costs for supplies and raw materials increases do 
not appear to be as prevalent as they were in the first quarter of 
the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall outlook among Third District manufacturers is positive. 
Expectations are that there will be modest improvement in orders and 
shipments over the next six months. Despite the anticipated 
improvement in business conditions most of the companies polled do 
not expect to extend working hours or increase employment. Capital 
spending by area firms may be increased, but current plans indicate 
the overall gain is likely to be only marginal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the Third District retailers contacted for this report said 
sales in July exhibited the usual seasonal slowdown. Discount stores 
posted greater year-over-year gains than other types of stores. A 
period of above normal heat and humidity in the region boosted sales 
of air conditioners and fans. After a relatively cool spring, the 
hotter weather also appeared to provide an impetus for somewhat 
better sales of lawn equipment and outdoor furniture as well as 
summer apparel. Store inventories were generally in line with plans 
according to merchants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers reported some improvement in sales in recent weeks, but 
the gains appeared to be based on extensive incentive programs by 
manufacturers. In general, dealers do not believe the annualized 
sales rate will continue to move up. Most think the pace of sales 
will level off for the rest of this year and into 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District bankers said lending was moving up moderately in 
July. Several noted recent increases in commercial and industrial 
loan activity, but nearly all of those contacted said competition 
was very strong and margins were thin. Real estate lending was 
picking up as well, according to bankers, driven by an upturn in 
home sales. Refinancings also increased. Bankers generally indicated 
that consumer lending was about steady. Some noted that they were 
deliberately restricting growth in credit card debt in order to 
limit or reduce delinquencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate brokers reported steady market conditions at 
midyear. Office vacancy rates for both the city and the suburbs have 
been virtually unchanged through the first half of the year. The 
rate in Philadelphia's central business district was estimated at 17 
percent. Vacancy rates in suburban office markets varied widely, 
with the overall rate estimated at 15 percent. Realtors and property 
managers said the demand and supply for Class A space remained 
roughly in balance, but the supply of Class B space exceeded demand. 
The supply of Class B space is likely to grow, according to 
realtors, as business firms in the region continue to reduce staffs 
or relocate out of the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential realtors and builders said sales picked up in June in 
response to declining mortgage rates and the higher sales rate was 
being maintained in July. The increase in sales was generally 
described as modest, however, and the inventory of homes for sale 
remained large. Builders have effectively cut prices through a 
variety of incentives in order to sell a larger than normal 
inventory of new homes built on speculation and to keep the pace of 
building activity from dropping. Both realtors and builders are 
concerned that the sales rate will dip in the seasonally slow summer 
months and may not pick up again in the third quarter They cite 
concerns about employment security as a major factor in restraining 
move-up buying by area residents.
