      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     N
     <strong>
      ovember 1, 1995
     </strong>
     <p>
      The economy of the Ninth District continues to roll right along as 
moderate growth prevails in most sectors and regions. A late summer 
upswing in residential building stoked the fires for the 
construction sector. Oil exploration, leasing and drilling is giving 
a big boost to western North Dakota and business remains good for 
metal mining and forest products firms. The 1995 crop is better than 
expected and most prices, with the exception of beef cattle, are 
favorable to producers. Interest rates are falling for farm 
borrowers. Manufacturers report moderate to strong sales. Auto sales 
are somewhat below year-earlier levels, but other retail sales are 
growing moderately. Fall foliage attracted tourists in many regions. 
Labor markets remain very tight. Increases in a few prices contrast
to declines in many others including steel and gasoline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family home building gained its second wind in late summer as 
new permits in Minnesota reached 18 percent above August 1994 levels 
and 12 percent above the building boom of 1993. Small multi-family 
units also posted substantial gains. Similarly, a Ninth District 
director describes home building in western Wisconsin as very 
strong. Active building continues in eastern North Dakota cities 
such as Fargo and Grand Forks, and is spreading to west-central 
areas of the state such as Bismarck and Dickinson. Western Montana 
builders reportedly are having a good season, although below the 
boom levels of the previous two years.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Suburban office and warehouse building remains very strong," says a 
Minnesota director, "but retail building has passed its peak." 
Commercial building is described as strong in most other urban areas 
of the district with the exception of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
Publicly-let construction projects in the Dakotas and Minnesota 
continue slightly above 1994 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural resource industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Booming oil exploration, leasing and drilling in western North 
Dakota continues as the most dynamic aspect of natural resource 
industries. Reflecting industry-wide interest in these new 
developments, the Oil and Gas Journal featured the Lodgepole oil 
formation in recent articles. Exploration and leasing radiate into 
Canada and Montana from initial wells near Dickinson.
     </p>
     <p>
      Iron ore mining continues to have a good season with shipments 
generally running ahead of 1994. Existing copper mines in Montana 
and Wisconsin are running at capacity, and a large mining firm is 
advancing in permitting a new mine southeast of Eau Claire. Lumber 
and building board producers report sales down somewhat for the 
year-to-date compared to 1994, but note late summer improvement. 
High paper prices continue to fuel strong output.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      1995 is turning out to be a much better year than expected for most 
farmers in the district. Farmers in east central South Dakota who 
experienced excessive rainfall in the spring, an early killing 
frost, and excess rainfall during the harvest are one exception. 
Cow-calf producers, particularly in South Dakota and Montana, are 
the other.
     </p>
     <p>
      While 1995 yields are below 1994's record levels for most crops, 
harvests are much better than expected in late spring or even 
midsummer, especially for corn, durum wheat, sunflowers, and 
soybeans in most areas. Prices for all the grains are well above 
year-ago levels. One concern is that rail and barge capacity is 
lagging output and localized shortages of storage are appearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Higher hog prices have cheered producers from a year ago when 
inflation adjusted prices reached historic lows. While increased 
feed costs continue to crimp profits, prices in the high $40 per 
cwt. range mean that most producers are at least recovering all 
costs. This increase in prices is apparently due largely to 
increased exports rather than changes in domestic demand or in 
output. Cattle producers, particularly those with breeding herds, 
continue to experience severely adverse prices. While well-
capitalized producers who experienced favorable prices earlier in 
the decade should be able to weather the cycle trough, bankers in 
ranching areas expressed concern about recent entrants and highly 
leveraged operators.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District third quarter survey of agricultural credit 
conditions showed a 10 to 40 basis point reduction in various 
categories of farm interest rates and adequate supplies of loanable 
funds. Most bankers noted increases in observed farm income and 
spending, which are confirmed by implement manufacturers' reports of 
good sales. But bankers in ranching areas report large increases in 
the proportion of their borrowers up against their credit limits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Sales are good, but not great," is one Minnesota food processor's 
characterization of business conditions, noting that export sales of 
breakfast cereals is one area of strong growth. But computer 
component manufacturers are opening new plants in a Minneapolis 
suburb and in Eau Claire, Wisc. "This year is as good as 1994, which 
was outstanding," says one manager of a North Dakota construction 
machinery manufacturer. Sales of electricity to manufacturers 
continue above 5-year trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Business is good, but not booming." "An O.K. year so far, with some 
improvement in late summer." Such remarks are typical for retailers 
of general merchandise. But one experienced retail analyst notes 
that perceptions of sluggish sales by store managers may be due 
largely to overcapacity in the sector after three years of fevered 
expansion rather than from weak consumer demand. Sales tax 
collections tend to confirm this view. Minnesota, North Dakota and 
Wisconsin all report tax receipts well above 1994 and prior 
projections.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers continue to ride a roller coaster, with highly variable 
sales generally running somewhat below 1994 levels. But there are 
areas of strength, North Dakota dealers report good sales of pickups 
resulting from oil sector activity and improved earnings for 
farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite seasonal slowness, tourism officials in the Ninth District 
report moderate growth. Visitations at major tourism sites for 
September were up 5 to 10 percent in Montana compared to a year 
earlier. A tourism official in Duluth, Minn., reports a 6 to 8 
percent increase in tourism activity for September, while a town in 
northwest Wisconsin has steady car traffic and 3 to 5 percent 
increase in business, according to a Chamber of Commerce official. 
But one source in northern Minnesota described the season as "so-so" 
and some North Dakotans report a decline in visits to regional 
attractions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, wages and prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Its becoming harder and harder to attract and keep good workers," 
is how a western Wisconsin director describes the labor market in 
his region. Labor markets are tight in most areas of the district, 
with unemployment rates below 3 percent for the states of Minnesota, 
North Dakota and South Dakota and near 2 percent in many urban 
areas. Ubiquitous help wanted signs and bulging employment ad 
sections in newspapers continue despite employment growth over 1994 
above 2 percent across the district. Skilled technical specialties 
remain in shortest supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reported increases in compensation levels are generally modest. One 
construction equipment manufacturer in North Dakota signed a 4-year 
contract with its union providing for a 3 percent per year increase 
in wages and another concluded an agreement for 1996 with no 
increase in wages. But some firms apparently are increasing benefits 
to attract and keep employees. An employee benefit plan firm reports 
a sharp increase in the number of restaurants and fast-food 
franchisees who are offering insurance packages and 401k plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural commodities have risen in price, and non-ferrous metals 
and paper remain high. But price declines are reported for a number 
of intermediate goods including most grades of steel and particle 
board. Declines are also reported for property and casualty 
insurance premiums, technology products, advertising specialties, 
and some trucking rates. Petroleum product prices continue to 
decline, and gasoline is advertised at less than $1 per gallon for 
the first time in years at some Minneapolis-St. Paul gas stations.
