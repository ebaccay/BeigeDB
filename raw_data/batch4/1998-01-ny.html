      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports in recent weeks paint a generally positive picture of the 
Second District's economy. Retailers report that sales were mostly 
close to plan in December, as a late surge offset early-month 
weakness; retail selling prices and merchandise costs were flat to 
down slightly. The housing market showed further signs of 
strengthening in the fourth quarter. Commercial rents in Manhattan 
accelerated in the fourth quarter, as the market continued to 
tighten. New York City prime-area hotels continue to operate at 
close to full capacity, with room rates rising at a double-digit 
pace. Regional purchasing managers' reports indicate some slowing in 
the manufacturing sector, and a diminution of price pressures. 
Finally, local banks report further softening in consumer loan 
demand, and a further modest decline in delinquency rates.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report that sales were mixed but, on balance, close to 
plan in December. Major chains report regional comparable-store 
sales ranging from a slight decline versus a year earlier to a 7 
percent gain, while smaller retailers in both New York and New 
Jersey averaged gains of 3-5 percent. Virtually all contacts say 
that sales were unexpectedly sluggish during the first two to three 
weeks of December. However, most report that a last minute spurt and 
strong post-holiday spending pushed full-month sales up to or 
slightly above plan. Most retailers report that inventories are in 
good shape, though a few cite some overhang, particularly of winter 
outerwear, which generally did not sell well. Overall, discounters 
appear to have fared slightly better than traditional department 
stores-most notably in the area of electronics.
       <p>
        Retail selling prices were said to be mostly flat; two major chains 
report a bit more discounting than in 1996, but a third says there 
were fewer markdowns. One contact notes that effective prices and 
profit margins were reduced because the bulk of sales came toward 
the end of the month (when there is heavier discounting). 
Merchandise costs are said to be flat to down slightly; most 
contacts expect modest downward price pressure during 1998 due to 
falling prices of imports. While most retailers report difficulty 
recruiting seasonal help, none reports any perceptible increase in 
wage pressures.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Construction and Real Estate
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Housing markets across the region appear to have gained steam during 
the fourth quarter. New Jersey homebuilders report that new home 
sales were relatively brisk in November and December, at both the 
lower and upper ends of the price range (though less so in the 
middle). Moreover, one large builder experienced unusually heavy 
customer traffic during the first weekend in January.
Remodeling activity, which is already quite brisk, may strengthen 
further in 1998. A New Jersey building industry specialist notes 
that, on January 5, the state introduced a pilot program that eases 
some codes on remodeling existing units, thereby reducing costs; he 
expects this to spur renovation-not only of single-family homes but 
especially of dilapidated inner-city buildings.
         <p>
          Realtors in New York State report that existing-home sales were down 
slightly in November, but that prices rose noticeably-especially 
down-state, where they are running more than 10 percent higher than 
a year ago. Upstate prices were little changed. Separately, a large 
Manhattan brokerage firm reports a fourth-quarter surge in co-op and 
condo prices, following a third-quarter lull. Permits for new 
construction, however, have been essentially flat-both upstate and 
downstate.
          <p>
           New York City's office market appears to have tightened further in 
the fourth quarter. Midtown Manhattan's office availability rate 
(space coming available within the next six months) declined from 
10.3 percent to 9.8 percent at the end of November, while Downtown's 
rate edged down from 17.7 percent to 17.6 percent. Asking rents in 
the tight Midtown Manhattan market rose at a double-digit annual 
rate over the past three months and are up 7 percent from a year 
ago. Downtown rates posted a more modest 4 percent rise over the 
past year but have also accelerated in recent months.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Other Business Activity
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Regional purchasing managers report mixed but, on balance, weaker 
conditions in the manufacturing sector in December. Buffalo 
purchasing managers report that new orders fell noticeably in 
December, production retreated moderately, but hiring activity 
picked up somewhat. They also note a downturn in commodity prices. 
New York purchasing managers in both the manufacturing and non-
manufacturing sectors report that business activity picked up 
slightly in December. Prices paid for goods and services edged up in 
December, though prices paid by manufacturers rose at a slower pace 
than in November.
            <p>
             In New York city, tourism and business travel continue to boom, as 
hotels are operating at virtually full capacity. Manhattan hotel 
occupancy rates held steady at just under 90 percent in October and 
November, while room rates were running 12 percent higher than a 
year earlier.
             <p>
              A substantial portion of upstate New York suffered a severe ice 
storm in early January. While its local impact was severe, the 
affected areas are sparsely-populated. Thus, it is not likely to 
have a substantial effect on the state's overall economy.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Financial Developments
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Bankers at small to medium-sized banks in the District report softer 
demand for loans during the past two months. The consumer segment 
weakened most noticeably, with 42 percent of bankers reporting lower 
demand. Demand also declined for residential mortgage loans but 
remained stable for nonresidential mortgages and commercial &amp; 
industrial loans. On net, refinancings remained level.
               <p>
                Bankers' credit standards did not change substantially over the last 
two months, though fewer respondents express an increased 
willingness to lend. Interest rates on all types of loans declined, 
as did average deposit rates. Delinquency rates continued to 
decline, particularly for consumer loans and nonresidential 
mortgages.
