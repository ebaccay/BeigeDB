      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 21, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The First District economy is strong. For 
              manufacturers and retailers, sales are generally up, employment 
              is level or rising, and prices are largely stable. Commercial real 
              estate markets are more robust in Greater Boston than elsewhere 
              in New England.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retail contacts report that sales grew at a moderate to strong 
              pace in the fourth quarter, matching expectations for the period. 
              Sectors of strength are office supplies, tourism, appliances, and 
              mail-order apparel. Weakness is reported in only one sector: men's 
              leisure wear. In all sectors, inventories are at desired levels. 
              Looking forward, retail contacts expect sales growth in the 4 to 
              7 percent range for 1998, about on par with recent trends.
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment is said to be either increasing 
              moderately or holding steady. Most contacts report that labor markets 
              were tight during the holiday hiring period, with employers encountering 
              difficulty in finding, attracting, and retaining employees. Permanent 
              staff levels appear to be holding steady, with highly skilled computer 
              programmers being the primary occupation with shortages. Among retailers 
              reporting tight labor markets, half are offering wage premiums as 
              one device to hire and retain help, although one contact said such 
              premiums were ineffective. In general, wages are said to be increasing 
              at a 3 to 5 percent annual rate, with selective premiums adding 
              another 5 to 10 percent for specific individual employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       Most respondents report that prices are 
              holding steady. The exception is tourism, where excess demand for 
              hotel rooms in Greater Boston has led to significant price increases. 
              Materials costs are also said to be holding steady, except for paper 
              products, for which prices are rising. Half the contacts say profit 
              margins are either level or increasing slightly. The other half 
              report slight declines in margins, suggesting that rising wage costs 
              may be more than offsetting productivity improvements. Most contacts 
              have modest capital expansions planned for 1998. New England retailers 
              are quite optimistic, expecting growth to continue at a healthy 
              pace during the next six months. None of the contacts express concern 
              that sales will slow as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Almost all First District manufacturing contacts report that recent 
              business is up from a year ago, with about half reporting double-digit 
              gains in sales or orders. The trends are particularly strong for 
              aircraft parts, biotech products, telecommunications and computer-related 
              equipment, sporting goods, and small tools. The majority of automotive 
              parts suppliers contacted indicate that business is very robust, 
              with some citing rising backlogs. For others in this industry, however, 
              sales are declining . In addition, equipment makers serving overseas 
              markets indicate that currency translation has resulted in weaker 
              revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts generally believe the U.S. economy 
              remains in good shape, with several citing accelerating domestic 
              demand for their products. Most exporters indicate that they have 
              not yet felt a decline in sales volume as a result of the Asian 
              crisis. However, they have downgraded their projections for sales 
              to Asia and they expect to face stiffer competition from Asian firms 
              in other markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers indicate that most materials 
              costs are flat to down. Costs rose a little at the beginning of 
              1998 for some grades of paper but held steady for others. Travel 
              costs are said to be increasing. Selling prices are largely stable. 
              Manufacturers have implemented small increases for selected paper 
              products and for fabricated metal products that are in short supply.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Employment is holding steady at about three-quarters of the manufacturers 
              contacted while increasing substantially at the remainder. Average 
              pay is said to be rising at a rate of 3 to 6 percent. Manufacturers 
              indicate that markets continue to be very tight for specialized 
              technical and professional personnel, with double-digit pay increases 
              in some categories such as engineering. A few report rising turnover 
              or greater challenges in recruiting blue-collar workers, although 
              most remain satisfied with availability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many manufacturers expect to make heavy capital 
              investments this year, in order to expand capacity or improve efficiency. 
              Most of the remaining companies indicate a moderate need for plant 
              and equipment. By exception, a large exporting firm is now scrutinizing 
              capital expenditures more closely in anticipation of margin pressures.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Commercial Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Boston continues to lead the commercial real estate market in New 
              England. All sectors of the Greater Boston market are strong. Vacancy 
              rates are around 5 to 6 percent for office space and below 3 percent 
              for retail space. During the past year, rental rates have reportedly 
              increased 12.5 percent on average and about 30 percent for prime 
              downtown and suburban office spaces. Small high-tech firms continue 
              pushing up demand for suburban office space. For the first time 
              since the 1980s, some speculative construction is being undertaken, 
              although banks are still very cautious about lending money for this 
              purpose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Commercial real estate markets in the rest of New England are mixed. 
              The areas adjacent to Greater Boston--southern New Hampshire and 
              Rhode Island--are also strong, with inventory levels shrinking and 
              prices increasing slightly. However, the market in downtown Providence 
              has not changed, and the Greater Hartford area showed no improvement 
              during the last quarter of 1997. Moreover, several major retailers 
              around Hartford closed their doors, leading to an increase in retail 
              vacancy rates and a drop in retail rental rates in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Nonbank Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Respondents at insurance companies report increases in revenue in 
              the range of 5 to 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared 
              to the fourth quarter of 1996. New sales at life insurance companies 
              continue to be driven by variable products linked to the stock market. 
              A few contacts mention increased downward pressure on premiums relative 
              to claims for group health and commercial property/casualty insurance. 
              Several insurers reduced their employment in 1997 while others intend 
              to do so in 1998. Respondents note continued difficulties in finding 
              information technology specialists but some indicate that wage pressures 
              in this field were lower than could be expected.
