      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

     <p>
      <strong>
       March 17, 1999
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The district economy continued to grow moderately last month. Retail 
sales again posted solid gains, and manufacturing registered its 
first improvement in months. Construction activity eased slightly 
due to colder weather but remained well above last year's pace. 
Energy activity declined as prices took another turn for the worse. 
In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop was in good condition, 
but hog farmers continued to suffer from low prices. Labor markets 
remained very tight in most of the district, with wage pressures - 
especially in the construction sector - increasing somewhat from the 
previous survey. Prices remained flat at the retail level and mixed 
for manufacturing materials, while prices for some construction 
materials began to rise.
      <p>
       <b>
        Retail Sales
       </b>
       <br/>
       The momentum created by stronger than expected retail activity 
during the holiday and post-holiday seasons continued in February, 
as sales compared with both the previous month and previous year 
again posted solid gains. At least part of the robust activity was a 
result of pre-spring clearance sales. Many stores have now begun 
increasing stock levels again to get ready for the spring season, 
and further expansions are planned in coming months. With consumers 
remaining predominantly upbeat about the economy, most retailers 
expect continued strong sales. Automobile sales remained somewhat 
slow in February, especially for small passenger cars, leaving sales 
below year-ago levels. Truck and SUV purchases continued to rise, 
however, keeping dealers fairly content with current inventory 
levels. Dealers expect an upturn in overall vehicle sales within the 
next few months unless credit conditions change considerably.
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        Tenth District manufacturing activity improved slightly last month 
but is still rather weak overall. Nearly all plants were operating 
at medium to high levels of capacity, which was an improvement over 
our previous survey but still well below the activity level of last 
summer. Manufacturing materials remained generally available, with 
virtually no variation in lead times and no major difficulties 
expected in the near future. Managers continued to trim inventories 
as fears of reduced exports and increased imports heightened after 
the Brazilian currency devaluation in mid-January. Inventory 
cutbacks were not as sharp as in the previous survey, but many 
managers remained unsatisfied with current stock levels and plan to 
keep trimming over the next few months.
        <p>
         <b>
          Housing
         </b>
         <br/>
         Construction activity eased slightly last month due to colder 
weather, but starts were still well above year-ago levels. Home 
sales also weakened a bit in February, pushing inventories of unsold 
homes slightly higher. New home purchases continued to outpace last 
year, however. Builders expect strong expansion of construction 
activity over the next three months. Mortgage demand remained flat 
in February, dropping slightly below year-ago levels. Small 
increases in interest rates may have helped slow both refinancing 
activity and new home purchases. But mortgage bankers concur with 
developers that activity will soon pick up and lenders therefore 
believe that loan demand is likely to grow much faster in the near 
future.
         <p>
          <b>
           Banking
          </b>
          <br/>
          Bankers report that loans increased while deposits fell last month, 
increasing loan-deposit ratios. Demand increased for consumer loans, 
home equity loans, commercial real estate loans, and agricultural 
loans. On the deposit side, demand deposits, NOW accounts, and large 
time deposits all decreased slightly. All respondents left their 
prime lending rates unchanged, and the majority left consumer 
lending rates unchanged last month. All banks expect to leave the 
prime rate unchanged, and most expect to hold consumer 
lending rates steady in the near term. A few banks reported a 
tightening of lending standards on agricultural loans because of 
concerns over low commodity prices.
          <p>
           <b>
            Energy
           </b>
           <br/>
           District energy activity continued to decline in February, as prices 
took another turn for the worse. The rig count fell 8 percent, 
following an even bigger drop in January, to 44 percent below year-
ago levels. After rising moderately in January, the price of West 
Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 2 percent in February, as world 
demand failed to pick up in the wake of the Brazilian crisis. At 
$11.96 per barrel, oil was 26 percent cheaper than a year ago. 
Natural gas prices also fell after recovering slightly in January. 
Mild weather and a glut of gas on the market led to a 5 percent 
price decline in February, to 18 percent below the previous year.
           <p>
            <b>
             Agriculture
            </b>
            <br/>
            The district's winter wheat crop was in good condition, although 
unusually warm weather led to early development, leaving the crop 
open to damage from a late freeze. The existing wheat pasture was in 
good shape. Hog producers in the district continued to struggle due 
to low market prices and many small and mid-sized producers have 
liquidated their herds. The remaining producers are expected to hold 
out another six months for higher prices. District farmland values 
remained stable, although sales volume was down. Landowners are 
being more flexible with rent payment schedules, but district cash 
rents held steady. District bankers indicated that credit reviews of 
agricultural borrowers look good. In most cases, less than 5 percent 
of the banks' agricultural loans will not be renewed, about the same 
percentage as a year ago. However, district ag bankers are requiring 
more of their customers to obtain federal loan guarantees this year, 
reflecting some concern about repayment difficulties in the year 
ahead.
            <p>
             <b>
              Wages and Prices
             </b>
             <br/>
             Labor markets remained very tight in most of the district last 
month, with wage pressures--especially in the construction sector--increasing somewhat from the previous survey. Retailers continued to have problems finding entry-level workers and sales associates. Labor shortages among manufacturers were less widespread than in previous surveys, but general laborers were still in need. Builders 
faced the biggest difficulties obtaining workers, despite a slight 
easing in the overall construction market. All types of construction 
workers were in high demand, especially skilled tradesmen such as 
framers, bricklayers, and carpenters. Builders subsequently felt the 
biggest increase in wage pressures in February, although retailers 
were also forced to increase pay more rapidly than in the recent 
past. Thanks to a reduction in labor tightness among manufacturers, 
wage pressures in that sector subsided somewhat compared with 
previous surveys. Retail prices held steady in February and are 
expected to remain stable in the near future. Prices of 
manufacturing materials were mixed. Steel prices continued to drop, 
but rubber and plastic prices both increased. The price of some 
construction materials, such as insulation and sheetrock, also edged 
up, and further small increases for some materials such as drywall 
are expected in the near future.
