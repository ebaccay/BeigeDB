      Conversations with First District business contacts 
                  again have a positive tone. Retailers say sales were up modestly 
                  during the summer months, and manufacturers report second quarter 
                  demand improvements in selected areas. Temp firms and software 
                  and IT companies also see some pickup. Commercial real estate 
                  markets are said to be stabilizing. Contacts in all sectors 
                  indicate that they remain cautious.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most retail contacts in the First District report modest improvements, 
                  with increases in sales ranging from 3 to 6 percent compared 
                  to a year earlier. Surplus merchandise and discount furniture 
                  sales are reportedly slightly ahead of expectations, with furniture 
                  sales accelerating in August. Rainy weather is said to have 
                  hampered sales in the hardware sector, particularly paint products, 
                  in June and early August, while sales in July were up 6 percent 
                  year-over-year. Office supply sales continue to build momentum, 
                  with increasing demand for durable goods and back-to-school 
                  items, as low prices help drive sales. By contrast, sales of 
                  graphic art supplies are reportedly below year-ago levels. Automobile 
                  contacts indicate sales have continued to exceed expectations, 
                  particularly in July.
       <p>
        Most contacts report employment is steady, though 
                  two retailers expect their headcount to increase by at least 
                  100 over the course of the year. Some respondents recently implemented 
                  annual salary increases, ranging from 2.5 to 3 percent, while 
                  the majority report no changes. Vendor prices are mostly stable, 
                  with selling prices flat to down. Capital spending plans are 
                  mixed among contacted retailers, with about half holding spending 
                  steady. New store openings account for most increases, while 
                  decreases reflect computer-related cutbacks.
        <p>
         Looking forward, most surveyed retailers anticipate 
                  slow sales growth over the next six months. Most contacts express 
                  greater optimism about the future of the economy than in the 
                  recent past. However, some retailers note concern about high 
                  unemployment rates, the possibility of rising interest rates, 
                  and the continued threat of terrorism.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing and Related Services
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Most manufacturing contacts report areas of improved demand 
                  in the second quarter but say they are unconvinced that the 
                  upturn is sustainable. For half of these firms, sales are up 
                  by 2 percent to 20 percent from year-ago levels, with new products 
                  and currency translation contributing in some cases. For the 
                  other half, year-over-year comparisons are weak, with sales 
                  flat to down by as much as 20 percent. Sources of strength include 
                  sales to the military and the semiconductor industry. Demand 
                  for commercial aircraft also shows signs of stabilizing. By 
                  contrast, demand for paper products and furniture is reportedly 
                  soft. Contacts continue to cut inventory--in a few cases from 
                  problematic levels--and note renewed pressures from retailers 
                  trying to reduce stocks.
          <p>
           Manufacturers also report that retailers and 
                  other major customers continue to demand price concessions although 
                  a few contacts have achieved small increases in selected prices. 
                  Downward price pressures reflect manufacturers' excess capacity 
                  and customers' increased use of online bidding. With prices 
                  for materials, other than petrochemicals, also flat to down 
                  year-over-year, respondents plan to improve margins through 
                  ongoing efforts to cut production costs.
           <p>
            Labor demand appears to be stabilizing at surveyed 
                  manufacturers. A majority reduced employment in recent months, 
                  but most hope to avoid further layoffs. A few have increased 
                  overtime or are hiring for specific divisions. One noted that 
                  experienced engineers are scarce.
            <p>
             A few firms are increasing their capital spending 
                  markedly in 2003 from 2002 levels as they "chase" technology 
                  or install long planned lean manufacturing systems. But over 
                  half are spending "carefully"--below last year, below budget 
                  or below norm. Most point to idle capacity.
             <p>
              A majority of contacts express cautious optimism 
                  about future prospects, with several noting that the outlook 
                  for profits or sales is better than expected recently and may 
                  even be improving. However, most view the improvements to date 
                  as modest and the challenges as daunting. Thus, they continue 
                  to plan conservatively and to hunt aggressively for savings.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Temporary Employment
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Respondents from temporary employment agencies in New England 
                  report slowly growing labor demand in the second quarter, and 
                  a noticeable pickup early in the third. Demand for manufacturing 
                  workers remains weak, while demand for technical workers--in 
                  telecommunications, software, and electronic assembly--has grown 
                  significantly in some cases. Respondents report employment is 
                  weaker in Connecticut, Vermont, and some parts of western Massachusetts, 
                  while southern New Hampshire and Maine are said to be performing 
                  better.
               <p>
                Several staffing companies report that some applicants 
                  have received multiple job offers, which respondents interpret 
                  as a sign of demand growth. Some contacts report a decline in 
                  labor supply, both skilled and unskilled. However, the number 
                  of permanent positions available remains small, with clients 
                  still preferring to hire on a temporary basis. Downward price 
                  pressure continues, with some companies reducing both bill rates 
                  and wages in response. Most respondents express concern about 
                  rising costs, particularly for medical and worker's compensation 
                  insurance.
                <p>
                 Contacts are positive about the remainder of 
                  2003, anticipating modest demand growth during this period. 
                  But after a healthy July and August, some respondents say they 
                  will wait to see what September has in store before committing 
                  to the idea of an economic recovery.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Commercial Real Estate
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  Commercial real estate markets in New England are holding steady. 
                  Contacts report no substantial improvement, but no material 
                  deterioration either. High office vacancy rates continue to 
                  prevail throughout the region. Even though Boston experienced 
                  positive market absorption in the second quarter for the first 
                  time in over two years, the area's vacancy rates increased as 
                  a result of new office space added to the market. Office rents 
                  continue to decline in the Boston area and are "nowhere near 
                  building replacement cost." Consequently, new construction is 
                  being put on hold until it becomes cost effective, which will 
                  likely take "a long time." Activity levels are low in all markets, 
                  although some contacts attribute that to usual seasonal slowdowns 
                  and anticipate more activity in the fall. Others expect the 
                  high vacancy rates to persist for quite a while, insisting that 
                  substantial employment growth is necessary to improve conditions 
                  in commercial real estate markets.
                  <p>
                   <strong>
                    Software and Information Technology Services
                   </strong>
                   <br/>
                   Contacts cite renewed optimism in the software sector, with 
                  most firms recording either revenue gains or no deterioration 
                  from first quarter to second. The majority of contacts, even 
                  those with flat current results, are encouraged by pipeline 
                  activity, since software sales are typically stronger at year 
                  end.
                   <p>
                    A few companies that were struggling to avoid 
                  layoffs in the first quarter are now beginning to hire; however, 
                  one contact reports a 10 percent layoff. Capital spending across 
                  the sector is still uneven, with some companies spending substantial 
                  amounts on technology and others freezing expenditures until 
                  the end of the year.
                    <p>
                     The outlook is beginning to change from flat 
                  to positive in the near term as contacts throughout the software 
                  and IT sector are buoyed by recent inquiries. Respondents report 
                  increased interest in custom applications and banking software.
