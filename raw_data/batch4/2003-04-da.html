      <p>
       Eleventh District economic activity was mixed from mid-February 
                through mid-April. The energy industry, including energy-related 
                manufacturing, picked up strongly. But other manufacturing activity 
                was mostly flat or down. Activity in the service sector was also 
                mixed. Retailers reported a drop in sales. Construction and real 
                estate markets continued to be soft, and the financial service 
                industry reported little change in activity. Overall agricultural 
                conditions remained relatively stable in the last seven weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts vary in their outlook for future activity. There is 
                optimism in some industries that activity will pick up soon, as 
                uncertainty surrounding the war dissipates. Other contacts are 
                more pessimistic about the outlook than they were a few weeks 
                ago. These contacts expressed concern that the economy is not 
                necessarily going to bounce back quickly after the war because 
                businesses are very reluctant to make capital investments until 
                they are certain demand is picking up in their industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Price pressures were mixed since the last Beige Book. There were 
                some reports of downward price pressure for goods, such as for 
                aluminum products and scrap metal. Energy prices remained high 
                but have fallen since March. Inventories of crude oil, which had 
                reached the lowest levels since 1974, are being rebuilt in the 
                last couple of weeks. Gasoline consumption has been near the top 
                of the five-year range, while inventories are near the bottom 
                of that range. The inability of refiners to build gasoline stocks 
                in early spring is expected to keep gasoline prices high for much 
                of the summer. Cold weather in the Midwest and New England areas 
                caused the Henry Hub price of natural gas to spike to $16.00 per 
                thousand cubic feet in late February. Strong demand has kept natural 
                gas prices above $6.00 per thousand cubic feet for more than two 
                weeks. Natural gas inventories were 50 percent higher than their 
                five-year average as the heating season began, and 50 percent 
                below average as it ended. Higher energy costs have also pushed 
                up prices for plastics, chemicals, paper, and plastic packaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       There continue to be widespread concerns about high insurance 
                costs. Accounting firms have increased fees to accommodate rising 
                insurance costs and additional work imposed by the regulatory 
                changes from the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. These firms say that their 
                customers are having difficulty passing these higher fees on to 
                their selling prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several contacts noted that wage pressures had lessened or the 
                company was offering smaller wage increases. Contacts say that 
                temporary workers are commanding far lower salaries, particularly 
                for sales and marketing, where yearly salaries have dropped from 
                $80,000 to $65,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall manufacturing activity was mixed, with a pickup in energy-related 
                activity but little signs of growth in other sectors. While there 
                had been a slight increase in demand for a few construction-related 
                products, sales of most construction-related products were soft 
                and contacts expect demand to weaken as building continues to 
                soften.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conditions in high-tech manufacturing were flat. Contacts said 
                the biggest obstacle to a significant turnaround continues to 
                be weak capital spending by businesses. One respondent noted that 
                SARS is having significant supply and demand effects in Asia, 
                and one of their factories in Asia had been shut down for at least 
                10 days after a worker became infected with the illness. Overall 
                inventory levels were reported to be lean, and productivity gains 
                were helping to improve profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for fabricated metals has been flat during the past six 
                weeks and slightly down from a year earlier. Contacts said that 
                private investment was very weak, but public spending (on construction 
                projects) was helping to buoy demand. Demand for primary metals 
                was also flat to down over the past six weeks, which contacts 
                attributed to a lack of business investment due to the war and 
                stiff competition from China. The demand for lumber has increased 
                slightly over the past month, but contacts expect a slowdown as 
                home building cools. Contacts in the stone, clay, and glass industries 
                said the demand has risen over the past six weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for food products has slowed over the past month, and 
                contacts say their customers are being cautious in their ordering 
                because of the war. Demand at "white table cloth" restaurants 
                has weakened, they say, but "middle of the road" restaurants are 
                making up for it. Demand for paper products has been "light." 
                Paper producers say competitive pressures have been stiff, and 
                heavy inventories have led some companies to reduce production 
                and lay off employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strong demand and profits have led refiners to run at high levels 
                of capacity utilization--higher than 90 percent--in recent weeks. 
                Refineries are postponing or minimizing the normal spring turnarounds 
                to switch from heating oil to gasoline. Demand for petrochemicals 
                has also been strong, particularly for products tied to construction. 
                However, high natural gas prices have led some energy-intensive 
                plants to shut down, and all plants have struggled to pass through 
                the increased cost of production. A substantial increase in basic 
                chemical and plastic production was reported in early April after 
                natural gas prices fell below $5 per thousand cubic feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for temporary workers remained strong overall. There has 
                been a sizable increase in demand for workers to supply durable 
                goods manufacturing, call centers, and technology, but demand 
                has weakened for clerical and administrative support workers. 
                Legal firms reported little change in demand for services to support 
                regulatory, litigation, and bankruptcy work. Demand continues 
                to be virtually nonexistent for mergers, acquisition, or venture 
                capital activity. Accounting firms say demand remains strong from 
                energy, construction, and financial sectors, as well as additional 
                work to support the regulatory changes imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley 
                bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The airline industry continues with its struggle to find the 
                road to solvency. Demand for air travel fell as the war in Iraq 
                started; international travel, which was also hurt in areas affected 
                by the SARS virus, was particularly hard hit. Some carriers have 
                temporarily suspended flights to SARS infected areas. Wage reductions 
                and additional layoffs are reducing costs, but costs continue 
                to rise due to a snowstorm in the Northeast and hail damage in 
                Texas. As one contact noted, "we can't get a break."
      </p>
      <p>
       Trucking activity improved markedly over the past four to six 
                weeks. Rail shipments were also higher than year-ago levels, with 
                significant increases in shipments under the category that includes 
                military traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers reported that when the war became imminent, sales dropped 
                between 3 percent and 5 percent on a store for store basis compared 
                with last year, after adjusting for the movement of Easter. Sales 
                of women's apparel have been particularly weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automobile sales in the District remain below year-ago levels, 
                although the so-called "CNN Effect" appears to have lifted since 
                the start of the war with Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall activity remains unchanged. Deposit growth is still relatively 
                strong, which contracts attribute to continued uncertainty over 
                economic conditions. Loan demand has been mostly stable. Auto 
                lending remains slow, despite several attempts by auto manufacturers 
                to entice new buying. Real estate lending is still strong, mostly 
                due to refinancing activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Nonresidential markets continued to be very weak since the last 
                Beige Book. The single-family market was mixed; sales of homes 
                priced below $175,000 or above $1 million are strong. "Caution 
                prevails" in office markets but several contacts suggested that 
                they believe the market has hit bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The U.S. rig count pushed up from near 900 to 972 in recent weeks. 
                Higher natural gas prices and expectations that they will be sustained 
                have stirred up substantial interest in domestic drilling. Respondents 
                are forecasting a substantial increase in the rig count ahead, 
                perhaps as high as 1,200 before running into labor or resource 
                constraints. So far, the additional drilling is relatively unsophisticated--with 
                few signs of a pickup in difficult areas, such as deep Gulf of 
                Mexico. Contacts report the lack of drilling in the shallow Gulf 
                may be related to pending government subsidies, but that there 
                is substantial interest in the deep waters of the Gulf in the 
                months ahead. International drilling remains unchanged, with the 
                downside risk for oil perceived as much greater than for natural 
                gas.

       Strong spring rains continue to improve moisture conditions in 
                parts of the District, although other areas remain dry. Higher 
                cotton prices have encouraged more planting of that crop compared 
                to last year. Feeder cattle continue to sell for near record highs.
