      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis

      <b>
       March 5, 2003
      </b>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Ninth District economic activity was mixed from early January through late 

  February. Agriculture, home building, and mining grew. Manufacturing, tourism, 

  and energy were mixed. Consumer spending was flat and commercial construction 

  was down. Over this period, labor markets loosened slightly. Overall wage and 

  price increases were modest. Significant price increases were noted in heating 

  costs, gasoline, and tuition.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial building was generally down. In 2003, only about 200,000 square feet 

  of new space is planned in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, down from 1.2 million 

  square feet in 2002, according to a commercial real estate firm. A Minneapolis 

  firm that reconfigures office space and moves furniture reported less work in 

  January and February than in the last months of 2002. However, in Sioux Falls, 

  S. Dakota, building permits were up in January compared with a year ago; commercial 

  realtors, developers, and architects are expecting a good year in 2003, according 

  to a city official.
      </p>
      <p>
       Home building and residential real estate activity were solid. The number of 

  housing units authorized in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area increased 14 percent 

  in January compared with a year earlier. "Every indication is that 2003 should 

  be another very busy year for builders," said a representative of a Minneapolis-St. 

  Paul area builders association. However, the vacancy rate for apartments in 

  Minneapolis-St. Paul increased to 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002, 

  up from 4 percent a year earlier. A representative of a realtors association 

  in La Crosse, Wis., expects 2003 to be another good year for single-family home 

  sales, but says 2003 will likely fall short of the 2002 sales record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall retail sales were flat. A major Minneapolis-based department store and 

  discount retailer reported that same-store sales were essentially flat in January 

  compared with a year ago. According to a representative of a chamber of commerce 

  association, retailers in Minnesota were not complaining about post-holiday 

  sales, but they carried low levels of inventory. A Minneapolis area mall manager 

  noted flat sales in January compared with a year ago, while a mall in Montana 

  reported sales down slightly in January from last year. In contrast, another 

  Minneapolis area mall manager reported good traffic levels in January and February, 

  while a mall manager in North Dakota noted that the mall's annual post-holiday 

  sale had higher traffic levels than a year earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto sales dipped in January from December levels. According to a representative 

  of an auto dealers association in Minnesota, after a good December, auto sales 

  have "fallen off a cliff." An auto dealer in Minnesota noted a significant slowdown 

  in sales at several stores in January.
      </p>
      <p>
       Winter tourism was mixed, primarily due to weather. The first seven weeks of 

  the winter tourism season were a "washout" due to a lack of snow in the Black 

  Hills area of South Dakota, according to a tourism official; however, since 

  the end of January, business has been up about 10 percent over last year. Businesses 

  in northern Wisconsin that depend on snowmobiling and cross-country skiing are 

  hurting, reported a university extension agent. In contrast, plenty of snow 

  in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan led to a recent 10 percent increase in lodging 

  expenditures in January compared with last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity was mixed. A January survey of purchasing managers by 

  Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated increased manufacturing activity 

  in Minnesota and the Dakotas. As evidence, a Minnesota prescription drugs manufacturer 

  plans to significantly increase capital purchases and employment, and an industrial 

  equipment maker will expand production in western Wisconsin. However, preliminary 

  results from a January survey of District manufacturers by the Federal Reserve 

  Bank of Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Trade and Economic Development 

  revealed that businesses expect employment and capital investment to decrease 

  slightly in the first half of 2003 from the second half of 2002. Several District 

  manufacturing facilities recently announced plans to close, including a western 

  Wisconsin tool factory and an electronic component plant in southern Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy and Mining
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the energy sector was mixed, while the mining sector was up slightly. 

  Mid-February District oil and natural gas exploration levels were down slightly, 

  while oil production was up slightly from early January. Meanwhile, two District 

  iron ore mines were operating at near capacity and expect to increase employment. 

  District metal mines enjoyed significant increases in gold prices and moderate 

  price increases for other metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The agricultural economy was generally up due to higher commodity prices. The 

  U. S. Department of Agriculture reported that farmers and ranchers received 

  slightly higher prices for their products in January compared with December. 

  January hog and beef prices were up 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, from 

  December. January poultry and egg prices were up 13 percent from a month earlier. 

  However, January dairy prices were down 1 percent. In response to higher wheat 

  prices, Montana farmers planted 21 percent more acres of winter wheat than last 

  year, despite continued drought conditions. Ranchers in the western part of 

  the District have reduced herds due to the drought and, therefore, a smaller 

  calf crop is expected this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages, and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Several upcoming layoffs were announced since the last report. In Rochester, 

  Minn., a high-tech manufacturing company will lay off most of its 550 workers 

  by June. A financial services organization with headquarters in Minneapolis 

  just announced plans to lay off 500 employees companywide due to merger issues. 

  In North Dakota, a bus manufacturing plant will lay off up to 230 employees. 

  A credit card issuer recently announced plans to cut 100 jobs in Minnesota. 

  In several areas of the District, state and local government budget problems 

  may be addressed in part through job reductions. For example, more than 1,000 

  Minnesota state workers could be laid off by June 30. School Districts in the 

  Upper Peninsula of Michigan noted that reductions in state aid will likely result 

  in layoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, a health benefits company in Duluth, Minn., plans to hire another 

  60 to 70 employees over the next six months. A call center in South Dakota has 

  hired 160 people since the beginning of the year and plans to hire 175 more. 

  A telemarketing company that opened in South Dakota in February plans to hire 

  as many as 50 employees, and a call center in Billings, Mont., will add 50 jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wage increases were modest. About 75 percent of respondents to a recent survey 

  by the St. Cloud (Minn.) Area Quarterly Business Report indicated no change 

  in employee compensation during the last three months of 2002. In Eau Claire, 

  Wis., two large unions agreed to pay a portion of their health insurance premiums 

  in exchange for pay increases of 3.75 percent during each of the next two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall price increases were modest, except for significant increases in heating 

  costs, gasoline, and tuition. Only 10 percent of respondents to the St. Cloud 

  (Minn.) Area Quarterly Business Report poll raised product prices during the 

  last three months of 2002, while 16 percent decreased prices. Heating costs 

  may rise as much as 10 percent to 35 percent over a year ago in several areas 

  of the District due to colder weather and higher natural gas prices, according 

  to energy companies. Gasoline prices at pumps in Minnesota were about 50 percent 

  higher than a year ago. Tuition and fees at four-year public universities in 

  North Dakota were up 14 percent for this academic year.
