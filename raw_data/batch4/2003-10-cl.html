       Business conditions in the Fourth District 
                  remained mixed in August and September. Residential construction 
                  activity and mortgage-related lending remained at high levels, 
                  although some contacts noted a slight deceleration in September. 
                  Modest improvements were noted in nondurable manufacturing, 
                  some retail categories, trucking and shipping, and commercial 
                  lending. Conditions remained steady or weak in durable goods 
                  manufacturing, apparel and auto retailing, and commercial construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Input prices remained the same or rose during 
                  these months. Manufacturers in particular noted sharp increases 
                  in energy prices, while builders noted an increase in some of 
                  their materials costs. Trucking companies reported that fuel 
                  costs had leveled off.
      </p>
      <p>
       At worst, contacts expect annual economic activity 
                  to be the same as in 2002, but many contacts expect higher levels 
                  of sales and production.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing contacts continued to report mixed conditions 
                  in August and September. Durable goods producers reported steady 
                  conditions compared with one month ago, but they often reported 
                  lower sales and production compared with a year ago. On the 
                  other hand, nondurable manufacturers consistently reported at 
                  least modest increases in both production and sales. For all 
                  contacts, inventory levels were flat or lower compared with 
                  a year ago. Few contacts in nondurable manufacturing reported 
                  excess idle capacity, but durable manufacturers reported excess 
                  capacity ranging from 5 to 40 percent. About half of the contacts 
                  stated that overtime was used, and most experienced no change 
                  in their employment levels. Input prices were higher than last 
                  year but were flat relative to July. Increasing prices for utilities 
                  was of particular concern. A few contacts have increased the 
                  prices of goods with some success, but most producers left their 
                  prices unchanged. Most contacts anticipate flat or increasing 
                  sales and production through the rest of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto production increased overall throughout 
                  the District in September (up 6.6 percent in the last month 
                  and up 2 percent since a year ago), though a few producers experienced 
                  declines. This increased production appeared to run counter 
                  to national trends. Most facilities in the District used overtime 
                  hours more than usual during the survey period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel production and sales were mixed during 
                  August and September. Firms in different market sectors continued 
                  to experience different trends, with those supplying the defense 
                  industry maintaining high levels of demand while demand from 
                  aerospace, power generation, and non-residential construction 
                  continues to be weak. Idle capacity is in the range of 10 to 
                  40 percent. Inventory levels are low, and most contacts were 
                  satisfied with current levels. Due to increases in some input 
                  prices including natural gas, electricity, and ferrous metals, 
                  steel prices have climbed as well for some contacts. New orders 
                  are coming at a very slow rate and are flat for most contacts. 
                  Contacts generally anticipate flat to moderately rising production 
                  and sales through the rest of 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales were flat to slightly higher than last year during 
                  August and September, in some cases, better than expected. Apparel 
                  sales were again soft, while food and drink, personal care items, 
                  furniture, and home appliances sold well. Inventories continue 
                  to be tightly managed and are low compared with historical standards. 
                  As usual, discount stores fared better than other retail chains. 
                  Vendor and retail prices continued to be flat in general, although 
                  sharp increases in meat prices hurt some restaurants. As retailers 
                  prepare for seasonal hiring, staffing is not expected to be 
                  a problem this quarter; labor turnover remains low, and prospective 
                  workers are easily found. Sales for the rest of the year are 
                  expected to be steady and flat to slightly up from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto dealers indicated that September sales 
                  were poor, much lower than August and September 2002. Used vehicles 
                  continued to sell well, as did new trucks. Dealer inventories 
                  have risen and become somewhat "bloated" because of soft sales 
                  and increased shipments from manufacturers attempting to reduce 
                  their own inventories as the model-year ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Sales were strong in residential construction in August and 
                  September. In Ohio, August home sales were up 18 percent over 
                  last year. Some of the increase was attributable to customers 
                  purchasing in anticipation of rising interest rates. Since rates 
                  have since flattened, there were some indications activity may 
                  have slowed slightly in September. Overall, contacts expect 
                  sales will be strong for the rest of the year and at least as 
                  high as fourth quarter 2002. Profit margins were somewhat strained 
                  by rising material costs. Plywood and lumber prices have been 
                  rising sharply. Contacts indicated that events outside the District, 
                  particularly rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Isabel and recent 
                  military purchases of plywood for operations in Iraq, were partly 
                  responsible for some of the price increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial construction was slow during this 
                  period, and increases noted in the last report appear to have 
                  been transitory. Conditions have not changed much from the early 
                  summer. However, most contacts continue to be optimistic about 
                  future contracts, as discussions about projects have picked 
                  up and appear to be less tentative than in the past. Several 
                  contacts noted new project possibilities in manufacturing areas. 
                  Profit margins continue to be low because of fierce competition 
                  for the available construction opportunities. A few contacts 
                  noted slight increases in materials costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trucking and Shipping
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in trucking and shipping in August and September showed 
                  modest improvements compared with the same period in 2002. Most 
                  contacts believed that the uptick in activity represented more 
                  than just seasonal factors. Retail customers increased their 
                  demand for trucking and shipping services, while demand from 
                  manufacturers continued its flat-to-negative trend of the last 
                  several years. Most firms have an optimistic outlook for the 
                  remainder of this year and into 2003. Fuel input costs rose 
                  during the summer driving season, but have since leveled off.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Banking
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Conditions were again mixed for commercial and consumer loans. 
                  Contacts reported stable-to-increased demand for commercial 
                  loans (which are at low levels), while consumer loan activity 
                  was steady to declining from the high levels seen earlier in 
                  the year. This drop in demand for consumer loans was driven 
                  by the drop in refinancing activity, which was caused by the 
                  recent rise in mortgage rates. Reports regarding the rate of 
                  loan delinquencies for mortgage, installment, and business loans 
                  were mixed.
