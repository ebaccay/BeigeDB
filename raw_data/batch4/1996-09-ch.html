      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Summary
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Seventh District economy continued to expand at a 
moderate rate in August. Retail sales improved from July's pace, 
with several retailers citing improved back-to-school sales from a 
year ago. Commercial construction activity picked up across the 
District, while residential activity varied from state to state. 
Manufacturing activity remained robust, but reports were mixed as to 
whether the sector was gaining or losing momentum. Overall bank 
lending remained strong, despite reports of a decrease in mortgage 
lending. Labor markets continued to be tighter than the nation as a 
whole, but wage pressures remained subdued. High grain prices and 
poor quality forage are cutting milk production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales improved moderately from July to August 
and were up from one year ago. Several large retailers attributed 
sales gains to year-over-year improvements in "back-to-school" 
items, most notably apparel. Most retailers expect this strength to 
carry into September with "back-at-school" sales. Results from a 
Michigan survey suggested that these sales patterns were similar for 
small retailers. One major retailer pointed out that August's year-
over-year sales comparisons may be distorted because of 
exceptionally strong sales of air conditioners and other hot-weather 
related items in the Midwest last year. This retailer noted that 
sales of appliances (other than air conditioners) remained strong, 
while electronics sales (other than computers) were soft in August. 
Computer sales were reported to be strengthening, in part due to 
improved back-to-school sales. However, a major discount chain 
reported that sales in District states were at or below 
expectations, with weakness in big-ticket items--small appliances, 
electronics, etc.--prompting plans to increase price discounting 
over the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Housing/construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While overall construction activity remained 
robust during July and August, residential housing activity was 
mixed. Recent data releases showed that Midwest sales of new and 
existing homes increased significantly in July, but reports from 
District contacts varied widely from state to state. A builder in 
one large metro area described activity as "the best (residential 
housing) market in 20 years," while a contact in another area 
reported that "(unsold) inventory is now a concern." A national 
survey of home builders suggests that sales of new homes in the 
Midwest were down in August and virtually every banker contacted 
reported that mortgage lending activity decreased. While most areas 
reported pockets of both increasing and decreasing residential 
building activity, contacts in Michigan reported increasing activity 
throughout the state. Commercial building activity was reportedly 
strong and increasing throughout the District in July and August. 
One lumber supplier reported that strength in commercial 
construction was responsible for shortages of building materials, 
most notably wallboard. This source also noted that a shortened 
summer building season (resulting from inclement weather in much of 
May and June) strained lumber supplies and prices increased 
significantly, reaching a two-year high. However, competition among 
suppliers to maintain market share is preventing them from passing
along the entire cost increase to builders, whose margins have 
already been squeezed. In addition, the price increases are not 
expected to endure.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained at a very 
high level in July and August, but views were mixed about whether 
momentum was building or slowing. Purchasing managers indexes across 
the District jumped in August, including one metro area which had 
been signaling flat activity for several months. These increases 
were led by strong gains in new orders and production. Most 
manufacturers contacted, however, reported that demand was flat or 
moderating in July and early August. Steel producers reported that 
mills were at effective capacity in August, and order books were 
full through November. One medium-sized machine tool producer noted 
a jump in orders in July from a year ago, while another said orders 
have been below year-ago levels for several months. A producer of
heavy construction equipment noted an increase in orders, after 
encouraging customers to place their year-end orders early to ensure 
production and on-time delivery. Otherwise, their order intake 
continued to slow across most market segments. An appliance producer 
reported that domestic shipments slowed in July and August from 
their stronger-than-expected pace earlier in the year. Except for 
recently announced steel price increases, which appear to be 
sticking, neither purchasing managers surveys nor individual reports 
suggested any recent increase in price pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from bankers generally indicated that 
lending activity remained strong in July and August. Several 
Michigan banks reported that business lending continued to post 
solid gains. Recent merger and acquisition activity in the state 
increased the demand for capital equipment-based loans. Bankers in 
other areas, however, noted recent flattening in business lending 
from very strong growth earlier in the year. A major regional bank 
cited double-digit growth in consumer loans from a year ago. Rising 
delinquency rates, while still low, encouraged some smaller banks to 
shift their emphasis from installment loans, including credit cards, 
to equity loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained tighter in the District than 
in the nation as a whole, with the unemployment rate in July 
virtually unchanged for the fifth straight month. Manufacturing 
employment continued its slight decline in July, but purchasing 
managers surveys suggested that payrolls were again increasing in 
August. Temporary help agencies also reported that "the industrial 
segment of the business is tightening up." Shortages of 
construction, skilled clerical, and technology workers persisted 
throughout the District. Despite the tight conditions, most contacts 
reported no discernible acceleration in wage pressures. One survey 
of small retailers in Michigan, however, suggested that smaller 
firms across the state were raising their starting wages to attract 
qualified workers. The survey also noted that the added costs were
being absorbed by the retailers, rather than passed on to consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Corn prices remained high in August, but down sharply 
from the very high levels of late spring, early summer. The extreme 
tightness in old-crop supplies was being overcome by cancellations 
and deferrals in export orders, the curtailed operations of many 
processors (especially ethanol plants), the use of alternative 
grains for feeding livestock, and regional imports of newly 
harvested grain from southern states. New crop prospects remained 
mixed, with sizable portions of the District's late-planted corn and 
soybean crops in a close race to reach maturity prior to normal 
first-frost dates. Meanwhile, evidence of scaled-back production 
among the District's dairy farmers continued to mount. Milk 
production during June and July was down 5.5 percent in District 
states and down 2.1 percent elsewhere. The cuts reflect fewer dairy 
cows and less output per cow. High grain (feed) prices and poor 
quality forage accounted for the abnormal decline in the 
productivity of dairy cows.
