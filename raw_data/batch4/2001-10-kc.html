      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 24, 2001
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy weakened in September 
            and early October. Retail sales dropped immediately following the 
            terrorist attacks and recovered only partially in the next several 
            weeks. In addition, the slump in manufacturing worsened, residential 
            construction activity slowed, and commercial real estate activity 
            declined. Energy activity also fell somewhat after increasing most 
            of the year. In the farm economy, fall crop yields were mixed and 
            weaker cattle prices trimmed profits for cattle feeders. District 
            labor markets eased, as previously scheduled job cuts took effect 
            and more layoffs were announced. Wage pressures remained minimal outside 
            of a few skilled occupations. Retail prices and prices for construction 
            and manufacturing materials were largely stable, while manufacturing 
            output prices edged down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales declined from the previous survey and were below year-ago 
              levels in most of the district. Many stores shut down on the day 
              of the terrorist attacks and most experienced slower than normal 
              sales the rest of that week. Sales had recovered somewhat by the 
              following weekend but remained below normal in most places through 
              early October. High-end retailers generally suffered the biggest 
              declines in sales, while large discount stores and grocery stores 
              fared better. Retailers expect activity to remain somewhat subdued 
              through the holiday shopping season. Motor vehicle sales in September 
              were strong in some areas due to attractive financing packages, 
              but remained soft in others due to consumers' unease about the economy. 
              Dealers expect sales to weaken once the consumer incentives come 
              to an end.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District factory activity weakened again after showing some signs 
              of improvement in August. A greater percentage of firms reported 
              year-over-year declines in production, shipments, and most other 
              indicators of factory activity. In addition, more manufacturers 
              reported declines in employment than in previous surveys. Layoffs 
              were announced in a variety of industries, but especially among 
              aircraft manufacturers and parts suppliers. Several firms mentioned 
              that the biggest immediate impact of the terrorist acts was a reduction 
              in executive air travel, which they feared could disrupt sales. 
              Capital expenditures at district plants continued to fall along 
              with expectations of future activity. Most plants were trimming 
              inventories in September and planned to continue doing so. No significant 
              material shortages were reported, and supplier delivery times were 
              little changed despite some disruptions immediately following the 
              terrorist attacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction activity eased in September and early October, 
              and commercial real estate markets continued to weaken. Housing 
              starts were down in most cities, with some cities reporting considerable 
              declines. Many builders reported a dropoff in customer interest 
              following the terrorist attacks and some said a few customers cancelled 
              orders. Some builders, however, reported that demand was slowing 
              even before the attacks. Home sales were markedly below year-ago 
              levels in some cities, and many realtors reported reductions in 
              buyer traffic. Mortgage demand held steady in September as increased 
              refinancing activity made up for fewer home purchase applications. 
              Commercial real estate activity declined somewhat further, with 
              construction, rents, and absorption all showing more weakness. Vacancy 
              rates were higher than a year ago in nearly all district cities, 
              and slightly higher than in the summer. Commercial lending standards 
              were reported to be slightly tighter than in the previous survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers report that loans decreased and deposits increased since 
              the last survey, reducing loan-deposit ratios. Demand fell for commercial 
              and industrial loans, consumer loans, and commercial real estate 
              loans. A number of bankers attributed the weaker demand for these 
              categories to increased caution on the part of borrowers, some of 
              whom are making a greater effort to pay down their loans. On the 
              deposit side, increases in demand deposits outweighed declines in 
              large CDs. All respondent banks reduced their prime lending rates 
              since the last survey, and almost all banks decreased their consumer 
              lending rates. A few banks tightened their lending standards, citing 
              the slowdown in the economy and the increase in uncertainty.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Energy activity in the district declined in September and early 
              October. The region's count of active oil and gas drilling rigs 
              continued to fall from a 14-year high established in July, reaching 
              a six-month low in the first week of October. Some producers attributed 
              the decline in drilling to the steep fall in natural gas prices 
              since last winter, which has discouraged the drilling of marginal 
              wells. District sources expected natural gas prices to remain fairly 
              low through 2002, but believe long-run prospects for the energy 
              industry are still favorable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Fall crop yields were mixed across the district, and district cattle 
              feeders suffered some decline in profits. With the fall harvest 
              almost complete, corn and soybean yields in the southern part of 
              the district were below normal due to adverse weather over the summer. 
              Elsewhere, yields were average or better. Rainfall came in time 
              for planting of the district's winter wheat crop, which is generally 
              ahead of schedule. Large supplies of market-ready cattle put downward 
              pressure on finished cattle prices, trimming profits for district 
              cattle feeders. Bankers reported that small business activity in 
              rural areas was sluggish, continuing the slowdown that began prior 
              to the terrorist bombings.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District labor markets eased in September and early October, as 
              sizable job cuts were announced and previously announced layoffs 
              took effect in many parts of the district. Employers were reported 
              to be taking more time in screening and hiring new workers, with 
              many having a waiting list of applicants for the first time in several 
              years. Several retailers said they would not be hiring as many temporary 
              holiday workers as in previous years. Worker shortages persisted, 
              however, for nurses and skilled construction trades. Wage pressures 
              remained minimal outside of these fields. Several contacts reported 
              that there has been a definite shift in unions' focus from wages 
              to working conditions over the last six months. Retail prices were 
              flat for most items, although several stores lowered prices to clear 
              excess inventory. Most store managers expect flat prices through 
              the remainder of the year. In the manufacturing sector, input prices 
              were flat and output prices fell slightly. Both input and output 
              prices are expected to edge up in coming months. Builders reported 
              that prices for most construction materials were stable.
