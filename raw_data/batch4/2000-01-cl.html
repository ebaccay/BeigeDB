      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

     <p>
      <strong>
       January 19, 2000
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy remains on a strong 
              growth trajectory, with continued low rates of joblessness and, 
              possibly, a small uptick in wage growth. Still, underlying price 
              pressures appear to be somewhat light.
      <p>
       District temporary employment agencies reported 
              a seasonal downturn in demand for general laborers. However, strong 
              demand for administrative assistants, clerical workers, and legal 
              secretaries continued unabated. Demand for seasonal retail help 
              was also quite strong in December. Overall, our contacts expressed 
              continued difficulty finding and retaining qualified workers, and 
              an increasing number of temp agencies are offering improved benefits 
              packages and bonuses to attract experienced workers. Continued strong 
              demand for temporary workers is expected at least through the spring.
       <p>
        Union sources reported that wage growth continued 
              to edge up in most industries, with estimates ranging from 3 percent 
              to 3  percent. Job security is still the focal point of union contract 
              negotiations, however, and our contacts indicated that, where possible, 
              workers seem willing to trade some wage gains for added job protection.
        <p>

         District homebuilders reported a slowdown in home sales in the latter 
              part of 1999. Nevertheless, fourth-quarter sales were still seen 
              as quite good, and most builders are reporting a record number of 
              homes built in 1999.
         <p>
          Commercial builders noted a steady improvement 
              in project startups, and business in this sector is reportedly quite 
              good. In the Cincinnati/northern Kentucky region, the pace of commercial 
              building seems to have picked up in the past several months. In 
              northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, a recovering manufacturing 
              sector is beginning to spur demand for more warehouse and industrial 
              space. Columbus builders reported high activity levels, although 
              the brisk pace of new building in this region seems to have slowed 
              down a bit as of late.
          <p>
           The availability of building materials has improved 
              in the industry, and accordingly, price increases appear to have 
              eased a bit after having peaked at midyear.
           <p>
            <b>
             Industrial Activity
            </b>
            <br/>
            Auto parts manufacturing continues to post solid orders gains, and 
              production activity in the industry is characterized as brisk. Heavy 
              machinery manufacturing has improved somewhat, perhaps fueled by 
              stronger orders growth from abroad. A small improvement in orders 
              and production of electronic building components was also seen, 
              reportedly tied to a rise in commercial construction activity. However, 
              orders for Class A trucks fell precipitously in December, building 
              upon a more modest downward trend that began about midyear. The 
              large backlog that existed early in 1999 has subsequently dwindled, 
              and expectations for the current year have been pared down sharply.
            <p>
             Most steel industry contacts reported an improving 
              demand for steel. Book orders for all steel products are improved 
              for the first quarter. Prices are strengthening and are expected 
              to increase further this spring. All companies reported inventories 
              commensurate with current sales levels, although there is a general 
              anticipation of even stronger sales numbers later this year.
             <p>
              Purchasing managers in the District reported a 
              modest increase in the growth rate of commodity prices in November. 
              Primary metals, paper, and chemicals prices were notably higher 
              in November than earlier in the year. Manufacturers' Y2K stockpiles 
              were small (generally less than one week's inventory), and no significant 
              disruptions due to inventory overhangs are expected. Virtually all 
              companies reported that business and plant operating computers were 
              functioning normally following the transition to 2000.
              <p>
               <b>
                Consumer Spending
               </b>
               <br/>
               The fast sales pace retailers have enjoyed slowed a bit in November, 
              damped by unseasonably warm weather. However, sales rebounded sharply 
              in December, and year-over-year December sales growth is estimated 
              to be at about the same strong pace as the year-to-date average. 
              Generally, retailers expect strong sales to continue this year, 
              but they do not expect sales to be quite as robustly as in 1999.
               <p>
                Few retailers built up inventories as a precaution 
              against Y2K-related disruptions. Much of the stockpiling took the 
              form of earlier-than-usual shipments of spring merchandise. Indeed, 
              some retailers reported lower-than-usual inventories for the season.
                <p>
                 Retailers with online sales outlets reported exceptionally 
              strong sales for the holiday period. Internet sales were about four 
              times higher this holiday season than last year. One Fourth District 
              retailer reported that sales via the Internet were so strong that 
              the company experienced inventory shortfalls.
                 <p>
                  Sales of new vehicles varied from steady to brisk 
              for District dealers in December. Contacts believe that unseasonably 
              warm weather may have helped boost new car demand. For many District 
              auto dealers, 1999 was their second consecutive record sales year. 
              Consumer demand for light trucks was a key factor in last year's 
              strong sales numbers, and District auto dealers are attempting to 
              bolster their inventories of new trucks. Our contacts foresee continued 
              strong sales for the next few months.
                  <p>

                    Banking and Finance
                   </b>
                   <br/>
                   Lending activity in the District is strong and growing for commercial 
              loans and stable (at a moderate level) for consumer loans. The rate 
              for loan delinquencies continues to be very low.
                   <p>
                    Credit quality is high as banks have become increasingly 
              selective in their loan applications. Willingness to lend remains 
              high, but banks reported that it is very difficult to attract deposits 
              at rates that provide an adequate margin above lending rates. Indeed, 
              as has been the case for much of the past several years, the spread 
              between borrowing and lending rates is reportedly narrow because 
              of fierce competition in the loans market.
                    <p>
                     No significant Y2K-related disruptions were 
              reported in the District, and Y2K-related currency withdrawals by 
              bank depositors seem to have been modest overall and much less than 
              had been anticipated. However, deposits were reportedly down slightly 
              in December, as people satisfied their liquidity demands by cashing 
              their regular paychecks rather than depositing them.
