      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 11, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District economic activity continued to expand in recent 
weeks, although growth has moderated in some sectors. Manufacturing 
rebounded sharply from July; commercial real estate activity 
continued to gain strength; and state tax revenues grew more 
quickly. Activity at ports and in the service sector was steady. 
Retail sales growth and housing activity weakened, and lending 
continued to slow somewhat. Reports of labor market tightness and 
upward pressures on wages were widespread, but only scattered 
reports of price pressures were received. In agriculture, weather-
related diseases damaged some crops, but most yields were still 
expected to be excellent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Several District retailers reported that activity 
expanded more slowly in August. They said that overall sales growth 
was sluggish, with little improvement in shopper traffic, although 
big ticket sales were steady. One large chain of home improvement 
stores, however, reported much stronger sales in August than in 
July. Employment grew only modestly; one West Virginia retailer 
commented that "finding quality employees continues to be 
difficult." Wage growth continued to be strong. Contacts noted that 
their inventory levels increased. Retail prices rose more slowly 
during the last several weeks; respondents, however, expected prices 
to rise more during the next six months than they had expected in 
July. Compared to July, contacts lowered their expectations of 
demand for their products over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service producers contacted by mail reported a steady pace 
of activity in August. Revenues and employment grew at the same rate 
in recent weeks as in July, although wage growth was more modest. 
Contacts said their prices rose more slowly in August, and 
respondents expected smaller increases in prices and in the demand 
for their product over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity grew at a substantially faster 
pace in August. Respondents to a mail survey of District 
manufacturers reported stronger growth in shipments, particularly of 
industrial machinery and equipment. New orders increased sharply, 
especially at printing firms, and order backlogs rose. Manufacturing 
employment edged up slightly amid widespread complaints of labor 
shortages. Manufacturers, however, indicated that their inventories 
remained above desired levels. Contacts reported that finished goods 
prices decreased slightly and that raw materials prices increased 
slightly in August from July. Respondents' six-month outlook was for 
lower finished goods prices and somewhat higher raw materials 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity generally softened in late August. Except 
at mountain resorts, most District contacts reported that hotel room 
occupancy rates were below July levels, possibly due to the early 
opening of schools in neighboring states. Many contacts from coastal 
areas said that their August revenues were below average. One 
respondent from the Outer Banks told us that tourists' concerns 
about Hurricane Edouard had led to a drop off in inquiries for the 
Labor Day weekend. In addition, fall bookings throughout the 
District were down slightly compared to a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Port Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Representatives at District ports indicated that July 
import levels were higher than in June but that export levels were 
lower; both import and export levels were lower than a year ago. 
Most representatives continued to anticipate that exports and 
imports would increase during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The demand for contingent workers grew faster 
in August, according to a survey of Fifth District temporary 
employment agencies. Clerical and light-industrial workers were 
particularly in demand. Respondents characterized labor markets as 
generally tight and several expected their local markets to tighten 
further as students returned to school. One respondent from Roanoke, 
Va., said that labor shortages in her area were becoming desperate. 
Several contacts noted that wage levels increased during August, 
especially for skilled labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall lending activity in the District slowed slightly 
during August. Contacts at financial institutions suggested that 
consumers had adopted a "wait-and-see" attitude toward further 
borrowing. Several mortgage lenders reported that the short-lived 
dip in interest rates in late July and early August was accompanied 
by a temporary increase in mortgage demand, but that as rates rose, 
demand eased. Some contacts noted declines in commercial lending at 
their institutions. Two respondents reported that they had recently 
tightened their lending standards while several others indicated 
that a future tightening of standards was likely.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to a telephone survey of District 
real estate agents and homebuilders, residential real estate 
activity declined slightly in late July and August. Housing starts, 
permits, and customer traffic were somewhat lower. Respondents 
indicated that home sales were steady and that sales prices 
increased slightly. Subcontractor wages rose slightly and some 
materials prices increased sharply; one West Virginia homebuilder 
said that lumber prices had "skyrocketed."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate activity picked up in 
August, according to a telephone survey of commercial real estate 
brokers. Leasing activity continued to escalate; one Richmond agent 
characterized the market there as "red-hot," and a South Carolina 
respondent remarked, "We don't know how much better it could get." 
Vacancy rates declined and rental rates continued to climb. The 
availability of prime office space continued to tighten, and a 
number of contacts reported shortages in their areas. Respondents 
throughout the District reported an increase in new construction, 
including speculative projects, although contacts in Northern 
Virginia and the District of Columbia noted that local rent levels 
were not high enough to spur much new construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       State Revenues
      </strong>
      <br/>
      State tax collections generally increased faster in 
July than in June. Withholding tax collections rose in most 
jurisdictions, but were slightly lower in West Virginia. Sales tax 
collections and real estate recordation tax receipts increased. 
Corporate tax collections increased only slightly; a North Carolina 
contact blamed flat corporate profitability for the small increase 
in corporate collections.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drier weather in late August allowed farmers to catch 
up on field work and slowed the spread of moisture-related crop 
disease, according to agriculture analysts. Disease damage was 
expected to reduce tobacco and peanut yields, but analysts 
anticipated that the production of those crops would be sharply 
higher than a year ago. Bumper crops of corn and soybeans were also 
expected. Hay harvesting activity picked up as drier weather allowed 
cutting and curing activities to resume.
