      Beige Book: National Summary

     <p>
      <b>
       April 24, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost all Federal 
              Reserve Districts reported signs of improvement or actual increases 
              in economic activity since the last survey. The sole exception was 
              Boston, which described economic activity as mixed. While the overall 
              tone was positive, a few districts expressed qualifications about 
              the pace of the recovery or the strength of their regional economies. 
              Cleveland said its economy continued to improve but cited concerns 
              that the rate of improvement had slowed considerably from earlier 
              in the year. Also, Kansas City and Dallas noted that their economies 
              were still weak despite recent signs of improvement.
      <p>
       Retail sales increased or held steady in most 
              districts, and all districts reported stable or improved manufacturing 
              conditions. Manufacturers' capital spending plans, however, remained 
              limited. Residential real estate activity was strong in most districts, 
              as both home sales and construction increased. Tourism activity 
              also improved in most areas, while other services activity held 
              steady. Demand for bank loans was little changed in most districts, 
              although increases were reported in some regions. Commercial real 
              estate markets remained generally weak, especially in the San Francisco, 
              Dallas, and Atlanta districts, but showed signs of steadying in 
              the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City districts. Energy 
              activity continued to ease, and agricultural crops in several districts 
              were damaged by adverse spring weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the increases in economic activity reported 
              in many districts, labor markets remained slack and wage and price 
              pressures generally stayed in check. Demand for labor showed signs 
              of firming in several districts but was still reported as weak in 
              others. Except for skilled health care workers, there were very 
              few reports of labor shortages. Also, those districts that mentioned 
              wage pressures described them as minimal. Retail prices were generally 
              flat. Steel producers sharply boosted prices, but most other manufacturers 
              held prices steady despite reports in some districts of higher costs 
              for fuel, steel, and petroleum-based inputs.
      </p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most districts reported that retail sales held steady or rose moderately 
            in March and early April. Philadelphia and Richmond reported increased 
            sales from previous months, and Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and 
            Kansas City reported sales above year-ago levels. Sales appeared to 
            be weakest in the Dallas district, although retailers there reported 
            some signs of improvement as well. In the New York, Chicago, and St. 
            Louis districts, sales at discount retailers were reported to be better 
            than at general merchandise stores. Home furnishing items continued 
            to sell particularly well in most districts. Apparel sales were reported 
            as weak in some districts, but as rebounding somewhat in the New York, 
            Philadelphia, and Cleveland districts. Store managers across the country 
            appeared to be largely satisfied with inventory levels, and were generally 
            positive about the outlook. Retailers in the Kansas City district, 
            however, said they were ready to begin discounting if sales did not 
            meet expectations.
      <p>
       Automobile sales were characterized as mixed or 
              flat in most districts reporting on such activity. Dealers were 
              cautiously optimistic about future sales in the Philadelphia and 
              Kansas City districts. On the other hand, Cleveland district auto 
              dealers did not expect to meet last year's sales levels, and dealers 
              in the Dallas district were concerned that rising interest rates 
              would dampen sales. Dealers in the St. Louis district were also 
              keeping inventories a little lower than usual in case sales did 
              not pick up.
      </p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in March and early April was reported to be 
            either stabilizing or showing signs of improvement in all districts. 
            Plants in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts reported continued 
            growth in orders and shipments, and many plants in the St. Louis district 
            were hiring new and previously laid-off workers. Boston and Kansas 
            City also reported signs of a looming turnaround, but noted that activity 
            was still weak compared with a year ago. Industries reporting the 
            strongest activity included producers of auto parts, steel, residential 
            building materials, and furniture. Activity also remained solid at 
            automobile plants in the Cleveland and Chicago districts and among 
            semiconductor producers in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. 
            Textile and apparel manufacturers in the Richmond, St. Louis, and 
            Dallas districts experienced increases in demand as well, but the 
            rebound follows numerous plant closures. Plants in most districts 
            reported a stabilization of inventories following a lengthy period 
            of decline, and some firms in the Chicago and San Francisco districts 
            were cautiously increasing stock levels.
      <p>
       Manufacturers were generally optimistic about 
              the outlook for factory activity later in the year. Purchasing managers 
              in the New York district, in fact, reported their highest expectations 
              for increases since mid-2000. In contrast, some producers of capital 
              goods in the Boston district expected weakness to continue until 
              2003. Despite the generally positive outlook, capital spending plans 
              remained rather limited across the country. Kansas City reported 
              a similar number of firms expected to increase as to decrease capital 
              expenditures over the next six months. Philadelphia reported that 
              manufacturers have raised capital spending plans, on balance, but 
              that the planned increases have been spotty and concentrated mainly 
              in the chemicals and plastics industries.
      </p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity remained robust. Housing markets 
            were reported to be strong in most districts, with both home sales 
            and new construction showing continued gains. The housing market in 
            the Boston district was described as very strong, with listings in 
            short supply throughout the region. In New York, further strengthening 
            in home sales has caused the number of unsold homes to dwindle and 
            has led to some acceleration in housing prices. Richmond also reported 
            especially strong housing activity, with one metro area described 
            as the best sellers' market ever and another metro area said to be 
            experiencing rapidly escalating home prices. There were, however, 
            a few exceptions to the overall strength in housing activity. Home 
            sales softened somewhat in the Chicago district, and residential construction 
            activity remained weak in the Dallas district. Moreover, demand in 
            several districts was weaker for high-end homes than for low- and 
            mid-priced homes, and demand for rental units in the New York district 
            was not as strong as that for houses.
      <p>
       Commercial real estate activity remained generally 
              weak but appeared to be stabilizing in a few districts. Markets 
              remained especially weak in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Atlanta 
              districts. In the San Francisco district, vacancy rates continued 
              to increase, lease rates continued to decline, and new construction 
              was at a minimum. In the Dallas district, office markets were still 
              being held back by overcapacity and weak demand, causing steep declines 
              in rental rates in many areas. Commercial markets in Atlanta also 
              continued to suffer from weak demand, limiting new construction. 
              Commercial builders in the Cleveland district expected to be busy 
              in the coming months but were somewhat less optimistic than in the 
              previous survey, with more projects still in the planning stage 
              than they had hoped. On the positive side, commercial markets in 
              a few districts showed some signs of stabilization or improvement. 
              Leasing activity strengthened in the Richmond district, and office 
              vacancy rates appeared to level off in the New York, Chicago, and 
              Kansas City districts following months of steady increases. There 
              were also scattered reports in the Chicago district of sublease 
              space being pulled off the market by tenants who had overestimated 
              the extent of the business slowdown.
      </p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Travel and tourism continued to improve, yet remained below year-ago 
            levels in most reporting areas. Richmond and Minnesota reported strong 
            ski seasons in their districts, and Atlanta reported that theme parks 
            in Florida were busy and cruise lines were operating near capacity. 
            New York and Richmond both reported that hotel business had improved. 
            Expectations for the summer travel season were high in most districts. 
            However, Atlanta reported that some contacts fear high fuel costs 
            may limit automobile travel this summer and Kansas City reported that 
            advance bookings at mountain resorts were still trailing year-ago 
            levels.
      <p>
       Activity in other service industries was generally 
              steady. Trucking service firms in the Cleveland district noted a 
              moderate increase in the volume of manufacturing shipments, while 
              Dallas indicated that demand for transportation services was still 
              low relative to past levels. In the Cleveland district, trucking 
              firms' operating margins remained very thin due to high fuel and 
              insurance costs. A media company in the Richmond district reported 
              that ad revenues rose for the first time in over a year, and insurance 
              firms in Boston reported continued high demand for life insurance. 
              Demand for legal services, particularly in the areas of litigation 
              and bankruptcy, increased somewhat in the Dallas district.
      </p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for bank loans held steady or rose modestly in most districts. 
            Banks in the Cleveland, San Francisco and Atlanta districts reported 
            some increase in demand for consumer loans and home-purchase mortgages, 
            while banks in the New York district experienced increased demand 
            for nonresidential mortgages. Demand for business loans was up modestly 
            in the Philadelphia district but flat in other districts. In the Chicago 
            district, banks noted that recent improvements in business sentiment 
            were not translating into increased loan demand. Similarly, banks 
            in the Philadelphia district said their business customers were seeing 
            increased demand but were showing little inclination to take out loans 
            to finance the expansion of facilities. In contrast to home-purchase 
            mortgage lending, mortgage refinancing activity in most districts 
            was down from the high levels reached last year.
      <p>
       Changes in credit quality showed no clear pattern. 
              At banks in the New York district, delinquencies fell for consumer 
              loans and residential mortgages. At banks in the Atlanta district, 
              consumer delinquencies increased but remained manageable. Banks 
              in the Chicago district reported that business loan quality had 
              stabilized following previous deterioration but was still fragile. 
              Banks in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts were still limiting 
              their commercial real estate lending, and banks in the New York 
              district continued to tighten standards for all types of loans except 
              residential mortgages. Otherwise, lending standards were unchanged 
              in those districts reporting on them.

      Activity in the energy sector continued to ease. Despite recent increases 
            in oil and natural gas prices, contacts in the Dallas and Kansas City 
            districts reported that exploration and production activity in the 
            oil and gas sector was contracting while Minneapolis reported flat 
            activity. Kansas City indicated that the higher prices have produced 
            some optimism about future activity. Some producers in the Dallas 
            district also expressed interest in increased future activity, but 
            others were merely taking advantage of increased prices to improve 
            their balance sheets. Outside of the oil and gas industry, Minneapolis 
            reported that activity in the iron ore sector was expanding with the 
            reopening of some shuttered extraction and processing facilities.
      <p>
       In the farm economy, spring weather conditions 
              have adversely affected some areas. Continued low levels of soil 
              moisture in most of the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts 
              have damaged crops, while portions of the Cleveland, Chicago, and 
              St. Louis districts reported excessively wet conditions. Recent 
              cold weather may have also damaged the apple, peach, and strawberry 
              crops in the Richmond district. The winter wheat crop was reported 
              to be doing well in areas with sufficient moisture, including the 
              Cleveland and St. Louis districts, but has been severely damaged 
              in the drought areas of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts. 
              Spring planting is either under way or is expected to begin soon 
              in most districts, with St. Louis and Chicago reporting that more 
              acres are being devoted to corn and fewer to soybeans this year.
      </p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained generally slack. Modest increases in demand 
            for workers in some industries were reported in the New York, Cleveland, 
            Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis districts, but otherwise demand was 
            weak across the nation. San Francisco and Dallas reported that employers 
            still have the advantage in most hiring situations, and firms in the 
            Kansas City district enjoyed a rising number of job applicants and 
            declining turnover rates. The only workers reported as being in short 
            supply in more than one district were those in skilled health care 
            occupations.
      <p>
       Wage pressures, when mentioned, were characterized 
              as minimal. Half of the manufacturers contacted in the Boston district 
              expected to hold wages steady at least until the second half of 
              the year. San Francisco reported that wages were being held back 
              due to significant increases in health care and other insurance 
              premiums. New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas also reported 
              substantial increases in insurance costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Price pressures for consumer goods were 
              generally subdued, and prices for most manufactured goods held steady 
              despite higher costs for steel, fuel, and insurance. Retail prices 
              were essentially flat in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco 
              districts and were flat to down slightly in the Boston district. 
              Retail price pressures in the Chicago district also remained subdued, 
              with price-conscious consumers discouraging retailers from going 
              ahead with planned increases. Steel producers in the Cleveland and 
              Chicago districts raised prices significantly. Despite reports of 
              increasing input costs in some districts, other manufacturers generally 
              held their selling prices constant. Concerns about rising input 
              costs were especially pronounced in the Dallas district, where rising 
              costs for fuel, petroleum-based products, and insurance were said 
              to be adversely affecting many industries.
