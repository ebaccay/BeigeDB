      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 15, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts around the District, the Southeast economy 
continued to expand in early 1995, although reports showed some 
softness as well as strength. Most retailers reported flat February 
sales, but expect a good spring selling season. Tourism remains 
depressed in some areas, but business and convention travel are 
strong. Single-family home building and sales are still slowing, 
although the commercial real estate markets continue to improve. 
District wage and price pressures remain moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers report that late January sales were up on a year-
over-year basis, while February sales were generally flat. According 
to merchants, however, bad weather was mainly responsible for 
February's disappointing performance. Most said that they were 
pleased with current inventory levels. Retailers expect improved 
sales this spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity is characterized by increases in some sectors 
offsetting scale-backs in others. Since the last Beigebook, both 
material and finished goods inventories have increased moderately 
for most firms contacted. Some regional producers report that 
weakness in the Mexican economy is slowing their exports and is 
forcing changes in capital spending plans. In Tennessee, auto 
industry plants are said to be operating at capacity but there is 
concern that any downturn in the national economy would have a quick 
adverse impact. Suppliers to the region's vehicle assembly plants, 
however, remain optimistic about the near-term outlook and expect 
orders to remain strong. Contacts report that both the steel and 
rubber industries in Alabama are doing much better than in the past
few years. Some producers of telecommunications equipment continue 
to report strong activity. Increasing commercial construction is 
stimulating demand at regional firms that fabricate building 
materials, and manufacturers of lumber products report strong sales 
and orders. Paper and paperboard mills are operating at or near 
capacity limitations. One contact, however, thinks that paper 
industry activity is currently peaking and will begin a gradual 
decline over the next few mouths. Although there continues to be 
scattered reports of layoffs by small, niche-oriented apparel firms, 
a few large apparel producers are adding to employment rolls and 
expanding capacity as a result of strong product demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While tourism is slumping in parts of the region, business travel is 
reportedly taking up some of the slack, keeping hotel vacancies at 
low levels. Strong convention activity continues on Mississippi's 
Gulf Coast and in central Florida; advance 1995 bookings for hotels 
in Atlanta are above year-ago levels. Overall, Florida tourism 
remains lackluster, although attendance at major attractions is 
reportedly slowly trending upward. In southern Florida, although 
Central and South American tourism remains strong, visits from other 
areas have not met expectations. Contacts report that this is due in 
part to competition from other destinations. Cruise ship bookings 
out of Miami are down sharply for some firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most real estate contacts in the District report that single-family 
home sales slowed once again and fell below last year's strong 
levels during January and February. However, sales are described as 
respectable in most parts of the region. Realtors attribute the 
continued slowdown to uncertainty on the part of buyers, but most 
anticipate that demand will increase this spring. The majority of 
builders continue to be conservative, and, as a result, some 
realtors are concerned that a short supply of new homes in some 
areas will limit sales. Several areas continue to report a shortage 
of skilled construction workers, but wage pressures have eased from 
earlier in the housing cycle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report 
strengthening markets. Several areas of the District report that 
strong demand is driving apartment construction. Large blocks of 
contiguous office space are reported to be scarce throughout the 
region. However, the majority of commercial construction remains 
build-to-suit with very little speculative space available. Realtors 
continue to be optimistic and anticipate that both commercial and 
multifamily markets will continue to strengthen during 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from bankers around the region about loan demand were mixed. 
Overall loan demand was steady. Home mortgage lending continues to 
slow as the housing sector cools off. Auto lending also has cooled 
appreciably. Consumer lending in general was reported as steady or 
slowing slightly, while commercial loans continue to rise slowly. 
However, several bankers noted that the economy was beginning to 
slow and they expect that a slowing would quickly affect new loan 
generation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing contacts generally report higher prices for materials 
and their own finished goods, but also anticipate less such price 
pressure in the future. Paper, paperboard, and newsprint prices 
continue to rise boosting activity by producers but adversely 
affecting publishers and others who use paper products. Producers of 
building materials, textiles, apparel, furniture, and plastic 
products, report increasing prices paid for raw materials, and more 
of these firms note that they are charging higher finished product 
prices than was the case late last year. Labor availability problems 
and wage pressures are limited to a few parts of the region and do 
not appear to be spreading at this time.
