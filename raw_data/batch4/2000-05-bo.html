      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business contacts in the First District 
              remain upbeat. Retailers indicate their sales are in line with expectations 
              and manufacturers report "solid" increases, with revenues or orders 
              for some sectors or products very strong. Average pay increases 
              remain in the 3 to 5 percent range, with larger increases for information 
              technology workers and increased use of a variety of performance-based 
              pay incentives for a wide range of professional and technical workers. 
              Except for oil-related products, both manufacturers and retailers 
              report little evidence of inflation. While a few manufacturers are 
              raising prices, materials costs and vendor prices are mostly flat 
              and large manufacturers continue to put pressure on their suppliers 
              for price reductions. Recent stock market shifts and interest rate 
              increases are said to be causing modest increases in uncertainty 
              about the outlook.
      <p>
       <b>
        Retail
       </b>
       <br/>
       Retail contacts report sales growth during the January through March 
              period ranging from near-zero to double-digit increases from year-earlier. 
              While these sales results are mostly in line with projections, sellers 
              of apparel came in below expectations. Inventories are at desired 
              levels. Respondents say that generally tight labor markets and acute 
              labor shortages in selected occupations make it difficult to retain 
              permanent staff and to hire replacements. Most retail contacts report 
              that consumer price inflation is nonexistent and that vendor prices 
              are either holding steady or, in the case of technology products, 
              declining. Gross margins are said to be rising slightly because 
              of productivity improvements.
       <p>
        Retail respondents indicate that they plan very 
              little expansion of their operations over the next six months. On 
              the basis of the economy's currently strong fundamentals, most contacts 
              expect steady growth to continue through the year 2000. However, 
              in the furniture and apparel sectors, uncertainty has crept into 
              the outlook for the second half of calendar year 2000.
        <p>
         <b>
          Manufacturing and Related Services
         </b>
         <br/>
         Almost all First District manufacturing contacts report that recent 
              business is up solidly relative to a year earlier. Close to one-half 
              of this month's respondents are experiencing double-digit revenue 
              growth. Companies selling to the semiconductor industry are reporting 
              extremely strong growth in sales and new orders. Manufacturers of 
              computer hardware, automotive equipment, plastics, and medical devices 
              also report vigorous growth. In contrast, makers of industrial equipment 
              continue to indicate that orders are sluggish, although one reports 
              that business from the automotive industry is poised to improve 
              this year. Contacts in a number of industries indicate that foreign 
              sales have accelerated.
         <p>
          Materials costs are largely flat even though many 
              manufacturers are paying more for oil-based products, fuel, and 
              freight. Apart from energy, respondents report few instances of 
              higher quotes and generally they are pressuring their suppliers 
              to hold the line or offer more attractive terms. Manufacturers selling 
              building products, office supplies, plastics products, and selected 
              consumer items have raised prices in the range of 2 to 5 percent. 
              Selling prices are steady or down slightly in the case of information 
              technology companies and those manufacturing equipment related to 
              biotech and semiconductors. Firms making machinery and equipment 
              for the aircraft and automotive industries report continuing pressures 
              to reduce prices.
          <p>
           Except for a few firms that are expanding aggressively 
              to meet rapidly rising demand, most respondents report that employment 
              levels are flat or up slightly. Most employers report average annual 
              pay increases in the range of 3 to 5 percent. However, the average 
              increase is higher at IT firms, and respondents in a variety of 
              industries are reacting to very tight labor markets for professional 
              and technical employees by increasing signing bonuses, stock options, 
              promotion rates, and performance-based compensation. Other responses 
              to tight labor markets include contracting out more engineering 
              and software work (including overseas) and raising expenditures 
              on equipment and information systems.
           <p>
            Various manufacturers mentioned that sharp reductions 
              in stock prices or sharp increases in interest rates could adversely 
              affect the economic climate. However, respondents remain upbeat 
              about their revenue and earnings prospects absent large, unforeseen 
              shocks.
            <p>
             <b>
              Residential Real Estate
             </b>
             <br/>
             Residential real estate markets in New England are "stable," but 
              contacts in all states complain about lack of inventory. Several 
              respondents stated that "there is nothing on the market," and brokers 
              are "desperate." As a result, both single-family homes and condominiums 
              tend to sell very quickly, and many properties receive multiple 
              offers, some above asking prices. The lack of inventory has led 
              to price increases in some areas. Prices in Vermont increased by 
              10 to 15 percent over the year ending in first quarter 2000. However, 
              prices in Rhode Island and Connecticut increased only moderately, 
              and Massachusetts contacts report modest rates of price increase 
              in the first quarter compared to the previous year: 6 to 8 percent 
              (annual rate) as compared to 10 to 15 percent earlier. Most contacts 
              expect market conditions to remain stable in the next few months, 
              although changes in the stock market or in interest rates could 
              bring unexpected changes.
