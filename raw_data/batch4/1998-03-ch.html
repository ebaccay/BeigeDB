      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 18, 1998
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Seventh District's economic expansion picked up modestly in 
January and February, led by increases in consumer spending and 
housing activity. Some contacts, however, suggested that the 
unseasonable strength in retailing and housing early in the first 
quarter may be borrowing from later in the year. Manufacturers 
continued to operate near capacity and strong new orders showed no 
signs of softening. Lending activity picked up as many consumers 
refinanced their existing mortgages. Overall wage pressures remained 
generally subdued despite very tight labor markets and worker 
shortages in some occupations and industries. Credit guarantees 
cushioned any Asian impact on crop exports this winter, but low 
livestock prices triggered heavy operating losses for many District 
farmers.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most District retailers were quite satisfied with sales results in 
January and February. Sales were generally described as above 
expectations and most merchants indicated that this strength was 
broad-based. Unseasonably warm weather in the early part of 1998 
increased traffic through most stores and greatly boosted sales of 
spring items, as well as some other goods. Spring apparel sales were 
doing very well with women's lines particularly strong. Some 
motorcycle dealers in the region credited the effects of El Nino for 
record high sales in January and February, at levels far above their 
seasonal averages. Exceptionally strong housing markets boosted the 
sales of complimentary items, such as furniture, home decor, 
appliances, electronics, and household tools. In addition, the spurt 
in mortgage refinancing activity improved consumers' debt positions, 
which some merchants credited with increasing sales of household and 
home improvement items. Inventories were in good shape, allowing 
most retailers to limit their use of promotional activities and 
concentrate on profit margins.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Housing and Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Overall construction activity picked up moderately in January and 
February, led by a sharp rebound in new housing construction. A 
healthy economy, low mortgage interest rates, and very mild winter 
weather were frequently cited by contacts as factors contributing to 
an unseasonably strong new home market. Most builders described 
sales as exceptional for this time of the year, with one adding
"if builders aren't selling now, they never will!" The strength 
appeared to be broad-based across both geographic and market 
segments. Some builders felt that strong sales this early in the 
year may lead to a slower-than-normal spring rush. This would not be 
entirely unwelcome to builders, given some of the labor shortages 
and materials bottlenecks that have occurred periodically over the 
last few years. Sales of existing homes continued to surprise on the 
upside, with most realtors reporting early 1998 sales results that 
were near record levels for this time of year. Broad-based strength 
in commercial construction activity was also reported, but contacts 
indicated that growth may be slowing in some segments.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Manufacturing activity remained robust in the District with 
virtually every sector running near capacity. Contacts in the heavy 
truck industry indicated that demand was high and production was 
running "full tilt," with only capacity constraints restraining 
stronger growth. The heavy/agricultural equipment and steel 
industries experienced similar strength, with orders booked through 
the second quarter and plants operating near capacity. One large 
steel producer reported having to turn new orders away. Output of 
light vehicles remained very healthy in the region amid continued 
reports of strong sales. There was some concern that momentum in the 
industry was being buoyed by discounting, with one contact noting 
that incentives were at levels normally reserved for the end of
the model year. Inventory levels for most manufacturers were in good 
shape, although they were slightly low for producers of heavy and 
agricultural equipment and slightly high in the auto industry. 
Prices for raw materials continued to show very little movement as 
did product prices. Steel producers were successful in pushing 
through very modest increases, but prices were still below 1994 
levels. A producer of supplies to the construction industry also 
raised prices, but only expected to reap half the announced 
increase. Adverse effects from East Asia's turmoil remained 
generally concentrated in the heavy/agricultural equipment sector. 
There were no reports of these effects spreading or worsening.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Banking and Finance
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Business lending activity was strong throughout the District and the 
consumer segment showed signs of gaining momentum. The unseasonably 
warm weather and low interest rates boosted housing activity and, as 
a result, mortgage originations. The exceptional activity, however, 
was in the refinance market. Every banker contacted reported that 
refinancing activity was up sharply in January and February, with 
one stating that activity was like nothing he's ever seen before. 
Reports indicated that personal delinquencies, repayments on credit 
cards, and bankruptcies were improving. On the commercial side, loan 
activity remained brisk, but loan growth appeared to be slowing. 
Overall asset quality was generally described as good, and improving 
slightly on the consumer side. Some bankers expressed concern that 
fierce competition in the commercial segments may have slightly 
eroded asset quality. Continuing a trend noted in our last report, 
additional contacts indicated that Asian lenders were withdrawing 
from U.S. lending markets as a result of the "Asian Contagion" 
turmoil.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Labor Markets
           </strong>
           <br/>
           In January and February, conditions in the District's labor markets 
changed little from late last year. While unemployment rates 
remained very low and shortages persisted in some industries and 
occupations, wage pressures were relatively unchanged. Construction 
help and information technology workers were most frequently cited 
as being in short supply. Entry-level positions continued to be 
difficult to fill and one contact indicated that this was due, in 
large part, to skill-matching problems. Most businesses indicated 
that growth in base salaries remained relatively subdued (with the 
exception of occupations in short supply, where wage increases were 
more pronounced), while the use of bonuses and other "one-time" 
incentives increased. One analyst noted that businesses were 
becoming ever more creative in their recruiting efforts, with at 
least one firm offering modest weekend trips as an incentive. The 
employment component of purchasing managers' surveys from throughout 
the District all showed sharp increases from January to February as 
well as in year-over-year comparisons. The same trend was evident in 
indexes derived from the volume of help-wanted advertising in local 
newspapers and quarterly hiring plans surveys. One contact cited 
very tight labor markets in Iowa as impeding economic growth in the 
state, and a regional manufacturer indicated that increased use of 
overtime was cutting into the company's profit margins.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Agriculture
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Corn export prospects remain depressed. As of late February, corn 
export commitments (shipments-to-date plus outstanding orders) for 
shipment in the year ending with August were down one-fourth from a 
year ago. Ironically, however, the decline in corn export 
commitments to all Asian markets was no worse than that for all 
other destinations. Late-February soybean export commitments were 
nominally above the year-ago level, but somewhat weaker for Asian 
markets than elsewhere. Export credit guarantee programs offered by 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to hard-hit Asian countries 
helped sustain new corn and soybean commitments to those markets 
during January and February. District livestock farmers experienced 
extensive operating losses this winter. Large meat supplies and weak 
demand, for both domestic consumption and exports, depressed cattle
and hog prices. The losses for pork producers are likely to continue 
for several months.
