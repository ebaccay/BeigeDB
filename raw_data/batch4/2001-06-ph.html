      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia

       June 13, 2001
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall business conditions in the Third District continued to be 
          soft in May. Manufacturers reported further declines in orders and working 
          hours. General merchandise sales were flat compared with April and with 
          May of last year. Auto sales in May were below the same month last year. 
          Bank loan volumes rose moderately during the month. Residential real 
          estate sales slipped, and commercial leasing activity continued to decline.
      <p>
       Businesses contacted for this report generally expect growth to resume 
          sometime during the second half of the year, albeit at a slow pace. 
          Manufacturers expect an increase in orders within the next six months, 
          but they do not plan to extend working hours. Retailers anticipate a 
          slow summer followed by a slight pickup in sales in the fall. Bankers 
          anticipate slight gains in business and consumer lending, but they expect 
          the demand for real estate loans to ease.
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        Third District manufacturing activity continued to decline in May. Although 
          shipments were about steady, the region's manufacturers saw a drop in 
          new orders. The falloff in orders was slight for most firms, but relatively 
          large declines in demand were noted by several producers of transportation 
          equipment, industrial machinery, and industrial materials. Firms that 
          supply the telecommunications industry with a variety of products generally 
          reported weak demand from that sector. Overall, manufacturers trimmed 
          working hours and reduced employment. Although capital spending plans 
          at area plants call for stepped-up outlays in the second half of the 
          year, on balance the increase will be slight.
        <p>
         Manufacturers indicated that, except for fuels and electricity, prices 
          were steady in May. Firms contacted during the month indicated that 
          slow demand and foreign competition were keeping most input and output 
          prices in check. But rising fuel prices were cited by many firms as 
          a deterrent to expanded sales, especially of motor vehicles and construction 
          equipment.
         <p>
          Manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the next 
          six months. Firms in nearly all of the major manufacturing sectors in 
          the region forecast higher demand for their products in the second half 
          of the year. The exceptions are apparel producers, who anticipate a 
          drop in orders, and producers of chemicals, transportation equipment, 
          and industrial materials, who expect steady order rates. Despite the 
          forecasted increase in business, area manufacturers project no rise 
          in order backlogs, and they do not plan to extend working hours during 
          the next six months.
          <p>
           <b>
            Retail
           </b>
           <br/>
           Retail sales in the Third District were virtually flat during May. Sales 
          were also level compared with last year. Although sales rose slightly 
          at some discount stores, sales at other types of stores were off. Merchants 
          indicated that a period of cool, wet weather hampered sales of summer 
          clothes and other seasonal merchandise. Sales of big-ticket items have 
          been slow as well. Retailers generally reported continuing low levels 
          of store traffic and spending per shopper. Many stores have stepped 
          up discounting to boost sales.
           <p>
            Store executives generally anticipate a slow summer. Most of those 
          contacted for this report expect a slight pickup in the fall, and they 
          have planned their purchasing accordingly. However, several store executives 
          said they are prepared to cut or cancel orders if sales do not turn 
          up.
            <p>
             Auto dealers indicated that sales ran at a nearly steady pace during 
          May but below the rate posted in May of last year. Manufacturers' incentives 
          remain extensive, and dealers said that rebates and low-cost financing 
          were necessary to keep sales from slipping further.
             <p>
              <b>
               Finance
              </b>
              <br/>
              Total loan volume outstanding at Third District banks rose moderately 
          in May. Bank lending officers said most of the growth has been in credit 
          card loans and residential mortgages. Other types of consumer lending, 
          such as auto loans and home improvement loans, have declined. Mortgage 
          refinancing activity has been strong, but most of the bankers contacted 
          for this report said demand for refinancing has begun to ease. Growth 
          in commercial and industrial lending has been slight, although some 
          bankers noted a recent pickup in business loan demand, mainly from existing 
          customers.
              <p>
               Bankers in the Third District expect overall loan volumes to increase 
          slightly during the second half of the year. They anticipate slow growth 
          in business lending and modest gains in consumer loans, but a decline 
          in residential mortgage activity. Some bankers expressed concern that 
          credit quality could slip during the rest of the year if overall economic 
          conditions do not improve, but they do not anticipate a significant 
          deterioration in either business or consumer loan portfolios.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Real Estate and Construction
                </b>
                <br/>
                There has been some softening in Third District commercial real estate 
          markets in the past two months. The vacancy rate for office buildings 
          has been steady in the Philadelphia central business district, but the 
          vacancy rate has moved up in some suburban markets. An increasing amount 
          of space in these markets has been offered for sublease by Internet-related 
          firms. Average quoted rental rates in the region have been steady, but 
          landlord allowances have increased, reducing effective rental costs. 
          However, this decrease in rents is being partially offset by some landlords 
          who are charging new tenants for electricity instead of including this 
          expense in rental charges. Demand for industrial space has eased somewhat, 
          but rental rates have been steady. Commercial construction activity 
          has been decreasing, and sales and leasing activity have eased. Contacts 
          in the region's commercial real estate sector expect markets to remain 
          slow for the rest of the year.
                <p>
                 Residential real estate agents generally indicated that sales of existing 
          homes have slowed recently. Homebuilders reported that sales declined 
          during May. For both existing and new homes, the slowdown has been sharper 
          in the higher price ranges. House prices have been close to steady for 
          both new and existing homes. Real estate agents and builders indicated 
          that the inventory of homes for sale has been running close to or a 
          little below demand. Due to the relatively tight inventory, homes have 
          been selling quickly and at asking prices.
