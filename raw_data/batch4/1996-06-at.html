      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from contacts in the District suggest that the 
Southeast economy continued to grow at a moderate pace during May. 
Retail sales largely met retailers expectations, with real sales 
apparently exceeding year-ago levels. Overall, manufacturing 
performance was mixed in May, although the outlook among 
manufacturers improved. Tourism and business travel continue to grow 
vigorously throughout the District, and this summer is expected to 
be especially strong. District Realtors report single-family home 
sales beat year-ago levels in May, while reports on home building 
compared to a year ago were mixed. Commercial and multifamily 
construction continued to increase. Bankers characterized overall 
loan demand as flat to slightly up. Wage pressures were reported in 
several parts of the region, especially for entry-level, low skill 
jobs. Some industries report higher materials and product prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to District retailers, real sales 
increased modestly as same-store sales during May met or, more 
generally, exceeded, year-ago levels, even with the entry of many 
new competitors. Sales largely met expectations for the month. 
Inventories are said to be on target throughout most of the 
District. Apparel and cosmetic products were strong sellers across 
the District, while previously strong home-related product sales 
were mixed. Looking forward to summer, most managers anticipate 
sales will grow modestly in real terms over last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers in the Southeast report mixed activity 
in May following an uptick the previous month. Plant production and 
the volume of new orders was said to have generally weakened, while 
materials inventories increased moderately. An increasing number of 
contacts noted declining employment rolls recently, although most 
continue to report steady payrolls. Looking ahead. however, reports 
indicated new orders for export mostly picked up modestly, and the 
outlook for production, orders, and capital expenditures, reportedly 
improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto component suppliers in the region reported a shrinking factory 
workweek and slowing production because of mixed auto production 
schedules. Some producers of heavy duty trucks are trimming factory 
payrolls. Apparel producers continue to report intense competition 
from both here and abroad, resulting in further layoffs and 
excessive inventory accumulations. Industrial machine and electrical 
equipment producers say that markets are weakening following a 
period of strong growth. More positively, production, orders, and 
exports are improving for some pulp producers. Building product 
fabricators and manufacturers of household appliances report that 
employment is growing, and some plants are running at capacity 
because of strong markets. Steel mini-mills continue to expand in 
the region because of increased product demand and capacity 
constraints. And, a medical equipment manufacturer reports that 
order backlogs are growing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The tourism and convention sectors 
continue to boost the region's economy; industry contacts expect an 
especially strong summer. In central Florida, hotels are 
experiencing high occupancy rates, and theme parks are posting 
strong gains in attendance over last year. South Florida tourism 
officials note a healthy second quarter with modest growth from 
European and South American markets. Summer advance bookings at 
south Florida destination resorts are ahead of last year. Gambling 
revenues in Mississippi continue to grow, rising over 10 percent 
from a year ago for the first four months of this year. The opening 
of a new mega-casino in the state, employing 3,600 workers by the 
end of June, is expected to further boost state revenues. Atlanta's 
Hartsfield International Airport continues to post double digit 
gains in passenger traffic compared to last year as the Olympic 
Games draw near.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most real estate contacts reported that single-family 
home sales were ahead of year-ago levels in May, and existing homes 
were selling much better than new homes. Builders and Realtors 
reported that inventory levels are adequate except in Nashville, 
where inventories remain tight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts reported that home prices are stable, however, several 
indicated that new home prices were on the rise because of increases 
in both labor and material prices. The sales outlook among District 
Realtors remained optimistic, while building contacts were more 
cautious in their outlook for the remainder of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts from across the District report that commercial and 
multifamily real estate markets continue to improve. Low vacancy 
rates and higher rents continue to propel new industrial and office 
development. While most commercial projects continue to be build-to-
suit, several speculative developments are underway and more are 
anticipated this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the banking industry described overall loan 
demand as flat to slightly up in May from April and this period last 
year. Consumer lending was reported as stronger than last month and 
steady to slightly stronger than last year. Some strengthening was 
noted in autos. Commercial lending was said to be constant over both 
periods. Mortgage lending was flat to slightly up in May over last 
month and a year ago, with interest rate differentials propelling a 
general migration from fixed to adjustable rate mortgages. Lenders 
expect their mortgage activity will fall off during the rest of the 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts again report instances of wage pressures 
in parts of the region. Some retailers and service sector employers 
note that the labor supply is tightening, especially for low skill, 
or entry-level type jobs. In Atlanta, intense demand during the 
Olympics is raising wages for entry-level and temporary workers this 
summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts report that prices for raw materials and output have 
increased marginally recently. Material price increases were noted 
by producers of packaging, plastics, apparel, machinery, and steel. 
Prices received are increased for producers of pulp wood, plastics, 
and some metals, according to factory contacts. Further out, 
material and finished goods prices are generally expected by 
contacts in the manufacturing sector to escalate moderately.
