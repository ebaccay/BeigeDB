      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 19, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic 
activity continued to advance at a moderate pace in May and early 
June. Nearly all districts report expanding activity, and several 
indicate the pace of growth accelerated recently. The retail and 
service industries generally strengthened, and manufacturing 
activity improved in several districts. Residential and commercial 
construction activity also picked up in most districts, although wet 
weather hampered homebuilding in some areas. Loan demand increased 
in most districts, despite a decline in mortgage lending. In the 
natural resource industries, agriculture was hurt in several 
districts by unfavorable weather and low cattle prices, while energy 
activity increased in regions producing oil and natural gas.Several districts note rising prices for some raw and intermediate 
products, especially building materials, petroleum products, and 
grain. Evidence of rising prices for retail products, however, was 
much less widespread. Most districts continued to report tight labor 
markets for both entry-level and skilled workers, although 
indications of rising wages remained scattered.
      <strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales strengthened in nearly all districts, with sales 
generally exceeding year-ago levels. The only exceptions were the 
Boston and New York districts. In the Boston district, retailers 
indicated that recent sales were disappointing, especially in off-
price discount stores, but they were generally optimistic about 
sales prospects during the remainder of the year. In the New York 
district, sales slowed slightly in early June after exceeding 
expectations in May.Recent sales gains followed normal seasonal patterns in most 
districts. Retailers in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas districts report strong sales of 
seasonal items such as air conditioners, men's and women's apparel, 
and lawn and garden products. In the Cleveland and Chicago 
districts, however, unusually wet weather slowed sales of home 
improvement products and other seasonal items.Automobile sales remained strong in most districts. Dealers in the 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis districts attribute part of 
the recent sales strength to various sales incentive programs. Some 
popular models were in short supply in the Cleveland and Kansas City 
districts. The Philadelphia district, however, reports weak sales of 
heavy trucks.
      <strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity improved in several regions, while pockets of 
weakness remained in some districts. Districts reporting generally 
improved manufacturing activity include Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, 
and San Francisco. Reports from the Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. 
Louis districts indicate manufacturing activity was uneven or flat.Activity improved in a wide range of industries. Both consumer and 
capital-goods industries improved in the Boston district. In the 
Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco districts, industrial machine 
and tool manufacturing strengthened. Construction-related industries 
were strong in the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Conditions in 
the oil field equipment industry improved in the Dallas district.Some districts report weak spots in manufacturing activity, however. 
In the Boston district, demand for hospital equipment was weak, 
reportedly due to lower cost health care plans. The heavy truck and 
construction equipment industries remained soft in the Cleveland and 
Chicago districts. In the Dallas district, the semiconductor 
industry remained weak, due to a slump in demand for computers and 
related products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service activity continued to expand in districts reporting on this 
  sector. In the Boston district, demand for temporary workers 
  continued to strengthen. Service producers in the Richmond district 
  indicate that employment rose in May, although revenues declined 
  slightly. The San Francisco district reports strong demand for 
  computer-related services, telecommunications, and long-distance 
  trucking. The tourism industry remained robust. The New York district reports 
  hotel occupancy in New York City remained at a 16-year high. In the 
  Richmond district, tourism activity picked up in May despite wet 
  weather. The Atlanta district reports strong gains in attendance at 
  Florida hotels and theme parks and rising gambling revenues in 
  Mississippi. Also, the approaching Olympic Games have apparently 
  boosted passenger traffic at Atlanta's Hartsfield International 
  Airport. In the Minneapolis district, the tourism industry holds 
  optimistic expectations for the summer, even though the season's 
  start was delayed by cold, wet weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity generally strengthened in most 
    districts, including New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, 
    Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Signs of 
    sluggishness emerged in some districts, however. Housing sales 
    slowed in some parts of the Boston and New York districts. Builders 
    in the Richmond district report declining buyer interest in new 
    homes, although housing sales rose. In the Chicago district, wet 
    weather slowed homebuilding and sales, but builders expected a 
    stronger third quarter.Commercial real estate activity continued to improve in most 
    districts. The Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta districts report 
    declining office vacancy rates, higher rents, and gains in 
    commercial construction activity. The Minneapolis district reports 
    solid gains in contracts for large projects. In the Dallas district, 
    the tightest supply of suburban office space in a decade was pushing 
    up rents. A few districts report a weakening in commercial activity. 
    The New York district reports office vacancy rates edged up in New 
    York City in May. In the St. Louis district, commercial construction 
    slowed in some areas of Tennessee and Arkansas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall loan demand rose in most districts, although demand for 
      commercial loans and consumer loans varied among the districts. 
      Demand for commercial and industrial loans was strong in the New 
      York, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts, and 
      was flat to down slightly in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
      Atlanta, and St. Louis districts. Demand for consumer loans was 
      strong in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, 
      and Dallas districts, and flat to down slightly in the New York, 
      Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts. The Cleveland 
      and Chicago districts report intense competition among lenders. 
      Mortgage lending and refinancing declined in most districts. In the 
      Boston district, assets managed and employment at investment 
      management firms strengthened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture was hurt in several districts by unfavorable weather and 
        low cattle prices. Wet weather delayed the planting of spring crops 
        and slowed crop development in the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, 
        Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts. The Cleveland and Chicago 
        districts report that more favorable weather recently enabled corn 
        and soybean planting to progress. Recent rains improved crop 
        conditions in some parts of the Richmond district. The wet weather 
        arrived too late in the Kansas City district, however, to avert an 
        expected sharp decline in winter wheat production caused by drought 
        earlier in the year. In the Dallas district, drought sharply reduced 
        the expected size of the winter wheat crop and trimmed pasture and 
        forage supplies. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San 
        Francisco districts report unfavorable conditions in the livestock 
        industry, due to low cattle prices and high feed costs.Energy activity improved somewhat in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, 
        and Dallas districts, despite declining energy prices. The 
        Minneapolis district reports stronger iron mining activity and mixed 
        conditions in the forest products industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices advanced for some raw and intermediate materials in several 
          districts, especially for building materials, petroleum-based 
          products, and agricultural commodities. Evidence of rising prices 
          for finished products and at the retail level was less widespread. 
          The Boston, Kansas City, and Dallas districts report higher prices 
          for building materials, including lumber. Prices for packaging 
          materials, some plastics, machinery, and steel were up in the 
          Atlanta district. Higher wheat prices pushed up flour prices in the 
          Minneapolis district, but otherwise had little effect on retail food 
          prices. Manufacturers in the Boston and Richmond districts report 
          rising product prices, but flat to slightly lower materials prices. 
          In the St. Louis district, some manufacturers report difficulty in
          raising product prices due to highly competitive markets. Retail 
          prices held steady in the Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City 
          districts and rose more slowly in May than in April in the Richmond 
          district. Retailers in the New York district, however, indicated 
          that a decline in price discounting was boosting effective retail 
          prices. Most districts continued to report tight labor markets for both 
          entry-level and skilled workers. The Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, 
          and Kansas City districts report a tight market for retail workers. 
          In the Boston and Chicago districts, the number of temporary workers 
          shifting to permanent assignments was increasing. Markets for 
          skilled laborers remained tight in the Chicago, St. Louis, 
          Minneapolis and Kansas City districts. The Boston district reports 
          that a tight local labor market has prompted area businesses to 
          recruit professional workers from other parts of the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of rising wages are scattered, despite widespread tightness 
in labor markets. The Boston district reports rising wages in 
manufacturing. In the St. Louis district, some fast-food 
establishments offer wages above the minimum wage and include a 
signing bonus. The approaching Olympic Games were pushing up entry-level wages in the Atlanta district.
