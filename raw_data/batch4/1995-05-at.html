      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 10, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Overview
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to most contacts in the District, the deceleration in the 
pace of growth in the region was becoming more evident. Retailers 
generally said sales were flat during March, but that they picked up 
in April. Comments from manufacturers were mixed, with some increase 
from earlier in the year in the number of those indicating a 
deceleration. Business travel is said to be up on a year-over-year 
basis, offsetting some weakness in tourism. Real estate contacts 
report that single-family home sales and construction continue to 
cool throughout the region, while activity in commercial and 
multifamily markets is still rising. Reports on prices and wages 
suggest that pressures remain moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported that sales during March were restrained by a late 
Easter season but improved during April. Inventory levels are 
generally deemed in good shape, although a few contacts note that 
they have begun to rise by more than they would like. Most retailers 
anticipate a good, but slowing, second quarter as compared to the 
first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from manufacturers suggest, on balance, a deceleration in 
growth that is becoming more generalized. Some firms linked to 
residential construction note slowing production and sales. Carpet 
production is down from a year ago at some regional plants and slack 
demand has forced layoffs. Producers of roofing products and 
concrete blocks point to slowing orders, while shipments have 
declined for cabinet manufacturers. A large producer of industrial 
equipment and machinery reports declines in both shipments and in 
the workweek, although new orders for export have recently picked 
up. Layoffs by military contractors continue to adversely affect the 
region, especially in Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other industrial respondents, however, report ongoing or new 
strength. Apparel contacts indicate that the two-year decline in 
employment at District plants has slowed. Denim production continues 
to increase, with a jeans manufacturer saying they are booked up 
through the end of the year. There are scattered reports of apparel 
producers adding to capacity. The weakness of the dollar is said to 
be generating significant increases in exports for Louisiana's 
chemical industry. Contacts report that the region's paper industry 
continues to do well. Tire producers say they are running at 
capacity and have shortages of some key materials such as carbon 
black. Steel plants in Alabama are said to be aggressively adding to 
capacity in response to strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although international travel is down for key parts of Florida and 
the baseball strike hurt March hotel business, domestic business 
travel is currently boosting occupancy at Florida hotels and in the 
rest of the region. Travel officials note a serious decline in south 
Florida tourism, which they attribute to the decline in the Mexican 
peso. Cruise companies out of Miami report a huge drop-off of 
bookings. In the wake of the dollar's decline, the number of 
international tourists visiting New Orleans has increased 
dramatically and local tour companies are reporting revenue gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to real estate contacts, single-family home sales and 
building continued to slow within the District during March and 
early April. Realtors continue to attribute the slowdown to 
uncertainty on the part of buyers despite a recent decline in 
mortgage rates. Several builders reported that new home inventories 
have begun to increase, and some added that inventories are 
uncomfortably high. However, most contacts remain optimistic that 
sales will pick up during the next couple of months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report 
improving markets throughout the District. Several developers 
indicate that strong demand is driving multifamily construction; 
however, some are concerned that the pace of development within 
their market will lead to oversupply. Most contacts are optimistic 
and anticipate that both commercial and multifamily markets will 
continue to strengthen during 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers report that overall loan demand is moderate. Commercial 
demand is growing, and was generally reported to be stronger than 
consumer loan demand. Many contacts said there was strong 
competition on the commercial side, as institutions compete to give 
borrowers the best deals. Home mortgage lending continues below last 
year's levels, but some lenders noted increased activity in recent 
weeks. Auto finance is reported to be holding steady at levels lower 
than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts indicate that wage and price pressures around the District 
are generally moderate. Compared to the last Beigebook, fewer 
manufacturers report receiving higher prices for their own finished 
products, and fewer expect to receive higher output prices in the 
near future; however, they continue to say they are facing price 
pressures for materials. Building material contacts note that prices 
are falling and inventories are up in some locations because of a 
housing slowdown. However, producers of transportation equipment, 
rubber, plastic, paper, and textile goods report rising prices of 
raw materials. Wage increases were said to be stable in most of the 
District, and reports of labor shortages continue to be confined 
mainly to parts of Tennessee.
