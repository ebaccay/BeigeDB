      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 6, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Restrained in part by generally weak retail sales, the Eleventh 
District economy continued to follow a path of moderate expansion 
over the last six weeks. Retailers were optimistic going into the 
holiday season, but their hopes were dashed by lower-than-expected 
sales during the initial holiday rush. District loan demand 
increased since the last beige book, boosted by continued 
improvement in real estate markets. Manufacturing orders were mostly 
unchanged, with continued strong demand for electronics but flat to 
softer demand for other products. Demand for business services rose 
at a strong pace, but there were a few hints of slower growth. 
Transportation services were unchanged except for a seasonal pickup 
in demand. Conditions in energy markets were mostly the same as 
reported in the last beige book, except for a cold snap in the 
Northeast and Midwest that boosted energy prices in late November.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although price pressures were minimal, there were more reports of 
wage pressures in this beige book survey than in the last one. 
Manufacturing contacts reported scattered labor shortages for 
mechanics, electricians and machinists that were pushing up wages. 
Contacts in the electronics industry said they were heavily 
recruiting engineers and software developers. In the services 
industry, respondents noted a tighter labor market for long-haul 
truckers and top-tier legal and accounting graduates. Several 
district contacts said there was a short supply of quality unskilled 
workers that was driving up entry-level wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, orders for Eleventh District manufacturing were mostly 
unchanged from the last beige book report. Demand for electronics-
including semiconductors, computers and communications equipment-
continued to rise strongly, and backlogs were reportedly rising. 
Contacts said orders for most construction-related products held 
steady, except for concrete and cement producers who reported higher 
demand. Orders for paper products and corrugated boxes continued to 
soften, and respondents said selling prices were dropping from 
extremely high levels. Apparel contacts said demand continued to 
weaken because of soft retail conditions in recent months. Contacts 
in the food industry continued to report slower demand, but remained 
optimistic in their outlook. Petrochemical inventories were reported 
to be stabilizing after rising for much of the past quarter. A 
Chinese embargo on petrochemicals was cited as a source of concern. 
Refiners said they were between seasons, and noted slack demand for 
products in October and the first part of November. Demand for oil 
services and machinery remained unchanged at good levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, demand for business sinless continued to rise at a strong 
pace. There were some hints of slight slowing among legal, 
accounting and consulting firms that was attributed to weakness 
along the Texas/Mexico border and a leveling off after a hot first 
half. Contacts in the business services industry were positive about 
current conditions and remained optimistic in their outlook for 
1996. Hiring rose among temporary, legal and accounting firms, and 
several respondents reported a tighter labor market for entry-level 
employees and top-tier graduates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the transportation services industry reported a pickup 
in demand that was strictly seasonal in nature. Several respondents 
in the cargo industry cited heavy competition and an unstable 
Mexican economy as continued sources of weakness. Most respondents 
were cautious in their outlooks and were concerned that holiday 
demand would not be as heavy as last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in the Eleventh District remained sluggish, according 
to most contacts. After a dismal October, retailers were slightly 
more optimistic going unto the holiday season, but were disappointed 
with the initial holiday surge. Department store and discount chain 
contacts in the district said holiday sale were below expectation 
and were weaker than national sales. Sales along the Texas/Mexico 
border remained depressed. Auto sales rose in November, and contacts 
said much of the strong demand was a result of good financing terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District financial institutions reported increased loan 
demand, with strong demand for business and commercial real estate 
loans. Residential real estate loan demand was about even with 
levels reported in the last beige book, but contacts raid it was 
above last year's levels. Respondents were more optimistic in their 
outlooks for 1996, mostly due to expected increases in business, 
consumer and commercial and residential real estate loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate conditions continued to improve in the Eleventh 
District. Contacts cited strong demand for industrial and warehouse 
space, especially along the Texas/Mexico border. Demand for office 
space also continued to edge up, and several respondents noted a 
lack of available space in high-tech suburban areas. Despite high 
vacancies in downtown Dallas and Houston, contacts were optimistic 
that office rents would continue to rise. In addition, contacts said 
that sales of new and existing homes were stronger.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in energy markets were about the same as reported in the 
last beige book report, except for a recent weather-related run-up 
in prices for natural gas and oil products. Natural gas spot prices 
rose from $1.70 per thousand cubic feet in mid-October to $2.10 per 
thousand cubic feet by late November. Heating oil inventories were 
reported to be 10 percent below last year's levels, and wholesale 
prices rose by five cents per gallon as colder weather hit the 
Midwest and East Coast. Cold weather also pushed crude oil prices 
slightly above $18 per barrel. For the previous five months crude 
prices had been hovering mostly between $17 and $18 per barrel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dry weather has impeded the growth of small grain crops, according 
to agriculture respondents. Livestock condition were reported as 
good, although prices for beef cattle continued to decrease. 
Overall, the Texas All Farm Products Price Index fell 1 percent in 
October, as rising crop prices were outweighed by declining 
livestock price.
