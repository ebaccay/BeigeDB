      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 17, 1999
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy continued to expand in February and 
early March, with some sectors reporting stronger activity than in 
the last beige book. Retailers said sales growth was stronger than 
expected, and some manufacturing sectors reported improved sales. 
Real estate activity picked up, but there continued to be some 
concerns about overbuilding, particularly apartments. Business 
service firms reported little change in activity overall. Most 
financial institutions reported a strong start to 1999, with the 
exception of banks lending to the agricultural and energy 
industries. Drilling activity continued to plunge, reducing demand 
for energy service and manufacturing firms. Dry conditions remain a 
concern for agricultural producers, with many farmers and ranchers 
still in serious financial jeopardy after last summer's drought and 
low commodity prices.
      <p>
       <b>
        Prices
       </b>
       <br/>
       There continued to be more reports of price declines than price 
increases. Finding qualified workers remains a problem for most 
industries, with many contacts reporting higher wages. Crude oil 
prices stayed between $11 and $13 over the past six weeks, and there 
was no indication that the glut of crude and oil products was 
anywhere near an end. Distressed oil companies are selling existing 
reserves to reduce debt, and the availability of these low-cost 
reserves is discouraging drilling. With the end of the heating 
season approaching, high inventories and continued warm weather 
pushed down heating oil and natural gas prices. Heating oil prices 
fell below 30 cents per gallon, but returned to 33 cents per gallon 
by the end of February as refiners pulled unprofitable capacity off 
line. Heating oil inventories are 17 percent above last year's 
levels. Wellhead natural gas prices fell from $1.85 to $1.65 per 
thousand cubic feet during the month of February. Retailers said 
selling prices were mostly unchanged, and some contacts 
expect apparel price reductions in the Spring. A number of 
maintenance outages led to a drop in ethylene inventories and 
chemical operators announced price increases, but large capacity 
increases are scheduled in coming months, so price increases are 
expected to be short-term at best. Prices have increased slightly 
for many types of semiconductor chips, but continue to decline for 
telecommunications equipment.
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        Some manufacturing sectors reported improved sales growth, but 
energy-related and most apparel manufacturers continued to 
hemorrhage. Conditions in the semiconductor industry continued to 
improve, with contacts reporting that the outlook for prices and 
sales improved significantly. World inventory of the consumer 
products that use chips has dwindled and demand in Asia has begun to 
recover, according to one source. Another respondent noted that 
several of the smaller producers of memory chips have left the 
market, resulting in reduced production. Telecommunications 
manufacturers reported solid gains in demand and a
strong outlook over the next year. Food manufacturers said demand 
remains good, with no signs of weakening. Metals producers report a 
pick up in demand. Brick and concrete producers reported 
continued strong sales, boosted by housing starts, low interest 
rates and commercial building. Demand for industrial paper products 
was strong, but demand for boxes was weaker than expected. Demand 
for lumber products softened over the past month and is lower than a 
year ago, although contacts expect a modest rebound. Refiners have 
taken capacity off line, and operating rates have fallen by 4 
percent to 5 percent. Apparel manufacturers reported weaker sales 
and layoffs, mostly because of intense competition from cheaper imports.
        <p>
         <b>
          Services
         </b>
         <br/>
         Business service firms reported little change in activity overall. 
Demand for legal services was down from a year ago, in part because 
of slower demand for transactional work such as real estate 
services. Contacts reported an increase in trial and litigation 
work, however, and continued strong demand for legal services 
related to the high tech industry and intellectual property rights, 
patents and trademarks. Temporary service firms reported little 
change in activity over the past month, with strong demand from 
telecommunications firms, call centers, and banks. Demand for 
temporary workers for manufacturing and defense was weaker and 
"pitiful" for oil industry workers. Transportation firms reported 
that activity was mostly stronger than expected.
         <p>
          <b>
           Retail Sales
          </b>
          <br/>
          Retailers said sales activity was stronger than expected in 
February. All types of products were selling well, particularly 
spring merchandise and home goods, such as appliances and furniture. 
Retail contacts were in good spirits, noting that consumers appeared 
to be feeling comfortable. One contact attributed the strength of 
sales growth to an increase in tax refunds. Auto sales were also up, 
with good demand for trucks and sports utility vehicles. Inventories 
are tight for some of these vehicles, in part because inventories 
are still recovering from the GM strike.
          <p>
           <b>
            Financial Services
           </b>
           <br/>
           Most financial institutions reported a strong first two months of 
1999. Auto lending, home equity refinancing and deposit growth all 
showed signs of strength, according to bankers. Credit quality and 
delinquency rates remained stable. The only contacts who were not 
positive were those with high levels of lending to the energy sector 
and financial institutions in rural areas, who are seeing trouble 
with agricultural loans.
           <p>
            <b>
             Construction and Real Estate
            </b>
            <br/>
            Real estate activity picked up in late February and early March, 
after a slowdown in January and early February. There continues to 
be no speculative construction, however. Sales of existing homes 
were exceptionally strong. Office occupancy rates are expected to 
fall by 1 to 3 percentage points this year, because contacts expect 
a high level of office completions and slower office leasing. Office 
and apartment rent concessions continued to be reported in some 
markets, and contacts still express concerns about some 
overbuilding, particularly apartments. Industrial construction was 
slower but leasing activity was steady.
            <p>
             <b>
              Energy
             </b>
             <br/>
             Low oil prices, large inventories, and concerns that broader 
structural changes are afoot, are all contributing to a serious 
decline in drilling activity. Domestic drilling has fallen 23 of the 
last 25 weeks, and contacts do not believe the rig count has 
bottomed out. Demand for energy services has declined with the rig 
count. Demand for pipe, machinery and equipment has fallen more than 
the rig count because a lot of rigs are being idled, providing a 
ready supply of cheap spare parts. Offshore drilling had been 
holding up well, but contacts say some shallow-water rigs are being 
taken out of service as well. Unlike oil prices, natural gas prices 
remain high enough to provide some incentive for drilling.
             <p>
              <b>
               Agriculture
              </b>
              <br/>
              Many of the region's agricultural producers remain in serious 
financial jeopardy. Agricultural bankers reported that farmers and 
ranchers continue to have difficulty repaying loans because of last 
summer's drought and low commodity prices, and producers continue to 
leave the business. There is concern about the current lack of 
moisture, and some farmers have delayed planting while waiting for 
rain. The lack of rainfall has stressed pastures in many areas, and 
supplemental feeding has been steady. Growth of small grains was 
slow, but mild temperatures allowed fields to stay green.
