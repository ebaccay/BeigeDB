      Beige Book Report: Chicago

       January 17, 1996
      </strong>

     <strong>
      Summary
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The Seventh District's economy expanded at a modest pace 
through December, continuing a pattern of slowing economic growth in 
recent months. Most retailers reported a "disappointing" holiday 
season despite a surge in consumer spending toward the end of 
December. Harsh weather in December slowed real estate transactions, 
but District sources maintain that the market remains strong and are 
very optimistic for the new year. Despite weakness in auto-related 
industries, overall manufacturing activity rebounded slightly after 
slowing in October and November. Banking contacts suggested that 
December's consumer and business loans continued to grow but at a 
slower pace than in November. Labor markets remained tight 
throughout the District with few signs of softening.
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite retail sales showing improvement throughout 
December, a majority of District contacts reported that sales were 
below their expectations. Competition continued to be quite intense, 
and aggressive promotional activity and price reductions were needed 
to boost sales. Mall sales in particular appeared to do better than 
other types of retailing, with "one-stop shopping" being cited as a 
primary reason for increased sales this year. One general manager of 
a suburban mail reported double-digit sales growth (year-over-year), 
although these results were viewed as much higher than other mails 
in the area. Several retail contacts stated that sales results 
regionally were roughly comparable with national results. However, 
one major retail chain reported that sales gains in the Midwest 
region were above the store-wide average, noting that bad weather in 
early December actually boosted auto parts-related sales. Overall 
inventories for this retailer were viewed as within plan at year-
end. A mail-order merchandiser also reported inventories at 
satisfactory levels. However, a District banker expressed concern 
that some of their retail customers were carrying heavier-than-
planned inventories.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Housing/Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The housing market remained strong through the 
fourth quarter and first week of January despite severe winter 
weather. Both new and existing home sales experienced a normal 
seasonal slowdown from November to December. Existing home sales 
were stronger than expected in November, but several realtors in the 
District noted an extraordinary number of cancellations of showings 
in December due to the weather. However, they also reported that 
buyers were back out in force in early January. All realtors 
contacted reported that buyers outnumber sellers in their markets 
and one realtor expressed concern of losing buyers because "the 
right home isn't on the market." A December survey of homebuilders 
suggested continued strength in the District's new home market as 
well as continued optimism for the next six months. Commercial 
activity was strong in December and early January, according to 
several District sources, with notable strength on the industrial 
side. Moreover, December's office vacancy rates in most metropolitan 
areas fell in year-over-year comparisons.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturing facilities generally continued 
operating at high levels over the last six to eight weeks, but 
weakening activity was noticeable in auto-related industries. The 
Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee purchasing managers surveys for 
December all indicated expanding orders and production. However, the 
auto component of Detroit's survey and purchasing managers surveys 
for western Michigan showed contracting activity. An energy supplier 
to southern Michigan reported a decline in year-over-year sales to 
industrial customers, mainly auto-based companies. Several auto 
suppliers reported that order intake rates for December were flat to 
down from the previous month, after accounting for normal seasonal 
variations. However, a diversified producer of capital goods in the 
District stated that orders increased in most of their market 
segments, with the exception of material handling. A steel producer 
reported that order rates at integrated mills were coming in quite 
strong, mostly for structural steel. Several steel producers 
attribute the recent pickup in demand to steel service centers 
restocking their inventories. New mini-mill capacity expected in the 
first quarter of 1996 may take market share away from both imports 
and integrated mills. Moreover, recently announced price increases 
for sheet steel are not expected to hold once the new mini-mill 
capacity is available.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Banking
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Contacts around the District reported that lending activity 
finished the year strong, but several bankers noted a distinct 
slowdown in the last six weeks. On the consumer side, mortgage 
lending remained at high levels and most sources reported a sharp 
increase in refinancing activity in December. While overall levels 
remained quite low by most standards, one banker cited an increase 
in consumer delinquencies and bankruptcies. Business loan demand 
remained generally strong but growth appeared to be leveling off. A 
widely cited source of softening loan demand was auto-related 
industries. However, several major regional banks reported 
accelerating lending activity in those areas of the District with 
strong local economies. Bank contacts noted that virtually all 
industrial lending was for new investment with little evidence of an 
increase in inventory financing.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Labor markets
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Labor markets remained tight through December 
although some ebbing of demand for retail and auto-related workers 
was evident. The greatest concern of most contacts continued to be 
labor shortages. Several placement specialists report that unfilled 
orders for both permanent and temporary help remained 
extraordinarily high in the fourth quarter, with shortages broad-
based across occupations and industries. A regional manager of a 
fast-food restaurant chain reported that labor shortages remain 
prevalent and that wage-related margin pressures were just starting 
to lead to higher consumer prices. Auto-related and retail trade 
industries showed some signs of softening demand for labor, but this 
softening is confined to a few metropolitan areas and market 
segments. The employment component of purchasing managers surveys 
around the District suggested modest softening in the demand for 
manufacturing workers in December, but the index numbers are 
consistent with steady employment levels.
