      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 8, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from various sectors of the Third District economy indicated 
that business activity was moving up slightly in April. Around one-
third of the manufacturers surveyed reported some gains during the 
month, although producers of building materials noted recent 
declines in sales. Retailers said sales were picking up modestly 
with the beginning of the spring season. Auto dealers described the 
sales rate in April as good, although a bit below their 
expectations. Bankers noted some increased commercial loan demand 
and a modest increase in consumer lending. Tourism in the District 
has been healthy, and contacts in resort areas said advance bookings 
for summer vacations have been strong. Among service industries, 
computer consultants and service firms reported increased hiring and 
contracting for computer network installations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported some improvement during April. 
Although about half of those contacted said their business was 
steady, a little over one-third indicated that orders and shipments 
of their products were on the rise. The gains were spread among 
almost all the major manufacturing sectors in the region; however, 
some firms that produce products and materials for the homebuilding 
industry said demand for these goods was slipping. In addition, some 
firms that export, as well as those that compete with imports, noted 
that the dollar's recent strength has adversely affected their 
competitive position.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, area manufacturers reported they were working down 
inventories and planned to continue to do so, but there were some 
reports that inventories in the paper industry were rising above 
desired levels. Local manufacturers noted some increases in input 
costs in April, and they expect some additional increases in the 
prices of purchased supplies and materials over the summer. 
Manufacturing employment remained nearly steady in April: nearly 
two-thirds of the local firms surveyed noted no changes in 
employment levels or working hours, and the number of firms adding 
workers was matched by the number making reductions in their work 
forces.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District merchants generally reported modest increases in 
sales for the March-April period compared with the first two months 
of the year. An early Easter boosted March sales but held down sales 
in the first half of April, according to store officials. But they 
also noted that warm weather in recent weeks has spurred sales of 
summer apparel and seasonal merchandise. In particular, new styles 
and colors for women's clothes have encouraged more buying of 
apparel this spring than last, according to some retailers, and 
helped to lift performance at department stores and women's clothing 
stores. Also, recent above-normal temperatures have encouraged 
purchases of lawn and garden-care merchandise. Most retailers in the 
District described their inventories as appropriate for the current 
sales rate and consistent with their expectations for a modest year-
over-year gain in sales for the spring season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers generally reported that sales in April were running at 
a healthy rate, although a bit below their earlier expectations. 
Some General Motors dealers said their sales were limited by the 
strike at a parts plant and attendant production cutbacks in March. 
Most dealers for all makes indicated that their inventories were at 
satisfactory levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bank lending in the Third District was moving up slightly in April, 
according to loan officers at major banks. They noted some recent 
small gains in commercial lending, primarily to manufacturers. 
Bankers continued to characterize the competition for business 
lending as very strong. Some banks also have seen increased demand 
for consumer installment credit and home equity loans. Credit card 
lending has also picked up a bit, but some bankers indicated they 
were implementing more conservative credit standards, which could 
restrain the growth of this type of lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's tourism industry has been healthy, according to tourism 
officials and hotel executives. Hotel occupancy rates continued to 
be strong in Philadelphia. Real estate .agents in New Jersey and 
Delaware shore resorts reported that more rental contracts for the 
summer have been signed through April of this year than last and 
rental rates have been edging up. Tourist officials in the Pocono 
Mountain region of Pennsylvania indicated that hotels in the area 
have seen increases in bookings for conferences and business 
meetings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Data processing firms and consultants in the Third District reported 
strong demand for systems design and installation as well as 
hardware upgrading. Computer consultants and contractors said a 
continuing trend toward personal computer networks was generating 
demand for their services and for the hiring of permanent staff with 
expertise in personal computer systems design and installation. 
Demand for programmers was steady, and the need for mainframe 
computer operators continued to decline.
