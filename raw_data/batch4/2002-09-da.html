      Overall Eleventh District 
                economic growth appears to have stalled in late July and August. 
                While some sectors, such as high-tech manufacturing and business 
                services, continued to show signs of recovery, other areas, such 
                as construction and construction-related manufacturing, appeared 
                to contract. While most respondents expect the economy to continue 
                to slowly recover, many contacts expressed concern that the recovery 
                is very fragile and that war with Iraq or another major terrorist 
                event could lead to declines in activity. Manufacturing activity 
                was flat or slightly down, and retail sales growth weakened slightly. 
                Construction and real estate activity softened further. Energy 
                activity was flat. There was also little change in financial conditions. 
                Demand for business services continued to show signs of slowly 
                improving, although the airline industry continues to suffer. 
                Rain helped crop and pasture conditions, but drought remains a 
                serious problem in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Labor Markets
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Price reports were mixed. Reports of rising insurance costs 
                  continue to be widespread, and the costs of energy and oil-based 
                  products have increased. In most instances, contacts indicated 
                  that price competition was preventing these costs from being 
                  passed along to selling prices. Steel prices are up nearly 10 
                  percent since June and are expected to continue to rise through 
                  the end of the year. Liner board prices are scheduled to increase 
                  roughly 4 percent from current levels, pushing up prices for 
                  some paper products.
       <p>
        Spot prices of West Texas Intermediate crude 
                  oil remained in a range of $26 to $28 per barrel, except for 
                  late August when they briefly moved over $30 per barrel. Fears 
                  of war with Iraq, falling Iraqi output, and tightening inventories 
                  have supported the price of crude oil, with the "war premium" 
                  variously estimated at $2 to $6 per barrel. Natural gas prices 
                  stayed under $3.00 per million Btu, except when oil prices moved 
                  over $30 per barrel in late August. Natural gas inventories 
                  have declined slightly but remain 11 percent above their five-year 
                  average and are expected to be at record high levels as the 
                  heating season begins. Gasoline prices were mostly unchanged. 
                  Petrochemical prices continued to rise for polyethylene, polypropylene 
                  and polyvinyl chloride, but producers do not expect the upward 
                  pressure on chemical prices to continue. Prices of new homes 
                  have not declined, but there are more concessions and giveaways. 
                  The rising inventory of homes in all price ranges is putting 
                  downward pressure on home prices according to some contacts.
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Overall manufacturing activity was flat or down slightly in 
                  late July and August. Demand was down for most construction-related 
                  materials, such as concrete, lumber and brick. Demand slowed 
                  sharply for petrochemical products, led by a drop in demand 
                  for ethylene, a fundamental building block. The slowdown has 
                  occurred partly because of import competition but mostly because 
                  a long period of inventory restocking has ended. Still, the 
                  level of petrochemical demand remains quite high, according 
                  to contacts.
         <p>
          Sales were unchanged for glass, primary and 
                  fabricated metals and food products. Domestic demand for paper 
                  products was unchanged, but foreign demand was up, particularly 
                  from Europe. Another El Paso apparel plant is scheduled to close 
                  in September, because production is moving out of the United 
                  States.
          <p>
           Gasoline demand has been strong, and refiners 
                  on the Gulf Coast kept output unchanged, with capacity utilization 
                  at 93 to 95 percent. Strong imports helped keep inventories 
                  about 3 percent above last year's levels.
           <p>
            The high-tech industry continued to slowly 
                  improve. There has been a broad-based pickup in the demand for 
                  semiconductors, except to supply business computers. Inventories 
                  are in good shape and, while semiconductor prices remained soft, 
                  there are signs of firming. A manufacturer of cordless phones 
                  reported double-digit sales growth. However, there has been 
                  little change in the telecommunications industry, and layoffs 
                  continue to be reported.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Services
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Temporary service firms reported continued slow improvement, 
                  although activity remains substantially below the levels of 
                  a year ago. Demand for temporary workers is coming mostly from 
                  call centers, light industrial firms, and manufacturing. Demand 
                  was still weak to supply the telecommunications, IT and energy 
                  industries. Although accounting firms reported little change 
                  in activity, auditing activity was strong, boosted by newly 
                  imposed regulations. Legal firms reported an increase in demand 
                  for their services in late July and August, with strength in 
                  litigation, bankruptcy, labor, and administrative areas but 
                  continued weakness in transactions/acquisitions activity.
             <p>
              Demand for air travel remained at very low 
                  levels. Business travel has been particularly weak, and airlines 
                  are no longer able to charge a premium to these travelers, slashing 
                  revenues. The industry is concerned that business travel may 
                  remain weak for some time. Airlines are reorganizing to make 
                  more efficient use of capital and labor.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Retail Sales
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Dealers said auto sales have been good, as low interest rates 
                  and large rebate checks continued to bring buyers to showrooms. 
                  More generally, however, retail sales were below expectations 
                  in late July and August. Department stores reported poor sales, 
                  and discount stores said sales growth was at the lower end of 
                  their expectations. Some retailers recently lowered their outlook 
                  for sales growth. All contacts say that they are being cautious 
                  to keep their inventories in check.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Financial Services
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Financial market volatility led to a sharp reduction in market-related 
                  activities, while commercial and industrial lending continued 
                  to be weak. Mortgage lending--first mortgages and refinancing--was 
                  still strong. Loan repayments also remained strong, and deposit 
                  growth was stronger than expected. While most contacts reported 
                  no change in credit conditions, some mentioned tighter scrutiny 
                  in loan committee and longer approval processes, although no 
                  significant changes to delinquencies or charge-offs.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Construction and Real Estate
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 Nonresidential markets are reported to be "difficult" and "terrible." 
                  Contacts are particularly concerned about new office space coming 
                  on line in downtown Houston, which they say could push up vacancy 
                  rates to 25 percent in 2003. Residential activity was mostly 
                  unchanged. Homes continued to sell if priced below $150,000, 
                  but sales of higher priced homes are slow. Home inventories 
                  are high, and some contacts expressed concerned about an excess 
                  supply of higher priced homes.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Energy
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  Energy conditions remained unchanged in July and August with 
                  about 335 working rigs in Texas and 850 rigs nationwide. Some 
                  producers say that they are still unable to aggressively drill 
                  because of weak balance sheets. Others are unwilling to risk 
                  the balance sheet because they believe high inventories are 
                  a risk to natural gas prices. Service firms say foreign drilling 
                  is down slightly but revenues are up because the projects are 
                  more complex.
                  <p>

                   <br/>
                   The cotton crop is expected to be 15 percent above last year's 
                  harvest. In some areas, producers have been able to get a second 
                  cutting of hay, and a surplus of hay supplies has been reported 
                  for the first time in several years. Nonetheless, drought remains 
                  a problem in some areas, where supplemental feeding of livestock 
                  is high and herd liquidation is under way. In Southern New Mexico, 
                  some areas are out of water, and herd sizes have been reduced 
                  to 40 to 50 percent of normal.
