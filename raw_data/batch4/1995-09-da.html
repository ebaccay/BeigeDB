     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 13, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity weakened in August. Generally, 
contacts expect continued expansion over the coming months, but 
combined they expressed wide variance in the strength of that 
expansion. Economic activity remained sluggish along parts of the 
Texas-Mexico border, and contacts expressed little optimism that 
activity there will recover quickly. Manufacturing orders remained 
unchanged or slower for several products. Retail sales were weak. 
Demand for most business services increased, but cargo shipments had 
declined. Construction and energy activity was steady, and financial 
institutions continued to report steady loan demand. Agricultural 
conditions were unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price and wage pressures were mixed. Oil prices strengthened from a 
low $17 to near $18 per barrel through August. Natural gas prices 
were also up slightly, as were wholesale gasoline and fuel oil 
prices. Strong demand led to scattered price pressure in the service 
sector, and labor shortages pushed up wages for some types of 
workers. There was little price and wage pressure in manufacturing 
industries, however, and most chemical prices had fallen. Retailers 
reported that heavy competition led to larger markdowns on selling 
prices, and most contacts expect continued downward pressure on 
prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing orders remained unchanged or slower for several 
products although demand remained very strong for telecommunications 
and semiconductor products. Also, orders were up for food products 
and primary metals. Demand for fabricated metal and other 
construction-related products was unchanged, as were sales of 
apparel. Paper producers reported slower demand for most of their 
products. Orders of petrochemicals continued to weaken, thanks to 
sluggish domestic demand, particularly from construction and auto 
markets, and a limit on petrochemical imports by China. District 
refining is operating at less than full capacity only because 
mechanical problems have shut down a few facilities, but margins 
have weakened as oil prices have risen faster than gasoline prices. 
The market for oil services and drilling equipment continued to be 
strong, despite relatively weak domestic drilling activity. 
International work, and strong activity in the Gulf of Mexico, 
continues to offset any domestic weakness onshore.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business services picked up, while demand for trucking 
and air cargo services declined slightly. Legal firms reported more 
mergers and acquisitions activity, increased hiring and an 
optimistic outlook. Growing demand for specialized consulting and 
accounting services enabled firms to raise fees and increase hiring. 
Temporary firms continued to report strong growth and higher fees, 
but the cost of upgrading technology and increased recruiting kept 
profit margins from increasing. Several temporary firms reported 
difficulty finding qualified employees. Decreased freight volume and 
heavy competition at trucking and air cargo firms resulted in 
discounting and a slightly pessimistic outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales were weak in August, with continued declines along the 
Texas-Mexico border. Retailers were surprised by the absence of 
back-to-school shopping, which has raised their concern about the 
outlook. Automobile sales were up slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial institutions reported steady loan demand. Residential real 
estate lending was up slightly, while commercial real estate and 
business loan demand held steady. Business lending is reported to be 
strongest to the service sector, with little demand for loans from 
manufacturing or retail companies. Contacts reported that all types 
of lending had weakened substantially along the Texas-Mexico border 
because "the reality of the peso crisis is setting in." Overall, 
contacts expect little change in loan demand in coming months, 
although they are uncertain about the outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity was steady at high levels. Contacts reported 
no change in new home construction, but home sales remained much 
higher than earlier in the year. Demand for industrial buildings and 
suburban office space continued to rise, and contacts in these 
sectors remained optimistic. Apartment construction remained above 
year-earlier levels, but respondents were increasingly concerned 
that the large number of units scheduled for completion in 1995 and 
1996 may lead to stagnant rents and rising vacancy rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Energy activity was up slightly in August. Higher prices for oil, 
gas and related-products led to a modest increase in drilling. 
Natural gas continued to lead drilling activity, but domestic oil 
drilling was up, rebounding from low levels. Inventories of crude 
oil continued to fall, and American Petroleum Institute data showed 
the lowest levels of domestic crude inventories in the last 10 
years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural conditions were unchanged, with continued hot, dry 
weather and scattered insect problems. Crop progress was reported to 
be generally on schedule, although insects and rain had delayed 
harvest activity in some areas. Most crops are reported to be in 
good condition. Major cotton crop losses from severe insect problems 
in parts of South Texas should be offset by good yield prospects in 
other parts of the state. Ranges and pastures were beginning to show 
signs of stress in areas where the hot, dry weather prevailed. 
Livestock remained in good condition.
