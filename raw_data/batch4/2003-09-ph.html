      Business activity in the Third District continued 
                  to advance slowly in August. Manufacturers reported increases 
                  in orders and shipments for the month. Retail sales of general 
                  merchandise picked up in August for the usual back-to-school 
                  shopping period, although the year-over-year gain appeared to 
                  be slight. Auto and light truck sales have been strong as model 
                  year close-out promotions boosted the sales rate. Bank lending 
                  has been rising slowly, with most of the gain coming from residential 
                  lending. Commercial real estate markets remain soft, but home 
                  sales have increased. Overall tourism business for the summer 
                  season appears to be matching last year's level, but lodging 
                  activity is off from last summer.
      <p>
       The outlook among contacts in the Third District 
                  business community is for steady or slowly improving conditions. 
                  Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments and orders during 
                  the next six months. Most of the retailers surveyed in August 
                  expect sales to rise slowly through the fall. Auto dealers anticipate 
                  some slippage in sales after 2003 models are cleared out. Bankers 
                  expect slow growth in lending as the pace of economic activity 
                  in the region gradually rises.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturers' shipments and orders increased in August compared 
                  with July. More than one in three of the companies surveyed 
                  in August reported increases in demand for their products and 
                  less than one in five reported decreases. Improvement in business 
                  conditions appears to be spreading across the major manufacturing 
                  industries in the District. Firms that make products used in 
                  residential construction reported increases in orders in August, 
                  continuing the strong demand they have had in previous months 
                  this year. Manufacturers of industrial equipment, which had 
                  experienced generally lackluster conditions for the past 12 
                  months or longer, reported increases in demand in August. There 
                  were gains for makers of many industrial products, such as primary 
                  and fabricated metals, machinery, and electrical equipment. 
                  However, chemical producers and instrument manufacturers reported 
                  a falloff in orders in August.
        <p>
         The outlook among the region's manufacturers 
                  is positive. Around half expect increases in shipments and orders 
                  during the next six months, and less than one in five anticipate 
                  decreases. Area manufacturers forecast some increases in employment 
                  and working hours, on balance, in the next six months, and they 
                  plan to step up capital spending plans moderately.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Retail
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Third District retailers generally reported that current dollar 
                  sales increased in August from July, although the year-over-year 
                  gain appeared to be slight, according to most of the stores 
                  surveyed. Sales of back-to-school supplies and apparel have 
                  been good, but some women's clothing stores continue to report 
                  weak sales. Some merchants said they have seen a pickup in sales 
                  due to the federal income-tax rebates, but others said consumers 
                  continue to be cautious in their spending. These merchants noted 
                  that many shoppers are favoring lower-priced brands and concentrating 
                  their buying at discount stores and manufacturers' outlets. 
                  Some stores have been left with undesired inventories of summer 
                  merchandise, although several noted that warm weather apparel 
                  was continuing to sell fairly well, and sales of home furnishings 
                  remained healthy.
          <p>
           The consensus among retailers contacted in August 
                  is that sales will move up slowly during the fall. Several store 
                  executives said they will introduce cold-weather merchandise 
                  later than usual this year and keep inventories limited. These 
                  retailers said consumers have been showing a greater tendency 
                  to delay purchases until their needs are more immediate. Merchants 
                  are responding by timing the introduction of seasonal merchandise 
                  more closely to the relevant season.
           <p>
            Auto dealers reported generally rising sales 
                  during August. Manufacturers boosted incentives to clear out 
                  2003 models as 2004 models arrive. Dealers are taking delivery 
                  of new models, and consequently, their inventories are high. 
                  In general, dealers expect it will be difficult to maintain 
                  the current rate of sales once older model inventories are depleted, 
                  but most dealers anticipate a high sales rate for the most popular 
                  new domestic cars and trucks and continued strong sales of luxury 
                  imports.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Finance
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks was growing 
                  slowly in August. Residential real estate lending continued 
                  to move up, mainly for home purchases, while refinancing activity 
                  has declined. Consumer credit also increased, although recent 
                  gains in most categories of personal lending, including credit 
                  cards, have been modest at most of the banks contacted for this 
                  report. Business loan volume outstanding has been practically 
                  flat, according to bank lending officers. They said most of 
                  their commercial and industrial borrowers have not had the increases 
                  in business that necessitate expansion.
             <p>
              Bankers surveyed in August expect business activity 
                  in the region to move up very gradually, and they expect total 
                  lending to rise slowly along with the improvement in regional 
                  economic conditions. Some also said they expect at least a slight 
                  deterioration in credit quality, unless the recovery in the 
                  region's economy strengthens.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Real Estate and Construction
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Commercial real estate firms in the Third District reported 
                  that overall office vacancy rates have increased in suburban 
                  markets, where several new buildings have recently become available 
                  with substantial amounts of space not pre-leased. Vacancy rates 
                  in suburban markets were estimated in a range of 12 to 24 percent, 
                  up around 1 percentage point since the spring. The vacancy rate 
                  in the Philadelphia central business district has been nearly 
                  steady at around 13 percent, virtually unchanged in recent months. 
                  Effective rental rates continued to decline as landlords offer 
                  tenant improvement allowances and rent-free periods, and several 
                  major tenants have negotiated renewed leases at lower rents. 
                  Commercial real estate contacts say office vacancy rates will 
                  probably begin to edge down near the end of the year as the 
                  number of new buildings becoming available declines.
               <p>
                Residential real estate agents and home builders generally reported 
                  that sales have accelerated. They said the recent upturn in 
                  mortgage interest rates prompted a rush to complete sales of 
                  both new and existing homes. Home builders generally expect 
                  sales to remain strong, although some indicated that their backlogs 
                  appear to have peaked. Real estate agents expect a strengthening 
                  economy to support a fairly good rate of home sales despite 
                  higher mortgage rates.
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Tourism
                 </strong>
                 <br/>
                 Tourism officials in the region reported that tourist and vacation 
                  locations have had mixed results this summer. Periods of cool 
                  and rainy weather have resulted in fewer visits to beach resorts. 
                  Lodging and other business activity in some of these areas have 
                  been less than last year. In particular, vacation home rentals 
                  have not met expectations. Tourist visits to urban areas have 
                  been fairly high. Some museums have broken attendance records, 
                  and many summer entertainment programs and performing arts festivals 
                  have had high attendance. On balance, it appears that the region's 
                  overall tourism-related business this summer will be roughly 
                  equal to last year's, but lodging activity will probably be 
                  down.
