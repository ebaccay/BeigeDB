      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 18, 1995
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      As 1995 opens, the economy of the Ninth District shows robust growth 
in most sectors. Manufacturing is very strong. Construction is 
active for the winter season, with commercial projects replacing 
residential buildings as the focus of strength. Iron mining expects 
its best year in over a decade and other metal mining faces 
favorable conditions. Forest product output remains high, with paper 
production continuing to gain strength. Modest recovery in depressed 
farm prices reportedly is fueling some increases in farm capital 
spending. Consumers are actively buying vehicles, and sales of 
general merchandise are generally good.
     </p>
     <p>
      But not all is favorable. Winter tourist businesses are having a 
slow year so far, largely due to unfavorable weather rather than 
lack of demand. Residential building remains below year-earlier 
levels, and sales of existing housing have slackened.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moreover, some problems associated with strong economic growth 
persist. Urban labor markets are very tight and may businesses have 
difficulty in securing employees. Businesses continue to report 
higher wage increases than were common in recent years. Reports of 
price increases in raw materials and intermediate goods are common 
and some such goods are increasingly difficult to secure.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Virtually all of our manufacturing customers are doing very well," 
reports a small business lending supervisor from a major Minneapolis 
bank. "It is really a boom," he adds. Commercial printers and firms 
manufacturing circuit boards, other electronic components, die 
castings, building components and hardware are described as doing 
particularly well across the district. A Japanese firm opened a 
small engine plant in Wisconsin citing the current dollar-yen 
exchange rate as a key factor. A major window manufacturer announced 
plans for a new plant in Fargo, N. D. Two mainframe computer 
manufacturers did announce layoffs, but these seem to result from 
long-term changes in that industry and ongoing restructuring in the 
particular companies involved rather than any overall weakness in 
the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resource Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "The taconite industry is on a roll," is how one newspaper described 
iron mining in northeastern Minnesota. Production was about 42 
million tons in 1994 and is expected to vault to 47.5 million tons 
in 1995, the highest level in over 15 years. As an exception to 
overall brightness in this sector, a Michigan mine announced a 
layoff as part of a consolidation into one site. Copper and other 
non-ferrous producers have not expended output to the extent that 
iron mines have, since they had less slack capacity, but extremely 
favorable prices are allowing these operations to replace old or 
worn-out equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production of corrugated cardboard and other packaging as well as 
printing paper continues to increase. Output of other forest 
products, including lumber and building board, continues strong, and 
Montana timber employment and output have regained much of the 
ground lost when a major mill closed in 1993.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "Office glut lessens as businesses take up lots of space," is one 
recent Minneapolis headline. "People have to build, there just isn't 
any decent commercial space left," comments a suburban St. Paul 
lender. Commercial projects clearly have passed up housing as the 
locomotive for the construction sector. New warehouses, distribution 
centers and other retail facilities are in particular demand. 
"Retail is to the 1990s what office buildings were to the 1980s," 
comments one major national developer and builder based in 
Minneapolis. Long lead times on new commercial buildings are 
reported in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, residential construction clearly has retreated from earlier 
highs in many areas of the Ninth District Single-family home permits 
issued in the Minneapolis-St Paul area were somewhat below year-
earlier figures in October and November, and industry spokespersons 
indicate that the same will be true when the December numbers are 
available. A major home builder noted that actual slowing was less 
than originally anticipated and stated that business was still good. 
He cited increasing numbers of new home buyers opting for adjustable 
rate mortgages as the primary reason why residential housing 
activity has not slowed more than it has. This pattern, of some 
slowing from year-earlier levels, but of still maintaining good 
levels of activity reportedly is true in other urban areas of the 
district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Markets for existing homes are cool, however. A Minnesota 
residential realtor describes sales of existing homes as depressed 
from levels that prevailed in the two previous winters. Existing 
home sales reportedly remain strong in rapidly growing urban areas 
such as Sioux Falls, S.D., and Billings, Mont., but have slowed 
slightly in other areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      With crop production in its mid-winter dead season, Ninth District 
farmers are focused on livestock production and on marketing the 
1994 crop. Modest improvements in both crop and livestock prices 
have reportedly improved producer outlooks for 1995, and a few 
observers see increased farmer willingness to invest in new 
machinery before the 1995 crop season. Unseasonably warm weather in 
December raised fears that stored, unprocessed sugar beets might 
spoil, but cold weather in early January has alleviated that threat 
at least temporarily. Lack of snow cover in dairy areas is causing 
concern about alfalfa survival.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      "The day after Christmas was phenomenal," according to a manager of 
a Montana discount store. Holiday retail sales apparently were very 
strong in Montana and the Dakotas. The Minneapolis-St Paul area 
mimicked national patterns: Appliances and consumer electronics sold 
briskly, but apparel sales were disappointing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers continue to go for new vehicles. North Dakota's 
registrations of new passenger vehicles for December were neatly 5 
percent above the already healthy sales experienced a year earlier. 
Reports from registration agencies and dealers' associations in 
other states confirm this pattern.
     </p>
     <p>
      Winter tourism activity was slow in parts of the Ninth District 
apparently due more to sparse snow cover than to weak demand. 
Officials in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northwest Wisconsin 
report a 50 percent decline for December 1994, compared to the prior 
year. Business stayed even for December at a northern Minnesota ski 
resort, while snowmobiling dropped from year-earlier levels. Despite 
unfavorable exchange rates for Canadian skiers, a northwest Montana 
resort reports a slight increase this season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Evidence of tight labor markets abounds. Help wanted signs are 
posted in all sorts of establishments and classified advertising 
sections are bulging. Even temporary agencies are scraping the 
bottom of the labor barrel, the CEO of a computer manufacturer 
reports, noting that over of half of the workers forwarded by 
agencies fail a drug screening test, up from less than 8 percent a 
year ago. Several executives of large Minnesota firms who 
participated in an economic roundtable hosted by the Minneapolis Fed 
cited increasing difficulty in securing needed workers and noted 
that they were raising wages much more than in preceding years. And 
a small Wisconsin firm that produces ribbon candy, a holiday season 
specialty, was unable to do so because it could not secure the 
needed temporary workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both manufacturers and building contractors report price increases 
for materials they need. Some steel uses still experience delivery 
delays. Precast concrete panels also reportedly are in short supply, 
in spite of plants running seven-day a week, 24-hour schedules. 
However, prices of petroleum fuels continue to drop.
