      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 13, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Summary
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District economic activity continues to expand at a slow and steady 
pace. While a few contacts noted some softening in the economy at 
the beginning of the year, they expect a slight pickup as the second 
quarter approaches. Reports indicate that the southern part of the 
District is growing somewhat faster than the northern part. Monthly 
residential and nonresidential building permit levels declined in 
most District metropolitan areas in December. Loan demand, 
especially for commercial loans, is still strong in most parts of 
the District. Significant crop and livestock damage occurred because 
of February's arctic cold snap.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District firms report that economic growth has proceeded at a slower 
pace than that of the past few months. Firms in the southern part of 
the District report slightly stronger activity than their northern 
counterparts. Some contacts expect the pace to pick up somewhat as 
the second quarter of the year approaches. For example, a survey of 
small businesses in the District found that about one-quarter plan 
to hire additional workers over the next three months, with about 
three-quarters planning no changes. This survey also found that 
about one-quarter of the respondents increased employee compensation 
during the past three months, while one-fifth plan to increase it 
over the next three months. Contacts report, however, that there has 
been little upward pressure on costs so far this year, and that 
competition is not allowing firms to raise consumer prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts in northern Mississippi generally report that sales for the 
past month or two are at levels comparable with a year ago, but 
signs of new growth have appeared. A producer of prefabricated metal 
buildings and several furniture manufacturers report unchanged sales 
in January, but have seen slight increases in February. Expectations 
are for less than 5 percent growth in the coming months. A brick 
manufacturer reports record sales for 1995, noting that this pace 
has continued into 1996. Demand for mobile homes has been 
particularly strong in Mississippi, requiring several local 
manufacturers to add employees. Firms targeting specialty markets, 
like gourmet stoves and home decorating, report that sales are 
remaining steady at high levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Arkansas, a cement supplier recently had to purchase 15 new 
delivery trucks to meet its high demand. A maker of glass containers 
reports that sales since the beginning of the year are up about 12 
percent over the same period last year. A company producing military 
and civilian boots will take over a recently closed shoe factory in 
western Tennessee and hire about 150 of the previously laid-off 
workers. A producer of truck transmissions and a maker of outdoor 
leisure products, however, have seen year-to-date sales fall 2 to 5 
percent from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Missouri and Kentucky, reports are more mixed. A large defense 
contractor in the St. Louis area announced layoffs for about 470 
workers because of lulls in production for some products. At the 
same time, this company received a new fighter jet contract worth 
almost $600 million, which will secure other jobs for the time 
being. An auto producer has reopened its Missouri plant as 
scheduled, employing about 2,400 people. A printing company in 
southern Illinois, trying to reorganize through bankruptcy, closed 
in late February, eliminating 850 jobs. Another high-sulfur coal 
mine in Illinois is closing, leaving behind 200 jobs. A major 
department store retailer, however, moved its credit department from 
Maryland to St. Louis and created 350 new jobs.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential building permits in December 1995 were above their year-ago levels in five of the District's 12 metropolitan areas. Only two 
metro areas, though-Fayetteville, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee-
experienced an increase in the number of residential permits between 
November and December. Most other District metro areas saw sharp 
declines in activity in December, including some of the areas that 
had levels above those of one year ago. Nonresidential building 
permits in December were above their year-ago levels in only three 
of the District's metropolitan areas. Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was the 
only District metro area to experience an increase in permits 
between November and December. The level of nonresidential permits 
in all other areas fell off sharply in December.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Loan demand continues to be characterized as strong by most 
respondents, although signs of softening are scattered throughout 
the District. Commercial and industrial (C &amp; I) loans appear to be 
the strongest segment of the loan market; respondents are divided, 
however, about the riskiness of new C &amp; I loans. Pricing is still 
described as aggressive in a number of District markets, but 
respondents in other markets report a lessening of competition. A 
few respondents report a recent surge in refinancing in their areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Natural Resources
       </strong>
       <br/>
       February's cold snap adversely affected the District's agricultural 
sector. Reports from crop analysts suggest that the wheat crop in 
Illinois, Indiana and Missouri, which was already hurting from 
inadequate soil moisture, suffered additional freeze damage. 
Although the true extent of the damage is yet unknown, one report 
indicates that a five-county area in southern Illinois was 
especially hard hit. Some farmers will be forced to plow their wheat 
fields under this spring and plant corn, soybeans or milo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cold weather also hurt livestock producers. For example, 
Mississippi catfish farmers reportedly suffered substantial losses 
because of ponds freezing over. On the positive side, cotton 
analysts said the cold weather destroyed a significant percentage of 
the boll weevil population. An increasing number of farmers indicate 
that the uncertainty surrounding the 1996 Farm Bill legislation has 
delayed final plantings. As a result, many farm lenders are 
reportedly proceeding at a cautious pace. Delta farmers are expected 
to reduce planted cotton acreage by about 10 percent this spring. In 
response to high grain prices, most of this acreage will be planted 
to corn or soybeans instead.
