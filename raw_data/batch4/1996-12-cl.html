      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 4, 1996
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       The District economy remains

strong overall and is growing moderately

in most areas.  Price and wage increases

are light.
       <p>
        Labor markets are characterized as

"tight" in many parts of the District, but

especially in central and southwestern

Ohio and northern Kentucky.  Many areas

report unemployment rates under 4 percent, and

in a few locations the rate has dipped below

3 percent.  While several sources are expressing

concern over the potential for

substantially higher wage growth, there

are few signs of any significant rise at

present.
        <p>
         Employment agencies report the

demand for temporary workers is strong,

with low-skilled workers in short supply.

In the past few months, a growing number

of corporate clients have begun hiring

temporary workers on a permanent basis.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Manufacturing
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Production at a wide variety of

manufacturing facilities is holding steady

at a high level.  Capital goods producers

generally note good production and orders

numbers, although heavy truck

manufacturing is still off substantially

from earlier in the year.  Firms with

significant export markets have seen a

recent strengthening in foreign orders, and

one source indicated that orders growth in

Latin America has been especially strong.

Manufacturers continue to report pressure

to hold prices down, and few are seeing any

unusual cost pressure.  A shortage of

engineers and other technical workers has

also been reported.
          <p>
           In mid-November, a few large

District auto assembly and manufacturing

plants were temporarily shut down

because of parts shortages stemming from

the Canadian Auto Workers? strike against

GM.  Some plants were closed for up to two

weeks, resulting in nearly 7,000 layoffs

Districtwide.  Production has since

returned to normal, although no makeup of

lost production is currently scheduled.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Agricultural Conditions
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Recent cold and wet weather caused

minor problems for the District?s farmers.

Snow fell in parts of all four District states

during the first two weeks of November,

ranging from a few inches in some areas to

as much as 70 inches in parts of northeast

Ohio.  Farm activity was curtailed in many

places because of muddy fields, hindering

winter wheat seedings.
            <p>
             The soybean crop is reported to be

plentiful and in good condition.  Potato and

apple harvests in Pennsylvania and Ohio

are nearly complete, and reports for these

crops are also favorable.  However, as of

mid-November, the corn harvest was still

about 20 percentage points below average

in Ohio.  In Kentucky, blue mold has

affected the weight and quality of burley

tobacco.
             <p>
              <strong>
               Retailing
              </strong>
              <br/>
              District retailers report mixed

sales patterns, but overall, sales seem to be

running behind last year?s pace.  Sales of

furniture and consumer electronics have

been particularly slow, while major

appliances and apparel have been moving

well.  Seasonal items, such as winter

apparel, are also selling well, especially in

areas of the District that received heavy

snowfall early in November.
              <p>
               Despite some disappointments with

the overall sales picture, retailers seem

cautiously optimistic about the holiday

shopping season.  Inventories are being

expanded in line with expectations of

increased store traffic.  Prices are

reportedly stable, except in electronics,

where deep discounts are common.  Many

stores have already hired seasonal help,

but a few report difficulty finding qualified

workers for some positions.  A variety of

chain stores have recently expanded into

the District, particularly in Ohio.
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Auto Dealers
                </strong>
                <br/>
                While dealers are pleased with year-

to-date sales levels, the past few months

have been disappointing, with most dealers

reporting sales at or slightly below last

year?s levels.  Some of the slowdown has

been attributed to the recent heavy snows,

but in parts of the District where the

weather remained mild, sales were only

slightly better.  Sales incentives have been

unusually generous and widespread for a

new model year.  A few dealers are

anticipating an end-of-year surge, but the

majority note that year-end sales upticks

have been negligible in the past few years.
                <p>
                 Inventories remain near desired

levels, with shortages reported only for the

most popular models and for light trucks.
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Banking and Finance
                  </strong>
                  <br/>
                  Loan demand is mixed, as

community banks report strong growth in

credit while larger institutions are seeing

more moderate gains.  Overall, loan

delinquency rates remain stable, although a

few large banks have noted an increase in

credit card delinquencies.  Declining credit

quality--based on fierce competition for

borrowers--remains an issue at many

institutions.  To date, though, the

deterioration is generally characterized as

modest.
                  <p>
                   In general, bankers are

experiencing a narrower spread between

borrowing and lending rates.  Profits,

however, are substantially improved from

this time last year.   Refinancing activity is

picking up as mortgage rates drop.
