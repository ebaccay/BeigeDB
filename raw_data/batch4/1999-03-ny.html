      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 17, 1999
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's economy continues to grow at a brisk pace with only 
scattered signs of price pressures. Retailers report that sales were 
above plan in both January and February, with somewhat less 
discounting than last year on winter clearance merchandise; 
inventories were said to be satisfactory, albeit on the low side. 
The housing market has retained strong upward momentum in early 
1999, with noteworthy improvement in upstate New York. After slowing 
in the fourth quarter, Manhattan office rents resumed their 15-20 
percent rate of increase in January, as vacancy rates fell to 
cyclical lows.
      <p>
       Regional purchasing managers report a rebound in manufacturing 
activity in February, along with steady to declining commodity 
prices but a re-emergence of sharp upward price pressures for 
contracted services. Final costs of most goods and services remain 
stable, though there are scattered reports of hikes in restaurant 
prices and movie admissions. New York State payroll employment 
levels for both 1997 and 1998 were boosted considerably after recent 
benchmark revisions. Local banks report continued strong loan 
demand, leveling off in credit standards, and further declines in 
delinquency rates.
       <p>
        <b>
         Consumer Spending
        </b>
        <br/>
        Retailers report that sales were generally above plan in both 
January and February. Most contacts report strong demand at 
clearance sales in January and brisk sales of spring merchandise in 
February, helped by mild weather. Among retailers, discounters 
continued to register the strongest sales gains compared to a year 
earlier, ranging from 4 to 9 percent, on a same-store basis; general 
merchandise chains reported more modest gains. Most sales categories 
performed well, though some contacts note lagging sales of toys, 
athletic footwear and accessories, and electronics. Inventories are 
mostly reported to be in good shape--none of the contacts indicate 
that they are too high, but one large chain says that inventories 
are too lean in certain categories. All of the retailers surveyed 
indicate that they and their major vendors are Y2K-compliant, and 
say they have no plans to accumulate extra inventories later this 
year.
        <p>
         Most retailers indicate steady wages, though one large chain reports 
that it is going to "bite the bullet and raise pay scales" this 
year, largely in response to rising turnover. Retailers indicate 
that prices of most goods are flat to somewhat lower; although 
ticket prices for apparel are lower than a year ago, some contacts 
note less aggressive markdowns than last year, thanks to strong 
demand at clearance sales. While prices of most goods and services 
remain stable, there are scattered reports of increases in 
restaurant and movie prices this winter in and around New York City.
         <p>
          <b>
           Construction &amp; Real Estate
          </b>
          <br/>
          The District's housing market showed further signs of strength in 
recent weeks. Single-family housing permits marginally exceeded last 
January's exceptional pace (despite snowstorms in western New York), 
while multi-family permits "mainly in New York City" were up 30 
percent from a year ago; both segments were also strong in December. 
More currently, homebuilders in New Jersey report persistently heavy 
buyer traffic and sales in February and early March. Builders in New 
York State say that the market is strong and improving; even most 
parts of chronically sluggish upstate New York have improved 
substantially "notably the Rochester and Albany areas."
          <p>
           Remodeling contractors in both New York and New Jersey say they 
"have more jobs available than they can possibly do." Remodelers in 
Long Island and northern New Jersey report "numerous jobs in the 
six-figures." One New Jersey realtor described current market 
strength as "amazing." Similarly, New York State's market for 
existing single-family homes continued to be brisk in December and 
January, with sales up 8 percent from a year ago, led by the 
Syracuse, Rochester and Albany areas. Statewide, home prices were up 
more than 7 percent from a year earlier in January.
           <p>
            New York City's office market regained momentum in January, after 
slowing in the fourth quarter. In Manhattan, office availability 
rates fell to cyclical lows in January, while office rents resumed a 
steep uptrend. In the suburbs of Albany and Rochester, office 
vacancy rates fell to all-time lows of 2-3 percent in late 1998, 
while rates in suburban Syracuse and Buffalo were about double that; 
rates in the central business districts, however, continued to be a 
good deal higher.
            <p>
             <b>
              Other Business Activity
             </b>
             <br/>
             Benchmark revisions to state payroll employment produced little 
change in New Jersey, but boosted New York State employment levels 
by roughly 1 percent in both 1997 and 1998. About half of the upward 
revision was in government (which had reportedly been undercounted 
going back to 1993); the other half mainly accrued to finance, 
construction and various services.
             <p>
              Regional purchasing managers surveys indicate a strong rebound in 
manufacturing in February, following a January slump. New York City 
area purchasers report that manufacturing improved sharply in 
February; they also note continued strength in nonmanufacturing 
activity. While prices paid for goods were flat to slightly lower, 
significant price pressures for contracted services re-emerged in 
February, led by computer and architectural services. Buffalo 
purchasing managers report a modest pickup in local manufacturing in 
February, with improvement in new orders and production but 
continued declines in employment; commodity prices were reported to 
be down noticeably in February.
              <p>
               New York City's tourism boom appears to have leveled off--hotel 
occupancy rates were somewhat lower than a year ago in January, 
while daily room rates registered a larger-than-normal seasonal 
decline and were up just 5 percent from a year ago. Albany-area 
hotels registered an increase in occupancy rates over the past year, 
despite a substantial expansion in the number of hotel rooms. Over 
the past year, there has been a sizable decline reported in the 
number of Canadians making day trips to the western New York State 
and an increase in New Yorkers visiting Ontario.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Financial Developments
                </b>
                <br/>
                According to a survey of senior loan officers at small- and medium-sized banks in the Second District, overall loan demand has increased in the past two months--particularly for residential and nonresidential mortgages, as well as for commercial and industrial loans. Refinancing activity turned down over the past two months. Bankers appeared more willing to lend than they were two months ago, 
and credit standards, which had been tightened through most of 1998, 
remained stable.
                <p>
                 Interest rates on residential and nonresidential mortgages remained 
unchanged since the last survey, while consumer and commercial loan 
rates fell. Average deposit interest rates decreased over the past 
two months, as over half of the bankers surveyed reported lower 
deposit rates. Delinquency rates decreased for all types of loans, 
indicating continued improvement in the quality of credit.
