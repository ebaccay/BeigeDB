      Beige Book Report: Boston

     <p>
      <strong>
       June 12, 2002
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions 
              are improving in the First District, according to most business 
              contacts. Manufacturers report that their business is firming or 
              improving compared with recent quarters. Most retailers say sales 
              are picking up, software and IT firms indicate that demand is up 
              either modestly or substantially, and staffing firms cite modest 
              signs of recovery. The region's commercial real estate markets, 
              by contrast, remain in the doldrums.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retailers in New England report improving sales in March, 
                April, and May. Home furniture and automobiles are in high demand. 
                A tourism agency has seen improvement, with a pickup in business-convention 
                attendance and hotel occupancy. Sales results for discount retailers, 
                however, are mixed, with one seeing an unexpected drop compared 
                to a year ago, and another up 10 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some retailers report an increase in employment, 
                while others are holding employment level. A tourism contact indicates 
                that hotels are hiring back service workers who were let go in 
                late 2001. An auto retailer has been hiring in all areas of business. 
                Wage rates are mostly level among retailers, with one company 
                budgeting a 3 percent increase for its fiscal year beginning June 
                1. Vendor prices are said to be fairly stable. Selling prices 
                are holding steady, although hotel rates are down 15 percent compared 
                to a year earlier. Most firms are increasing their emphasis on 
                promotional sales, rebates, special pricing, and added value.
      <p>
       The contacted retailers are expecting their 
                businesses to improve in the next six months. Most respondents 
                feel positive about the future of the economy, with a few foreseeing 
                no change. One contact says, "Despite the economy being a little 
                wobbly, I think things will improve."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most First District manufacturing contacts report that revenues 
                in the first quarter and early second quarter were fairly close 
                to year-ago levels. Companies with more positive results attribute 
                them to acquisitions, expansions of their retail outlets, or development 
                of new products. Manufacturers indicate that they and their business 
                customers are no longer in an inventory-reduction mode, but nonetheless 
                remain intent on controlling inventory and other costs. The prevailing 
                opinion among manufacturers is that the economy will improve later 
                this year, but only modestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many contacts cite signs of slightly improving 
                demand in the last month or two. For example, a paper products 
                manufacturer indicates that business customers are replenishing 
                their inventories. A manufacturer of corporate gift products is 
                getting more requests for quotes, and a maker of business uniforms 
                has seen a pickup. A furniture maker says store traffic appears 
                to be increasing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to the general tone, some lines 
                of business remain stagnant or are slowing. An aircraft components 
                manufacturer says business is down considerably from a year ago 
                and below plan. Other firms supplying travel- and transportation-related 
                nondurables or services say volumes remain below what they were 
                prior to September 11. One equipment maker reports that financial 
                services firms have cut their purchases, while another says biotech 
                and pharmaceutical firms are increasing their purchases at a lower 
                rate than forecasted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Selling prices are mostly flat. Manufacturers 
                cite higher costs for fuel and petroleum products such as plastics 
                and resins. Although paper costs reportedly remain low, contacts 
                make frequent mention of possible future increases for corrugated 
                cardboard. Insurance costs continue to escalate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers remain intent on controlling employment 
                costs and deferring unessential capital spending. Very few firms 
                are adding employees, and almost one-half of the respondents are 
                shutting facilities or installing labor-saving equipment. Pay 
                raises range from zero to 3 percent. Budgets for information technology 
                and air conditioning equipment are especially tight.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Temporary Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The temporary employment industry notes small signs of recovery 
                during the second quarter of 2002. Almost all contacts report 
                either narrowing revenue declines or positive revenue growth compared 
                to a year ago, although profits are minimal. This industry started 
                its downward slide during the second quarter of last year and 
                bottomed out in the third quarter. Since then, many temporary 
                employment agencies have consolidated or restructured.
       <p>
        <p>
         Although many customer industries are still 
                in the doldrums, staffing firms cite pockets of strength—call 
                centers, telemarketing, and customer services—as businesses step 
                up their marketing efforts. The financial services sector is said 
                to be hiring on a moderate scale. Some contacts report stirrings 
                in the light industrial sector, particularly in assembly and light 
                manufacturing. The technology sector, including software, electronics, 
                telecommunications, aerospace, and defense, is lackluster.
        </p>
        <p>
         The supply of well-qualified workers is ample. 
                As a result, many applicants display considerable flexibility 
                in terms of wage demands and choice of work. The loose labor market 
                has also caused some companies to bypass temporary employment 
                agencies and hire directly. Those that do hire through temp firms 
                are generally taking longer to hire and are more interested in 
                short-term placements; they are not eager to add permanent workers. 
                Although wage cuts are rare, wage increases are also minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Temporary employment contacts expect the industry 
                to grow during the third quarter, typically the busiest and most 
                critical quarter of the year. Nevertheless, 2002 is not expected 
                to be a banner year for most contacts.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Commercial Real Estate
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Commercial real estate markets in New England remain weak. Although 
                most contacts state that their local market is "not a disaster," 
                they have little positive to say about recent developments, and 
                some characterize conditions as "lethargic." Even in areas where 
                activity levels are relatively high, most of the action has been 
                due to existing companies' relocation or consolidation, not net 
                absorption. The office market remains stable in Connecticut and 
                Rhode Island, but has deteriorated noticeably in the greater Boston 
                area, with vacancy rates high and rents falling. Rents remain 
                steady in most other markets. Most contacts anticipate no significant 
                improvement before the end of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Software and Information Technology 
                Services
         </strong>
         <br/>
         All respondents report some growth in demand for their software 
                products and services. About half of the respondents report very 
                slow sales growth thus far in 2002 compared with a year earlier. 
                These contacts say their clients remain slow to reinvest in technology. 
                An equal number of respondents report very strong sales growth 
                in the first five months of 2002. Multiple contacts in the healthcare 
                software field report a 15 percent or higher increase in revenues 
                or sales and a growing backlog of orders; other companies report 
                sales that are ahead of their targets. One contact at a strongly 
                performing company mentions some concern over their education-related 
                software because of lingering questions about state and municipal 
                government budgets.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most contacts are uncertain about the 
                future of the economy and also about their business for the rest 
                of 2002. Contacts whose businesses have grown slowly so far expect 
                growth to continue to be slow or possibly slow further, while 
                those whose businesses are performing well consider the future 
                to be somewhat uncertain. As a result, most software and IT respondents 
                are holding headcounts level, although a couple are reshaping 
                their job mix. Longer-term, many respondents are convinced that 
                latent demand exists and will be activated either when the economy 
                improves or clients decide they cannot postpone software or IT 
                purchases any longer.
