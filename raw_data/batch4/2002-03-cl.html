      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       March 6, 2002
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      According to reports gathered the third week 
            of February, business conditions during the first six weeks of 2002 
            remained much the same as in the last six weeks of 2001. Very few 
            signs of further deterioration in conditions were evident in reports 
            from our contacts, and signs of modest improvement continued to emerge 
            throughout the District. The manufacturing sector continued to report 
            slight improvement, retail noted strong sales of home-related items, 
            construction activity remained strong, and, for the first time in 
            more than a year, some improvement was reported in the trucking and 
            shipping industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets, however, continue to struggle. 
              Demand for temporary workers softened again in January, with some 
              contacts reporting that demand for temporary workers was down at 
              least 50 percent from a year earlier. Modest improvement was seen 
              in requests for the first two weeks of February, and most contacts 
              believe conditions will improve during the second quarter, because 
              they are beginning to receive inquiries and initial business proposals 
              requesting temporary help for later in the spring.
      <p>
       Job security is still the number-one concern among 
              organized labor. Hiring freezes remain in effect across most industries, 
              but contacts noted that widespread layoffs in industries such as 
              steel and aerospace during the last three months of 2001 appear 
              to have subsided. Some bargaining units in the public sector reported 
              substantial wage increases (from 5 percent to 8 percent annually). 
              Health care continued to be a point of contention in labor negotiations 
              because employers attempted to pass through some of the increasing 
              costs of health care to their workers. In some cases, disputes over 
              health care benefits have led to strikes.
       <p>
        <b>
         Manufacturing
        </b>
        <br/>
        Modest improvements were seen in manufacturing over the last six 
              weeks, as slightly more manufacturers reported an increase in new 
              orders, and there were slight increases in production throughout 
              the District. Most manufacturers reported lower employment levels 
              than in previous months, but indicated that they did not anticipate 
              more layoffs.
        <p>
         None of the District's automakers reported plant 
              closings during the first six weeks of the year, and a few plants 
              reported three consecutive weeks of scheduled overtime to meet booming 
              demand for their models, the first time this has occurred in the 
              District in more than six months. In the steel industry, conditions 
              remained mixed. Several companies reported that they had implemented 
              3 percent to 5 percent price increases for hot-rolled steel. On 
              the other hand, contacts noted that the length of time it takes 
              to collect accounts receivable has been increasing. Plans for capital 
              improvements remain on hold until steelmakers see substantial improvement 
              in industry conditions. Most contacts believe that this will not 
              occur until fourth quarter 2002: although improvement already has 
              been seen in spot market prices, changes will not be complete until 
              contract prices (which comprise over 60 percent of industry sales) 
              are renegotiated at the end of this year.
         <p>
          <b>
           Retail Sales
          </b>
          <br/>
          As in the last six weeks of 2001, the first six weeks of 2002 showed 
              mixed conditions in the retail sector. Discount retailers continued 
              to report significant improvement in conditions (one contact reported 
              year-over-year sales were up almost 17 percent). Apparel retailers, 
              however, reported continuing declines in year-over-year sales figures, 
              with reports of declines as high as 14 percent for the first six 
              weeks of the year. In general, items related to the home, such as 
              furniture and decorations, electronics, and appliances, have shown 
              strong sales over the last six weeks.
          <p>
           Nearly all retailers noted that their conservative 
              sales plans have led to solid inventory positions. One contact noted 
              that inventories are currently running 25 percent below the same 
              period last year. Most retailers continue to run promotions at a 
              normal pace and have not resorted to heavy discounting.
           <p>
            Most retailers' plans for capital expansion remain 
              in effect, but some have scaled back the number of store openings 
              planned for this year. In general, contacts continue to expect retail 
              sales for the first half of 2002 to be flat or slightly better than 
              the first half 2001 and to improve in the second half of the year.
            <p>
             While some auto retailers reported slight increases 
              in January sales compared with December, most reported that sales 
              were flat compared with January 2001. Although dealers do not expect 
              year-over-year increases for 2002 (sales for 2001 were the second-highest 
              on record), they are optimistic that the pace of sales will improve 
              substantially in late March or early April, and that the higher 
              level of sales will persist throughout the year.
             <p>
              <b>
               Construction
              </b>
              <br/>
              Both commercial and residential builders throughout the District 
              continued to characterize business conditions as "favorable." Most 
              homebuilders reported that customer traffic continues to be strong, 
              with year-to-date sales for 2002 comparable to those the first six 
              weeks of 2001.
              <p>
               Commercial builders are optimistic about business 
              in the months ahead. Like residential homebuilders, they have seen 
              the number of customer inquiries remain unusually strong since the 
              year started. Many expect demand to accelerate in the latter part 
              of 2002; several contacts noted that architects appear to be very 
              busy, a sign that companies are going ahead with plans for expansions.
               <p>
                <b>
                 Trucking and Shipping
                </b>
                <br/>
                Nearly equal shares of contacts reported a decline, constant activity, 
              and an improvement in industry conditions over the first six weeks 
              of 2002. This report is the first time in more than a year that 
              a significant number of contacts noted improvement in the industry. 
              Overall, shipping activity for the first six weeks was slightly 
              off from the same period last year, but the year-over-year decrease 
              has narrowed compared with the year-over-year decline seen during 
              the last six weeks of 2001, suggesting some improvement in conditions. 
              Many carriers also reported that the first two weeks of February 
              showed an increase from January. While most contacts noted that 
              no single product area has been doing relatively well or poorly, 
              some noted that shipping of manufacturing-related goods did not 
              decline and may have been up slightly compared with the last six 
              weeks of 2001.
                <p>
                 Some companies have been able to phase in minor 
              rate increases, but competition has kept companies from raising 
              rates significantly, with some contacts even reporting rate decreases. 
              Diesel prices and associated surcharges remain low and are still 
              less of a concern to carriers than insurance costs, which have increased 
              substantially.
                 <p>
                  Rather than replacing existing trucks and trailers, 
              companies are spending to maintain existing equipment as much as 
              possible to manage costs. Capital expenditures are not likely to 
              show an increase over the low levels reported for 2001.
                  <p>
                   <b>
                    Banking
                   </b>
                   <br/>
                   Competition for borrowers continued to be very aggressive across 
              all lines of lending as the demand for commercial and consumer loans 
              remained soft. Most contacts reported a decrease in demand for commercial 
              loans, while trends in consumer loan demand were mixed among contacts. 
              Roughly half of contacts reported that the credit quality of loan 
              applicants had diminished; the other half reported an unchanged 
              credit quality. Although one contact reported an improvement in 
              the loan delinquency rate, all others reported no change. Most banks 
              reported either no change or a tightening of the net interest margin.
