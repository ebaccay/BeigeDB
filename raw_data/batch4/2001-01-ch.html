      Economic activity in the Seventh District 
              slowed further in December, in part due to severe winter weather 
              adversely impacting virtually all economic sectors. Retailers reported 
              that brutal weather kept store traffic down and, with few exceptions, 
              holiday sales fell below merchants' expectations. Builders and Realtors 
              also cited the weather as contributing to a general slowdown in 
              construction and real estate activity. Recent softening in the auto 
              industry contributed to a further slowing of the District's overall 
              manufacturing activity. Lenders reported moderating growth in business 
              loan volumes while many noted a discernible increase in mortgage 
              refinancing applications. Labor markets, while remaining very tight, 
              appeared to ease somewhat as 2000 drew to a close, alleviating some 
              worker shortages and wage pressures. With the notable exception 
              of heating costs, price pressures appeared to ease slightly as economic 
              conditions softened. Many contacts noted a discernible drop in both 
              consumer and business confidence since our last report. Contacts 
              were more optimistic after the Federal Reserve's unexpected rate 
              cut in early January, but remained cautious in their business expectations 
              for the first half of the year.
      <p>
       <b>
        Consumer Spending
       </b>
       <br/>
       Overall retail sales were very sluggish in the Seventh District 
              through December, contributing to one regionally-headquartered retailer 
              announcing it was going out of business and a few others announcing 
              store closings. Retailers with a national presence suggested that 
              sales in the Midwest fell below the nation's "disappointing" results, 
              as brutal winter weather gripped the region and discouraged shoppers 
              from leaving their homes. With a few exceptions, both discounters 
              and department stores reported lackluster year-over-year sales results. 
              Preliminary reports indicated that nearly 60 percent of respondents 
              to a survey of small retailers in Michigan had fewer shoppers over 
              this holiday season than last year, and an even greater share reported 
              slower sales. Regionwide, cold-weather items (outerwear, auto batteries, 
              etc.) were selling well, and there were reported shortages of some 
              items such as snow throwers, shovels, and sleds. However, sales 
              of electronics, home decorating items, and men's apparel were said 
              to be slow. Contacts reported that shipments of consumer-related 
              durables were fairly strong in December, but one transportation 
              company noted that an increasing share of their business was picking 
              up excess inventory from big-box retailers and returning it to the 
              manufacturers. Contacts also indicated that the region's auto sales 
              were slower than the national average, with demand for domestic 
              nameplates much softer than foreign nameplates. There were a few 
              indications that price pressures at the retail level may have eased 
              somewhat recently. Retailers generally reported that the economic 
              environment necessitated greater price cutting this holiday season, 
              and a contact in casual dining noted that a planned price increase 
              was "put on the back burner" as the economy slowed. However, home 
              heating bills rose sharply in December and may have contributed 
              to slower growth in spending on other consumer goods and services.
       <p>
        <b>
         Construction and Real Estate
        </b>
        <br/>
        Overall construction and real estate activity appeared to soften 
              further in December, but contacts suggested this may have been largely 
              due to inclement weather. Store closings by major retailers were 
              expected to free up millions of square feet of space in the region 
              in the first half of 2001. While this was a source of concern for 
              some real estate contacts, others were looking at it as an opportunity. 
              Consumer traffic was generally low at the stores being closed and 
              freeing the space up for new tenants may reinvigorate many strip 
              malls, according to some analysts. On the residential side, sales 
              of new and existing single-family homes were again relatively soft, 
              but Realtors and builders were quick to point out that sales remained 
              at high levels. In addition, contacts noted that severe weather 
              may have discouraged many would-be buyers from house hunting in 
              December. By contrast, development of multifamily residences remained 
              very strong in the Milwaukee and Chicago downtown areas.
        <p>
         <b>
          Manufacturing
         </b>
         <br/>
         Manufacturing activity slowed further in recent weeks with virtually 
              every segment showing signs of softening. Even the auto industry, 
              the region's star performer in recent years, was sluggish. Nationwide, 
              December's light vehicle sales for domestic nameplates were significantly 
              below year-ago levels, with particular softness in passenger cars. 
              With weaker sales and sales expectations, as well as excessive inventories, 
              automakers were planning "significant" downtime for some assembly 
              plants in the first quarter. New orders for heavy equipment continued 
              to slow substantially across practically all categories, but inventories 
              were said to be in good shape due to earlier production cutbacks. 
              December shipments of gypsum wallboard were below a year ago, and 
              prices continued to erode. Demand for steel products, while still 
              strong, softened somewhat, and foreign competition continued to 
              put a strain on domestic producers. One industry analyst suggested 
              that conditions in December were the worst for domestic steel producers 
              since the early 1980s. According to this contact, unprecedented 
              downward price pressures, due in large part to a flood of imports, 
              forced some companies to file for bankruptcy and has left very few 
              domestic steel producers "economically viable." Lower steel prices, 
              however, translated into lower input costs for producers of other 
              manufactured goods, including office furniture. In contrast to other 
              industries, demand for office furniture remained strong, despite 
              modest softening in new orders toward the end of 2000.
         <p>
          <b>
           Banking and Finance
          </b>
          <br/>
          Overall lending activity remained strong in the District, but not 
              quite as robust as in early 2000. Growth in business loan volume 
              continued to slow in late December according to most contacts, despite 
              strong demand from small and medium-sized businesses. Overall quality 
              on business loans generally was described as good, but many bankers 
              were "keeping their eyes on" specific industries (especially retail 
              and manufacturing) for any signs of deterioration. Business credit 
              standards may have tightened further in recent weeks, and one lender 
              suggested that some loans approved a year ago would have "zero chance 
              of being approved now." On the household side, lending activity 
              was mixed. Some bankers reported a notable decrease in new mortgage 
              originations as 2000 drew to a close. Contacts were unclear, however, 
              as to whether this drop was due to deteriorating market conditions 
              or simply to harsh weather conditions. At the same time, many lenders 
              noted increased refinancing activity as fixed-rate mortgage interest 
              rates continued to move lower. Several contacts expressed optimism 
              that refinancing activity would pick up further in the first quarter. 
              Some banks, particularly smaller ones, again reported difficulty 
              in attracting deposits to fund loans. With recent stock market volatility, 
              a few lenders were anticipating a boost in deposits as investors 
              were expected to seek less risky investments. However, one analyst 
              suggested that funds that fled the stock market found their way 
              into other investment vehicles, but not into bank deposits.
          <p>
           <b>
            Labor Markets
           </b>
           <br/>
           Labor markets generally remained very tight in the Seventh District, 
              although there were increasing reports that some slack may have 
              developed. After falling more or less steadily for three straight 
              years, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits rose dramatically 
              above seasonal trends in November and December. Many of these claims 
              were the result of layoffs in manufacturing industries. Some retailers 
              announced that layoffs were in the offing, but most industry analysts 
              were confident that these workers would be quickly reabsorbed. Some 
              service industries that had difficulty attracting workers in the 
              past reported greater success in the last few weeks of 2000. Staffing 
              agencies indicated that new orders for temporary help softened toward 
              the end of December, although one agency noted that clients weren't 
              sending workers back, they just weren't placing new orders for additional 
              help. Contacts suggested that wage pressures appeared to ease modestly 
              as a result of softer demand for workers. Additionally, in contrast 
              to our previous reports, there were no further reports of intensifying 
              pressure on non-wage employment costs.
