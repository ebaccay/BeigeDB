      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy improved slightly in late August and September.   Retailers and auto dealers reported stronger sales and anticipated further gains   in the months ahead. Sales were weaker at restaurants and hotels, leading to   pessimism in these industries as the holiday season approaches. Manufacturing   activity rose at durable goods factories, and the high-tech services industry   experienced strong growth, while transportation activity was flat. Residential   and commercial real estate and construction contacts continued to report weak   conditions. Bank deposits continued to increase, while loan demand and loan   quality deteriorated slightly. Crop conditions varied across the District, but   farm income expectations remained strong. The energy sector expanded further   with production increasing for oil, natural gas and coal. As input prices   continued to increase, more contacts expected to raise prices in the coming   months. But wage pressures eased from already low levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In late August and September, consumer   spending increased in the retail and auto sectors but declined slightly in the   restaurant and travel sectors. District retailers reported strong sales and   expected additional increases during the next three months. Luxury goods, such   as jewelry and custom-upholstered furniture, sold particularly well. One contact   noted an uptick in sales among both high-end and low-end customers, but reported   that those in the middle were holding back. Auto sales were also higher than   expected despite several contacts describing low consumer confidence due to   economic and political uncertainty. Many auto dealers reported difficulty   finding qualified sales people and technicians. Restaurant sales were lower than   anticipated but were expected to remain steady over the next three months.   Despite slightly lower average room rates, hotel occupancy decreased, and   District hotel owners expected further declines in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   and high-tech service activity continued to grow during the survey period, while   transportation activity was flat. Manufacturing activity increased at durable   goods factories, particularly firms producing aircraft and computer equipment.   These increases helped to offset a slight decline in activity at non-durable   goods plants. Shipment and new order volumes edged up during the survey period,   and firms expected both to improve over the coming months. With an overall   increase in activity, firms hired additional workers and slightly increased   employee hours. Manufacturers continued to anticipate higher capital spending   over the next six months, but these expectations were dampened somewhat compared   to the previous survey. The high-tech industry reported steady growth in sales,   and firms expected activity to be strong over the next three months.   Transportation activity was flat during the survey period, and contacts reported   continued difficulty finding skilled technicians and drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial   real estate activity remained weak during late August and September. Residential   sales were flat during the survey period, and home prices were down. Real estate   contacts expected sales to be much slower in the coming months, but many   attributed this to the seasonal slowdown. Residential mortgage lenders continued   to report an increase in refinancing activity due to low mortgage rates, but   very little new loan activity. Construction supply firms saw sales fall during   the survey period, and they expected upcoming sales to be weak due to the   seasonal slowdown of the construction industry. Housing starts were flat, and   builders did not foresee activity increasing in the next three months.   Multi-family building projects were the only area of reported growth by   commercial construction contacts. Commercial real estate sales and prices   continued to decline, and vacancy rates were flat. District contacts expected   commercial prices and rents to decline further in the coming months. Developers   reported no change in their access to credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the recent survey period, bankers reported   increased deposits, but somewhat weaker loan demand and a slight deterioration   in loan quality. Overall loan demand decreased slightly as demand for consumer   installment loans declined, while demand for commercial and industrial loans,   commercial real estate loans, and residential real estate loans was marginally   weaker. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan   categories, and deposits increased for the sixth straight survey. Bankers   reported a minor deterioration in loan quality compared to a year ago but   anticipated some improvement in the outlook for loan quality over the next six   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions continued to vary   across the District. Northern portions of the District, which received ample   rain, expected bumper crops, while crops in the southern portions of the   District continued to suffer under drought conditions. Most of the corn and   soybean crops in Nebraska were rated in good or better condition as harvest   began, while Kansas expected yields well below average due to drought. Winter   wheat planting was delayed in some areas of Oklahoma as farmers waited for rain,   but planting was on schedule in Kansas and Nebraska. Despite recent downturns in   crop prices, farm income expectations remained strong. Robust export demand   supported livestock prices, but high feed costs trimmed profit margins. Farm   loan demand remained weak as capital spending slowed further and some producers   paid cash for higher input costs. District contacts indicated that prices of   farmland sold at auction continued to post record highs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity continued to expand in late August   and September, and activity was expected to grow further over the next three   months. The number of active drilling rigs for both oil and natural gas   increased in the District. Oklahoma and Wyoming showed the largest growth in rig   counts, which helped to offset slight decreases in New Mexico and Kansas.   Contacts continued to report that future drilling activity was being constrained   by a lack of qualified labor and the availability of equipment and supplies.   Contacts reported having a difficult time attracting experienced skilled workers   due to increased competition among firms. The price of crude oil was expected to   decrease over the next three months, but natural gas prices were expected to   increase as winter demand increases. Coal production increased slightly during   the survey period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported higher prices   for both inputs and finished goods, but wage pressures eased from already low   levels. More manufacturers reported increases in raw material prices and   finished goods prices in September, and most expected further increases over the   next six months. Input prices also rose for building materials, especially   roofing materials. Prices held steady at retail stores but were expected to   increase in the coming months. Restaurant contacts also anticipated raising menu   prices as food prices continued to climb. Contacts from several industries   reported difficulties finding qualified workers for skilled positions, but fewer   firms than in recent surveys reported increasing wages in response. Across all   industries, most contacts expected wage increases to remain stable over the next   three months.
