      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy grew modestly since the last survey with   expectations of further improvement in the coming months. Consumer sales edged   up at retail stores and auto dealerships, and District contacts were hopeful   that rising consumer confidence would boost future sales. Residential real   estate activity improved slightly, but real estate agents expected expiring tax   credits to weigh on the housing rebound. While the commercial real estate market   remained stressed, District contacts noted a slight improvement in leasing   activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity expanded modestly, transportation activity   strengthened, and factory managers expected further production gains. Bankers   reported improved expectations for loan quality, and credit standards were   generally unchanged. Energy activity expanded further as oil and natural gas   production increased. Agricultural conditions improved with higher livestock   profits and farmland values. Despite higher input prices, retail prices and wage   pressures remained low, and few firms planned to pass through additional costs   to consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continued to improve,   and many contacts expected further gains in retail sales. Spurred by lower   prices and promotional advertising, retailers reported a rise in sales led by   summer apparel items and lower-priced appliances. Auto dealers reported strong   demand for used vehicles, which helped boost auto sales and reduce vehicle   inventories. Some contacts felt rising consumer confidence would encourage   future auto sales. Restaurant sales declined with fewer diners and a flat   average check amount. With the onset of seasonal travel, tourism activity and   hotel occupancy rose. Further improvements in the tourism and hotel industries   were expected as summer travel picks up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity improved slightly in April and May, while the decline in commercial   real estate activity slowed. Lower priced single-family homes sold well in April   as buyers rushed to take advantage of tax credits. In contrast, sales of   higher-priced homes slowed, contributing to a rise in home inventories. Real   estate agents expected home sales to fall in the coming months due to expiring   tax credits and weak job growth in some areas of the District. After rising in   the last survey period, residential construction activity held steady. Mortgage   lending activity rose with new home purchases, and loan refinancing volumes   increased with lower mortgage rates. Commercial real estate activity remained   weak and below year-ago levels. However, lower rents appeared to slow the rise   in vacancy rates and raise absorption rates since the last survey period.   District contacts expected leasing activity to rise faster than sales activity   for commercial property in the coming months. Commercial construction activity   continued to decline due in part to difficulty accessing credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   activity grew at a modest pace in April and May while transportation firms   reported sustained growth. After several months of solid gains, the pace of   production moderated at both durable and non-durable goods producing plants. The   volume of new orders, order backlogs, and shipments edged down from March levels   while finished goods inventories rose slightly. Employment levels were stable   and fewer firms planned to increase payrolls. Still, manufacturing activity   strengthened compared to a year ago, and more plant managers expected factory   production to ramp up in the next six months. Some District manufacturers noted   an increase in supplier delivery times, and sales activity in the transportation   sector rose further. Most transportation firms anticipated the rebound would   continue through the summer. Some companies were having difficulty finding   qualified drivers, and a few contacts raised concerns about future capacity   constraints. The high-tech industry reported a slight uptick in sales activity,   partly due to an increase in government contracts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported steady loan demand, higher   deposits, and an improved outlook for loan quality. Overall loan demand was   essentially unchanged, following a series of declines over the last year. Demand   for commercial and industrial loans was flat, while demand for commercial real   estate loans and residential real estate loans increased moderately. Consumer   installment loans continued to trend downward. Credit standards were generally   unchanged. Slightly more bankers reported an improvement in loan quality from   one year ago than reported a deterioration. Also, for the first time since late   2007, respondents expected stable rather than declining loan quality over the   next six months. Deposits increased moderately after showing no change in the   previous three surveys.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy production expanded since the last survey   period, and additional gains were expected in the coming months. The number of   active drilling rigs in the District rose further, primarily due to expansion in   Oklahoma and New Mexico. Some firms reported difficulty finding qualified   workers, especially engineers. Crude oil prices were expected to rise due to an   uptick in demand from the industrial sector and higher gasoline use for summer   travel. Since the last survey, fewer contacts expected further declines in   natural gas prices. However, several natural gas producers were concerned that   prices would remain low due to excess supply. With increased production and   limited demand, supplies at natural gas storage facilities grew at a record   pace. Though District coal production slowed in April and May, year-to-date   volumes approached 2009 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions improved since the   last survey period. Overall, the winter wheat crop was reported in good   condition. However, prolonged cool, wet weather promoted wheat crop diseases,   which could reduce yields in some areas of Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Corn   planting was almost complete while soybean planting was slightly behind   schedule. Crop prices were little changed since the last survey period, but hog   and cattle prices rose significantly with further contractions in supplies.   Improved incomes among livestock producers contributed to a rise in District   ranchland values. Cropland values also increased with strong farmer demand and   nonfarm investor interest. Agricultural lenders reported a slight decline in   loan repayment rates, but loan renewals and extensions held steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage and retail price pressures remained   low in April and May; however, input prices rose for some District firms.   District labor markets improved slightly and contacts generally reported little   wage pressure and few problems finding qualified workers. After falling in April   and May, retail prices were expected to dip further in the coming months, and   builders expected lumber prices to fall from their recent spike. However,   materials prices, especially steel, rose sharply for District manufacturers. In   addition, transportation companies noted rising fuel costs, and restaurant   owners paid higher food prices. Despite rising input costs, most District   contacts were reluctant to increase selling prices.
