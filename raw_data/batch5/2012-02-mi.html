      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew at a firm pace since the last report.   Strength was noted in consumer spending, professional services firms, commercial   and residential real estate and construction, manufacturing, energy and mining,   and agriculture. Lack of snowfall reduced tourism activity. Some more firms   announced plans to expand hiring, while wage increases were modest. Overall   prices were level, but some increases were noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was   solid. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased about 4 percent   in January compared with a year ago. A Minneapolis area mall manager reported   relatively strong traffic during January. A Minnesota-based restaurant and bar   chain reported that same-store sales were off to a good start in January and   February. A fast food chain recently announced plans to add more restaurants in   Minnesota. A representative of an auto dealers association in Montana noted that   recent vehicle sales were higher than a year ago and that availability of new   and used cars has improved. Repair shops in eastern Montana were very busy   repairing oil-drilling-related vehicles. However, due to the surprisingly mild   winter, many District auto repair shops reported a decrease in business because   of fewer snow- and ice-related accidents.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism was down due to low snowfall in much of the District. The lack of   snow in Minnesota and Wisconsin has stymied snowmobiling and cross-country   skiing. Snowmobile dealerships reported a sharp drop in sales from a year ago.   However, a Minnesota travel company reported strong demand for both corporate   and leisure travel in January; interest in traveling to Europe and other   overseas destinations was up. Another travel agency noted that recent corporate   travel sales were up almost 25 percent compared with a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The unusually warm weather   aided construction activity. The value of commercial building permits in the   Sioux Falls, S.D., area was up in January from January 2011. A major   Minnesota-based commercial real estate company expects more construction of   retail and warehouse structures. Residential construction increased from a year   ago. The value of residential building permits increased significantly in the   Sioux Falls area in January. The number of single-family building permits   increased in Minnesota and North Dakota in December 2011, compared with December   2010. Multifamily construction in the Minneapolis area is in a "boom," according   to a major real estate firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate market activity increased. A large warehouse property   manager noted increased transaction activity over the past few months. A major   Minnesota-based broker noted increased leasing of office space. Home sales in   January were up from the same period a year ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul   area, and the inventory of homes for sale continued at low levels. Several   brokers noted that the low end of the market appeared to shift to a "sellers'   market." The multifamily market continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter of   2011 as rents increased and vacancy rates decreased in many markets, according   to a real estate research firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity at professional business services firms   increased at a solid pace since the last report. Of the 33 firms that responded   to a mid-February ad hoc survey, 63 percent saw revenues increase over the past   three months, while only 16 percent experienced revenue drops. Over the next   three months, 59 percent expect increased revenues and only 6 percent expect   sales to drop. A human resources consulting firm noted increased activity with   "more proposals and opportunities." An architectural firm noted increased   activity and demand, but said the competition remains "fierce."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing expanded at a firm   pace. A January survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,   Neb.) found that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and the Dakotas.   An electrical equipment producer is opening a new facility in Minnesota. An   aerospace firm announced plans to locate a plant in Montana. A producer of   automotive cooling systems is expanding operations in South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors continued at strong levels. District oil and gas exploration increased   since the last report. In Montana, construction began on what will be the   state's largest wind energy development. In addition, regulators in Montana   approved an $86 million wind energy project. Iron mines in northern Minnesota   were operating at near capacity. A Canadian mining company discovered large iron   and titanium deposits near Duluth, Minn., but any mining operations are several   years away.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture remained strong. January prices   received by farmers for corn and cattle increased. Prices declined somewhat for   wheat, soybeans, hogs, dairy products, eggs and poultry, but all prices were   above their January 2011 levels. According to preliminary results from the   Minneapolis Fed's fourth-quarter (January) survey of agricultural credit   conditions, 67 percent of District lenders reported that farm incomes increased   in the previous three months; 10 percent reported decreases. However, drought   conditions spread in Minnesota, the Dakotas and District portions of Wisconsin.   Low snowfall combined with erratic temperatures were having an uncertain effect   on the District's winter wheat crop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some more firms announced   plans to expand hiring. An airplane manufacturer announced plans for a new   facility in northwestern Wisconsin that will initially create 300 jobs. A   marketing company plans to expand its operations in Minnesota and eventually   hire 200 more workers. Also in Minnesota, a clothing supplier will add 150   employees at a new facility, and a boat manufacturer expects to rehire former   employees laid off during the recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, some employment cutbacks were announced. A Minnesota-based food   retailer will cut about 200 jobs at the company's headquarters. A bank will lay   off almost 70 employees at an auto-debt-collection unit in South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases were modest. Workers at two food operations recently agreed to   a new contract that includes some wage increases over a five-year period. Bank   directors recently reported that business contacts expected wage increases   between 2 percent and 3 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 after remaining level   over the past couple of years. Larger increases were noted in the oil-drilling   area of western North Dakota and eastern Montana, particularly for welders who   were in short supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall prices were level, but some increases were noted. Minnesota gasoline   prices were up 15 cents per gallon since early January. Bank directors noted   that health insurance costs were up between 6 percent and 8 percent over a year   ago, with some reports of steeper increases.
