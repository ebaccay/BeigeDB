      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 8, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Signs of slowing or contracting economic activity became more prevalent in   the Fifth District since our last report. Manufacturing activity continued to   expand, but a slowdown in the pace of expansion that began several months ago   continued into August. Tourism also improved, although discounting was often   needed to attract visitors. We received mixed reports of activity at   services-providing firms, while retailers reported flat-to-weakening sales over   the last month. The financial and real estate sectors generally remained soft,   with several reports by residential Realtors indicating further declines in both   closed and pending home sales in recent months. The agricultural sector enjoyed   increased rainfall, but the benefits were too late for some crops. Survey   respondents in the retail sector cited cuts in the number of permanent job   hires, but temp agencies noted increased demand for workers from the   manufacturing sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales sputtered in August, with most   merchants reporting either flat or contracting activity. Sales declined at   several building supply businesses as well as lawn and garden retail   establishments. An executive at a hardware store chain in central Virginia   commented that sales were flat, and he had redistributed inventory across store   locations as part of an ongoing cost reduction plan to survive the weak housing   market. The store manager for a discount chain store in central North Carolina   reported erratic apparel sales; however, he and several other retailers were   relieved that early results from back-to-school sales on other items were at   least satisfactory. Although grocery store sales generally grew, an executive at   a Southwestern Virginia location reported that "margins are under constant   pressure." Big-ticket sales remained weak, according to several contacts. A car   dealer in the Tidewater area of Virginia and another in the South Carolina   Piedmont indicated that their dealerships were seeing gradual improvement.   However, contacts at other dealerships reported a slowdown in sales. In   addition, several contacts at department stores expressed worry about soft   holiday sales later this year. Our survey respondents indicated that retail   price growth was moderate; average wages in the service sector rose.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Services-providing firms also gave mixed   reports. Contacts at healthcare organizations noted that demand was typical for   the summer, while airport officials and electrical contractors saw a small   increase in demand for their services. A telecommunications contact reported   accelerating revenues, while several administrative-support firms cited flat or   slowing revenue growth. Local officials in Norfolk, Virginia noted that a   recently announced shut-down of major military facilities would affect a large   number of civilian contractors. Community leaders indicated that they will be   vying for other military projects. Price growth slowed slightly at services   firms in recent weeks, according to survey respondents.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity continued   to expand in late July and August, but some sources indicated a slowdown in   demand over the last month. A chemical manufacturer commented that new equipment   was being installed at his company with the expectation that the economy would   continue to grow. Moreover, a packaging manufacturer informed us that demand was   stronger at his company, and a parts supplier indicated that raw material   inventories had decreased and his suppliers were having a hard time keeping up   with demand at his firm. He added that his company was working Saturdays to meet   demand and that inventories of finished goods remained below desired levels. A   majority of survey respondents reported that shipments, new orders, and   employment continued to grow, but at a slower pace than a month ago. Some   declines were reported; for example, a manufacturer of exterior doors for   residential housing said that all activity had ground to a halt in the building   products industry. He noted that the slowdown started in May and continued   through August.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Banking was widely described by contacts as weak   and relatively unchanged since our last assessment. Several bankers noted that   consumer loan demand remained soft, as consumers continued to reduce debt, and   mortgage demand centered mostly on refinancing with existing clients. Small   business loan demand was also described by most contacts as soft, as firms   struggled with weak demand. One community bank official stated that auto dealers   had difficulty obtaining floor-plan loans, even though they needed more   inventory to support the current sales rate. A bank economist reported some   improvement in equipment expenditure financing, which was mostly to replace   out-dated technology and not to increase capacity. Tighter controls on credit   cards, such as higher fees on overdrafts, were cited by one banker as limiting   consumers' credit card usage. Credit quality was mostly unchanged, with several   bank contacts noting no increase in delinquencies or late payments.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Real estate markets remained weak over the   last four to six weeks. There were more reports of declining activity,   especially in the residential sector. For example, several Realtors indicated   that closed sales were flat to down in July and pending sales dropped in August   both from a year-ago and on a seasonally adjusted month-over-month basis.   Moreover, the home sales that did occur were dominated by foreclosure and short   sales. A housing expert in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia stated that, with   mortgage rates low and prices still falling, buyers were very picky and in no   hurry to close deals. Several Realtors complained about buyers having more   difficulty obtaining financing and about the amount of time required to get   mortgage loan approvals. One Realtor stated that sales activity would benefit   substantially if banks could speed up the process. Most Realtors cited   continuing declines in home prices. Most Realtors said that the high-end market   was extremely sluggish and often limited to corporate relocations. In contrast,   however, a Realtor in the greater Washington, D.C. area reported that July sales   were stronger than expected and that homes below $250,000 generally moved   quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the commercial side, construction remained soft and there was continuing   downward pressure on rents. Several commercial Realtors stated that both   uncertainty about the economy and confusion about recent reforms were key   factors in holding back sales and construction. Most contacts noted that vacancy   rates were still rising. One developer attributed less demand for new building   space from small business startups to the fact that laid-off workers were facing   diminished savings due to the severe stock market and real estate slumps. In   addition, a paving materials supplier reported that local sales of crushed   stone, which is used as a base for laying concrete and other paving materials,   were non-existent. State and local governments cut back construction projects as   well, according to contacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Tourist activity strengthened across the District   since our last report. Along the District's coast, a contact in Myrtle Beach   said that visitations were up in recent weeks, compared to a year ago, with   slightly longer stays. Considerable increases in discretionary expenditures also   positively affected the retail and hospitality sectors. However, reports from   Baltimore, Washington, and Charleston, S.C. indicated that, while tourism picked   up, stays were shorter and spending was lower than in the past. A manager from   Virginia Beach also stated that, even though hotel bookings were up, vacationers   were shortening their length of stay. A contact from Charleston, S.C. mentioned   that hotel occupancy was up substantially from a year ago, although hotels were   discounting to get people "in the door." People were often described as "taking   staycations"-- visiting nearby attractions, such as theme parks, museums, and   historical areas, rather than taking vacations away from home. Contacts both   along the seaboard and at mountain resorts reported that bookings for the Labor   Day weekend were stronger than a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Markets
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports on Fifth District labor market   activity was generally mixed in recent weeks. In service sector labor markets,   survey respondents said that hiring was flat at services-providing firms, while   retail job cuts were widespread. However, survey respondents from most   manufacturing industries indicated continued mild expansion of employment and   weekly production hours, but average wages slowed. Several contacts at temporary   employment agencies reported generally stronger demand for temporary help since   our last report, particularly in manufacturing. For example, a contact at an   automotive plant told us that they had hired both additional full-time employees   and temporary labor. Increased demand for temporary workers was reported by a   wide array of service industries, including professional services, life   sciences, banking, health care, and government.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In many sections of the District, soaking   rains helped to refresh crops and improve pasture conditions. It was too late   for corn, however, and in some areas of Virginia farmers shifted   drought-stricken corn fields to cover crops and small grains. Analysts in   Virginia reported that the corn harvest had very poor yields. Elsewhere in   Virginia, flooding resulted in damage to silage corn, tobacco, vegetables, and   both standing and baled hay. In contrast, the corn harvest was ahead of schedule   in the Carolinas, although heavy showers hampered field work for some growers in   both states. In West Virginia, pasture conditions ranged from very poor to   excellent, but most fields were reported to be in fair to poor condition. Also,   cattle producers in Virginia continued to cull herds due to reduced feed   supplies. On a brighter note, ninety-four percent of peaches had been harvested   in South Carolina, and the watermelon and cantaloupe harvest was nearing   completion in that state. In Maryland, the peach harvest was 80 percent   completed and apples were 20 percent harvested.
