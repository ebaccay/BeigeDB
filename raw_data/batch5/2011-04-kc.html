      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 13, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy expanded solidly in late February and March. Consumer   spending rebounded in March after severe weather limited February sales. Factory   production rose sharply, allowing manufacturers to rebuild inventories and   fulfill a surge in new orders. Residential construction remained weak, and   commercial construction rose modestly. Strong commodity prices boosted profits   at energy and agricultural enterprises. District bankers reported weaker loan   demand, higher deposits and improvements in loan quality. Despite tighter labor   markets, especially for skilled workers, District contacts did not expect to   raise wages in order to hire new workers. More manufacturers and distributors   expected to pass through higher raw material and fuel costs to finished goods   prices, and more retailers expected to raise selling prices in the coming   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending picked up following   weather-reduced sales in the last survey period. After firming in late February   and March, retailers expected sales to rise in the next three months. Store   managers noted an uptick in sales of apparel and decorative items. One jewelry   store, however, noted that high gasoline prices were cutting disposable incomes   and trimming sales. After slowing in the last survey, auto dealers reported   robust sales, particularly for used cars, fuel efficient vehicles, and SUVs.   Dealers were optimistic that sales would rebound further. Restaurant operators   reported stronger sales despite a continued decline in the average check amount.   Tourism activity edged up, and vacation destinations were hiring for the summer.   Colorado resorts reported the number of skiers this season exceeded year-ago   levels. Some District hoteliers raised room rates in response to higher   occupancy rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District   manufacturing activity expanded rapidly and business activity for high-tech   service and transportation firms improved in late February and March. Factory   managers reported a surge in production and shipments at both durable and   non-durable goods plants. New orders jumped in March, boosting order backlogs as   firms replenished finished goods inventories. Raw material inventories rose with   some reports of stockpiling to meet anticipated demand and to protect against   further price increases. Expectations for future factory orders, production, and   shipments remained positive. Some manufacturers were hiring workers, and others   expanded the average work week. After softening in the last survey period, sales   rose at high-tech service and transportation firms with further improvements   expected. Transportation companies struggled to find qualified drivers, and some   high-tech firms had difficulty filling specialized positions, such as software   developers. With brisk demand, factories and high-tech service firms ramped up   capital spending and planned additional hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity remained slow with subdued growth prospects, while commercial real   estate activity stabilized with expectations for improvement. Home building   edged down since the last survey period, and construction supply sales were   below expectations. Even with a seasonal upturn in residential home sales, the   inventory of unsold homes grew substantially as more homes were placed on the   market and real estate agents anticipated further home price declines. Driven by   less demand for refinancing, mortgage loan activity plummeted, and builders   noted the mortgage loan approval process was taking longer. After falling in the   last survey period, commercial construction activity picked up modestly and was   expected to hold steady over the next three months. District commercial real   estate contacts reported an uptick in sales with stable prices and rents. Office   and multifamily property leasing was particularly strong. Vacancy rates remained   elevated but were expected to move lower as absorption rates gradually   improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the recent survey period, bankers reported   weaker loan demand, but also rising deposits and improvements in loan quality.   Overall loan demand decreased as demand for commercial and industrial,   residential real estate, consumer installment, and commercial real estate loans   declined. For the fifth straight survey, credit standards remained unchanged in   all major loan categories. Deposits increased further in the recent survey   period. Bankers also reported improvements in loan quality compared to a year   ago, and they expected further improvements over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural growing conditions worsened in   late February and March, but farm income and farmland values strengthened.   Winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further as drought conditions in the   southern Plains intensified. While farmers are expected to plant more acres to   corn and soybeans this spring, crop prices continued to rise as robust food and   bio-fuel demand was expected to strain global supplies. Livestock prices   strengthened with rising demand and stronger exports, preserving profits despite   higher feed costs. Producers continued to pay off loans, shrinking loan demand.   Lenders, however, expected a modest rebound in demand for farm operating loans   before spring planting and indicated ample funds were available for qualified   borrowers. Farmland prices rose further with strong crop prices and a limited   number of farms for sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District energy activity rose since the last   survey period with plans for further expansion in the coming months. District   contacts reported increased drilling activity, with exploration shifting away   from natural gas towards crude oil. While many energy companies were hiring,   some indicated that a lack of qualified labor and limited availability of   equipment and services could constrain future drilling activity. Natural gas   prices held steady at the close of the winter heating season but were expected   to fall as inventory levels were considered sufficient. Crude oil prices rose   sharply in late February and March, and contacts felt that political and   economic instability in some producer nations would keep prices high for the   near future. Ethanol profits held steady as rising ethanol prices offset higher   costs of corn inputs. The Bureau of Land Management announced plans to conduct   competitive lease sales of coal land in the Powder River Basin that will provide   additional production for Wyoming's coal industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wages generally held steady even with   expanded hiring, and more firms planned to increase selling prices, especially   in industries where input prices have surged. Of the companies that added staff,   most were not offering higher salaries to attract applicants. With the exception   of highly competitive or specialized positions, wage pressures were expected to   remain contained. Many District manufacturers reported another jump in raw   materials prices, and some companies had already raised finished goods prices   with more firms planning to do so in the coming months. Several construction   suppliers and transportation companies reported fuel and delivery surcharges   were common, and higher input costs were often being passed through to customer   prices. Some restaurants increased menu prices in reaction to higher food costs,   and some hotels raised room rates. District retailers also expected an uptick in   selling prices with stronger consumer demand.
