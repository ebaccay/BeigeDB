      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, business activity in the Third District has grown at a somewhat   faster pace compared with the previous Beige Book. The overall sentiment has   been more positive, although the very mild winter weather may have played a   part. Since the last Beige Book, manufacturing activity has grown further with   more broad sectors contributing to the gain. Retail sales maintained steady   year-over-year increases. Motor vehicle dealers experienced unseasonably strong   sales growth overall; however, results varied by state. Third District banks   have reported slight growth in lending and continued improvement of credit   quality since the last Beige Book. New home construction started the year strong   with the warm weather assist. Commercial real estate contacts continued to   report steadily improving markets for industrial, retail, and office space.   Overall, service-sector firms reported continued growth. Price pressures have   remained contained for most sectors, with little change from the last Beige   Book.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most firms have expressed a brighter outlook since the last Beige Book.   Manufacturers anticipate rising shipments and orders during the next six months.   Retailers expect slightly stronger sales, and auto dealers are increasingly   confident that the current surge in sales will carry into the spring selling   season. Banking, real estate, and service-sector firms continue to plan for slow   growth in 2012. In general, contacts seemed to prefer talking about recent   positive trends rather than reiterating their uncertainty. However, their   concerns continue to include the ongoing slow housing recovery, Europe's   economic problems, and federal budget indecisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since the last Beige Book, Third District   manufacturers have reported further increases in new orders and shipments. Gains   were widespread among the makers of food products, lumber and wood products,   primary metals, instruments, and electronic equipment. A supplier to the broad   industrial market stated that demand accelerated over the past several months   and that the production capacity of many manufacturing clients was picking up.   Contacts also reported that work was returning from overseas and that foundries   were reaching capacity. The primary metals sector reported strong demand from   the automotive and heavy equipment sectors. Among the makers of instruments and   of electrical machinery, some contacts indicated that the level of demand seen   recently has been the highest since near the beginning of the recession. Even   the housing sector contributed to slight upticks in demand, according to   contacts from two firms that produce housing-related products.
     </p>
     <p>
      About nine out of 10 Third District manufacturers expect business conditions   to improve or stay the same during the next six months; most expect their   business to increase. This optimism permeates nearly every broad manufacturing   sector. Increasingly, our contacts cite signs of stronger economic growth,   although some of the expected increase reflects seasonal trends. Risks from   Europe's problems and constraints from a weak housing market continued to add   uncertainty to the outlook, according to some contacts. Expectations of capital   spending and future hiring have strengthened since the last Beige Book.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers reported little drop-off   from the holiday shopping season -- maintaining steady year-over-year sales   increases. One industry contact reported better than normal sales for January;   another reported perceptible, gradual improvement. All contacts conceded that   the mild winter weather may have increased activity, although sales of winter   clothes and gear have suffered. Price competition remains tough and shoppers are   still very budget conscious, according to some contacts. Overall, retail   contacts were a bit more optimistic but remain cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales strengthened further in January and February, especially for   Pennsylvania dealers. New Jersey dealers had a stronger December, which may have   pulled sales forward from January; this was in part due to financial-sector   workers spending their year-end bonuses. The outlook for auto sales remains very   strong. Industry contacts indicated that some larger dealers have begun hiring,   mostly in sales. More hiring is expected if robust sales continue into the   spring season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, loan volumes were flat to up slightly in   the Third District since the previous Beige Book. The issuance of home equity   lines and home mortgages, including refinancing, increased the most, although   some contacts were unwilling to write 30-year mortgages at the current low   rates. Commercial real estate and C&amp;I lending remained flat. Banking   contacts reported low demand for some lines and early paydowns in others.   Overall, credit quality continued to improve. One financial contact reported   that the pace of loans going into delinquency has slowed, although the rate   being resolved by foreclosure or workout remained flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential builders   reported strong activity and sales in January and early February. One   Pennsylvania builder said it was the strongest January in several years. A New   Jersey builder closed deals that had been initiated in November and then dragged   through December; the builder also reports a good backlog of sales. The mild   winter weather helped with production and may have boosted traffic. Contacts   cited a more active resale market as a positive trend but expressed concern over   higher gas prices and increased compliance costs in the mortgage market. A   residential broker also reported a stronger January than last year. Builders   reported hiring some sales staff. The outlook among builders and brokers is   modestly more positive. However, a broker cautioned that increased sales   activity will first spur the shadow inventory to emerge and add to the active   inventory, before the active inventory can begin to shrink.
     </p>
     <p>
      Brokers and managers of nonresidential real estate have reported generally   improving conditions for industrial, retail, and office space since the last   Beige Book. The industrial market remains strong, and gains are spreading to the   weaker South Jersey market area. High-end and low-end retail markets are   especially strong. Mid-value retail, including grocery stores, which often   locate in community shopping centers and street retail properties, is   struggling, producing higher vacancies. Office market contacts reported that   signs of pent-up demand are emerging that will lead to positive net absorption   by year's end. The overall outlook for nonresidential real estate has improved   since the last Beige Book, but growth will remain modest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District service-sector firms generally   have reported further growth since the last Beige Book. A logistics firm   reported very strong year-over-year results through the first six weeks of 2012.   Despite some expressed concerns, the contact is hopeful that this strong pace is   maintained or improves when "freight season" begins in March. Though somewhat   skeptical of the sudden surge in confidence and market enthusiasm, one contact   quipped, "I won't fight the tide!" Advertising dollars are expected to build   through the year with the Olympics and the presidential election. One staffing   firm reported a surprising dip in new orders compared with last year and a shift   to short-term orders that are not indicative of growth. The majority of   service-sector firms anticipate growth will steadily improve in 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price levels have remained contained   since the previous Beige Book. Auto dealers and freight shippers still command   favorable pricing power. Price pressures are mixed among manufacturing firms,   with some firms unable to pass their higher costs along. Retailers and   homebuilders continue to report tight margins. Wages are reported to be flat,   and some firms have substituted lower cost temporary contract workers to reduce   their overall wage bill. House prices are expected to fall further; however,   nonresidential rents are stabilizing and concessions are scarcer.
