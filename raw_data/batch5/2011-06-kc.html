      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth in the Tenth District economy remained solid in May. Consumer spending   grew further, and transportation and high-tech firms reported generally strong   activity. The energy industry continued to expand at a robust pace, and   agricultural activity was mostly positive with generally favorable growing   conditions and rising farmland values. Bankers reported mostly steady loan   demand, better loan quality, and rising deposits. Growth in manufacturing   activity slowed somewhat but remained modestly expansionary. Residential and   commercial real estate activity was generally stable but still slow. Business   contacts were mostly optimistic about future sales, and a number of firms   reported increased capital spending and hiring plans. Prices rose more slowly,   but wage pressures were limited outside of select industries and occupations   with labor shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continued to grow   solidly, and most contacts expected further growth in the months ahead. Retail   sales accelerated and nearly all retail contacts reported that sales were above   year-ago levels. Sales of apparel and seasonal garden supplies were noted as   particularly strong, while a few contacts characterized sales of appliance and   some high-end items as weak. Store inventories edged higher, but most stores   were satisfied with current stock levels. Auto sales continued to increase, but   the pace slowed somewhat from the previous survey. Auto inventories declined   further, and several dealers reported additional supply constraints due to the   natural disaster in Japan. Restaurant sales were strong, and travel and tourism   activity remained favorable. Most restaurant and tourism contacts expected solid   activity heading forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in   District manufacturing activity slowed following rapid growth in recent months,   while other business activity expanded further. Factory orders declined after   surging earlier in the spring, but factory hiring continued at solid rates and   firms remained relatively optimistic about future sales. Growth in   transportation activity accelerated from the previous survey, and most firms   reported optimism about future sales. The majority of high-tech services firms   reported strong growth in sales, though the pace slowed a bit from the previous   month. Capital spending plans improved for transportation companies, and   high-tech and manufacturing firms also reported fairly solid plans for future   expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial   real estate activity was stable but still generally slow. The decline in housing   starts leveled off in May, and new home construction activity was similar to   year-ago levels. Expectations for future homebuilding improved from the previous   survey, and materials were generally available. Residential construction supply   firms reported an uptick in sales, partly driven by demand for storm related   items such as roofing and decking materials. Home sales were higher than the   previous month but lower than a year ago. Expectations for future home sales   were modestly positive, but home inventories climbed higher and home prices   continued to edge down in most areas. Mortgage lending activity improved from   the previous survey but was well below year-ago levels, particularly for   refinancing activity. Commercial real estate activity was mostly flat, though it   was slightly stronger than a year ago and contacts had a more positive outlook   for future months. Vacancy and absorption rates were steady but expected to   improve. Office prices and rents declined and were below year-ago levels in most   cities. One contact noted continued obstacles in financing, and another firm   said projects have decreased in overall size.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported generally stable loan demand,   increased deposits, and improvements in loan quality. Overall loan demand was   stable to slightly lower in some cases. Demand for commercial and residential   real estate loans was generally unchanged, while demand for commercial and   industrial loans and consumer installment loans decreased. Credit standards   largely remained unchanged in all major loan categories. Deposits increased for   the third straight survey. Bankers reported improvements in loan quality   compared to a year ago, and the outlook for loan quality was more favorable. The   majority of bankers expected bank employment to remain unchanged over the next   year, citing low expected growth, cost constraints, and uncertainty about   regulations and government policies as the major reasons restraining hiring   plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity continued to expand strongly in   May. Nearly all contacts reported an increase in drilling activity and were   optimistic about the months ahead. Crude oil prices remained elevated and   favorable for drilling, and natural gas activity rebounded somewhat with a   recent uptick in prices. Contacts reported that shortages of equipment and labor   continued to somewhat restrain the rate of increase in drilling activity.   Several companies have expanded their capital expenditure plans, mainly for   projects directed towards drilling and exploration.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rising farm income spurred record high   farmland values and cash rental rates. Crop prices rose further with higher   export demand, especially from China. Record pork exports bolstered hog prices,   but increased cow slaughter and weaker than usual demand for grilling cuts   dampened cattle prices. Many producers used cash rather than debt to pay for   higher input costs, and farm equipment sales remained robust. Agricultural   growing conditions varied in May. Recent heavy rains held up the start of the   winter wheat harvest with early reports of below-average yields in   drought-stricken areas. Despite planting delays due to wet fields, the corn and   soybean crops were progressing normally.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price levels generally rose at a slower   rate in May, and wage pressures were mostly contained despite solid hiring   plans. Manufacturing price increases remained common, but with some slowdown in   materials price increases and with fewer firms planning to raise selling prices.   Construction supply firms also reported a moderation in selling price increases,   but builder input prices were considerably higher than the previous survey.   Retail prices increased further and were expected to continue rising in future   months. Transportation firms reported an increase in input prices, and   restaurants said menu prices were well above year-ago levels. Wage pressures   were still contained in most industries. However, some firms reported   difficulties finding skilled workers and were forced to raise wages,   particularly in information technology fields. Hiring plans have improved for   most firms, particularly those in the energy, information technology,   health-care, and manufacturing sectors.
