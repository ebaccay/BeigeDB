      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from contacts for October through mid-November  continued to paint a mixed picture of economic activity in the Sixth  District.  Retail reports suggested that  year-over-year sales growth had moderated somewhat, and vehicle sales fell short  of expectations.  In contrast, tourism  reports were generally positive.  According  to homebuilders and Realtors, new and existing home  sales remained well below year-ago levels in October and the pace of new home  construction continued to decline.  The  inventory of homes for sale remained high across much of the District.  Manufacturing reports varied by sector; the  pace of production slowed for most manufacturers linked to residential housing,  but remained strong for firms connected to energy, medical, and defense-related  industries.  Banking contacts noted moderating  loan demand and higher foreclosure and mortgage delinquency rates in many  areas.  Labor markets remained tight in  parts of the District, but there were reports of increased layoffs in  construction and some housing services industries.  Price pressures were centered on energy and  food products.  Exceptional drought  conditions in areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee continued to hamper crop production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending  and Tourism
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports from  District retail contacts indicated that year-over-year sales growth had  moderated somewhat since September.  The  majority of contacts reported that inventories were up from a year ago, and  several contacts stated that inventories were higher than desired.  Looking ahead, retailers remained cautiously  optimistic, with most anticipating positive year-over-year sales growth over  the next several months.  October vehicle  sales fell short of expectations for most regional contacts.  Domestic-brand sales continued to be soft,  while foreign-brand dealers reported weaker retail sales than in the last  report.  Vehicle inventories were  generally higher than expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism reports  were largely positive.  Foreign travel has  boosted leisure and hospitality activity in Florida,  and industry contacts expect Canadian travel to the Sunshine   State to increase to record numbers  this winter because of appreciation in the Canadian dollar.  Hotel and resort occupancies in South   Florida increased, in part because of increased business from Europe  and Latin America.   A North Florida hotel contact said that the pace  of bookings for next year is solid.   Gaming revenue remained strong along the Mississippi   Gulf Coast.  All tourism industry contacts indicated that  increasing gasoline prices were a significant risk factor for the outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Homebuilders and Realtors reported  that new and existing home sales remained well below year-ago levels in October  and inventories remained at high levels across much of the District.  In addition, the pace of new home  construction continued to decline sharply and contacts noted intensifying  downward pressure on new and existing home prices.  The majority of contacts anticipate weakness  in home sales will persist, although some builders remained optimistic that new  home sales will improve over the next several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      October reports on  commercial construction indicated that activity was flat to down slightly  compared with a year ago.  Most Florida  contacts continued to report fewer projects in the pipeline compared with last  year at this time, while outside of Florida  there were scattered reports of declining backlogs.  Several contacts noted that high insurance  costs remained a stumbling block for commercial development along the Gulf   Coast.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports indicated that the pace of  production slowed for most manufacturers linked to residential housing.  Contacts supplying building materials for  residential housing markets reported that demand remained weak and inventories  were high.  A concrete company producing  material for the multi-family housing sector noted that production was down  significantly.  More positively,  manufacturers producing goods for the defense, medical, and energy industries  reported strong activity.  In addition,  firms producing for the export market noted improved business and a positive  outlook.  Freight service firms reported  lower shipments of housing-related construction goods and autos.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Banking contacts reported rising mortgage  delinquency and higher levels of foreclosure.   Institutions noted that lending standards and terms had tightened for  consumer and C&amp;I loans.  Commercial  loan demand also appeared to be softer, according to some reports.  Several contacts reported that the pipeline  of new development projects was lower than earlier in the year, with the  exception of medical and public sector projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment  and Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Labor market  conditions remained generally tight in most parts of the District.  Several employers noted a continuing shortage  of skilled labor.  Labor costs in  southeastern Louisiana are  reportedly starting to climb because of increased demand for labor in the  refinery and petrochemical industries.   Contacts reported a lower demand for workers in several housing-related  activities such as construction, building material and fixture manufacturing,  the sale of homes, and landscape services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price reports were mixed.  Weak  housing markets continued to adversely affect District suppliers of building  materials and fixtures.  Demand for  milled lumber, for example, is weak and prices have declined further.  In contrast, some food prices have risen  substantially.  According to one contact,  there have been double-digit increases in prices received for flour, sugar, and  soy.  Prices are reportedly also  increasing for milk and corn products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and  Natural Resources
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Regional  drought conditions continued to trouble the District's farming sector.  Crop production and yields were off sharply  for most growing areas except Louisiana.  Meanwhile, greenhouse and nursery growers  were challenged by the lower demand caused by slower new home construction and  higher operating costs.  One large  regional nursery has been forced into bankruptcy because of reduced demand  associated with the drought.  Citrus  production estimates are above last year's weak crop that was affected by the  hangover from the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes and disease-related losses.  However, dry weather predictions and scarce  water supply from two major river basins could seriously limit the near-term  outlook for citrus and other Florida  crops.  Higher oil prices have led to an  increase in exploration as well as plans to expand refinery operations in the  District.
