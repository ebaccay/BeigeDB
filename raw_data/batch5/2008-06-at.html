      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixth District  business contacts indicated that overall economic activity remained weak from  mid-April through May.  Several retailers  and auto dealers reported that sales were disappointing, but tourism activity  continued to be positive.  Reports from  homebuilders and Realtors indicated that home sales and prices remained below  year-ago levels.  However, most Florida  homebuilders we contacted stated that new home sales were flat to slightly up  on a year-over-year basis.  District  contractors indicated that commercial development remained soft and most  industrial contacts reported that production and shipments were down from year-ago  levels.  Banking industry contacts  reported loan demand for all types of loans was slightly lower.  Labor markets displayed additional signs of  weakness with contacts in several industries citing plans to limit hiring and,  in some cases, reduce payrolls.  Further  price increases were noted in energy, metals, and agricultural goods.  Business' ability to pass through higher  input costs to customers varied.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District merchants reported that the pace  of sales decelerated from year-ago rates during late April and May, with  overall activity described as below expectations and inventories higher than a  year ago.  Weakness in building materials  and home-related durables persisted.  The  outlook among retail contacts was mixed, but most did not expect a significant  increase in sales in the near-term.  Most  auto dealers reported disappointing sales during late April and May for both  domestic and import brands.  Inventories  of trucks and SUVs were up significantly in early May, according to industry  reports.  Demand remained healthy for  hybrid and small-engine vehicles, however.   Tourism-related sales in the District remained strong with international  visitors boosting activity in Florida,  and the New Orleans convention and  tourism sector continued to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports from homebuilder and Realtor  contacts indicated that new and existing home sales remained below year-ago  levels in April and May in most areas.   For the first time in over two years, Florida  homebuilders reported that new home sales were flat to slightly up on a  year-over-year basis.  Sales of new homes  outside Florida were described as  below year-ago levels.  Realtors in Florida  and other Sixth District states conveyed that existing home sales remained  below year-ago levels.  Both homebuilders  and Realtors continued to note declining 
home prices throughout the  District.  New home inventories continued  to moderate while inventories of existing homes increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from  District contractors indicated that the pace of commercial development was  below that of a year-ago.  The majority  of contacts continued to report that commercial construction declined during  late April and May compared with a year ago.   Order backlogs continued to shrink while material costs continued to  rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Most industrial contacts reported that  production and volume of shipments were down from year-ago levels.  In addition, many cited higher production  costs and cuts in employment or hours.   Slumping home sales and weak construction have led to layoffs in  District companies producing items such as carpet, appliances, and building  materials.  Automobile production  continued to decline as well.  Steel,  defense-related, and energy-related production increased further, according to  contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trucking and rail  contacts reported lackluster activity in late April and May.  Freight demand remains soft, and escalating  diesel prices have added pressure to several regional trucking firms.  Regional rail activity was reportedly down through  mid-May from year-ago levels, with a sharp drop in shipments of automotive and  construction materials offsetting gains in coal and farm products.  Inter-modal shipments were down slightly from  year-ago levels
      <em>
       .
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District contacts reported loan demand  for all types of loans was trending slightly lower.  Demand for mortgages was particularly weak,  while consumer and retail loan demand was described as soft.  Commercial loan demand was reported as mixed  and varied by location.  Lenders are  applying stricter underwriting standards for most types of loans.  Deposit growth was generally described as  restrained at District banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Labor markets weakened in late April and  May with many construction firms and building materials suppliers noting plans  to decrease their labor force.  Contacts  in several other industries plan to limit hiring in the immediate future and,  in some cases, cut payrolls as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fuel and  petrochemical price increases were noted across the District.  Increases in the prices of metals and  agricultural goods were also observed.   There were more reports of these price increases being passed on.  However, notable exceptions were construction  firms, building materials producers, and businesses  that were restricted by existing fixed-price agreements with their  customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Spring
      <strong>
      </strong>
      rains improved agricultural conditions across much of the District.  However, some areas in Florida  have had no significant rainfall since April.   With dry pasture conditions, Florida  ranchers are reporting hay shortages and are selling off livestock to relieve  grazing pressures.  Agricultural firms across  the region noted higher costs of fuel, fertilizer, and feed.  Market conditions for local poultry and  cotton remained favorable because of strong global demand and a favorable  international pricing environment.
