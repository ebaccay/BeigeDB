      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace since 
  the last report. Businesses report increasingly widespread cost pressures, but 
  thus far there has been no broad-based acceleration in consumer prices. The 
  labor market has shown further signs of strength since the last report, except 
  in the construction industry, where some slackening is reported. On balance, 
  retailers report that sales remained close to plan since the last report, while 
  tourism activity has strengthened. Firms involved in goods production and distribution 
  report increasingly favorable business conditions in May. More generally, however, 
  business and household surveys suggest increased concern about the outlook for 
  the second half of the year. Housing markets showed further signs of softening 
  in April and May, though Manhattan's rental market is reported to have tightened. 
  However, office markets across the New York City metro area were steady to stronger 
  in April and May, with scattered signs of acceleration in rents. Finally, bankers 
  report across-the-board weakening in loan demand, particularly for consumer 
  loans, as well as easing in credit standards and lower delinquency rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report mixed results for May, with department stores indicating that 
  sales were on or above plan but discounters reporting sales below plan. Retail 
  contacts continue to note fairly brisk demand for higher-end merchandise, but 
  weakness in lower-end lines. Sales of home furnishings continue to be one of 
  the more sluggish categories. Overall, inventories are reported to be at favorable 
  levels, and selling prices remain relatively steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity in New York City has picked up since the last report: Manhattan 
  hotels report strong business in April, with occupancy rates rising by more 
  than the seasonal norm and room rates up nearly 11 percent from a year earlier. 
  Similarly, Broadway theaters report strong attendance for both April and May, 
  following a brief slump in March--attendance rose 4% from a year earlier, while 
  total revenues were up by well over 10 percent in both months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer confidence in the region, which reached a nearly 4-year high in March, 
  declined moderately in both April and May, based on the Conference Board's survey 
  of Middle Atlantic state (NY, NJ, Pa) residents. There was a pronounced drop 
  in consumers' expectations, but their assessment of current conditions remained 
  fairly positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's housing market has shown mixed but generally softer signs since 
  the last report. New Jersey homebuilders report that they continue to adjust 
  down their expectations for the local housing market; some builders in the midst 
  of the authorization process are reported to be withdrawing and allowing their 
  options to build to expire. One industry expert is now advising appraisers to 
  assume a flat to downward trend in prices, as opposed to an upward trend. Cumulative 
  widespread increases in fuel and materials costs are reported to be pinching 
  homebuilders' profits; however, builders report some slackening in labor demand 
  and little or no upward pressure on wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The market for existing homes has also shown further signs of softening since 
  the last report, but observers differ on the nature and extent of a slowdown. 
  In New Jersey, the inventory of unsold homes continues to be much higher than 
  a year ago, with the increase reported to be concentrated at high end of the 
  market (over $500,000). The New York State Association of Realtors reports some 
  weakening in sales activity in March and April, and notes a sharp deceleration 
  in prices in the suburbs around New York City. A major Manhattan appraisal firm 
  reports a fairly large supply of apartments on the market and less of a spring 
  pickup in co-op and condo sales than usual this year. However, a major Manhattan 
  real estate firm notes that apartment prices have held steady and attributes 
  the growing inventory of homes on the market largely to a surge in newly constructed 
  units coming onto the market, rather than weakening demand. Manhattan's rental 
  market has reportedly strengthened since the last report, reflecting a lack 
  of new rental construction, a dwindling number of listings and continued strong 
  demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office markets across the New York City area were steady to stronger since 
  the last report, with vacancy rates easing off and rents accelerating in some 
  areas. In April and May, office vacancy rates were little changed in northern 
  New Jersey, southwestern Connecticut and Westchester County, and down moderately 
  in Long Island and Midtown Manhattan. Lower Manhattan's vacancy rate rose, due 
  to an increase of 1.7 million square feet of available space with the opening 
  of 7 World Trade Center in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major NYC employment agency, specializing in office jobs, reports steady and 
  strong job market conditions since the last report. This contact also notes 
  that salary offers continue to run more than 10 percent ahead of a year ago 
  while the qualifications of available job applicants are noticeably weaker than 
  a year ago. Purchasing managers in the Buffalo and Rochester areas report some 
  strengthening in general business conditions and a pickup in hiring activity. 
  More broadly, New York State manufacturers continue to report generally favorable 
  business conditions in May, though they express somewhat less optimism about 
  the six-month outlook than they have for some time. Firms outside the manufacturing 
  sector also report strong growth in business activity but a number of companies 
  in shipping and financial services express increased concern about prospects 
  for the second half of 2006. Both manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms 
  report increasingly widespread price pressures and expect further boosts in 
  the months ahead. A trucking-industry expert notes that business remains fairly 
  strong and that firms have been able to add fuel surcharges with relatively 
  little resistance from customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small to medium-sized banks in the Second District report decreased demand for 
  all types of loans since the last report--most notably for consumer loans. Bankers 
  also report increasingly widespread softening in refinancing activity. Credit 
  standards eased, particularly for consumer loans, with no banker reporting tightened 
  standards, and 24 percent reporting eased standards; this is the most widespread 
  easing reported on consumer loans since we began asking this question in 1997. 
  Bankers again report broad increases in both loan rates and deposit rates. Finally, 
  banks report lower delinquency rates across all loan categories: in each category, 
  more than 20 percent of firms report declines in delinquencies, while fewer 
  than 4 percent report increases.
