      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21 , 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy in the Fourth District has shown a few signs of improvement since   our last report, though overall activity is sluggish and the recovery remains   fragile. Reports from factories indicated that production was steady to up   slightly, with increases being attributed to new orders and seasonal   adjustments. New home sales showed a modest improvement, while commercial and   industrial construction continued at a slow pace. Credit availability remains a   major issue for residential and commercial contractors. Sales by District   retailers were flat to up slightly. New motor vehicle sales fell since the   "cash-for-clunkers" program ended, whereas purchases of used vehicles improved.   Coal production declined, with little change noted in oil and gas output.   Reports indicated an uptick in freight transport volume. Demand for new   commercial and industrial loans was soft, while consumer lending was flat to   down. Core deposits continued to grow substantially at most banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The only industries reporting notable employment reductions were commercial   construction and coal mining. Staffing firm representatives had mixed responses   when asked about the number of new job openings. However, a majority said that   they received more requests for temps rather than permanent employees. Given the   weak labor market, wage pressures are contained. We heard several reports of an   uptick in steel prices. Otherwise, raw materials and product pricing were   relatively stable. Business fixed investment remains at reduced levels, with   little change expected in the upcoming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reports from District factories showed   that production was steady to up slightly during the past six weeks, with   increases being attributed to new orders and seasonal adjustments. On a   year-over-year basis, factory output remains depressed. A majority of our   contacts expect output to remain at current levels or show a gradual improvement   going into 2010. Shipments by steel producers and service centers held steady or   increased slightly, with reports indicating a small uptick in demand from a wide   range of industries. Our steel contacts expect shipments will track seasonal   trends, but at reduced levels, through the end of the year. District auto   production rose substantially during August on a month-over-month basis.   Increases can be attributed to beginning production of 2010 models, restocking   dealer inventories, and the aftermath of the GM and Chrysler restructurings.   Production of both domestic and foreign nameplate vehicles in the District   remained well below year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of our contacts said that they are in the process of further   reducing inventories or are not replenishing existing stocks. Capacity   utilization remains below historic norms, with little change noted over the past   six weeks. Capital expenditures continue to be substantially below pre-recession   levels, and only modest adjustments are expected in the upcoming months. Reports   show that other than an uptick in the cost of steel (especially stainless), raw   materials and product pricing was relatively stable. On net, there was little   change in staffing levels, and wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A majority of home builders we contacted said   that sales improved slightly during the past six weeks, and are comparable on a   year-over-year basis. Entry-level sales are doing particularly well, while the   high-end market is sluggish. Looking forward, builders see new home construction   proceeding at a slow pace. They are also very concerned about credit   availability and the withdrawal of the first-time home buyer tax credit. Many of   our contacts reported that they are unable to obtain financing to build any spec   homes. There has been little change in the pricing (list and discounting) of new   homes during the past few months, while materials prices were stable. General   contractors continue to operate with skeleton crews, and subcontractors are   readily available at competitive rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial construction continues to be sluggish, though   activity in public works projects has picked up. All of our respondents said   that business has fallen on a year-over-year basis. Inquiries are coming in at a   much slower pace, while backlogs are down substantially for nearly all builders.   Most contacts expect construction activity will be weak in the upcoming months,   and it may be a year before a recovery begins. We continued to hear numerous   accounts of difficulties in obtaining financing for private-sector projects. For   the most part, construction materials prices were stable. A majority of our   contacts reported reducing the size of their workforce during the past six   weeks, while subcontractors are charging significantly lower rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that sales   from mid-August through mid-September were flat or had improved slightly on a   month-over-month basis, while remaining below year-ago levels. Reports show that   consumers continue to focus on purchasing necessities rather than discretionary   items and are very price sensitive. Retailers' expectations for fourth-quarter   sales were decidedly mixed. Vendor and retail pricing has been relatively   stable, though we heard two reports of some downward pressure on core food   items. Retail inventories continued on the lean side. Reports from auto dealers   indicated that new vehicle sales dropped since the cash-for-clunkers program   ended, with half of our contacts characterizing sales decline as modest. In   general, purchases of used vehicles have improved since cash-for-clunkers was   withdrawn. Vehicle inventories remain low. Most dealers expect future sales to   track seasonal trends, but at a lower level. All of our contacts commented that   new vehicle purchases are heavily dependent on incentives and promotions.   Difficulty in obtaining credit remains a serious issue for consumers and   dealers. On balance, there has been little change in staffing levels or labor   costs at retailers and auto dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New demand for commercial and industrial loans   was soft during the past six weeks. However, several bankers reported a rise in   refinancing existing debt that was turned away by other institutions. Some   large, regional banks are seeing increased pay-downs and lower overall volumes.   Interest rates and spreads were steady to increasing. On the consumer side, loan   demand was characterized as flat to down, with part of the decline caused by the   withdrawal of the cash-for-clunkers program or other bank promotions. Reports on   residential mortgage applications were mixed, with some improvements credited to   falling rates. Core deposits continued to grow substantially at most banks.   About half of our contacts said that they have tightened lending standards even   further, especially for loans tied to construction. Credit quality of loan   applicants has deteriorated somewhat since our last report, more so on the   business side. There continues to be a slight upward trend in delinquencies,   especially for commercial loans and loans tied to real estate. For the most   part, workforce sizes are stable and no wage pressures were reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Coal executives reported a continuing sharp   decline in production on a year-over-year basis, with no turnaround expected in   the upcoming months. One executive said that contract prices for coal have   dropped 50 percent from a year-ago. Little change in oil and gas output was   reported, while drilling activity was steady or slowly declining. Most reports   showed that prices received for oil were little changed, while those for natural   gas were up slightly. For the most part, the cost of production equipment and   materials has stabilized. However, we heard two reports of a rise in fuel   prices. Capital spending by coal producers remains on hold, while expenditures   by oil and gas producers stayed on plan. Employment levels in the oil and gas   industry were stable, while coal executives reported additional workforce   reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Almost all freight transport contacts   reported a slight improvement in shipping volume during the past six weeks, with   several commenting that volume growth has been uneven and shipping rates remain   competitive. Although no end market stands out, several contacts noted increases   in auto-related shipments. Looking forward, a majority of our contacts expect   slight incremental improvements in volume. Capital spending remains at low   levels. Nonetheless, two trucking executives reported that they have committed   to purchasing a substantial amount of replacement equipment during the last   quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2010. On the labor front, most   hiring is limited to replacements.
