      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The economy of the Eighth District has continued to expand at a moderate pace   since our previous survey. Retail and auto sales in October and early November   increased over year-earlier levels. Recent reports of planned activity from   manufacturing firms have been positive. In contrast, reports from services   contacts have been negative on net. Residential real estate market conditions   have continued to improve, while commercial and industrial real estate   conditions have remained mixed. Reports of lending activity at a sample of large   District banks indicated little change during the third quarter of 2012. Prices   wages, and employment levels have remained generally stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported that retail sales in   October and early November were up, on average, over year-earlier levels.   Fifty-four percent of the retailers reported increases in sales, while 27   percent saw decreases and 19 percent saw no changes. Forty-eight percent of the   retailers noted that sales levels met their expectations, 48 percent reported   that sales were below expectations, and 4 percent reported that sales were above   expectations. The sales outlook through the end of the year was mostly   optimistic: 66 percent of the retailers expect sales to increase over 2011   levels, while 17 percent expect sales to decrease and 17 percent expect sales to   be similar to last year’s levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Car dealers in the District reported that sales in October and early November   were up, on average, compared with last year. Fifty percent of the car dealers   surveyed saw increases in sales, while 21 percent saw decreases and 29 percent   saw no changes. Twenty-four percent of the car dealers noted that new car sales   had increased relative to used car sales, while 6 percent reported the opposite.   The sales outlook through the end of the year was mostly optimistic: 64 percent   of the car dealers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, while 14 percent   expect sales to decrease and 22 percent expect sales to be similar to last   year's levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports of   plans for manufacturing activity have been positive since our previous report.   Several manufacturing firms reported plans to hire new workers or expand   operations, while fewer manufacturers reported plans to lay off workers or   reduce operations. Firms in the plastic, poultry processing, shoe and apparel,   aerospace, paper product, and beverage manufacturing industries announced plans   to hire new employees or expand operations. In contrast, firms in the   compressor, coal, semiconductors and related devices, auto parts, and food   manufacturing industries announced plans to lay off workers or reduce   operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports of planned activity in the District’s service sector have been   negative on net since our previous report. Firms in business support,   telecommunications, casinos, legal, and crisis management services announced   plans to increase employment or expand operations. In contrast, a greater number   of service firms, including firms in air transportation, sports, information,   health insurance, health care, and financial services, announced plans to lay   off workers or reduce operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Home sales increased   throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with   the same period in 2011, September 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 15   percent in Louisville, 4 percent in Little Rock, 11 percent in Memphis, and 14   percent in St. Louis. Residential construction also increased. Compared with the   same period in 2011, September 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits   increased 40 percent in Louisville, 25 percent in Little Rock, 36 percent in   Memphis, and 19 percent in St. Louis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial and industrial real estate conditions were mixed throughout most   of the District. A contact in Louisville reported that office and industrial   space leasing in the third quarter of 2012 was less robust than in the previous   quarter. A contact in northeast Arkansas reported strong commercial real estate   activity in the Jonesboro-Paragould area but soft activity in other areas in the   region. Commercial and industrial construction activity continued to improve   throughout most of the District. Contacts in Little Rock noted a couple of   commercial construction projects in the downtown area. A contact in south   central Kentucky noted that commercial construction remains strong. A contact in   Memphis noted new speculative construction in the suburban market. Contacts in   Memphis also reported several commercial construction projects in Jonesboro and   large industrial construction projects in Shelby County.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks found little change in overall lending activity   during the third quarter of 2012. During this period, credit standards for   commercial and industrial loans remained largely unchanged, while the demand for   these loans and the number of inquiries ranged from moderately decreased to   moderately increased. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were   unchanged, while demand remained largely unchanged. Credit standards for prime   residential mortgage loans remained generally unchanged, while demand ranged   from about the same to substantially stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards and   demand for consumer loans remained largely unchanged, although a third of the   banks reported that demand for auto loans was moderately stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Natural Resources
       </strong>
       <br/>
       As of early November,   the rice crop in the District states was fully harvested; similarly, over 90   percent of the corn, cotton, sorghum, and soybean crops have also been   harvested. Harvest completion rates were 3 to 12 percentage points higher than   their 5-year averages. Planting of winter wheat across the District states was 8   percent ahead of its 5-year average, while over 90 percent of all winter wheat   was rated in fair or better condition. Excluding eastern Kentucky, the   District’s year-to-date coal production for the end of October was 6.4 percent   higher compared with the same period last year. Meanwhile, the District’s coal   production for October 2012 was 6.2 percent higher than in October 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices, Wages, and Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts indicated that   price levels over the past three months have stayed the same relative to the   same period last year. Similarly, non-labor costs have generally stayed the   same, although the majority of manufacturing contacts noted increases in costs.   The majority of contacts reported that wages per employee and benefits per   employee over the past three months have stayed the same relative to last year.   Employment levels over the past three months showed signs of improvement; 38   percent of contacts reported increases in employment compared with the same   period last year, while about half of contacts reported that their total   employment has remained the same relative to last year.
