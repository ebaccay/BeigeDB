      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 6, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, business activity in the Third District continues to improve, but the   pace has slowed slightly in most sectors since the previous Beige Book.   Manufacturing activity has eased slightly, but most major manufacturing sectors   continue to grow. After a strong first quarter, partially due to the   unseasonably mild weather, retail sales slowed somewhat in April but appear to   be gaining strength based on customer traffic in May. Although sales remain   strong overall, motor vehicle dealers also reported softer sales in April. Third   District banks report steadier growth in lending and continued strong credit   quality since the last Beige Book. Demand for new home construction has eased   off a bit, but brokers report stronger sales of existing homes. Several signs of   improvement were cited by commercial real estate contacts. Overall,   service-sector firms report continued growth. Price pressures have eased   slightly in some sectors since the last Beige Book.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook remains optimistic, but more firms readily noted the slow pace of   the recovery relative to the sunnier views expressed in the last Beige Book.   Manufacturers' expectations for the next six months, although diminished, remain   positive. Retailers continue to expect steady improvement. Auto dealers   anticipate continued strong sales. Banking, real estate, and service-sector   firms are slightly more optimistic but continue to plan for slow growth in 2012.   In general, business plans reflect caution, and businesses have resumed a more   realistic perspective on the limitations of the current recovery and the risks   to its longevity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since the last Beige Book, Third District   manufacturers have reported virtually no change in shipments and just the   slightest decline in new orders. Gains continue among the makers of food   products, lumber and wood products, fabricated metals, industrial machinery, and   instruments. Firms in the primary metals and electronic equipment industries   report a fall-off in demand. According to various contacts, growth is attributed   to warm weather, automotive demand, production returning from China, Marcellus   Shale activity, and renewed customer optimism.
     </p>
     <p>
      About eight out of 10 Third District manufacturers expect business conditions   to improve or stay the same during the next six months â€“ somewhat less   optimistic than reported in the last Beige Book. Except for primary metals,   optimism is present in all major sectors. Firms seem relatively divided as to   whether high energy costs are a concern, depending largely on their ability to   pass the cost along to their customers. New to the list of concerns and   uncertainties about the outlook is the increasing worry that political gridlock   will lead to large cuts in defense-related production through sequestration.   While caution remains, firms have reported a little more optimism as have their   customers. However, manufacturers have expressed somewhat lower expectations of   future capital spending and future hiring since the last Beige Book.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers reported that the   surprising early sales gains held up through March, then fell back some in   April. Year-to-date, gains have remained positive through April. Sunny weather   has continued to boost traffic in May; bus counts at outlet malls are nearly   double last year's level. Small businesses in less urban markets are struggling   as consumers adjust to higher gas prices by cutting retail purchases. Retail   contacts remain cautiously optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in Pennsylvania shifted from strong in March to moderately strong   in April. Very low borrowing costs for inventories have helped to support   dealers' profitability. A large New Jersey dealer reports that retail auto sales   are off year-over-year through April but that fleet sales are strong. Profits   are also off. The dearth of auto sales in recent years has created a slump for   dealer service sales; they must compete harder to retain customers with aging   cars that typically are taken to independent garages. The outlook for auto sales   remains positive. Hiring remains spotty and depends on brands carried, fleet   business, and local economic conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, loan volumes have continued to grow in   the Third District since the previous Beige Book. While activity remains uneven,   banks report increasing signs of a steady recovery. Loan demand continues to be   strongest for inventories and capital equipment to manufacturers and for   investments in the higher education, health care, and technology sectors, and in   multifamily housing. Most contacts report solid credit quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential builders report   some softening in May traffic and sales due to a combination of typical seasonal   slowing and a drop-off from the atypically strong first-quarter sales.   Construction crew members for one Pennsylvania builder are working 45 to 70   hours per week; the builder is hiring cautiously as the builder's pace of   activity slowly picks up. Residential brokers report "seeing genuine   improvement": Year-to-date sales through mid-May exceed last year's and are over   plan. A broker reported that much of its workforce operates on a shortened week,   and it will exploit this substantial excess capacity before hiring more staff.   The outlook among builders and brokers remains positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential real estate activity has been generally positive since the   last Beige Book, with several contacts citing increased leasing activity   throughout the District, including southern New Jersey. Despite ongoing demand,   Philadelphia's Center City office market has slowed a bit, as the bulk of   existing class-A trophy space is now under agreement. Several contacts also   cited a few large build-to-suit projects that have gone to bid and are awaiting   approvals before construction begins. Other contacts noted reluctance among   transportation contractors to hire more workers, given the uncertain future of   public infrastructure funding due to the increasingly short funding horizon of   the federal transportation authorization bill. The overall outlook for   nonresidential real estate has brightened slightly since the last Beige Book.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District service-sector firms have   generally reported positive growth since the last Beige Book. Job postings have   risen at area universities, local advertising sales have been strong, and area   theme parks are attracting increasing numbers of foreign visitors (notably from   China). Contacts note little recent change in defense-related activity; however,   concerns are mounting that significant federal spending cuts on defense and   civil contracts may result from sequestration or its alternative, political   compromise. Employers continue to make liberal use of staffing firms; however,   staffing contacts report that employers' sense of urgency to fill specific slots   is often low. Overall, service-sector firms retain a positive outlook for growth   through the remainder of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price levels have eased slightly since   the previous Beige Book and remain generally constrained. Industry contacts   indicated that gas prices have stabilized and are expected to ease through the   summer. Manufacturing firms report lower cost factors since the last Beige Book.   Home builders anticipate cost increases for materials if activity picks up more   quickly; however, the current gradual pace of recovery may allow suppliers to   adjust without severe cost increases. Retailers and home builders continue to   report tight margins. Contacts continue to report a lack of wage pressures,   other than for medical benefits. House prices have stabilized in many areas for   low-end homes but have fallen further for high-end homes.
