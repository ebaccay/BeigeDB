      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to pick up modestly during   the reporting period of late October through late November. Upward pressures on   prices and wages were largely absent. Consumer demand remained weak but showed   signs of improvement in some retail categories, and demand for services appeared   to be little changed on net. Manufacturing activity was mixed but appeared to   firm a bit further overall. Agricultural producers reported largely stable   sales, while demand remained somewhat weak for providers of energy resources.   Demand for housing exhibited further modest improvement, but conditions   continued to erode in commercial real estate markets. Banking contacts reported   largely stable loan demand and lending standards but further declines in credit   quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures were largely   absent during the reporting period. Outside of increases in oil and natural gas,   commodity prices in general were stable. Final prices for various retail goods   were held down by substantial discounting and promotional activity, and   sustained weak demand further reduced the prices for some services, such as   professional services and hotel rooms. In contrast, prices for computer memory   chips continued to firm, a trend that is expected to persist through the holiday   season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts reported little or no upward wage pressures. High levels of   unemployment held down wage pressures throughout the District, and contacts   expect this to continue for an extended period as labor demand and hiring remain   subdued. Employers in various sectors also have been implementing cost-saving   measures such as suspending their 401(k) match and increasing employee   contributions for health benefits. Nonetheless, many businesses expect   significant increases in the costs of health insurance benefits in the coming   year, based on contracted or anticipated rate increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales remained weak on   net, although reports suggested that they were stable or slightly improved   compared with the previous reporting period. While consumers continued to focus   on necessities and trade down to lower-priced options, contacts noted firmer   demand for some nonessential items, and traditional department stores and   discount chains alike reported improvements in sales. Similarly, sellers of   furniture and household appliances reported further improvements in demand. New   automobile sales remained at very low levels, and sales for used automobiles   remained weak, although a limited supply of used vehicles has kept their prices   firm. In general, retailers' expectations for holiday sales are somewhat   downbeat, with sales expected to be largely unchanged or down from last year's   season; as a consequence, inventories of holiday items have been running very   lean to date.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for services remained very weak on net. Demand fell further for   providers of professional services such as accounting and legal services.   Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry noted that demand held   largely stable, albeit at a very low level. Similarly, providers of real estate   services such as title insurance reported that activity was largely flat at low   levels. Conditions remained challenging but showed further signs of improvement   in the tourism and leisure sector: contacts in Southern California indicated   that the sharp rate of decline in hotel and resort visits is slowing, and   contacts in Hawaii continued to report firming in visitor arrivals and hotel   occupancy rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity showed   further signs of improvement during the reporting period of late October through   late November. Reports from manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology   products indicated that demand continued to strengthen, with rising sales and   capacity utilization rates noted. Food manufacturers reported that new orders   and sales remained strong on a seasonal basis. By contrast, metal fabricators   and makers of wood products continued to experience very weak demand, keeping   their capacity utilization rates at unusually depressed levels. Refining   capacity at petroleum refineries remained well below their five-year average as   producers sought to reduce excess inventories. New orders continued to be very   weak for makers of commercial aircraft and parts, although ongoing work on the   prior backlog has kept deliveries stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand held   largely steady for agricultural products and remained somewhat weak, but with   signs of improvement, for providers of natural resources. Sales continued at a   solid pace for most types of agricultural output, including livestock products   and assorted crops, and input costs were reported to be largely unchanged. Oil   extraction activity has been at low levels but rose somewhat in response to   earlier increases in the price of oil. Similarly, as a result of price increases   and a resolution of problems with pipeline deliveries in prior months, natural   gas extraction activity expanded somewhat, with restarts reported for some   previously dormant wells.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the District's   housing markets continued to improve gradually, while demand for commercial real   estate weakened further. The pace of home sales in many areas of the District   continued to pick up, and prices in some areas have risen for several   consecutive months. However, ongoing increases in the supply of foreclosed   properties in some areas have slowed the decline in the inventory of available   homes and contributed to builders' decisions to hold construction activity for   new homes at very low levels. Conditions in commercial real estate markets   deteriorated further, with vacancy rates for office and industrial space   increasing in many parts of the District. However, one contact reported slight   improvement in the availability of financing for new development and investment   transactions, which has been very tight for a prolonged period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was largely unchanged compared with the prior reporting period.   Commercial and industrial loan volumes continued to be held down by businesses'   uncertainty about demand and corresponding caution in their capital spending and   inventory investments. Demand for consumer loans was stable at low levels.   Contacts noted further declines in credit quality, and lending standards   remained relatively restrictive for both consumer and business lending, with   further tightening reported for commercial real estate loans. By contrast, the   availability of venture capital improved a bit, with contacts noting slight   upticks in investment amounts and IPO activity.
