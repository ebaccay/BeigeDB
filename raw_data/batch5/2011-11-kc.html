      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 30, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Growth in the Tenth District economy edged higher in October and early   November but remained moderate overall. Consumer spending improved further, and   manufacturing activity rose modestly. High-tech firms reported generally strong   growth, and the energy industry continued to expand at a robust pace. Bankers   reported mostly steady loan demand, better loan quality, and rising deposits.   Transportation firms reported stable activity, while agricultural activity was   mixed due to varying rainfall and drought conditions across the District.   Residential and commercial real estate activity remained sluggish, though some   improvements were noted. Prices were generally flat, and wage pressures were   limited outside of several skilled labor positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending strengthened, and   expectations improved for the months ahead. Retail sales continued to grow   solidly, and the majority of contacts expected continued sales growth in coming   months. Sales of apparel and seasonal outerwear were noted as particularly   strong, while a few contacts characterized sales of high-end appliances and   jewelry items as weak. Store inventories leveled out somewhat but were above   year-ago levels in most establishments. Auto sales remained solid, with several   dealers reporting high demand for mid-size SUVs and fuel efficient vehicles.   Expectations for future auto sales were mostly positive, and auto inventories   increased slightly over the previous survey. Restaurant sales improved, with   further growth expected in coming months. Tourist activity was largely flat, but   some contacts were cautiously optimistic about the upcoming winter season.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District   manufacturing activity edged higher from the previous survey, and expectations   rebounded after easing somewhat the past few months. Factory orders slowed   slightly, but shipments increased and hiring plans remained solid. Plant   managers indicated moderate growth in capital spending plans. Transportation   firms noted generally stable conditions, but expectations for future activity   increased over the previous survey and capital spending plans were positive. The   majority of high-tech services firms reported strong growth in sales and   expected this trend to continue. Future capital expenditure plans at high-tech   firms remained solid.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential and commercial   real estate activity remained generally sluggish in October and early November.   Housing starts dropped from the previous survey, with construction of   higher-priced homes particularly weak. Expectations for future homebuilding   remained slow, and materials were generally available. Sales at residential   construction supply firms improved somewhat, driven in part by an increase in   remodeling as more consumers updated existing homes. Home sales picked up   slightly but remained weak overall. Expectations for future home sales were more   positive than in previous months, and home inventories drifted lower as home   prices continued to ease in most areas. Mortgage lending activity was positive   and remained above year-ago levels, though some contacts reported continued   buyer financing difficulties. Commercial real estate activity edged higher from   the previous survey, but remained sluggish overall with little further   improvement expected. Vacancy rates dropped slightly, though they were expected   to rise somewhat in future months. Office prices and rents increased but   remained below year-ago levels, and expectations were flat. One contact in   Joplin, Missouri noted considerable building activity as a result of the   devastating tornado in that area last spring.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most bankers reported steady or stronger loan   demand, stable or improving loan quality, and increased deposits compared with   the previous survey. Overall loan demand increased marginally as demand for   commercial and residential real estate loans strengthened, demand for consumer   installment loans declined, and demand for commercial and industrial loans   weakened slightly. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan   categories, and deposits increased for the seventh straight survey. Bankers   generally reported loan quality as steady or improving compared to a year ago,   with even more improvement expected for the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Energy activity continued to expand strongly in   October and early November. Nearly all contacts reported an increase in drilling   activity and were optimistic about the months ahead. Crude oil prices remained   favorable for drilling, and one contact noted that overall drilling activity was   approaching levels reached before the price collapse in 2008. However, contacts   reported that shortages of equipment and labor continued to constrain the rate   of increase in exploration to some degree, and one producer said the delay in   the Keystone Pipeline project was hindering future growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural activity varied across the   District in October and early November. Northern portions of the District, which   received ample summer precipitation, reported above average corn and soybean   yields at harvest and the majority of Nebraska’s wheat crop emerged in good   condition. In contrast, drought conditions severely cut crop production in the   District’s southern regions, with Kansas and Oklahoma winter wheat crops in fair   or poor condition. Robust export demand continued to boost crop and livestock   prices. Farm income rose in areas with bumper harvests, while crop insurance was   expected to mitigate losses in cases of poor yields or crop failure. Strong farm   income boosted farm loan repayment rates and trimmed demand for operating loans.   With rising farm income and strong demand from both farmers and non-farm   investors, District farmland values posted another record high, with the   strongest gains in the northern Plains.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Price levels were generally stable, and   wage pressures remained mostly contained, outside of a few skilled positions.   Manufacturing price pressures moderated somewhat, especially for raw materials,   and fewer firms planned to raise selling prices. Prices for construction   materials stabilized, and retail prices were also flat as fewer firms expected   increases. However, transportation firms reported continued high input prices,   and restaurants expected higher menu prices due to rising food costs. Wage   pressures were still contained in most industries. However, some firms reported   difficulties finding skilled workers and were forced to raise wages,   particularly in energy and information technology fields. Hiring plans were   generally solid for most firms, particularly those in the energy, information   technology, and manufacturing sectors.
