      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has continued to expand at a modest pace since the   last report. Despite some pickup in commodity price pressures, prices of   finished goods and services have generally been stable. There have been   scattered signs of softening in the labor market: while manufacturers continue   to add workers, firms in other industries have scaled back hiring. A growing   number of contacts in both manufacturing and other sectors report some softening   in business conditions. Retailers, however, report generally favorable results:   auto dealers note that sales remain fairly strong, and non-auto retailers report   some recent improvement. Tourism activity has remained strong. Residential real   estate markets have shown signs of improvement, and Manhattan's office market   picked up slightly. Finally, bankers report increased loan demand, no change in   credit standards, and further declines in delinquency rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retailers report that sales activity   has firmed somewhat since the last report. Two major retail chains report that   sales in the region were on plan in July and ahead of plan in early August.   Similarly a major retail mall in upstate New York reports some firming in sales,   as well as shopper traffic, in July and early August, following lackluster   business in May and June. Retail prices continue to be described as   steady--including apparel prices, which had previously been expected to drift   down with the retreat in cotton prices earlier this year. Stores in New York   City have performed on par or modestly better than those in the rest of the   region. Inventories are generally said to be at or slightly above desired   levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in upstate New York continue to report strong sales. New vehicle   sales are characterized as particularly robust--up 14 percent from a year   earlier--in the Rochester area. Buffalo-area dealers are seeing gains of about 7   percent. Sales of used cars and business at dealers' service departments are   also described as fairly robust. Wholesale and retail credit conditions remain   favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity has been mixed but generally strong since the last report.   Hotels occupancy rates in the Albany and Buffalo areas have climbed and are well   ahead of year-earlier levels. New York City hotels indicate that revenues per   room were up roughly 6 percent from a year ago in June but up by a more modest 2   percent in July, as growth in room rates slowed and occupancy rates leveled off   at close to 90 percent. With a 2-3 percent increase in the total number of hotel   rooms in the city, this suggests continued fairly brisk growth in tourism   activity. Attendance at Broadway theatres picked up in July and remained robust   in early August, running 4-5 percent ahead of a year earlier, while revenue was   up roughly 10 percent, reflecting higher ticket prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Housing markets across the   District have shown further signs of modest improvement since the last report.   The housing market in the Buffalo area continued to show strength through   mid-July, though activity has dropped off in recent weeks--to a greater extent   than the seasonal norm. Northern New Jersey's housing market has bottomed and is   showing scattered signs of improvement, according to an industry expert. This   contact also maintains that internal market fundamentals are favorable: low and   declining inventories, pent up demand, high affordability and a steady reduction   in the foreclosure pipeline Manhattan's co-op and condo market has been fairly   active since mid-year, relative to the normal seasonal pattern of slowing. In   particular, there has been strong activity at the very high end (for "trophy   properties") and also for entry-level apartments, driven in part by low mortgage   rates. There has been more significant improvement reported in Brooklyn and   especially in Queens, where an inventory glut has evaporated surprisingly   quickly, according to one contact. New York City apartment rents have continued   to rise across all segments, and Albany's rental market has strengthened   noticeably, with rents running 7 percent higher than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manhattan's office market strengthened somewhat in July, as leasing activity   picked up and vacancy rates edged down. Asking rents for Class A office space   rose modestly and continued to run more than 10 percent ahead of a year earlier.   A real estate contact also reports that retailers have started leasing more   ground-floor space in apartment buildings that have recently reached full   occupancy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Businesses across the District   indicate some softening in general conditions since the last report. A rising   number of contacts in both manufacturing and other sectors indicate a recent   pullback in business activity. While some pickup in input price pressures has   been noted in recent weeks and further increases are anticipated in the months   ahead, most report steady selling prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor market conditions across the District have been mixed, but somewhat   weaker, on balance, since the last report. While manufacturers report that they   continue to add workers, on net, firms in other sectors indicate that they have   cut back on hiring. Moreover, both manufacturers and non-manufacturing firms   recently scaled back their near term hiring plans. Separately, a major New York   City employment agency specializing in office jobs reports that hiring activity   was even more sluggish in July and early August than is usual for the this time   of year. A contact in the securities industry reports that there has been   neither any significant increase in layoffs nor much hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Small- to medium-sized banks in   the District report a noticeable pickup in overall loan demand. Particularly   widespread increases in demand were reported for both residential and commercial   mortgage loans, while demand for consumer loans was little changed. As was the   case in the last report, demand for commercial &amp; industrial loans decreased.   Bankers also indicate steady demand for refinancing. Virtually all contacts   report no change in credit standards across all loan categories. Respondents   indicate continued decreases in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for   all loan categories--particularly commercial &amp; industrial loans and   commercial mortgages. Respondents also note continued declines in the average   deposit rate. Finally, bankers report declining delinquency rates, particularly   on commercial &amp; industrial loans and residential mortgages.
