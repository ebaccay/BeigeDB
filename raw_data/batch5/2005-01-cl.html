      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       January 19 , 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      For the final six weeks of 2004, economic conditions were mixed across major 

  sectors of the Fourth District. Retailers' reports varied by retail segment, 

  while activity among the District's durable and nondurable goods facilities 

  was steady. Though residential and nonresidential construction continued to 

  slow somewhat, the slowdown was probably partially due to seasonal variation. 

  And while borrowing from banks in the District remained steady, demand for shipping 

  services was "surprisingly strong." In general, input cost increases 

  were modest and retail price pressures remained limited. Finally, staffing services 

  companies reported an increase in demand for workers from manufacturing firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production at the District's durable goods manufacturers was generally 

  steady at a high level toward the end of 2004. Some small declines were reported, 

  but seemed to be the product of a seasonal slowing in demand. Automobile industry 

  suppliers reported slowing sales at year-end, and domestic steel producers acknowledged 

  that, aside from seasonal fluctuations, inventories have risen somewhat. Nevertheless, 

  most manufacturers reported higher levels of production than at this time last 

  year. And though growth in new orders was weak, firms' expectations for 

  the future improved in December. In addition, unlike in recent reports, several 

  firms reported that they plan to hire in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nondurable goods makers generally reported that production levels were flat 

  for the last six weeks of 2004. Some firms also reported a rebound in production 

  in January, but noted that this may be from seasonal fluctuations in demand. 

  Production levels were reported to be the same as or less than at this time 

  last year. Regarding expectations, several chemicals producers expect the economic 

  environment to improve in the near term; however, paper producers were less 

  sanguine in their assessment of the outlook. Most firms indicated that they 

  had little intention to hire in the coming months, or to add to their capital 

  stock.
     </p>
     <p>
      Input costs continued to increase in recent weeks for nearly all nondurable 

  goods makers, and they are also higher on a year-over-year basis. By contrast, 

  durable goods producers generally reported that their input costs were flat 

  throughout the recent period, though their costs also remained above year-ago 

  levels. Finally, many durable goods producers reported rising wages and indicated 

  continued concerns about increasing health care costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic environment for retailers in the District was mixed, with some 

  retail segments seeing strong gains and other reporting disappointing December 

  sales. For some firms, this year's holiday selling season was worse than last 

  year's, which itself was weak. Some contacts suggested that poor weather in 

  the Midwest may have been a factor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales at District department stores were generally weak, while sales at specialty 

  apparel shops were more mixed. A few firms noted strong sales in early January, 

  though these firms indicated that they were sharply discounting some of their 

  merchandise. In particular, apparel retailers reported aggressive promotional 

  activity in the wake of sluggish sales. Discounters reported sales growth that 

  was consistent with their expectations. And grocers reported strong sales during 

  the holiday season, while restaurateurs reported weaker conditions. While personal 

  care products generally sold well, furniture and other home products sold poorly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales at auto dealerships improved in December after a weak November. New 

  automobile sales strengthened throughout the month of December, as dealerships 

  employed discounts and incentives in an attempt to move merchandise. Nevertheless, 

  dealerships generally reported that their inventories of new cars remained above 

  acceptable levels. Used car sales were generally flat for the last six weeks 

  of 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential builders reported continuing declines in activity, often exceeding 

  the expected seasonal slowing in sales. Building activity also appeared to be 

  down from the levels of this time a year ago. Big builders discounted prices 

  and provided incentives in an attempt to spur buying, but sales stayed weak 

  throughout the District, especially in the Columbus and Cincinnati areas. Overall, 

  builders' costs remained flat for the most part in December. Regarding hiring, 

  several builders said that they have reduced or will reduce workforce sizes, 

  as the expectations for future sales have diminished: Most builders expect 2005 

  sales to be below those in 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      Accounting for the usual seasonal slowing in activity, nonresidential construction 

  was largely flat throughout the last six weeks of 2004, though customer inquiries 

  improved modestly during December. On a year-over-year basis, building activity 

  saw a slight increase. Regarding specific sectors, education-related construction 

  remained robust at year-end, and several contractors also indicated increasing 

  demand from firms in the manufacturing sector. Input prices for nonresidential 

  builders have been flat for several months. Few firms expected to add to their 

  workforces in the coming months, and most contacts think that activity in 2005 

  will be at least as strong as in 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banks described loan demand as steady, in general, throughout the six 

  weeks ending 2004. While many smaller banks experienced a slight slowdown in 

  commercial borrowing, they attributed this primarily to seasonal factors. Larger 

  banks reported moderate improvement in their commercial clients' borrowing. 

  Banking contacts generally characterized consumer borrowing as flat. Across 

  all borrowers, most contacts reported that their delinquency rates remained 

  low. Deposit growth differed across District institutions, with banks describing 

  the deposit market as "very competitive."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trucking and Shipping
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for trucking and shipping services remained strong through the six weeks 

  ending 2004. In fact, a number of contacts characterized conditions as "surprisingly 

  strong." Though demand continued to come from an array of sectors, manufacturers 

  were noted as having especially high demand. And while fuel prices fell in recent 

  weeks, shipping firms' fuel surcharges continued to protect them against any 

  adverse fluctuations in fuel expenses. Companies continued their attempts to 

  add to capacity through new truck purchases. The increase in demand for new 

  trucks has created long lead times for their delivery. Companies also continued 

  attempts to add to their payrolls by raising wage rates, as well as offering 

  prospective personnel nonpecuniary enticements.
