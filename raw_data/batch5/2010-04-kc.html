      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded moderately during March, and District   contacts expected economic conditions to improve further in coming months.   Warmer weather conditions led to increased retail traffic and supported a modest   rebound in consumer spending, generating some optimism among District contacts.   Manufacturing and transportation activity continued their steady rebound,   resulting in a few new hires. District housing activity rose and contacts   anticipated further improvements in coming months. In contrast, commercial   construction activity continued to wane. Energy activity expanded further, but   natural gas production was expected to ease with slower summer demand.   Agricultural conditions remained solid as livestock profits improved and strong   crop profitability boosted planting expectations this spring. Wage pressures   remained muted and retail prices held steady, but some manufacturers were   considering raising selling prices due to higher raw material costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending rebounded in March as   customer traffic improved with warmer weather. Retailers reported higher than   expected sales and were optimistic that business activity would continue to   recover. Apparel items sold well, and demand for lower-priced durable goods   rose. After months of declines, auto dealers reported steady sales in March and   were hopeful that increased showroom traffic would spur purchases. Mid-size cars   and SUVs were in greatest demand. Restaurants reported more diners but less   spending per check, resulting in flat sales. Travel and tourism activity edged   up and was expected to strengthen further approaching vacation season. District   hotel owners reported higher average room rates and increased occupancy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   and transportation activity expanded solidly since the last survey period.   Manufacturing production improved to near year-ago levels as slightly slower   growth at non-durable goods plants was offset by stronger durable goods   production. A moderate rise in shipments and exports reduced inventories and the   backlog of orders increased slightly. Producer expectations for future factory   activity improved with sustained growth in new order volumes. Employment levels   held steady during the survey period, but more manufacturers planned to increase   payrolls over the next six months. Capital spending plans, however, remained   largely on hold. After rebounding in the last survey period, sales activity in   the transportation sector rose further, but firms were concerned about rising   fuel costs. Some trucking companies were hiring qualified drivers. The high-tech   industry reported a decline in demand for commercial consulting services as   clients cut costs. However, an increase in projects to retro-fit existing   facilities to maximize efficiency was noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity strengthened in March, while commercial real estate activity weakened   further. Residential builders reported an upswing in building starts after the   harsh winter. Home sales and buyer traffic moved higher, though sales prices   fell slightly with a rise in existing home inventories. The home buyer's tax   credit continued to support the starter home market, but District contacts   expected slower sales after the incentive program expires. Sales of higher   priced homes remained sluggish. Mortgage lenders reported an increase in home   purchase loans while loan refinancing volumes declined. Construction supply   firms anticipated stronger sales for new construction materials as well as   higher consumer demand for home improvement supplies. In contrast, commercial   real estate activity remained well below year-ago levels. Contacts also noted   that few new construction projects had qualified for financing due to continued   tight credit conditions. Vacancy rates edged higher, rents fell further, and   sales were expected to remain sluggish. Leasing concessions were common as   landlords tried to retain current tenants and attract new ones. Some distressed   commercial properties were being put on the market and more were expected to   follow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported lower loan demand, stable   deposits, and an unchanged outlook for loan quality. Overall loan demand   declined at a slightly faster pace than in the previous survey. Demand for   commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans fell   moderately. Demand also declined somewhat for residential real estate loans and   consumer installment loans. A few banks tightened credit standards on commercial   real estate loans, but credit standards for other loan categories were generally   unchanged. Somewhat fewer banks than in the previous survey reported lower   quality than a year ago. As in the previous survey, however, about a third of   respondents expected loan quality to decline over the next six months. Deposits   continued to show little change overall. Several respondents said that some of   their depositors were shifting funds to alternative investments such as stocks   and bonds in search of higher yields.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity expanded during the survey period,   and additional modest gains were expected in the coming months. After rising in   March, the number of active rigs in the District approached year-ago levels.   Several firms planned to hire additional staff, primarily engineers and skilled   labor. Crude oil prices were expected to rise due to a seasonal uptick in demand   and improvement in the world economy. Natural gas prices, however, were expected   to decline with excess supply and lower summer demand. Some contacts noted that   the expansion in drilling activity could be constrained by the availability of   labor, equipment, supplies, and financing. A Wyoming producer also noted   difficulty obtaining drilling permits and a decline in land lease sales which   could also hinder future development. District coal production increased in   March, but remained below year-ago levels. Ethanol profit margins have fallen   below capital costs and biodiesel production remains stalled after the loss of a   federal tax credit eliminated profits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions improved since the   last survey period. Livestock prices strengthened in March boosting   profitability, especially for cattle producers, and prices were expected to rise   further with smaller supplies. Crop prices edged down in March with the   prospects of increased plantings and bumper crops. The winter wheat crop was   reported in generally good condition. District plantings of corn and soybeans   were expected to increase this year, most notably in Kansas where winter wheat   plantings declined. Soil moisture levels were more than adequate and contacts   were concerned that excessively wet fields could delay spring planting again   this year. Lenders reported ample funds were available to satisfy rising demand   for farm operating loans in preparation for spring planting. Cropland values   remained solid with limited sales activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wages held steady since the last survey   period, and some factories considered raising selling prices in coming months as   raw materials prices rose further. Contacts reported little wage pressure in   District labor markets, and most companies hiring new workers were not offering   higher salaries to attract qualified applicants. Input prices rose in March and   were expected to rise further in coming months. District manufacturers reported   additional increases in prices paid for raw materials. Builders and construction   supply companies stated that prices for construction materials increased,   especially for roofing shingles and asphalt. Transportation companies paid   higher prices for fuel, and restaurant owners noted higher food costs. Some   manufacturers planned to raise selling prices in the months ahead. Most   retailers, however, did not anticipate raising prices, and restaurants expected   menu prices to remain flat.
