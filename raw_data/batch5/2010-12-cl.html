      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <strong>
      December 1, 2010
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <p>
      On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District grew at a modest pace   during the past six weeks. Manufacturers reported some improvement in new orders   and production. Car sales increased, while general retailing was flat to down   slightly. Freight carriers saw a small rise in volume, and energy companies   reported stable production. Residential and nonresidential construction remains   sluggish. Demand for business loans showed some signs of a pickup, while   consumer borrowing was weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of rising payrolls in manufacturing, banking, and auto dealerships   increased slightly since our last survey. Overall, staffing-firm representatives   noted little change in the number of new job openings, with vacancies   concentrated in the healthcare sector. Wage pressures continue to be contained.   Apart from volatility in commodity prices, raw materials and product pricing   were fairly steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District factories indicated   that new orders and production were either stable or rose modestly during the   past six weeks. Production was higher on a year-over-year basis, with many   contacts experiencing double-digit increases. Several manufacturers commented   that opportunities continue to grow at a faster pace in offshore markets than   domestically. In general, manufacturers are cautiously optimistic and expect at   least modest growth during 2011. Steel producers and service centers reported   that volume was either flat or improving, with shipments being driven by   energy-related, auto, and heavy equipment industries. Two respondents commented   that they are experiencing some difficulty filling orders due to capacity   constraints and long lead times. Most steel executives we spoke with expect   business activity to follow seasonal trends in the near term. Looking forward to   the remainder of 2011, they anticipate modest growth at best. District auto   production showed a moderate rise during October on a month-over-month and   year-over-year basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capacity utilization is trending up for some manufacturers and steel   producers, while the majority said that utilization rates still remain below   pre-recession levels. Inventories are balanced with incoming orders. Although   there has been some increase in capital outlays, most producers are conservative   in their planning. Several noted that new spending will be directed at their   offshore facilities. Other than volatility in steel and commodity prices, the   cost of raw materials has been relatively stable. Several manufacturers   announced selective product price increases to reflect changes in steel, copper,   and agricultural input prices. We heard a few reports that these adjustments are   expected to become more widespread in 2011. About half of our contacts told us   that they have expanded their payrolls slightly since our last report. Wage   pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New home construction was generally flat at a   low level during the past six weeks, with several builders reporting no sales.   General contractors expect construction to remain sluggish going into the new   year and their outlook for the remainder of 2011 is uncertain. Most new home   sales are occurring in the move-up buyer categories. Spec inventories are   intentionally being kept at low levels, and those who want to build have   difficulty obtaining financing. A majority of our contacts reported lowering the   list prices of their homes. Construction material costs have shown little   movement since our last report. We have been hearing an increasing number of   reports about subcontractors and building material suppliers going out of   business. General contractors continue to work with very lean crews.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discussions with nonresidential builders drew mixed responses. A majority of   our contacts reported having less work than a year ago and seeing a slowdown in   inquiries. Several builders characterized their backlogs as acceptable, but   noted that they were down year-over-year. New projects are generally falling   into the infrastructure category. The general consensus is for little change in   business conditions in the near term. On balance, construction material prices   have been stable. Two general contractors reported reducing their payrolls,   while other builders said employment was steady. Subcontractors are still   struggling and bidding at very competitive rates. Reports indicate that it is   very difficult for subs to obtain credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales for the period from   mid-September through mid-October were flat or down slightly when compared to   the previous 30-day period. The exception was food retailing, where sales showed   a modest improvement. When compared to year-ago levels, most retailers said that   sales volume was similar or had increased. A few of our contacts noted that   consumers have postponed buying cold-weather items. Expectations call for sales   to improve somewhat through yearâ€™s end, reflecting the holiday shopping season.   Households remain price sensitive and tend to purchase items only as needed,   focusing more on necessities. Several retailers saw modest price increases from   their suppliers, which they passed through selectively to customers. Half of our   contacts plan to increase capital budgets in 2011, mainly for new stores and   warehousing. Hiring will be limited to temporary holiday workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most auto dealers saw a pickup in new vehicle sales during October on a   month-over-month basis. Looking forward, dealers expect sales to follow seasonal   trends through the winter months. However, they anticipate that volume will be   higher than the prior yearâ€™s level. New car inventories rose during the past few   weeks. Used vehicle purchases are flattening out since our last report. Little   change in lending standards was reported, while credit pricing remains very   competitive. We heard a few reports of incremental hiring at dealerships.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported commercial loan demand was   stable or showed modest growth since our last survey. Demand was driven   primarily by companies in the energy, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors.   Demand also came from firms seeking financing for mergers and acquisitions. On   the consumer side, conventional loan demand remains weak, although several   bankers reported that they are beginning to see early signs of growth. Consumer   activity is strongest in indirect auto lending and home equity lines of credit.   We heard a few reports that households are relying more heavily on debit cards   and are bypassing credit, even if it means postponing a purchase. Interest rates   for business and consumer credit moved by only a few basis points, with a slight   bias to the downside. Most of our contacts said that the demand for residential   mortgage refinancing remains strong, while new-purchase mortgage originations   are weak. Mortgage rates are stabilizing at historic lows. Core deposits   continue to grow, with most of the growth occurring in nonmaturing products.   Credit quality was generally characterized as either stable or showing a slight   improvement, especially for business applicants. In total, delinquency rates are   stable or trending down. However, delinquencies in some residential mortgage   portfolios, though manageable, are either high or rising slightly. Several   bankers reported that they have slowly increased their payrolls during the past   few months, though some existing positions are being converted from full-time to   part-time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports indicate that oil and gas output from   conventional wells was fairly steady during the past six weeks, with output   expected to remain at current levels in the near term. Production from Marcellus   shale was somewhat higher and is expected to continue to increase. Spot prices   for natural gas are generally flat at a low level, which is putting downward   pressure on capital spending. Oil prices continued on a slow upward trend. Coal   production has been stable since our last report, with little change expected in   the near term. However, one energy executive noted that international demand for   coal is rising as an economic recovery in Europe builds momentum and traditional   supply sources are being drawn to Asian markets. Spot and contract prices for   coal were mixed but are tending to the down side. Other than a rise in fuel   prices, equipment and material costs have been flat. Employment at energy   companies has not changed recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight transport executives reported that   volume generally showed a modest increase during the past six weeks. Chemical   shipments rose, while a decline was seen in apparel and building materials.   Several carriers characterized their outlook as cautious, with some expectation   for a slight drop in volume due to seasonal factors. Almost all of our contacts   reported rising prices for fuel, with limited success at passing the increase   through to customers. Capital outlays are expected to remain at relatively low   levels until the pace of the recovery picks up. Although pent-up demand exists   to replace aging equipment, high prices for new tractors and tight credit are   limiting purchases. Two of our contacts said that they are now leasing equipment   because of attractive rates. Wage pressures are beginning to emerge due to a   growing problem with driver turnover and a tightening of the driver pool.
