      Beige Book Report: San Francisco

       January 19, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy continued to expand at a solid pace in late November 

  and December. Contacts reported little or no pickup in the pace of overall price 

  increases. The pace of cost increases for selected inputs eased, albeit from 

  high levels. Several contacts noted that some of the higher input costs were 

  passed on to consumers, though efficiency gains helped hold down overall production 

  costs. Wages and salary pressures remained modest but up slightly overall. Strong 

  export growth contributed to improving demand conditions in most sectors. Holiday 

  retail sales, on balance, were up compared with last year, with retailers stepping 

  up discounting in late December. Manufacturers, agricultural producers, and 

  transportation and other service providers generally reported strong demand. 

  Activity in District residential real estate markets remained robust, though 

  it moderated in some areas. District banks reported overall solid loan demand 

  and good credit quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The overall pace of price increases remained modest in recent weeks. District 

  producers reported that, although the level of certain input costs remained 

  high, increases in the cost of energy and building materials have eased from 

  previous rapid rates. Several businesses indicated they were passing along at 

  least some of the higher input costs to consumers. At the same time, several 

  District businesses reportedly have experienced efficiency gains in their production 

  processes, which served to hold down overall cost increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts noted little change in labor market conditions. Reports indicated 

  little or no difficulty filling positions, with the exception of certain high-skilled 

  jobs in selected industries. Wages and salary pressures remained modest but 

  up slightly overall; most District businesses reported that increases in benefits 

  costs continued to push up total compensation bills.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District retailers indicated generally solid retail sales for the 

  holiday season as a whole, with both dollar sales and unit sales up relative 

  to last year. The strength of demand during the holiday season was broad-based 

  across establishment types, with sales at discount stores, department stores, 

  and establishments specializing in luxury products reportedly all performing 

  well. Contacts noted that holiday season discounting was generally more restrained 

  than last year, though many retailers increased discounting as the end of the 

  season drew near. Perhaps as a result, sales performance was reported to have 

  been considerably better toward the end of the holiday season than at the beginning. 

  Overall, most contacts reported that holiday sales met expectations, leaving 

  retail inventories in balance heading into 2005.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of autos generally were solid during the survey period; foreign makes 

  reportedly sold considerably better than domestic brands, despite the dollar's 

  recent declines relative to other currencies. Final sale prices and profit margins 

  remained restrained as a result of intense competition, particularly among domestic 

  automakers.
     </p>
     <p>
      District service providers reported a further strengthening in demand in recent 

  weeks. For example, demand for health-care and transportation services was solid, 

  and service providers operated at high utilization rates. District travel and 

  tourism activity was healthy in most areas, with increases in both domestic 

  and international traffic. In particular, the number of Japanese visitors to 

  Hawaii have returned to pre-September 11 levels, boosting activity there. Hotel 

  occupancy and average daily room rates continued to improve in many markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District manufacturers reported strong demand for their products in late 

  November and December. Increased foreign demand for various products contributed 

  to overall improvements in business conditions. Makers of machine tools reported 

  strong demand for most of their products; the market for certain inputs such 

  as steel plates is characterized by tight inventories, strong demand, and rising 

  prices. Robust construction activity continued to drive demand for wall board, 

  insulation, and other building products in recent weeks. Robust demand conditions 

  also characterized the food processing industry. Transportation equipment makers 

  reported that demand conditions improved; new orders edged up slightly in recent 

  weeks. In IT manufacturing, semiconductor orders and sales generally were solid; 

  however, capacity utilization of chip makers dropped slightly from its already 

  high level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District providers of agricultural and resource-related products indicated a 

  strengthening in demand during the most recent survey period. Agricultural exports 

  rose in recent weeks. District orders and sales of tree nuts especially were 

  high, attributable in part to favorable public announcements regarding nutritional 

  value and in part to constrained supply in other nut-growing regions. Contacts 

  reported that prices for most agricultural products increased moderately in 

  recent weeks. Overall, respondents indicated strong underlying demand for natural 

  resources. Contacts reported a slight decline in wholesale prices for natural 

  gas, while retail prices generally remained stable. On the other hand, consumers 

  in the Pacific Northwest faced higher electricity prices as the effect of drought 

  conditions on hydroelectric generation more than offset the effect of mild weather 

  on demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for residential real estate generally remained robust in recent weeks. 

  Sales of new and existing homes increased throughout the District and home-price 

  appreciation remained solid, particularly in certain areas such as Hawaii. However, 

  in some areas the pace of home sales growth and price increases slowed from 

  previous rapid rates. The overall robust demand for new homes and home improvements 

  has kept overall construction activity at high levels. District commercial real 

  estate markets generally improved in recent weeks; contacts reported that office 

  vacancy rates continued to fall, and rents increased moderately in most markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts indicated overall solid loan demand and good credit 

  quality in late November and December. A very competitive environment generally 

  has kept profit margins low in the banking sector recently, although several 

  contacts reported that profit margins have improved. Commercial and industrial 

  lending edged up slightly in recent weeks. Demand for construction, commercial 

  real estate, and residential loans slowed a bit in some areas but remained at 

  high levels overall. Several contacts noted increases in merger and acquisition 

  activities among District firms.
