      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy in the Fourth District grew at a modest pace since our last report.   Manufacturers reported a small increase in production, while activity in   residential and nonresidential construction picked up slightly. Many retailers   and auto dealers characterized February sales as good. Energy production was   stable except for shale gas, where activity expanded. Freight transport volume   trended higher at a moderate rate. And the demand for business and consumer   credit improved slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hiring remains at a low level and was mainly limited to the manufacturing and   freight transport sectors. Staffing-firm representatives reported that the   number of job openings has increased, especially for information technology and   healthcare workers. Wage pressures are largely contained. Prices were largely   stable apart from increases in petroleum-based products, metals, and some   building materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production at District factories showed a   small increase during the past six weeks, and a majority of manufacturers said   that output was above year-ago levels. However, several contacts reported that   the boost in new orders they had seen late last year is leveling off and they   are uncertain about sales to European customers. Some of our respondents   expressed a more cautious outlook than at the start of 2012, but they are not   expecting a significant weakening. Shipping volume by steel producers and   service centers was trending slightly higher. Demand is being driven by the   auto, energy, and industrial equipment markets. Steel representatives are   cautiously optimistic about second-quarter shipments, and they expect the   positive growth trend to continue. District auto production showed a modest rise   during February on a month-over-month basis, while increasing substantially from   prior-year levels. Increases were attributed, in part, to the abatement of   supply chain issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capacity utilization has returned to normal rates for the majority of our   contacts, while inventories were consistent with demand. Capital budgets remain   on track, with many manufacturers reporting that they plan to increase outlays   during the next several months. Input- cost changes were mainly limited to   rising prices for petroleum-based products and metals. Only a few producers said   that they are considering raising product prices during the second quarter.   Manufacturers continued to hire, but at a modest pace. We heard reports about   difficulties recruiting professional and high-skilled production workers. Wage   pressures are contained. Several contacts said that they need to allocate   additional monies for pension plans due to low rates of return.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family-home construction has improved   slightly during the past couple of months, although overall sales remain at very   low levels. Activity in multi-family construction and remodeling remains strong.   Single-family-home builders are a little more optimistic in their outlook due to   the time of year and low mortgage interest rates. A few builders reported   reducing house sizes and altering interior specs as a means of holding new- home   prices steady. Employment and wages were stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in nonresidential construction for small to medium-size contractors   continues to strengthen and is at a higher level than a year ago. Inquiries were   up substantially for most of our contacts, although backlogs, while growing, are   not as strong as builders would like. Financing projects remains one of the   biggest challenges facing contractors. Construction activity is broad-based,   driven by student housing, senior housing, healthcare, office, and   manufacturing. Our contacts expect that business will slowly improve as the year   progresses, but it will remain below pre-2008 levels. Looking at   building-materials prices, residential and nonresidential contractors reported   increases for petroleum-based products, drywall, and lumber. Hiring by   nonresidential general contractors was limited. Several commented that they need   to see more robust growth before expanding their payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported that sales were   ahead of plan during the past six weeks and increased by single digits relative   to year-ago levels. Almost all of our contacts cited the unusually warm weather   as a primary factor for the pickup in sales, which was seen across their product   lines. However, several of our respondents described middle-income households as   challenged. These consumers are trading down, looking for value, and they remain   very sensitive to rising gasoline prices. Most retailers expect second-quarter   sales to increase over prior-year levels, mainly in the low- to mid-single   digits. However, grocers anticipate little change in sales. Reports on vendor   pricing were mixed. Upward pressure was attributed mainly to rising   transportation and offshore labor costs, with little emphasis on changes in raw   material pricing. There was some reluctance to pass through rising costs to   consumers. Inventories were characterized as being in good shape. Capital   spending for the year remains on track. Outlays will be used largely for   technology enhancements, distribution facilities, store expansions, and new   store construction. Little hiring is anticipated except at new stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers described new-vehicle sales during February as good. Sales   received a boost from the unusually warm weather. We heard one report of a shale   gas producer purchasing 75 vehicles from a dealer. On a year-over-year basis,   sales were mainly higher. However, some dealers reported seeing a lull in   activity, which they attributed to a significant pick up in vehicle leasing at   the beginning of 2011. Inventories are light on the domestic side, but foreign   nameplates are rebuilding stocks rapidly, as those manufacturers are trying to   recapture market share. The outlook for the remainder of this year was mixed.   Half of our contacts expect the rise in 2011 sales will be repeated, while   others believe that the rate of increase seen last year is unsustainable.   Purchases of used vehicles were fairly strong. On the financing side, interest   rates are competitive, but it remains difficult to arrange financing for   customers with low credit scores. Auto dealers are hiring at a very slow rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for business credit was described as   either steady or rising, with a majority of bankers telling us that loan pricing   remains competitive. Requests are being driven by commercial real estate,   including multifamily housing, and healthcare. Consumer credit requests rose   slightly during the past six weeks. Demand was mainly for auto lending (direct   and indirect) and home equity lines of credit. Several community bankers   commented that it is difficult competing against large banks, credit unions, and   captives, especially for motor vehicle loans. In the residential mortgage   market, demand was described as steady to very strong. A high percentage of   applicants are looking to refinance. No changes were made to loan application   standards. Delinquencies were generally steady or declined; any increases were   found largely in real estate portfolios. Core deposits continued to grow.   Payrolls were stable, with little hiring expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conventional oil and natural gas drilling and   production were flat since our last report, with little change expected in the   upcoming weeks. Our contacts attributed these conditions to low natural gas   prices and regulatory costs. Well-head prices for oil were up slightly. Leasing   activity in Ohio's Utica shale continues to expand, and energy companies are   redeploying drilling resources from dry gas to the wet gas areas of the   Marcellus shale due to its significantly higher market value. The outlook for   coal production during 2012 is similar to 2011 levels. However, there is a   growing likelihood that output will decline due to the regulatory environment   and lessening demand from electrical utility companies and offshore markets.   Spot prices for metallurgical and steam coals continued to decline. Production   equipment and materials prices were fairly steady except for rising diesel fuel   prices and the cost of items tied to steel. Energy payrolls were stable, though   some small oil and gas companies are considering layoffs because of reduced   revenues.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight transport volume has been trending   higher during the past few weeks. Industries driving demand include energy and   metals. One executive noted a significant upswing in long-term leasing of his   railroad cars. Volume is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace for the   remainder of the year. Costs associated with truck maintenance have begun   stabilizing after increasing for two consecutive quarters. The price of diesel   fuel continues to rise, although a few of our contacts characterized it as   manageable. Some of the increase was passed through via surcharges. Capital   spending for 2012 remains on plan. Outlays are allocated for replacement of   aging units and adding capacity, although it remains difficult to recruit   qualified drivers. We heard two reports of additional drivers being hired to   meet potential staffing requirements under the new hours-of-service rules. Some   wage pressure exists due to a tightening of the driver pool.
