      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Fourth District has been stable since early  April.  Factory  output and shipments by steel producers were steady to increasing.  Production at auto assembly plants rose  slightly.  The housing industry remains  weak, with little expectation of improvement for the remainder of the  year.  Commercial building contractors  reported steady business activity, although there is some concern about  weakening backlogs.  Sales by District  retailers were flat to improving.   Bankers reported that lending standards continue to tighten, though  credit remains available.  Demand for  business loans was mixed, while lending to households has weakened.  Energy production was stable, and the demand  for freight transport services was flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, employment levels were largely unchanged across the District.  Several contacts reported modest wage  pressure.  Staffing firms saw little net change  in the number of job openings, while the number of job seekers increased.  Job vacancies were greatest in health-care-related  fields.  A significant rise in  commodity-based input prices was reported across the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Output by  District factories was stable to increasing during the past six weeks.  Reports of increased production were  attributed primarily to seasonal adjustments or rising demand by customers in  energy-related industries.  On a  year-over-year basis, reports were evenly split between production slowdowns  and increases, with only one company experiencing a significant increase.  The outlook of manufacturers is best  described as guarded, with several contacts noting a softening in demand.  Steel shipments were stable to increasing for  producers and service centers.  The  strongest end markets for steel include energy and heavy equipment  manufacturing.  Contacts expect steel demand  to remain at current levels or decrease slightly during the third quarter.  District auto production showed a slight  uptick in April on a month-over-month basis.   Output by domestic nameplates increased, while their foreign  counterparts showed a small decline.  In  terms of year-over-year comparisons, auto production was down appreciably.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For the most part, capital spending remains on plan, with little change  expected in the 
  upcoming months.  Reports of decreased capital expenditures  were tied to lower sales forecasts.   Although standards have tightened, access to credit is not an issue for  manufacturers.  All our contacts reported  substantial price increases for raw materials, especially metals and  petroleum-based inputs.  In response,  over two-thirds of our contacts either raised their product prices or increased  surcharges.  Further, most contacts are  considering additional price increases in the near future if input costs  continue to rise.  Those manufacturers  who did not raise prices sell primarily to the housing industry.  About a third of our respondents said they had  recently hired a small number of workers, some on a temporary basis.  Other manufacturers noted that they had  increased overtime in place of new hiring.   Wage pressures are not a major issue at this time, though many  respondents expressed concern about rising health care costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      New home sales  were flat to declining, while inventory levels remain high.  Even though there has been a slight pickup in  traffic, almost all home builders expect no improvement in the housing industry  for the remainder of 2008.  New home  prices have been relatively stable since our last report, though discounting  has increased.  Accounts of dramatic increases in steel, concrete, and fuel costs were widespread; in contrast,  lumber prices were stable.  Several  general contractors reported reductions in staff and that subcontractors are  readily available at competitive rates.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Commercial contractors said that business has been steady over the past  six weeks, with several noting an increase in activity on a year-over-year  basis.  However, several builders  mentioned that backlogs are weakening.   Further, owners and developers are finding it more difficult to obtain  project funding due to stricter credit standards.  Most contractors experienced a rise in the  cost of materials, especially for steel and concrete.  Workforce levels remain largely unchanged.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District  retailers reported flat to improving sales across all segments since our last  report.  However, our contacts are very  cautious in their outlook for the third quarter, with the majority expecting  sales to be relatively flat.  Reports  from auto dealers showed that new and used car sales across the District were  mixed, while purchases of SUVs and trucks declined.  Dealers anticipate little change in sales  during the coming weeks.  In general, 
  vendor price  increases were limited to food items, paper products and fuel surcharges.  Most retailers have passed these increases  through to their customers.  Capital  expenditures remain on plan, albeit at reduced levels compared to 2007.  Employment growth is limited to staffing new  stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Demand for commercial and industrial  lending was mixed.  Segments showing  strength include commercial real estate and small business loans.  Consumer loan demand has weakened, especially  for autos.  Nonetheless, a few contacts  noted a pickup in home equity lines of credit.   Most respondents experienced a slight increase in delinquencies.  An uptick in home mortgage originations was  attributed to seasonal factors and is not seen as the beginning of a  trend.  Bankers told us that credit is  available, though lending standards continue to tighten.  Reports on core deposits were mixed.  Employment levels across District banks  showed a small net decline, and a few bankers are experiencing modest wage  pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      On balance, there has been little change  in
      <strong>
      </strong>
      oil, gas and coal production.  However, energy producers reported a pickup in  oil and gas drilling.  Looking forward,  almost all our contacts told us they expect to see a rise in production  activity.  Reports indicate that spot and  contract prices have increased across the board.  In general, equipment and material costs,  especially fuel, were on the rise.   Capital expenditures were on plan or slightly higher than projected,  with half of our respondents telling us they expect to increase the number of  capital projects during the next few months.   Employment levels increased slightly, and producers are looking to  expand payrolls.  However, many of them  told us that it is difficult to attract qualified workers, which is  contributing to some upward pressure on wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Freight transport has been flat since our  last report, with volumes running below available capacity.  Most carriers expect current market  conditions to continue into the second half of 2008, with some modest  improvement toward the end of the year.   All our contacts noted a significant jump in fuel prices, which they  were largely able to pass through via a surcharge.  Freight pricing remains competitive; however,  as excess capacity is removed from the system, some contacts believe prices  will begin to strengthen.  Capital  expenditures were reported to be somewhat below projected plans.  Carriers expect that future expenditures will  not 
  increase until freight volumes  start to pick up.  Hiring was limited to  driver turnover, and no change in wages was reported.
