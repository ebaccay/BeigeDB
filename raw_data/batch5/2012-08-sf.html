      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to expand at a modest pace   during the reporting period of July through mid-August. Price inflation was   limited for most final goods and services, and upward wage pressures were quite   contained. Sales of retail items rose a bit further on net, and demand for most   business and consumer services continued to expand. District manufacturing   activity appeared to inch up on balance. Agricultural output expanded, while   activity continued to trend up for providers of energy resources. Home demand in   the District strengthened a bit further, and demand for commercial real estate   was largely stable. Contacts from financial institutions reported that overall   loan demand was unchanged or weakened slightly on balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Price inflation was limited for most   final goods and services during the reporting period. Prices increased for some   energy items, mainly crude oil, retail gasoline, and electricity, but natural   gas prices remained near historic lows. Contacts also noted price increases for   assorted food commodities, particularly grains, although meat prices reportedly   have leveled off for the time being. For most products and services, vigorous   competition among firms and cost-conscious purchasing behavior by consumers kept   price inflation in check.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were quite limited overall. Wage increases were noted   for employees in some manufacturing sectors where wages had been flat for   several years; the reported increases were moderate, in the 2 to 3 percent   range. Wage gains also remained significant for workers with specialized skills   in the application of information technology. Contacts in general reported very   limited hiring plans for the balance of the year, suggesting that upward wage   pressures will remain muted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retail sales expanded a bit   further overall. Respondents in general indicated that sales strengthened   somewhat in July compared with softness in May and June. Performance was   stronger for discount chains than traditional department stores, particularly   for online sales. At grocery stores, extensive bargain hunting by shoppers   caused sales revenues to weaken a bit. The pace of auto sales slowed somewhat   compared with the prior reporting period, although it remained significantly   above the pace from the same period last year. Used vehicles have been in short   supply, raising their trade-in values and helping to spur sales of new vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for most business and consumer services expanded further. Sales   continued to grow for a wide variety of technology services, with expectations   for further rapid growth in selected segments, such as cloud computing services.   Advertising revenues remained at high levels for radio and television   broadcasters in the District, but the slow drift of television production   activities away from District locales such as Los Angeles continued. Providers   of health-care services noted a drop in the demand for discretionary medical   services and a consequent reduction in capacity utilization at medical care   facilities. Demand picked up further for restaurants and other food-service   providers. Contacts in the District's travel and tourism sector reported   additional gains for business and leisure travel, although the pace of growth   has slowed of late in some areas such as Las Vegas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District manufacturing activity was mixed   but appeared to inch up on balance during the reporting period of July through   mid-August. Production activity remained at high levels for makers of commercial   aircraft and parts. Demand continued to grow for pharmaceutical manufacturers.   Output and sales strengthened a bit further for manufacturers of wood products.   By contrast, the slowdown continued for makers of information technology   equipment, with sales declines reported for some equipment categories in recent   months. Demand for steel was mostly stable at low levels, while sales of   processed scrap metal fell, largely as a result of a decline in overseas demand.   For petroleum refiners, capacity utilization rates increased somewhat, as growth   in export sales for a range of refined products offset weakness in domestic   demand for gasoline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Agricultural   producers saw further sales gains, and extraction activity of natural resources   used for energy production continued to expand. Orders and sales grew for many   crop and livestock products, and one report indicated that demand for cotton was   particularly strong. The persistent drought in parts of the country has raised   grain and feed prices, prompting District cattle ranchers to reduce herd sizes.   Extraction activity for petroleum and natural gas remained at high levels or   expanded a bit further on net, although some producers have been shifting   operations away from natural gas in response to continued high inventories and   the consequent low price.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Home demand in the District   continued to improve, while demand for commercial real estate was largely   stable. Although it is still well below its historical average, the sales pace   for new and existing homes picked up further in many areas, and some contacts   pointed to pent-up demand that may spur additional gains. Contacts also reported   that the share of foreclosures and short sales in overall home sales has been   declining, and the quality of the inventory of available homes has improved. In   some parts of the District, a shortage of lower-priced homes and rental units   has led to an ongoing increase in construction activity, particularly for   multifamily rental projects. Demand for nonresidential space was largely stable   overall, with construction activity largely limited to various public projects   and remodeling of commercial and industrial space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was unchanged or down slightly on balance compared with the   prior reporting period. Business loan demand appeared to drop a bit, amid   growing reluctance by many firms to commit to expansion plans under current   economic conditions. At the same time, the reports continued to highlight ample   liquidity and stiff competition among lenders to provide credit to   well-qualified business loan applicants. Demand for consumer credit remained   relatively strong, reflected primarily in high lending activity for automobile   and home purchases.
