      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 12, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy continued to expand in late November and December,   despite slower construction activity. Strong consumer spending over the holidays   lifted retail sales and expectations for future spending. Manufacturing activity   improved amid a rise in new orders and stronger durable goods production, and   some plant managers planned to increase capital spending and hire more workers.   Residential and commercial construction remained weak, though commercial real   estate sales edged up and vacancy rates dipped slightly. District bankers   reported stable banking conditions with some improvements in loan quality.   Energy activity expanded further, and incomes improved for the agricultural   sector. Even though several district contacts expected to increase employment,   wage pressures remained subdued. With raw materials prices continuing to climb,   more manufacturers expected to pass through higher input costs to finished goods   prices; however, most retailers did not plan to raise selling prices in the   coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending improved in late   November and December, and many retailers expected further gains in the coming   months. Brisk holiday shopping boosted retail sales with some reports of price   discounting. Store managers reported that major appliances and household items   sold well. Retail sales were expected to edge up further in the next three   months. After improving slightly in the last survey, auto dealers reported   limited sales, which contributed to larger vehicle inventories. Dealers were   optimistic, however, that auto sales would pick up with additional financing   incentives and discounts. Restaurant operators reported stronger overall sales   despite a continued decline in the average check amount. Tourism activity   improved, and Colorado resorts reported a strong start to the winter ski season.   District hoteliers reported average occupancy and room rates fell since the last   survey but were above year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District   manufacturing activity strengthened further since the last survey, and plant   managers were increasingly optimistic about future activity. Plant managers   reported that production, shipments, and new orders increased in December, led   by durable goods manufacturers. During the first half of 2011, manufacturers   expected new orders, shipments and production to rise, and finished goods   inventories to remain flat. Some factory managers planned to increase employment   levels as well as capital spending in the coming months. Stronger demand for   computer software and IT consulting contributed to a rise in sales at high-tech   firms. Activity in the transportation sector slowed since the last survey period   but remained above year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial   construction slowed in late November and December, while commercial real estate   sales and vacancy rates improved slightly. There was little new home building   activity since the last survey period, and construction supply sales were down.   Homebuilders and real estate agents noted reduced buyer traffic and a decline in   home sales, especially compared to last year when buyers were motivated by the   federal tax credit program. With limited sales activity, home inventory levels   were expected to grow over the next three months, accompanied by further   reductions in home prices. After rising in the last survey period, mortgage loan   activity eased with fewer home purchases and less demand for refinancing.   Commercial construction activity slowed and was expected to remain weak over the   next three months. District commercial real estate contacts, however, reported   an uptick in sales and noted prices generally held steady despite further rent   reductions. Vacancy rates dipped and were expected to move lower as absorption   rates gradually improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the recent survey period, bankers reported   generally stable deposits and loan demand with an improved outlook for loan   quality over the next few months. Overall loan demand was stable to slightly   weaker. Demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate   loans were little changed while demand for residential real estate loans and   consumer installment loans decreased. For the third straight survey, credit   standards remained unchanged in all major loan categories. Compared to a year   ago, loan quality edged up slightly, and bankers expected loan quality to   improve further over the next six months. After rising in the previous survey,   bankers reported that deposits held steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural growing conditions deteriorated   since the last survey period, but rising crop prices supported farm income   gains. Continued dry weather across the Southern Plains intensified drought   concerns and could affect winter wheat development, especially in Oklahoma and   Kansas. Crop prices rose further at year-end, boosting farm incomes. Strong   export demand for beef supported an uptick in cattle prices, but hog prices fell   with bigger supplies and softer demand for pork. With rising incomes, farm loan   repayment rates improved, farm loan renewals and extensions fell, and farm   capital spending remained robust. Even with a modest increase in the number of   farms for sale, strong demand pushed farmland values higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District energy activity expanded further in early   November and December. District contacts reported increased drilling activity,   driven by additional oil rigs in Oklahoma. While energy producers expected   drilling activity to rise in the coming months, some indicated that a lack of   qualified labor and limited availability of equipment and services would   constrain future drilling activity. Natural gas prices held steady, with ample   supplies offsetting higher demand as the winter heating season began. Crude oil   prices rose in late November and December, and contacts expected further price   gains with stronger global demand and a weaker value of the dollar. Ethanol   prices rose with tighter supplies and a one-year extension of the ethanol   blenders' credit and tariff. Higher ethanol prices preserved producer profits   despite elevated corn prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wages generally held steady even as some   firms reported an uptick in hiring, and prices paid for raw materials rose   further. Several contacts across a variety of sectors expected to increase   employment over the next six to twelve months, including manufacturing,   transportation, high-tech, energy, and retail. However, few employers planned to   offer higher salaries, and wage pressures were expected to remain low. Firms   that were maintaining or reducing staff levels often cited low sales growth and   uncertainty over regulatory costs as reasons for not hiring. District   manufacturers reported another jump in raw materials prices and expected more   increases would follow. Transportation companies, builders, and construction   supply firms also expected input prices to rise, especially for fuel and   petroleum-based products such as roofing shingles. More plant managers planned   to pass higher input costs to finished goods prices, and several transportation   and high-tech firms anticipated raising prices in the next three months. In   contrast, District contacts in the retail sector noted some price discounting   during the holiday sales season, in addition to reduced hotel rates and more   incentives offered by auto dealers. Most retailers expected selling prices to   hold steady in coming months. Menu prices remained flat at restaurants despite a   steep rise in food costs.
