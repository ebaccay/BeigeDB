      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 8, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Recent business developments are positive on average across the First   District, but performance continues to vary between and within sectors. Reports   are mostly upbeat among contacts in software and IT. Manufacturing firms also   had mostly positive news, with recent sales at least steady for most and very   strong in some cases. Among staffing services, positive developments outnumber   negative ones. Retailers give mixed results, including some significant sales   declines. In the commercial real estate market, leasing activity is flat to   modest and downward pressure on rents remains high in Boston. Residential real   estate sales are very weak following the expiration of the home-buyer tax credit   but selling prices are up slightly in many parts of the region. Concerning the   labor market, some firms are hiring modestly or plan to hire soon, while others   are still reluctant to hire. The number of job-seekers is perceived as high by   some, while others are having difficulty filling vacancies requiring specific   skills. Some software and IT firms are giving significant pay raises and   staffing firms also note an increased willingness to pay higher wages among some   firms. Constraints in ocean-freight capacity are a concern among manufacturers   and retailers, as are increases in commodity prices. The outlook varies widely   across sectors, from largely positive in manufacturing and software to cautious   in retail and tourism and mixed among commercial real estate professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District retailers report mixed   sales results for July and early August. Year-over-year same-store sales range   from decreases of 10 percent to increases in the low single-digits, and one   contact quips that "flat is the new up." Back-to-school sales were modest, with   the consumer focused on buying for immediate needs only. Several retailers   report increases in foot traffic but also smaller average ticket size. Inventory   levels are generally in line with expectations. However, decreased ocean-freight   capacity has firms concerned about their ability to restock in a cost-effective   and timely manner, forcing additional advanced planning. Capital spending is   mixed and headcount is stable. Retailers note significant cost increases for   food commodities, particularly dairy. Outlooks are cautious or cautiously   optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travel and tourism are stronger than expected. One contact attributes the   trend to generous travel incentives, supported by an increase in the number of   low-fare air carriers operating out of Boston. Overseas arrivals are much   stronger than forecast. Business travel is also more robust than anticipated,   with travel managers using the downturn to leverage favorable rates. The   respondent reports modest hiring in the visitor industry, although the outlook   remains cautious.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Nearly all   manufacturing firms surveyed report favorable results for the second quarter.   Demand is particularly strong at semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms. One   respondent from a long-standing business describes the second quarter as their   best ever. In contrast, a parts supplier for the aircraft industry says that   demand has been slow to recover from the recession. Sales held steady in recent   weeks among many contacted manufacturers; multiple respondents attribute recent   demand to booming business in northern and western Europe. The same firms   describe domestic sales as flat in comparison. In addition, several diversified   manufacturers and one large domestic industrial manufacturer all note that sales   leveled off in recent weeks relative to the first half of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventory levels at many contacted firms are reportedly low in comparison   with pre-recession levels. One firm remarks that, even if demand were to slow,   it would not be as damaging as in 2008 because most goods are being produced   only as orders arrive. Low inventory levels are also attributed to supply   constraints. A number of firms report that suppliers are producing at capacity   due to cuts in capacity in 2008 and 2009. In addition, inputs for one firm have   been slow to arrive because of cutbacks in global ocean-freight capacity. These   constraints have led at least one contact to stockpile intermediate inputs as a   hedge. Despite supply constraints, almost all respondents report that selling   prices remain relatively steady, although some note continued fluctuations in   raw materials prices. Some firms passed modest price increases on to their   customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiring remains limited among the manufacturing firms surveyed. The companies   that cut workforces substantially during the recession are slowly re-hiring   workers, although employment at most of these firms remains below 2008 levels.   Some firms expect hiring to pick up next year, although one firm wants to see   sustained growth before making major hiring plans. A few semiconductor and   pharmaceutical firms continue to have difficulties filling skilled positions.   Capital spending plans at most manufacturers remain moderate, as some firm's   upgraded IT infrastructure and other equipment. A number of firms characterize   the investment environment as favorable but had not yet found good   opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many firms remain optimistic about growth going forward. One contact notes   that demand is much stronger than what news reports suggest. By contrast, a few   firms are not as optimistic as they were three months ago. Firms again mention   being concerned about the uncertainty of fiscal policy going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Software and Information Technology Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Software and   information technology contacts in the First District report that business   conditions continued to improve. Year-over-year revenue increases ranged from   mid-single digits to 15 percent in the most recent quarter. Half of contacted   firms increased their headcounts and another was "on the cusp of hiring." One   contact, however, reports a modest reduction in headcount due to restructuring.   Wages are steady or up notably, with some merit increases in the range of 3 to 5   percent. Prices held steady and one contact observes less discounting pressure   relative to a year ago. Half of contacted firms say that they have increased   capital and technology spending relative to last year in order to expand or   upgrade equipment; remaining contacts held capital and technology expenditures   steady. The outlook among contacts is moderately positive. Most expect a   continuation or slight acceleration of current growth rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Staffing Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The majority of First District staffing   contacts report that business continues to strengthen, although a few   experienced stagnant or inconsistent activity over the past three months. Most   contacts describe business since the end of Q2 as "fair to good" or "generally   positive," with revenue growth in the single digits. Year-over-year revenue   changes vary widely, from down slightly to up by over 40 percent. Labor demand   increased, particularly in the light industrial, information technology, and   health care sectors; however, the consensus among contacts is that jobs are hard   to fill. A few contacts report that the supply of job seekers is plentiful but   that clients are reluctant to hire; others said that recruiting workers with   specific skills has become more difficult. Bill rates and pay rates are steady   or up slightly, as many clients show increased willingness to pay higher rates   for quality workers. The number of conversions from temporary to permanent staff   increased and permanent placements picked up. Several contacts express concern   over rising costs, particularly workers' compensation, health insurance, and   state unemployment insurance taxes. Despite these concerns, contacts predict   continued growth in the coming quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts in Hartford, Boston, and   Portland describe commercial leasing activity as flat in recent weeks, while a   Providence contact describes activity as healthy, notwithstanding some seasonal   slowing in recent weeks. Lease renewals and relocations resulted in net negative   absorption across the region as businesses continue to consolidate operations.   Investors continue to bid aggressively for low-risk properties, while demanding   steep discounts on distressed assets. Contacts in Hartford and Portland both are   increasingly pessimistic concerning the outlook based on weak forecasts for job   growth, while a Providence contact sees potential for significant positive   absorption in the downtown office market based on deals currently under   discussion. Also on the bright side, loans are flowing to new condominium   conversions in core Boston neighborhoods based on increasing buyer demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Residential Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       New England contacts report large   year-over-year declines in home sales. In July, the greater Boston area   reportedly had the fewest sales in over a decade while other parts of the region   also experienced very weak sales. Nonetheless, contacts observe relative calm   among realtors regarding weak sales activity. They understand that the   home-buyer tax credit moved sales forward in time, leaving fewer buyers in the   market following the expiration of the incentive. Some contacts are optimistic   that a recovering economy and low interest rates on mortgages, particularly for   buyers with good credit, will draw buyers into the market in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of homes and condos on the market increased around the District. A   couple of respondents in Massachusetts expect the increased inventory, and   resulting greater choice, to lure more buyers to the market; conversely, a New   Hampshire contact is concerned about the excess supply of homes. The median   price of homes and condos moved up in most parts in New England. Such moves are   attributed to a greater fraction of sales coming from higher-end properties   rather than to a general increase in prices. The only exception to this trend is   New Hampshire, where prices fell 1 percent year-over-year. Contacts expect   prices to remain stable in the coming months, although they anticipate slower   sales for the rest of year due to the expiration of the tax credit and perceived   lack of job security.
