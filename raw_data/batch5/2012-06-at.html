      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 6, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that economic activity   continued to expand at a moderate pace
      <strong>
      </strong>
      in April and May.   Reports were somewhat more positive than the previous report, and expectations   remained generally optimistic across most sectors. However, uncertainties   surrounding the potential impact of developments in Europe weighed on the   outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers noted a modest increase in sales activity, and auto sales   remained strong. Positive reports from the hospitality sector included healthy   occupancy and room rates, and future bookings were solid. Brokers and   homebuilders noted higher sales compared with last year, and commercial real   estate contacts stated they were seeing improvements led by gains in the   apartment segment. Manufacturers cited modest growth in new orders and   production. Bankers asserted that the demand for refinancing mortgages continued   to increase slowly. Hiring activity was positive, but muted. Firms continued to   note difficulty filling specialized positions. Most businesses indicated having   little pricing power; however, an increasing number of firms said that they have   been able to successfully pass on price increases, especially those tied to   energy costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District   retailers indicated that consumer spending improved in April and May. Merchants   anticipate that sales will continue to grow at a modest pace in the near term.   The auto sector remained strong, and regional dealers expect sales to remain   solid going forward. Despite the recent slide in gasoline prices, merchants   remained wary of the potential impact on personal spending. That said, few   retailers reported significant changes in consumer behavior with the exception   of those operating in rural areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leisure and business travel contacts continued to report robust activity and   a solid outlook for the remainder of 2012. Occupancy and room rates exceeded   expectations and convention bookings remained strong. Reports also showed that a   number of hospitality-related capital investment projects were underway in   several areas across the District. Florida continued to be bolstered by visitors   from South America and Canada. Cruise-line bookings were down slightly compared   with the last report. High fuels costs were identified as a downside risk to the   summer travel season, but hospitality contacts were somewhat less concerned than   they were earlier in the year. They were more concerned, however, about a   potential decline in visitors from Europe.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of residential   brokers said that home sales exceeded year-ago levels in April and May with many   reporting that sales exceeded expectations. Strengthening sales, mostly from   cash buyers and investors, were noted by most Florida contacts. Brokers observed   that inventory levels across the District continued to decline. The majority of   contacts reported that home prices were flat to slightly up on a year-over-year   basis. The sales outlook among brokers remained positive with most anticipating   year-over-year gains, albeit from very low levels of overall activity, over the   next several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      District homebuilders reported that new home sales and construction rose   modestly compared with a year earlier. Builders indicated that home price   declines continued to abate. The majority indicated that new home inventories   declined further on a year-over-year basis. Contacts noted that multifamily   construction remained robust and new projects continued to be announced. In the   short-term, homebuilders expect sales and construction to be flat to slightly up   compared with a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Improvements in the District's commercial real estate markets were led by   gains in occupancy and solid rental growth in the apartment sector. Overall,   small improvements were noted in the region's office and industrial sectors as   vacancy rates moderated somewhat; however, reports on District retail real   estate were more mixed. Although flat on a year-over-year basis, the majority of   commercial contractors said that year-to-date construction activity was slightly   ahead of activity in last year's fourth quarter. Backlogs were down from a year   earlier. Most contacts anticipate a modest increase in private construction   activity through the remainder of the year, while public works projects are   expected to decelerate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District's   manufacturing sector continued to expand modestly in April and May.   Manufacturers reported growth in new orders and production, but noted that   employment growth had slowed somewhat. A District auto manufacturer announced   plans to add a third shift to meet increased global demand for their products.   Auto producers continued to note concern about economic and financial conditions   in Europe, a significant market for the region's auto exports.
     </p>
     <p>
      Railroad contacts noted continued volume growth in shipments of automobiles,   metals, and forest products, along with strong intermodal demand. Shipments of   coal, construction-related aggregates, and chemicals continued to moderate,   however. Reports indicated that elevated diesel prices were allowing railroads   to maintain a competitive edge over trucking. At District ports, imports of   construction-related steel was reportedly strengthening.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending standards remained largely   unchanged since the last report, but banking contacts indicated that more   applicants were qualifying for loans. Most District bankers commented that   demand for refinancing mortgage loans continued to increase; more applicants had   ample cash for down payments or enough equity in their homes to meet the loan   requirements. Credit availability increased and competition among lenders for   loans remained strong. Some bankers mentioned improvements in the general   creditworthiness of borrowers and appraisal valuations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Price
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional employment growth remained   positive, although contacts noted that uncertainty regarding future economic   conditions was a major headwind for additional job creation. Employers continued   to express difficulty hiring for specialized positions, such as those in   information technology and engineering. Trucking contacts also noted continuing   trouble finding qualified labor to meet new federal regulations and some   manufacturers cited difficulties finding trained operators and welders. Skilled   auto mechanics also appeared to be in short supply. Firms noted the importance   of efforts by government and academic institutions to coordinate training   programs with large employers. Contacts also indicated that private training   programs funded by trade associations or industry groups were being developed to   train workers where larger public programs were not available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Though most contacts continued to indicate having little pricing power, more   firms recounted successful attempts or plans to pass on price increases since   the last report. Increased transportation costs, including those resulting from   higher gasoline and other fuel prices were being passed on to consumers without   much difficulty. Firms responding in May to the Atlanta Fed's Business Inflation   Expectations survey reported that unit costs were expected to rise 1.8 percent   for the year ahead, down from an average of 2.0 percent over the previous three   month period. According to businesses surveyed, materials costs had subsided   somewhat since April, though they are still expected to have a moderate upward   influence on prices over the coming year. Despite continuing reports that sales   levels are below what they consider to be normal, contacts anticipate little to   moderate upward price pressure from improving sales levels over the next 12   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts noted that   more investment is needed in transportation infrastructure to accommodate recent   increases in domestic and Canadian energy production. District refining contacts   indicated that the capacity to process heavier grades of crude are limited and   despite investment in additional refinery capacity, a number of recent and   planned refinery closures elsewhere in the country could imply that existing   facilities may have difficulty meeting demand for distillate fuels, like diesel   and jet fuel. Permits for offshore drilling have increased in recent months.   Drought conditions worsened in most of Florida and Georgia and parts of Alabama.   Prices paid to farmers for oranges were up and a contact reported these higher   prices were dampening demand. Prices paid for soybeans were up on a   year-over-year and month-over-month basis because of strong global demand and   decreased supplies coming from South America.
