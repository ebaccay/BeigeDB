      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Eleventh District firmed up further over the past   six weeks. Respondents in high-tech manufacturing, retail, residential real   estate, energy and staffing and transportation services cited continued   improvement in demand. Conditions in the commercial real estate, financial   services and construction-related manufacturing sectors also showed signs of   nearing bottom. Although respondents continued to express caution in their   outlooks, overall expectations were slightly more optimistic than the last   report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weak demand, excess capacity and competition   continued to put downward pressure on selling prices or fees across several   industries, and some contacts noted lowering prices to keep the business. There   were reports of an uptick in raw materials prices for steel, fuel, cotton and   sugar. Rising raw material costs are squeezing margins as many contacts are   unable to pass on these increases to clients.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crude oil prices rose from $75 in mid-February to over $80 per barrel in late   March. On-highway prices for diesel and gasoline followed suit, rising nearly 20   cents per gallon. Prices of chemicals and related products also rose sharply   largely due to plant outages. In contrast, natural gas prices slipped from $5.50   per Mcf to near $4 during the reporting period due to continued high levels of   production, low industrial demand and the end of the winter season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment levels held steady at most   respondent firms. Layoffs have subsided but most firms are hesitant to hire new   employees. On a more positive note, staffing firms continued to cite increased   hiring activity, and there were reports from a few high-tech manufacturing,   paper and lumber industry respondents that temporary hiring had edged up. A   high-tech manufacturer noted opening a new plant, while a large discount chain   operator said they were opening new stores and expanding headcount albeit at a   much slower pace than before the recession. Additionally, some energy service   and transportation manufacturing firms noted an uptick in hiring. Wage pressures   were nonexistent, and a handful of firms reported they planned on partially   reinstating employer matches to employee 401(k) plans or on giving small pay   increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from construction-related   manufacturers were mixed, but overall they suggest that activity has bottomed   out. Some firms noted that favorable weather in March led to an uptick in   orders, while others reported continued weakness. Contacts say that while the   "worst may be over", they expect a slow recovery in business. Fabricated metals   producers cited a sharp rise in orders, and reported a positive sales outlook   for the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of trailers reported a large increase in orders over the past   month, and added that they were building up inventories to better meet   customers' needs. Manufacturers of emergency vehicles said growth in orders   decelerated over the past six weeks as customers, particularly municipalities,   are experiencing a decline in tax revenues. An aircraft components manufacturer   reported an uptick in demand but said that orders remained significantly below   year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper manufacturing firms cited flat to rising demand. Respondents say   conditions have improved relative to last year, but the picture is far from rosy   and expectations are for a slow and gradual recovery. Food producers said demand   held steady over the past month, and noted a positive sales outlook for the   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in high-tech manufacturing reported that orders continued to   accelerate and the book-to-bill ratio was well above one. Contacts say   inventories have increased slightly but still remain below desired levels. In an   industry where prices typically fall, strong demand has helped stabilize prices.   Most respondents are cautiously optimistic that demand will remain solid over   the next three to six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemical producers report that ethylene plant outages have led to large   increases in prices for ethylene and other related products such as polyethylene   and polyvinyl chloride, which has dampened export demand for these products.   Refinery margins remain very weak, and capacity utilization rates are below 80   percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales rose further during the reporting   period. Large discount store chains noted an increase in demand especially for   electronics and household items, and department store sales were also better   than expected. Contacts say although consumers remain cautious, they are   regaining confidence and are more willing to spend. Outlooks remain guarded but   contacts expect continued improvement in sales throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales rose over the past six weeks, which contacts attributed to   improving consumer confidence. Inventories remain lean. Prices are flat but   rebates recently introduced by Toyota, have led other automotive manufacturers   to follow suit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing firms say orders are streaming in at a   solid pace and are well ahead of last year. Demand is still largely for contract   work, but direct hire placements are picking up pace. Sustained growth in orders   has boosted contacts' assessments of current conditions as well as their   near-term outlook. Accounting firms note that demand outside of tax related   services remains sluggish. Demand for legal services held relatively flat at low   levels, with the exception of a slight uptick in energy-related activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from transportation service firms were generally positive. Strong   overseas demand pushed up intermodal cargo volumes over the past month. Small   parcel shipping firms said a pickup in demand from the professional and business   services, manufacturing and nondurable retail sectors led to positive growth in   volumes. Railroads reported a modest but broad-based increase in shipments, and   noted that the outlook is more upbeat than last time. Airline demand appears to   be slowly improving, with leisure travel seeing continued growth and business   travel stabilizing. Contacts expect demand for air travel to be steady this   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing contacts noted more   favorable conditions. Builders said sales in the first three months of the year   were relatively strong, especially at the low end. Sales of higher priced homes   are happening but they are not as widespread. Given the severe cutback in   construction in the first quarter of 2009, builders have been pro-active in   adding spec homes in hopes of sales and closings before the expiration of the   current tax credit. Realtors were encouraged that prices were up slightly and   noted the housing market was in the beginnings of a modest rebound. Overall,   housing contacts were more positive in their outlooks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment demand in most Texas markets was "meaningfully positive," according   to contacts. New product was leasing well and there were fewer move-outs in   older units, consistent with an improving job market. Lower rents were "doing   their job" and generating positive demand. The exception was Houston, where   overall leasing was weaker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from commercial real estate contacts were mixed, but overall they   suggest the sector may be nearing bottom. Declining rental rates have spurred   leasing activity in the office and industrial markets. One industrial contact   noted that landlords have "taken a realistic look" at conditions and are   offering drastic reduction in rental rates on renewals. Respondents noted that   while absorption had improved, there would be no construction any time soon.   Commercial property sales activity picked up from very low levels. Contacts said   while the good deals being offered were minimal; there were many interested   buyers and lenders. Outlooks for the commercial real estate sector were mixed,   with some contacts expecting continued improvement and others anticipating a   longer, rocky road ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan demand remains soft but appears   to be stabilizing. Contacts are seeing more commercial and industrial loan   activity in the pipeline as well as some improvement in credit card volumes and   consumer loan demand, albeit with more aggressive pricing. Real estate lending   is still restricted. Deposit growth has been relatively flat, and lending   standards remain tight. Credit quality appears to have turned a corner, and is   either stabilizing or improving. Despite a shift towards stabilization and   slight optimism, much uncertainty remains around impending regulatory changes,   particularly for community banks. Overall, most contacts expect growth in   revenues and loan demand to be slightly positive this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The rig count rose further over the past six   weeks. Oil-directed drilling continued to be boosted by rising oil prices.   Contacts say the increase in gas-directed drilling is not justifiable at current   low prices, but firms are drilling based on futures prices locked in earlier, to   hold leases and to learn the shale technology. There is concern that   gas-directed drilling will decline in the second half of the year. Demand for   oil and gas services and equipment continues to grow with the rig count.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wet weather continues to boost pasture   growth. It has, however, delayed spring planting in some areas, which may lead   producers to shift away from corn in favor of crops with shorter planting   seasons such as cotton and grain sorghum. Net farm income is expected to be   higher in 2010 compared with last year but below the ten-year average.
