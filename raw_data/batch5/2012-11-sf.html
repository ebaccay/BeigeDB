      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded at a modest pace during the   reporting period of October through mid-November. Price inflation for final   goods and services was subdued overall, and upward wage pressures were quite   limited. Sales of retail items and most business and consumer services rose   further on net, and contacts noted expectations for sales growth during the   holiday retail season. District manufacturing activity was uneven but appeared   to expand on balance. Agricultural output and sales increased, and extraction   activity rose for providers of energy resources. Housing demand continued to   firm, and conditions were largely stable for commercial real estate. Contacts   from financial institutions reported that overall loan demand was largely   unchanged, while credit quality improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Upward price pressures were very limited   on balance during the reporting period. Prices fell for some energy items,   mainly crude oil and retail gasoline; prices rose significantly for natural gas   but remained very low by historical standards. Earlier price increases for food   commodities prompted moderate price increases by restaurants, in the range of 2   to 3 percent. Price movements for raw materials used in the agricultural,   industrial, and construction sectors were uneven but appeared to be slightly   upward on balance. Retail prices were characterized as largely flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upward wage pressures were modest overall. In most sectors, limited hiring   activity and extensive worker availability held down recent and planned   increases in wages and overall compensation, with reported numerical increases   of 2 to 3 percent in general. Only a few cases of significant upward wage   pressures were noted, including for truck drivers, health-care workers, and   entry-level employees in a few geographic areas where unemployment rates have   declined substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales expanded further.   A pickup was noted for department store sales during the reporting period, on   the heels of a slight slowdown earlier. Significant sales gains were reported   for consumer technology products such as tablet computers and games, and   retailers added to inventories of these products in anticipation of solid sales   growth during the upcoming holiday season. Sales of new and used automobiles   remained strong, running well above levels from 12 months earlier, with further   gains expected at year-end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for business and consumer services expanded on net. Sales continued to   grow for various technology services, as consumer demand remained high and   businesses in many sectors focused their limited capital spending on information   technology equipment and software. Demand for health-care services stayed   somewhat weak, due to an ongoing decline in the use of discretionary medical   services; however, health-care providers continued to invest in new information   technology products to enhance efficiency and respond to emerging legislative   requirements. Sales expanded further for restaurants. Activity in the travel   sector was robust, with strong growth for visitor counts and spending in Hawaii   and continued sales growth and profitability reported for U.S. airlines in   recent months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       <a id="OLE_LINK1" name="OLE_LINK1">
        District   manufacturing activity was mixed across sectors but appeared to expand on   balance during the reporting period of October through mid-November.   P
       </a>
       roduction activity for commercial aircraft and parts has been running well   above levels from last year, with further gains in production and sales expected   over the next few years. Demand continued to grow at a modest pace for   pharmaceutical manufacturers. For producers of wood products, capacity   utilization and sales have held up in recent months and generally have been   running above their levels from last year. By contrast, the slowdown continued   for makers of information technology equipment, with further sales declines   reported for some equipment categories. Demand for scrap metal and steel   remained low by historical standards but improved a bit, largely as a result of   increased demand for use in automobile manufacturing and infrastructure   construction projects. Production activity fell at petroleum refineries in   response to recent declines in consumer demand for gasoline.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural   producers saw further sales gains, and extraction activity of natural resources   used for energy production continued to expand. Contacts noted that the   agricultural sector appears to be immune from factors that have restrained   growth in other sectors of late: production activity and sales of most crop and   livestock products have been growing at a solid pace, as has investment spending   on new production equipment. Extraction activity expanded on balance for   petroleum and natural gas, although the number of rigs used for natural gas   extraction has been falling as producers have shifted their extraction   activities toward higher-valued oil formations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Home demand in the District   continued to strengthen, while demand for commercial real estate was largely   stable. Home sales have been growing on a sustained basis in most areas,   spurring incremental gains in home construction activity. Home prices also have   firmed, with significant gains reported over the past 12 months in some areas,   substantially reducing foreclosure pressures. Construction activity for   multifamily rental projects grew further in response to rising rents and tight   availability of lower-priced homes. Demand for nonresidential space was largely   stable overall, and contacts noted that the amount of new commercial   construction was limited, although significant construction activity continued   for large infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was largely unchanged on balance. Business loan demand was   characterized as weak to moderate. Firms in most sectors remain uncertain about   near-term prospects for their revenues and costs; hence, they are reluctant to   make new capital investments other than those that directly enhance business   efficiency and pay returns within a short time frame. The reports continued to   highlight ample liquidity and stiff competition among lenders to provide credit   to well-qualified business loan applicants, with community banks facing   increasing competition from larger national banks for small business lending.   Consumer lending expanded further, primarily for automobile purchases and new or   refinanced home mortgages. Contacts noted that credit quality has been showing   slow but steady improvement for business and consumer loans.
