      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 16, 2013
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District economic activity generally grew at a modest pace in recent weeks.   District manufacturing growth slowed, and retail sales
      <strong>
      </strong>
      flattened, with the exception of food and vehicle sales. Non-retail   services providers reported stable to stronger demand, and tourism activity was   at normal winter levels. Commercial and consumer lending varied by location,   while the environment remained competitive. Residential real estate activity   continued to improve; reports on commercial real estate activity, however, were   mixed. Agricultural conditions remained favorable. Oil and natural gas   production held steady at high levels during the past six weeks, but coal   production fell. Labor market conditions weakened somewhat since our last   report. Manufacturers' input prices were little changed, while finished goods   prices rose at a slower rate, and the pace of wage growth remained moderate.   Services providers' prices rose slightly faster and non-retail wage growth edged   up. Retail price increases slowed, and wages fell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District manufacturing continued to expand,   but at a more modest pace since our last report. A furniture manufacturer said   that his business had improved through gains in market share and new product   introductions, and that the improvement should continue in 2013. A spokesperson   for the technology industry reported that 2012 was expected to be flat, but   instead grew by ten to twelve percent. Another contact stated that,   "Manufacturing is hanging in there," noting that niche markets were doing best,   but only if they were not dependent on international demand. A producer of   lumber products commented that sales volumes and orders dropped, in part because   of Hurricane Sandy's impact on their customer base in the northeast. An   electrical components manufacturer reported that business was "terrible," adding   that his only sales were to replace ruined equipment from Hurricane Sandy, and   that export orders to Europe had dropped off. According to our latest survey,   raw materials prices were relatively flat, while finished goods prices rose at a   slightly slower pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Ports
       <br/>
      </strong>
      The typical seasonal surge in import volumes   shifted as a result of two major events. The first was the threat of an East   Coast port strike that has loomed since the September 2012 expiration of the   master contract between the International Longshoremen's Association and the   U.S. Maritime Alliance. A number of shippers used alternative West Coast and   Canadian ports ahead of the peak season to minimize disruptions to their   businesses. Secondly, Hurricane Sandy caused diversions to Fifth District ports,   boosting an already solid peak season. In addition, bulk fuel shipments that   were diverted to the Northeast created "a pinch in supply" for companies located   further south. Exports of resins for plastics, grains, forestry products and   metal scrap were especially strong, with imports being led by beverages and   retail goods. Both exports and imports of auto-related products were robust.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retail sales
      <strong>
      </strong>
      flattened, with the   exception of food and vehicle sales, according to most merchants contacted since   our last report. Several blamed the lackluster sales on the federal government's   failure to resolve its fiscal issues. Most retailers responding to a special   poll indicated that they planned an equal amount of holiday discounting as a   year ago. A West Virginia department store manager reported that sales were a   little soft ahead of Christmas, while other retailers noted little change. In   contrast, many grocers noted an uptick in revenues. Although big-ticket sales   were weak overall, car sales rose by double-digit percentages in recent weeks.   Federal fiscal indecision also pushed sales of heavy trucks, construction   equipment, and buses at the end of 2012, ahead of the possible expiration of   bonus depreciation. According to survey respondents, retail price growth slowed   during the past month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Services firms reported stable to stronger   demand since our last report. An executive at a national freight trucking firm   indicated that revenues flattened in the District, while another trucking   company reported that demand slowed slightly, although that company was able to   improve its margins. Demand strengthened at telecommunications and engineering   firms, and a contact in Washington, D.C. remarked that law firms see regulatory   practice as a growth industry. During the week of Christmas and New Year's Day,   the CDC reported that the flu had become widespread across the District. An   executive at a North Carolina healthcare facility commented that the "flu season   hit early and hard," more than doubling the average number of cases for that   time of year. Non-retail services prices rose slightly faster in recent weeks,   according to survey respondents.Ã‚
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity was at normal winter levels in recent weeks, and rate   changes were modest. In addition, a D.C. contact commented that restaurant   bookings were brisk for holiday meals and events. An executive at a Virginia   resort area said that his rentals were filled up for the week from Christmas   through New Year's Day. A source on the outer banks of North Carolina reported   somewhat less tourism activity, compared to a year ago because of lingering road   problems caused by Hurricane Sandy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Demand for both consumer and commercial loans   varied across the District. A North Carolina lender noted that mortgages for new   purchases of homes declined, in part because of economic uncertainty. However, a   second North Carolina lender said new financing is outpacing refinancing at his   bank. According to another North Carolina banker, the home mortgage business is   improving and he indicated that refinancing has strengthened in his region; in   addition, a number of lenders stated that the competition among lenders for   refinancing business has been aggressive. Finally, a banking contact with   several locations in the District reported that demand for consumer loans and   mortgages had not changed much. Bankers in Maryland and West Virginia reported   that foreclosures have slowed. A West Virginia banker said that while overall   credit quality has been very good, residential mortgage delinquencies have crept   up slightly, and that demand for commercial credit had been steady at a relative   high rate in recent weeks. Another West Virginia banker remarked that his   region's commercial and industrial loan demand had slowed because economic   progress has been "lumpy." A banker in North Carolina reported that loan demand   from businesses had remained weak despite lower borrowing rates, owing in part   to economic uncertainty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential real estate activity continued to   improve since our last report. A contact in South Carolina said that the real   estate market was dynamic in the Charleston area and that demand and pricing   were stronger than they had been in a long time. A Realtor in the Washington,   D.C. area expects a strong market through early 2013, as the combination of   record low inventory and low interest rates encourages new listings. A contact   in West Virginia told us that home sales in his area have improved considerably   and that prices were flat for the first time since the drop in values two years   ago. Another source saw improvement in the "move up" market but little to no   activity in the speculative market. He also remarked that the start-up market   for housing remained flat and that the effect of student loans on credit scores   was a cloud over the mortgage market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports were mixed on commercial real estate and construction markets in the   District. While a few contacts reported modest improvement in activity since our   last report, others noted flat activity or modest declines. A developer in the   Carolinas said that absorption rates in the office sector tightened in the   downtown Charlotte area, but vacancies in suburban areas remained elevated. In   contrast, a real estate representative in Virginia indicated that office park   absorption rates in the Roanoke suburbs were good, with ninety percent occupancy   rates, which he attributed to new medical facilities. However, he noted that   vacancies in the downtown area were considerably higher. Most sources also   mentioned tightening of available office space, especially among Class A   properties, due to lack of new construction. A Charlotte Realtor stated that   leasing rates in the industrial sector continued to decline this year and noted   little new development in the retail sector. Moreover, several realtors reported   that rental rates were soft, noting that it was a "tenant's market." However,   all contacts were in agreement that concessions were decreasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Agricultural conditions   remained favorable. Oil and natural gas production remained at high levels   during the past six weeks. December was relatively mild across most of the   District, with warmer than normal temperatures and significant precipitation.   Small grain conditions improved with the added moisture, as did pastures and   hayfields.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although conventional oil and natural gas production held steady at high   levels, the rig count fell in West Virginia. Cushioning the fall, many companies   continued to drill in order to get wells in place before permits expired. In   contrast, coal production fell last year due to lower demand from domestic   utilities and offshore customers, idling many mines. One coal producer   attributed the depressed coal market to stricter regulations coupled with lower   natural gas prices, as well as a weaker economy both in the United States and in   Europe.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Conditions in labor markets weakened since   our last report. There were several reports of soft demand for workers in part   because businesses were reluctant to hire in the politically uncertain climate.   Retail employment dropped sharply in recent weeks, and several service sector   contacts indicated that hiring decisions were in a holding pattern. Exceptions   were to fill vacated positions and to ease nursing shortages, and a Washington   contact remarked that restaurants were paying bonuses to attract managers.   Sources continued to report difficulty finding qualified workers to fill   vacancies, particularly in advanced manufacturing. Two Virginia temporary   employment agencies noted increased demand for high tech and highly skilled   workers. According to an ad hoc poll, less than half of the retailers who made   seasonal hires expected to offer those employees a permanent position after the   holidays. Wage growth in manufacturing remained moderate, even among skilled   workers, while average retail wages declined. In contrast, non-retail service   sector wages continued to rise at a moderate pace.
