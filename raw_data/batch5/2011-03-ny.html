      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy appears to have expanded at a modest pace since   the previous report. Business contacts in most industries report stable to   improving conditions and express widespread optimism about the near-term   outlook. Labor market conditions have been mixed but generally steady, on   balance: T here has been little or no net hiring in the financial and   manufacturing sectors, but a slight pickup in some other sectors. Retail sales   are characterized as relatively strong in early 2011, despite inclement weather,   and consumer confidence has continued to improve. However, tourism activity has   shown signs of slowing by more than the seasonal norm in early 2011. Commercial   real estate markets remain fairly slack: The market for office space has been   generally stable, while the market for industrial space has softened somewhat.   Housing markets have been mostly stable, with scattered signs of improvement.   Finally, bankers report strengthening demand for commercial loans and mortgages   but weaker demand for home mortgage loans; they also indicate little change in   credit standards and steady to lower delinquency rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers generally report continued   strength in sales in early 2011. One major retail chain notes that sales were   ahead of plan in January and on plan in February but that New York City   underperformed the rest of the region--possibly due, in part, to the heavy   snowfall during January, which is estimated to have reduced sales by about 1   percent. Retail contacts in upstate New York also report that sales have been   brisk since the beginning of the year, despite a brief lull in early January,   with one Buffalo-area contact indicating that sales continue to be buoyed by a   steady flow of Canadian shoppers. Inventories are generally reported to be at   desired levels, and the pricing environment continues to be characterized as   highly promotional.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in upstate New York report that sales of new vehicles continued   to trend upwards in early 2011, as lean inventories of used cars have nudged up   prices and spurred demand for new models. Dealers in the Rochester and Buffalo   areas report that sales of new autos were up 10-20 percent from a year ago in   January, with reports of particular strength for domestic brands. Both retail   and wholesale credit conditions continued to improve. Service departments also   report fairly brisk business, aside from a brief slow patch in early January.   One industry contact notes that a recent auto show in western New York State   drew strong traffic. Dealers are generally optimistic about the sales outlook   for 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      Confidence surveys suggest that consumers are in somewhat better spirits.   Siena College's survey of New York State residents shows confidence surging to   its highest level since 2007, with good gains both upstate and downstate. The   Conference Board reports that consumer confidence among residents of the Middle   Atlantic states (NY, NJ, Pa) edged down from a 3-year high in January but   remains near the upper end of its recent range.
     </p>
     <p>
      On a less positive note, tourism activity in New York City registered more   than a normal seasonal slowdown since the beginning of the year, though the   overall level of activity remains fairly high. Occupancy rates at Manhattan   hotels in January were somewhat lower than a year earlier, while revenues held   steady, reflecting moderate increases in room rates. In the first half of   February, however, revenues have been running a bit lower than comparable 2010   levels--if this persists for the full month, it would be the first 12-month   decline in revenues since 2009. Broadway theaters report that, after a brisk   December and early January, both attendance and total revenues tapered off   noticeably around mid January and have been running roughly 10 percent lower   than a year earlier over the past few weeks--in part because a number of shows   have closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing markets across the   District have been generally stable since the previous report, with pockets of   mild improvement. An authority on New Jersey's housing industry reports that the   market has been performing slightly better in early 2011, as the negative   aftermath of last year's homebuyer tax credit appears to have worn off. While   there is still a sizable supply of existing homes on the market--including a   large number of distressed properties--the inventory of available new homes in   northern New Jersey is reported to be very low. The residential real estate   market in metropolitan Buffalo also appears to have recovered to more normal   levels of activity after several months of sluggish performance. There are signs   of gradual improvement in Manhattan's apartment rental market: Rents continued   to rise at a moderate pace, the inventory of available units is described as   tight, and fewer landlords are reported to be offering concessions than last   year. Conditions in Manhattan's co-op and condo market, on the other hand,   appear to be holding steady: A major appraisal firm reports that prices are   holding steady across the board and notes that, while contract activity fell   noticeably in January, harsh weather is seen as the culprit, and transaction   activity appears to be rebounding in February.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets generally remain slack--the market for office   space has been mixed but mostly stable in recent weeks, while the industrial   market has shown further signs of softening. In New York City, office leasing   activity has remained fairly brisk, but this has been more than offset by   additional space coming onto the market; as a result, vacancy rates edged up in   January. Asking rents on Class A properties did edge up in January but were   still down nearly 10 percent from a year earlier. Elsewhere across the region,   office vacancy rates edged down in northern New Jersey and across much of   upstate New York but rose modestly in Long Island and in Westchester and   Fairfield Counties. Industrial markets showed further signs of softening across   much of the District. Long Island's industrial vacancy rate rose to its highest   level in more than a decade, and rents drifted down. In northern New Jersey,   industrial vacancy rates held steady, but rents slipped to multi-year lows.   Across upstate New York and in Fairfield County, vacancy rates and rents were   little changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from business contacts   generally suggest that firms tend to be adding workers, on net, and plan to   increase staffing levels in the months ahead. A major New York City employment   agency reports that labor market conditions are improving gradually and that   hiring activity has picked up somewhat since the previous report. Financial   sector hiring is reported to be up marginally--largely in the areas of trusts   and estates--and legal hiring has picked up a bit from very low levels. A   securities industry contact reports that layoffs continue but at a subdued pace;   still, there is said to be little or no net hiring in this industry. Cash   bonuses are reported to be down somewhat from a year ago, though overall   compensation is seen as little changed. Most manufacturing contacts, however,   indicate that they are currently keeping employment levels steady, though some   net hiring is anticipated in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers report a decrease in the   demand for residential mortgages, but increased demand for commercial and   industrial loans and especially commercial mortgages; demand for consumer loans   is reported to be little changed. Bankers indicate no change in the demand for   refinancing. Respondents note some tightening of credit standards for commercial   and industrial loans, on net, but no change in standards for the other loan   categories. Bankers report no change in spreads of loan rates over costs of   funds across all loan categories; spreads had been narrowing towards the end of   2010, based on the prior few surveys. Respondents indicate that average deposit   rates have been steady to declining. Finally, bankers report a decrease in   delinquency rates for commercial mortgages but no change in delinquencies for   the other loan categories.
