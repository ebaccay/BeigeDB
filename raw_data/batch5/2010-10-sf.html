      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to post further modest   growth during the reporting period of September through early October, although   conditions in many sectors remained weak. Price increases for final goods and   services were quite limited, and upward pressures on wages were virtually   nonexistent. Demand for retail items and services continued to strengthen   somewhat, but sales remained lackluster overall. Manufacturing activity in the   District firmed a bit further on balance. Sales were robust for agricultural   products, while demand was largely stable for energy resources. Activity in   District housing markets remained sluggish, and demand for commercial real   estate stayed weak. Contacts from financial institutions reported largely stable   lending activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures were very limited   on net during the reporting period. Commodity prices changed little in general,   with the exceptions of continued increases in grain prices and rising prices for   metals, particularly copper. Contacts pointed to very limited pricing power for   most retail items and service categories, as final prices continued to be held   down by weak demand and extensive competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were largely absent, although reports pointed to   further increases in the costs of employee benefits, particularly health care.   High unemployment and limited demand for new employees held down compensation   gains in most regions and sectors. Contacts in most sectors expect that ongoing   productivity gains and cost efficiencies will largely offset the need for   staffing increases in the near term. However, a few contacts noted that some   firms have reached the limits of productivity gains from current staff and will   need to add workers as product demand improves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales remained sluggish   but improved somewhat on balance. Both traditional department stores and   discount retail chains reported modest improvements in sales, although somewhat   elevated inventories were noted; moderately priced items such as selected home   and garden products reportedly saw the strongest gains. By contrast, retailers   of major appliances and furniture reported a further slowdown in activity and   expressed pessimism for a reversal over the remainder of the calendar year.   Grocery sales were characterized as largely flat, with consumers focused on   bargains, and grocers do not anticipate any change in customer buying patterns   for the foreseeable future. Sales of new domestic and imported automobiles   improved a bit, with dealers citing replacement of broken-down or leased   vehicles as key motivating factors for purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for services continued to improve modestly. Sales grew for providers   of technology services, spurred in part by business investments to enhance   production efficiency. Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry   noted continued slight gains in activity. Demand for professional, media, and   entertainment services held largely steady overall. Providers of energy services   reported increased deliveries to businesses and households, and activity picked   up somewhat for providers of trucking services. Conditions in the District's   travel and tourism sector improved further. Visitor volumes and hotel occupancy   rates rose in several of the District's major markets, spurred largely by   significant growth in business travel and convention activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity expanded   further on balance during the reporting period of September through early   October. For manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products,   demand continued to grow, although the pace of growth slowed a bit and   inventories rose slightly. Extensive order backlogs continued to keep production   rates at or near capacity limits for manufacturers of commercial aircraft and   parts. Demand firmed further for metal fabricators, although capacity   utilization remained well below normal. Activity at petroleum refineries slowed   a bit and inventories rose, as seasonal declines in domestic demand were only   partly offset by increased overseas demand. Conditions in the wood products   industry remained depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of   agricultural products continued at a brisk pace, and demand appeared to hold   steady on net for natural resources used for energy production. Final sales and   orders for most types of agricultural products continued to be robust, and input   costs stayed largely stable. Unfavorable weather conditions and consequent   supply restrictions for overseas producers have boosted sales for domestic   producers of corn and food grains. Demand for crude oil fell slightly, largely   as a result of the normal end-of-summer lull, but extraction activity for   natural gas rose further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing demand in the   District appeared to be little changed from the previous reporting period, and   demand for commercial real estate remained largely stable at very low levels.   The pace of home sales continued to be mixed across areas but mostly unchanged   on balance. In response to sluggish sales, new home construction has stayed   quite subdued, although contacts reported slightly expanded activity for home   repairs and remodeling. Conditions in commercial real estate markets generally   remained weak, as vacancy rates stayed at very high levels in many parts of the   District. Although slight declines in total space availability were reported for   some areas, tenants continued to receive rent concessions and other favorable   terms in many cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand was largely unchanged compared with the   prior reporting period. Demand for commercial and industrial loans continued to   be restrained by businesses' cautious approach to capital spending and desire to   deleverage. Consumer loan demand also remained weak overall, although contacts   noted an uptick in demand for nonconforming mortgage loans. While lending   standards stayed relatively restrictive for business and consumer lending, the   reports suggested some loosening of credit standards for select groups of   borrowers. Contacts also pointed to an uptick in financing for corporate   acquisitions as well as further modest expansion in IPO activity.
