      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 4, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     Economic activity in the  Seventh District remained weak in January and February. The expectation of most  contacts was for economic activity to remain weak into late 2009 before slowly  beginning to recover in 2010. Consumer spending, construction, and  manufacturing activity continued to decline, and labor market conditions  deteriorated further. Credit conditions remained tight. Price and wage  pressures tilted toward the downside. Most key agricultural prices decreased  during the reporting period.
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer  Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending continued to soften.  Retailers reported that sales were slow, with apparel, big-ticket, and luxury  items experiencing the largest declines. Discount stores and fast-food  restaurants fared better than their higher-priced counterparts. A contact noted  that inventory reductions were likely to be substantial for the first quarter.  Auto dealers reported slight increases in showroom traffic and sales,  particularly for used vehicles. Nonetheless, their expectations for overall  vehicle sales moved lower. Auto dealers also noted that service center activity  continued to be strong, while vehicle inventory levels remained elevated and new  orders were down substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Spending
        <br/>
       </strong>
       The pace of business spending continued to weaken.  Contacts reported that they were trying to control costs by closely monitoring  expenditures and by reducing inventories.   Furthermore, contacts in several industries cited cuts in annual capital  expenditure budgets as well as delays in the timing of capital spending. Labor  market conditions in the District deteriorated. A contact noted that the longer  the duration of the current downturn, the more plant closings and permanent layoffs  will replace the temporary measures of rotating shifts and reducing hours now  being employed to lower output but still retain labor. Additional layoffs were  reported across a wide variety of industries. Hiring activity remained low,  outside of lower-end retail companies, healthcare, environmental related  businesses and highly skilled professionals in financial services and  information technology.  In addition, a staffing  firm reported a sizeable reduction in billable hours from the previous  reporting period.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Construction  activity in the District weakened further from the previous reporting period.  Residential construction continued its steady decline, with housing demand  remaining low, particularly for higher priced homes. Few mortgage originations reflected  new purchases, and even the recent boom in refinancing activity began to ebb  with the rise in mortgage rates in recent weeks. A contact also noted that  tighter secondary markets for mortgages and credit standards along with lower  home values have resulted in a much higher rejection rate of applications  during the recent refi boom relative to a year ago. Downward pressure on prices  and rents continued. One contact expressed the belief that the processing  period for new foreclosures will likely run its course by year's end, potentially  easing that influence on inventories and prices. Nonresidential development and  construction also weakened, with the exception of the healthcare sector.  Contacts expected a very limited impact on construction from the recent fiscal  stimulus bill for 2009, with a small boost to activity more likely in 2010 or  2011. Several contacts reported that commercial property values were declining  along with rents as vacancy rates continued to rise, particularly in the retail  sector. The availability and cost of financing remained a concern for  residential and commercial developers, with additional cancellations and  project delays reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity in the District continued to decline  from the previous reporting period.   Production and new orders were reported to have weakened further, and  several manufacturers reported aggressively liquidating inventories purchased  during last year's surge in material prices. Activity in the domestic steel  industry improved slightly from a very weak December. A contact noted that  service center inventories remain low, suggesting a quick turnaround for the  industry when demand improves. Other metals-related industries noted weakening  conditions. Mining activity was reported to have declined substantially, with a  subsequent drop in the demand for heavy mining equipment also reported. The  demand for heavy trucks and construction machinery, construction materials, and  housing-related items such as appliances declined further.  A contact noted that more overseas customers  were not accepting delivery on shipments of heavy machinery, as financing in  other countries for purchases was falling through. Several contacts expressed  concern over a further weakened state of the auto industry. Inventories of light  vehicles remained elevated, and sales in February were likely to be much lower  than even January's depressed pace.  In  contrast, contacts reported strength in demand for large agriculture equipment  and pharmaceutical products.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Credit  conditions remained tight. Bank lending decreased from the previous reporting  period and loan performance deteriorated as business bankruptcies in the  District increased. Contacts in the banking industry reported increases in the  fees and pricing for credit to riskier applicants, but stressed that credit  remains available for well-qualified borrowers. The auto and commercial real  estate sectors were noted to be of particular risk. Several contacts in the  financial sector reported that high volatility and illiquidity in some asset  markets continued to limit investment activity by banks, hedge funds and  private equity firms. Strains on bank balance sheets continued to be seen by  contacts as limiting credit availability. The demand for liquidity remained  high, but borrowing spreads decreased as elevated counterparty risk concerns  eased some from the previous reporting period. Conditions in the commercial  paper and corporate bond markets were noted to have improved significantly. In  contrast, illiquidity in the auction-rate securities market and the secondary  market for jumbo residential mortgages were raised as concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported closely monitoring margins  given ongoing declines in the demand for their goods and services. In general,  material prices declined in January and February. There were a few reports of  firms continuing to try to pass on last year's higher material prices; but, for  the most part, the input price declines that were showing through leaned toward  price reductions. Contacts in the construction industry cited expected  increases in the price of cement as a concern. Gasoline prices also increased from  the previous reporting period, but contacts noted that pass-through had been  minimal and that fuel surcharges from the previous year had disappeared in  recent weeks. The low cost of fuel was also reported to be showing through to  other energy prices, including electricity. Heavy discounting continued in  retail trade, where margins remained tight. Wage pressures also continued to  tilt toward the downside, with several contacts alternatively noting pay  freezes or reductions in non-wage compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most  agricultural commodity prices fell since the previous reporting period. Crop  prices moved down and were substantially lower than a year ago. Farmers  continued to store more corn and soybeans than last year given the current lower  prices. Farmland cash rents and input costs for crop production have not  decreased as much as crop prices, so farmers faced added pressures in making  plans for 2009. Some farms may incur significant losses, even at cash prices  above the triggers of the government safety net. Spring planting intentions  remained somewhat uncertain, though shifts toward soybeans and away from corn  are likely to occur. Hog prices increased, but dairy and cattle prices declined  from the previous reporting period. Even with recent below normal precipitation  in some areas, almost the entire District had plentiful levels of ground water  heading into the spring.
