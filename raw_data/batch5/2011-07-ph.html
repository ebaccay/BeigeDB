      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 27, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Since the last Beige Book, Third District economic activity has continued to   grow at a very slow rate. Overall, manufacturing growth has leveled off at a low   rate since the last Beige Book. Retailers posted strong year-over-year sales   increases in June. For motor vehicle dealers, the slowdown in sales that began   in May eased slightly further in June. On balance, bank lending has been mostly   flat since the last Beige Book. Steady and falling house prices continue to   dampen sales of existing and new homes, according to residential real estate and   construction contacts. Commercial real estate contacts reported small   improvements in market conditions since the previous Beige Book. Slight   increases in activity were reported by service-sector firms, dampened somewhat   by a hiring slump among customers. Price pressures from food, energy, and other   commodities continue to affect many sectors. The ability to pass along costs   remains mixed, and there is little evidence of wage pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third District business contacts continue to expect slow growth despite   expressing increased uncertainty. Manufacturers forecast a modest rise in   shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers remain cautiously   optimistic about future sales; auto dealers are more agnostic. Bankers expect   slight growth in lending, at best. Residential real estate contacts are   generally planning for a continuation of slow growth, comparable to last year.   Contacts in commercial real estate continue to expect modest gains.   Service-sector companies also expect continued slow growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Since the last Beige Book, Third District   manufacturers reported a lull in the growth of new orders and a slowdown in the   modest growth rate of shipments. However, activity was reported to be a bit   stronger in July. Among key manufacturing sectors in the Third District, the   number reporting increases of both shipments and orders has narrowed since the   last Beige Book. Growing product demand was reported by makers of furniture;   instruments; stone, clay, and glass products; and printers and publishers.   However, makers of food, apparel, chemicals, rubber, primary metals, fabricated   metals, and electronics reported declining product demand. Comments from firms   were mixed, with several citing an ongoing lull in customer demand, a few   surprised by unseasonal increases, and many concerned by economic   uncertainties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the uncertainties, Third District manufacturers have grown somewhat   more positive in their outlook for business conditions over the next six months   compared to the time of the previous Beige Book. Among firms contacted, over   two-fifths expect increases in new orders and shipments, while about one-fifth   expect decreases. One-third of firms polled project increases in capital   spending over a six-month planning horizon--the same proportion as at the last   Beige Book.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District retailers reported stronger sales   in June than a year earlier. Shopping trips and a willingness to spend were   aided by falling gas prices since the previous Beige Book. Consumers continue to   search for value, and retailers continue to respond with merchandise at lower   price points. Retailers remain cautiously optimistic as the critical September   through December retail period approaches. However, given the slow growth so far   this year, one retailer indicated that it would likely implement only half of   this year's capital budget plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third District auto dealers generally reported that sales eased further in   June after May's slowdown. Results varied by brand, depending on reliance on   Japanese production for the vehicle or parts. One dealer of General Motors   brands indicated June was the dealership's best month of the year. Dealers   remain uncertain about future sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District banks contacted in July indicated   little change in loan volumes outstanding. Many sources reported continued weak   demand from small businesses; some bankers cited stronger lending to middle   market businesses. Revolving credit had bounced back somewhat in June, after a   fall-off in April and May; however, the gains may have been lost in early July.   On balance, total credit extended by banks in the region has been flat to   slightly down. Expectations for better growth were not met for the most recent   period--dampening expectations for anything but the slightest improvement in the   near future, according to banking contacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate   activity in the Third District has changed little since the previous Beige Book.   While some agents reported positive comparisons during June and early July for   showings and sales compared to year-ago levels, activity last year was soft   after the tax credit expired. Agents and builders continue to report stronger   sales among mid- and low-priced homes, but incidences of high-priced home sales   are increasing. Reports of multiple offers for condos in center city   Philadelphia were noted by one agent as a glimmer of improvement. Most market   participants do not expect the year as a whole to be markedly different from   last year. In most parts of the Third District, sale prices of existing homes   continue to fall slightly; in a few areas, prices were unchanged. Traffic and   sales of new homes have weakened since the last Beige Book; however, one builder   reported an uptick in activity in Pennsylvania in the last two weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial and industrial real estate contacts have noted small improvements   in the Third District since the previous Beige Book. Overall, vacancy rates have   improved for office space, industrial space, and apartments, although one   manager said activity seems to have come to a standstill in the last month.   Retail space vacancies may have edged up slightly; however, demand is stronger   in regional centers and weaker at neighborhood sites. An ongoing trend of   trading up for quality as office space leases renew has lowered vacancies and   reduced concessions for Class A space, while raising vacancies for Class B   space. Rents are generally steady for most sectors in most areas and concessions   remain common.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from Third District service-sector firms   were slightly positive overall, but firms described various challenges. A   recurring theme was a recent slowdown in hiring, especially from small and   medium-sized businesses. One staffing agency described "almost a stop to new   [excludes replacement] hiring orders in the last three weeks." Other firms cited   projects delayed due to ongoing economic uncertainties, including   government-related projects contingent on budget negotiations. The most positive   firms recognized that the "easy year-over-year comps are over" in this recovery   and that continued growth will be slow. Despite these challenges, most   service-sector firms expect growth to be somewhat better over the next six   months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Wages
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Since the previous Beige Book, the   percent of manufacturers reporting increases in prices paid for inputs dropped   from more than one-half to one-third. Over the same period, the percent   reporting decreases in prices received for their own products rose from nearly   zero to over one-sixth. Rising commodity prices continue to pressure retailers,   service-sector firms, and home builders to pass through costs when they can and   to lower the price-point of their offerings. There are a few reports of a little   upward pressure on rents in selected local markets for apartments and some   retail space. Meanwhile, there is little evidence of pressure on wages.
