      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity 
  continued to expand from mid-April to early June, but there were some signs 
  of deceleration. Activity moderated in four Districts--Atlanta, Kansas City, 
  Richmond, and San Francisco--and the New York District noted increased concern 
  about the outlook for the second half. Seven Districts--Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, 
  Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, and St. Louis--said growth was similar to the 
  pace reported in the last Beige Book. The Philadelphia District, however, reported 
  an improvement in overall economic conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending continued to increase, but District reports suggest that 
  the growth rate slowed. Manufacturing activity still expanded quite strongly, 
  but reports indicate more areas of weakness than in March and early April. Residential 
  real estate markets continued to cool across the country, with slower homebuilding 
  and sales of existing homes. In contrast, commercial real estate activity strengthened, 
  and a few reports expressed concern about too much building in some portions 
  of the real estate market. Activity in service-producing industries was strong 
  or increased in all Districts that reported on that sector. The financial sector 
  continues to report good credit quality. Commercial lending picked up, but there 
  was some slowing in loans to consumers, particularly for mortgages and home 
  equity loans. Growth in the energy industry continued to be robust, with expansion 
  constrained by shortages of equipment and labor. Agricultural conditions varied 
  across the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets continued to tighten, with more Districts reporting employers 
  having difficulty finding skilled workers. Wage pressures remained moderate 
  overall, with the exception being workers with hotly demanded skills. High energy 
  costs were fueling price increases in manufacturing and, to a much lesser extent, 
  retail. Reports of costs being passed forward varied considerably but were more 
  prevalent than in the last Beige Book.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Consumer spending continued to increase between mid-April and early 
  June, but reports were varied, and several Districts noted areas of weakness. 
  Some Districts mentioned that sales were slowing or weaker than anticipated 
  at discount stores or to lower income customers. High gasoline prices were cited 
  by a few Districts as changing purchasing patterns or clouding the outlook for 
  sales. A couple of Districts also said that rising interest rates were a concern. 
  Inventories were mostly reported to be at desirable levels, but the Atlanta, 
  Boston, and Kansas City Districts said some retailers had more inventory than 
  they would like.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two Districts reported weaker retail sales growth--Dallas and Richmond--and 
  retail sales were "down" compared with last year in the St. Louis District. 
  The Boston and New York Districts said results were "mixed," but Boston added 
  that the majority of retailers cited soft year-over-year sales gains. Three 
  Districts--Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco--reported little change 
  in retail sales. Philadelphia said sales in its District increased from April 
  to May, but gains were "varied" among stores. The Atlanta District reported 
  that sales rose at a "solid pace" but "some segments reported lower demand." 
  Improving trends were reported by the Cleveland District, and the Chicago District 
  said consumer spending continued to "increase modestly."
     </p>
     <p>
      Most reports about auto sales suggested weakness, with particularly poor sales 
  of SUVs and light trucks. Auto sales were reported as "sluggish" or "down" in 
  the Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Philadelphia Districts. Atlanta reported 
  that sales were "mixed," and Kansas City said auto sales were unchanged from 
  last month but lower than a year ago. Sales increased in the Dallas and San 
  Francisco Districts, but some dealers in the Dallas District reported sizable 
  excess inventory because sales were less than expected over the winter months. 
  The Chicago and St. Louis Districts also reported that inventories were higher 
  than desired, and the Philadelphia District said dealers had limited their orders 
  to manufacturers to keep inventories in check. The Kansas City District reported 
  that inventory levels were satisfactory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The manufacturing sector continued to expand quite strongly, but with more reports 
  of softening than at the time of the last Beige Book survey. Strong activity 
  was noted in the production of goods to supply the energy, semiconductor, and 
  aerospace industries. Areas of weakness included production of agricultural 
  equipment and autos. Slower demand for goods to supply residential building, 
  most notably lumber, was mentioned by a few Districts, although the Atlanta 
  and Dallas Districts reported demand for construction-related materials still 
  remained strong overall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity was characterized as "strong" or "up solidly" in the 
  Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts. The San Francisco District 
  reported that activity expanded overall, with production of commercial aircraft 
  near full capacity and capacity utilization of semiconductor manufacturers at 
  or above 90 percent. Production was "steady to increasing" in the Cleveland 
  District, and firms continued to report generally favorable conditions in the 
  New York District. Activity continued to expand in the Minneapolis and St. Louis 
  Districts. Two Districts--Philadelphia and Richmond--noted some softening or 
  leveling of growth. The Atlanta District said activity remained mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Boston, Dallas, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts report 
  "strong" or "robust" activity throughout the service-producing sector. Demand 
  for workers at temporary employment firms picked up in the Chicago, Dallas, 
  and Richmond Districts, while contacts in the Boston, Dallas, and New York Districts 
  indicated "steady" and "solid" activity. Business activity at information technology 
  service firms grew at a steady pace in the Boston and San Francisco Districts, 
  and firms in both Districts indicated an increase in hiring activity. Demand 
  for health-care and professional services was vigorous in the San Francisco 
  District, while demand for professional services in the Dallas District was 
  "typical."
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for trucking, shipping, and rail services remained strong across the 
  country, but companies cited difficulty finding and retaining drivers in the 
  Atlanta and Cleveland Districts. The Boston, Chicago, and Dallas Districts indicated 
  strong demand for air travel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the tourism and hospitality industries remained upbeat. Tourism 
  activity strengthened in the Boston, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond Districts 
  and remained solid in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. 
  The Chicago District reported steady tourist activity but noted that pre-bookings 
  were slow. Hotel occupancies were strong in parts of the Atlanta, New York, 
  Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, and the Atlanta District reported that 
  gambling revenues were recovering.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate markets continued to cool across much of the country--with 
  most Districts reporting slower homebuilding and sales of existing homes. In 
  contrast, commercial real estate activity continued to strengthen in most Districts. 
  A few reports noted concern about too much building.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some softening of the market for existing homes was reported by ten Districts--Chicago, 
  Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond, 
  St. Louis, and San Francisco. Dallas and Richmond noted that activity remained 
  quite strong, and Chicago reported slowing from high levels. San Francisco reports 
  hot housing markets in Utah and parts of the Pacific Northwest. Several Districts 
  said sales had weakened for some of the most expensive homes, except in the 
  Dallas District where demand for lower-priced homes "had dipped noticeably." 
  Atlanta reported that residential sales were near year-ago levels in most parts 
  of the District, but that sales weakened and inventories increased in Florida. 
  The Philadelphia District said sales of homes in resort areas have declined 
  sharply. The New York District reports a sharp deceleration in prices in the 
  suburbs around New York City, but a tightening of the Manhattan rental markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Homebuilding slowed in most Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas 
  City, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco. The New York District 
  reported that some homebuilders in New Jersey are withdrawing from the authorization 
  process and allowing their options to build to expire, noting that increases 
  in fuel and materials costs are pinching profits. Homebuilders in the Atlanta 
  District reported that single-family home construction was near year-ago levels 
  in most parts of the District, except in Florida, where sales slowed. The Atlanta 
  District also reported that Florida condominium sales continued to weaken and 
  several projects were cancelled.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity strengthened in nearly all Districts, with 
  mostly positive reports about office markets. Commercial building "improved" 
  in the Cleveland District. Office markets were steady or stronger in the New 
  York City metro area, with scattered signs of accelerating rents. The Philadelphia 
  District said vacancy rates have continued to decline in the region's office 
  markets. The Richmond District reported "fairly strong" office markets. Demand 
  for office space "edged up at a steady pace" in the Dallas District. Office 
  vacancy rates fell and rental rates rose in most major markets in the San Francisco 
  District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Boston reported that downtown office real estate markets were improving but 
  mostly at the expense of suburban markets. Demand for commercial real estate 
  in the Chicago District continued to expand, but the pace of new commercial 
  construction slowed, according to contacts, who said rents were too low to justify 
  new construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Kansas City District reported that commercial construction remained strong, 
  but received a few reports that high material costs were resulting in the scaling 
  down or postponement of some projects. Construction firms in the Philadelphia 
  District reported that rising costs have caused some construction projects to 
  be rebid or redesigned to reduce the amount of costly materials used. Some builders 
  in the San Francisco District continued to face cost increases and minor project 
  delays as a result of tight availability of skilled workers and selected materials, 
  such as steel and cement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Philadelphia District reported growing demand for industrial space and 
  an increase in construction of industrial buildings both on a speculative and 
  build-to-suit basis. Demand for industrial properties was said to be gradually 
  improving in the Dallas District. The Richmond District also reported growth 
  in commercial leasing in the industrial sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, and Dallas Districts expressed concern about 
  the level of investment in some portions of the real estate market. The Boston 
  District reported that New England--and Boston in particular--continues to attract 
  large volumes of commercial real estate investment, resulting in price increases 
  that require "ambitious assumptions" to justify the transaction. The Dallas 
  District noted growing concern about overbuilding of condominiums and town homes 
  in Dallas, and contacts "fear that it will end badly." A contact in the Chicago 
  District expressed concern about the potential for overbuilding of large distribution 
  centers in Indiana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall lending activity was mixed, and credit quality remained good across 
  the nation. The New York, Chicago, and Atlanta Districts reported continued 
  slowing in loan demand, while lending activity levels held steady in the Dallas, 
  Kansas City, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Only the Philadelphia District 
  noted an increase in overall loan volumes over the past six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for commercial loans increased or remained steady in most Districts, 
  with only the Atlanta and Chicago Districts reporting a slowing in commercial 
  lending activity. Bankers in the Dallas, and Richmond Districts said loan pricing 
  was very competitive, and contacts in the Richmond District said they had to 
  reduce margins to retain market share. On the consumer side, most Districts 
  reported softening mortgage finance activity, while reports of other types of 
  consumer loans were mixed. Demand for home equity loans weakened in the Chicago 
  and Kansas City Districts but was up in the Cleveland and Philadelphia Districts. 
  Refinance activity was categorized as "brisk" in the San Francisco District 
  but declined in the Chicago, Kansas City, and New York Districts. Slower auto 
  lending was reported by the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit growth was mostly steady, and some Districts noted an increase in 
  interest rates on deposits. Delinquencies declined in the Chicago and New York 
  Districts, but bankers in the Philadelphia District expect rising default rates 
  if interest rates continue to rise. The Kansas City and St. Louis Districts 
  reported no change in lending standards, while the New York District reported 
  an easing in credit standards, especially for consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions varied across the country. Spring rains boosted moisture 
  conditions in parts of the Dallas and Minneapolis Districts, and most crops 
  were off to a good start in the Chicago, Richmond, and St Louis Districts. Plantings 
  were ahead of last year's pace in the Minneapolis, Richmond, and St Louis Districts, 
  while crop conditions improved in the Atlanta District. In contrast, a dry spell 
  lowered winter wheat crop yields and was hurting cattle producers in parts of 
  the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. Concerns about high fuel and fertilizer 
  costs were reported by contacts in the Kansas City District as well as the Minneapolis 
  District, where agricultural lenders anticipated a decline in farm income in 
  the second quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The energy industry continued to show strong and expanding oil and gas activity 
  in the five Districts that mention the sector--Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, 
  Minneapolis, and San Francisco. The Dallas and Kansas City Districts noted that 
  drilling activity is being constrained by shortages of equipment and labor. 
  Expansion of coal-fired power plants, wind farms, and ethanol distilleries was 
  reported as under way in the Minneapolis District. The Kansas City District 
  also reported that a railway expansion is in progress that will allow more coal 
  to be moved out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin to end users.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts reported that overall mining activity 
  is strong, with all open mines in the Minneapolis District producing at or near 
  capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to tighten across the country. Shortages of some types 
  of skilled workers were reported by nine Districts--Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, 
  Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. Six 
  of those Districts noted that the shortages had intensified--Atlanta, Boston, 
  Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Richmond. District reports mention a variety 
  of skills that are in short supply, including truck drivers, some types of engineers, 
  financial analysts, and oil and gas workers. The Minneapolis and New York Districts 
  noted strengthening labor markets. In contrast, manufacturers in the Richmond 
  District reported that hiring softened after several months of moderate payroll 
  increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Salaries continued to rise, but wage pressures were reported to have intensified 
  somewhat in only a few Districts--Dallas, Kansas City, and Philadelphia. The 
  San Francisco District said wage growth remained rapid for selected worker groups 
  with specialized skills. The Cleveland District reported an absence of any accumulating 
  wage pressure outside of a few specific skills. Pay rates were not accelerating 
  in the Boston or Chicago Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Atlanta District reported that shortages of affordable housing were hampering 
  labor availability in South Florida and the Gulf Coast region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Concerns about high or rising costs were expressed by business contacts across 
  much of the country. Cost pressures were pushing up selling prices for manufacturers 
  in several Districts, but few reports indicated that these increases were reaching 
  the retail level. Four Districts--Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, and New York--cited 
  rising selling prices for manufacturers, and just three Districts--Boston, Dallas, 
  and Philadelphia--reported that retailers are having success raising retail 
  prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cost pressures increased in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, 
  Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Some firms 
  in the Philadelphia District said their suppliers were including automatic price 
  escalation in contracts to cover future increases in the cost of materials. 
  The San Francisco District noted little or no change from the modest upward 
  pressure on prices noted in the previous report. Only the Richmond District 
  reported that raw materials prices increased less rapidly than in the last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Higher prices were reported for a number of items, with the products most 
  cited including fuels, metals, petroleum-based products, and many building materials, 
  such as concrete, steel, copper, and zinc. The most notable price decline was 
  for natural gas. A number of Districts reported increases in fuel surcharges. 
  In the New York District, fuel surcharges were being added with relatively little 
  resistance from customers. Increases in delivery charges were noted by firms 
  in all industries in the Philadelphia District. The Cleveland District reports 
  that rising freight costs were affecting retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the Philadelphia District said they have raised retail prices 
  significantly for some goods with large plastic or metal content, although they 
  had not implemented major price increases for most lines of merchandise. Several 
  retailers in the Dallas District said that they had passed cost increases through 
  to higher selling prices. Retailers in the Boston District indicated that vendor 
  prices continued to reflect increases for petroleum-related items, and many 
  contacts reported being able to pass on some price increases to consumers. The 
  Atlanta District reported that firms' ability to pass on higher costs to customers 
  remained mixed, citing slowing demand and strong competition restraining price 
  increases. Five Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and San 
  Francisco--reported little change in retail prices since the previous reporting 
  period. The Richmond District reported that retail price growth eased slightly 
  in May.
