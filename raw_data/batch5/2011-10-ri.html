      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Fifth District were either weak or weakening in   most sectors since our last report. Manufacturing activity contracted moderately   in September, after pulling back markedly in August. Retail sales also softened.   In addition, activity at non-retail services firms began to decline. Both   residential and commercial real estate activity remained near the weak levels   seen in recent months. However, in banking, a moderate improvement in commercial   lending offset weakness in mortgage lending. Tourism remained strong overall.   District labor markets had undertones of weakness, with temp services reporting   problems finding qualified workers. Price pressures moderated since our last   assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continued   to contract in September. A primary metals producer reported a dramatic falloff   in their domestic orders, noting that a domestic retail chain had recently   cancelled a large order. The firm expects to cut production unless orders   improve immediately. Similarly, several textile and apparel manufacturers   indicated that customers had reduced their purchases. Moreover, a number of   furniture producers cited sluggish consumer spending, but added that corporate   spending had improved somewhat since our last report. In contrast, an automotive   parts maker said that underlying business was very strong. Also, a metal   fabricator cited examples of improving orders, with autos and aerospace among   his strongest customers. Our latest manufacturing survey showed that raw   material prices grew at a considerably slower pace, while prices for finished   goods changed little since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Port activity has advanced at a slower-than-expected pace in recent months.   Several analysts stated that exports continued to outpace imports, but   characterized both as somewhat soft during the current peak season. An official   noted that major retailers were not anxious to build inventory going into the   big holiday season and were waiting for an improvement in consumer spending   before increasing their import orders. Another port official reported that ocean   carriers had also become less optimistic about cargo shipments over the   remainder of the year. Auto exports were flat in recent months, according to one   analyst, but auto imports were starting to increase as dealers began stocking   for the new model year. Exports of coal and other commodities continued to do   exceptionally well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales generally weakened since our last   report, although several merchants reported a pickup in the last week of   September. Most contacts indicated that back-to-school sales were satisfactory,   but for many, somewhat below expectations; a Virginia retailer commented that   sales were "good, though not fantastic." Shopper traffic waned in early   September but returned later in the month. A retail contact in central Virginia   reported that credit-card use increased toward the end of the back-to-school   season, indicating shoppers were more confident, but remarked, if consumers   accumulate sizeable levels of debt now, they might spend less during the holiday   season. An executive at a Virginia hardware chain also reported strong sales   through September, with little difficulty passing through price increases.   Looking ahead to holiday sales, a Maryland department store manager was   cautiously optimistic and she expected "practical gift-giving" this year.   Apprehension about the strength of holiday sales has constrained seasonal hiring   for some retailers. Small merchants in some areas reported difficulty obtaining   financing for inventory. Big-ticket sales continued to be soft overall, but   automobile sales were steady since our last report, according to several   contacts. A West Virginia auto dealer said that his sales were close to 2010   levels, while a dealer near the D.C. metro area reported a stronger month, led   by imports. Average retail wages and prices increased moderately, according to   our contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Non-retail services providers reported slower   activity. A number of services providers complained about various new government   regulations and regulatory burdens on their businesses. Contacts on the southern   Delmarva Peninsula expressed anxiety that new EPA regulations for the Chesapeake   Bay could result in local chicken farmers losing contracts to farmers further   inland, resulting in trickle-down business closures and job losses. Several   executives commented that they were refraining from expansion and hiring and   that they were holding cash because of uncertainty about the economy. An   executive from a West Virginia engineering firm commented, "We are now in a   wait-and-see mode." According to a transportation contact, freight trucking   firms faced challenges in hiring long-haul drivers, as drivers opted to remain   on unemployment benefits rather than accept higher income for driving   long-distance routes. Prices at services firms climbed more slowly since our   last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity in the District was mixed over   the last six weeks. Several commercial bankers in Virginia and Maryland reported   moderate increases in loan demand in recent weeks, although some of the increase   was from refinancing. One banker attributed an increase in loan applications to   businesses shopping around to establish new bank relationships. Also, a lending   officer in Richmond reported a sharp increase in loans to existing customers,   because new products were now available and the approval process was faster.   However, several bankers in West Virginia and the Carolinas noted a recent   slowdown in home mortgage lending, following signs of improvement as recently as   July. An exception was home refinancing, which benefited from lower mortgage   rates, according to several sources. One commercial and industrial loan officer   stated that the recent rise in economic uncertainty had caused several of his   clients to pay down debt. Another banker reported that local auto dealers were   borrowing less now, but were expected to increase their borrowing for new model   year deliveries. Most banks continued to report improvements in credit quality,   partly due to tighter credit standards. However, that tightening also   contributed to a slowdown of the approval process.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity continued to   be depressed. Several brokers reported that sales in their area had dropped and   that housing prices continued to decline. A contact in Charlotte described the   local real estate market as worsening, while a source from Richmond stated that   new building permits were down. According to a contact in Baltimore, the housing   market remained slow and short sales were getting harder to close due to tighter   regulatory standards. A Realtor from Northern Virginia said that there were   fewer foreclosure sales in the market, but added that short sales were still   about 50 percent of her company's sales. Another Realtor in the D.C. area   expected fewer sales for the upcoming season because inventory was shrinking,   but said that low interest rates should keep the market active. He added that a   moderate trend of sales at or above full price should continue for properties in   good condition. Finally, a market analyst from the eastern Virginia area noted a   modest improvement in sales activity, particularly in more urban areas. He also   noted that new construction had shifted towards smaller, more energy-efficient   homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate and construction activity was little changed from weak   levels that have persisted throughout much of this year. Many commercial   Realtors described the market as "spotty," with gains one week being offset by   declines the next. Warehouse leasing activity fell, due to soft manufacturing   sales and production. A Realtor in Virginia cited modest improvements in leasing   by small industrial clients who were expanding, but added that he had to offer   lower rents to retain several office tenants. An agent covering the Carolinas   noted that "leases were getting done," but problems obtaining financing were   holding back many deals. A South Carolina Realtor described the office market as   mixed, but noted that gains were limited to the high end of the market. On the   construction side, several contractors also described business as slow-paced. A   contractor in Maryland stated that a slight increase in building renovations   during June and July ended in August. Several contractors reported an uptick in   government-related projects, while private work continued to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although reports on labor market activity   were varied in September, on balance their tone was more negative than in our   last report. Employment agencies reported somewhat stronger demand for temporary   help in recent weeks, particularly in the manufacturing sector, but indicated   that finding qualified workers was becoming an increasing concern. A Virginia   contact noted that one-in-five businesses were having problems finding workers   with the desired skills, particularly in the manufacturing and professional   business services industries. A manager of a temp agency in North Carolina   stated that companies were hiring workers on a more permanent basis, but   companies were taking longer to do so than in the past. A temp agency executive   from the Charlotte area reported that, despite a backlog of work and employees   working a lot of overtime, a manufacturer was still unwilling to hire at this   time due to concerns about future demand. According to our latest survey,   service sector hiring was flat over the last month. Retail sector wages were   weak, while wages at service firms edged up. Hiring by manufacturers   strengthened over the last month, while the average workweek eased and wage   growth inched higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Following Hurricane Irene in late August, hotels   and related businesses on the Outer Banks of North Carolina quickly re-opened to   serve late-season travelers. The southern portion of the Outer Banks suffered   extensive damage, including destruction of buildings and roadways, particularly   along the Hatteras side. These tourist destinations are now closed, and many may   not re-open until next spring. However, tourism remained vibrant in other areas.   A hotel manager in western North Carolina reported strong bookings, both for   groups and for pleasure stays. He noted that "leaf peepers" were booked for   October and into November, and local holiday attractions were expected to keep   bookings up through the end of the year. Hospitality contacts in Richmond and   Baltimore also reported solid business. Finally, a contact said that recent   international media attention on the earthquake-damaged Washington Monument has   been overwhelming. He added that the new Martin Luther King Memorial was drawing   huge crowds.
