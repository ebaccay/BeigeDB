      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic activity in the Seventh District expanded more slowly in July and   August. Contacts expressed concern about the economic outlook, noting lower   business and consumer confidence. Both consumer and business spending were   little changed over the reporting period. Manufacturing production expanded at a   slower pace, while construction decreased. Credit conditions tightened   moderately. There was further pass-through of elevated commodity prices to   prices downstream. Expectations for the corn and soybean harvests were trimmed   due to hot and dry weather in most of the District.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Consumer spending was little changed on   balance from the previous reporting period. Retailers reported the   back-to-school shopping season got off to a strong start. Consumers responded   more than expected to the increase in early back-to-school promotions on items   such as apparel, and expanded their purchases even on non-back-to-school items.   Spending on luxury goods also increased in July, but slowed noticeably in early   August. Contacts noted that rising uncertainty about the economic outlook and   stock market volatility had led to a decline in consumer confidence, pointing to   lower customer traffic in August. Vehicle sales edged up in July before leveling   off in August. A contact in the auto industry reported that many consumers were   still waiting for Japanese products to become more readily available before   making a purchase decision. Spending on other consumer durables like furniture   and appliances remained weak.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Business Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Business spending continued at a slow,   but steady, pace in July and August. Some manufacturers reported proceeding as   planned with capital expenditures and labor force additions to alleviate   pressures on capacity. In contrast, contacts mentioned that lower expectations   for farm income had slowed purchases of farm equipment. Several contacts also   noted closely watching inventory and staffing levels in the event that increases   in uncertainty in the economic outlook and financial market volatility took a   toll on demand. A retail contact indicated that holiday inventories will likely   be higher this year because retailers had been very optimistic at the time the   orders were made. Labor market conditions weakened, with hiring still slow and   unemployment edging up in the District. In addition, a large staffing firm   reported a decline in billable hours for staffing and professional services as   well as fewer permanent placements.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction and Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Construction activity   softened in July and August. Residential real estate conditions remained weak.   There was little new single-family home construction during the reporting   period. Builder showroom traffic declined, as contacts noted an inability to   maintain the slight momentum they had seen early in the summer sales season.   Nonresidential construction also fell overall. Public construction work slowed   some and commercial construction remained low. In contrast, contacts noted   continued strength in demand for industrial construction, particularly from the   automotive sector, and a slight uptick in demand from the retail sector.   Commercial real estate conditions were little changed, with vacancy rates steady   and downward pressure on rents.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturing production appeared to have   settled down to a slower pace of expansion in August after experiencing some   volatility in output during July. Demand for heavy equipment moderated from its   robust pace during the first half of the year. However, contacts noted as   reasons for its expected continued strength robust activity in the energy and   mining sectors, pending regulatory emissions requirements, low dealer   inventories, a lack of used equipment, and an aging rental fleet. Auto   production increased in July before leveling off in August, as inventories   returned to more comfortable levels. District automakers also reported no change   in production plans, despite concerns about the recently slower gains in sales.   Capacity utilization in the steel industry remained at a record high level, with   order books solid and steel service center inventories still tight.   Manufacturers of industrial metals cited a significant softening in orders for   near-term delivery, but a pick-up in recent weeks in higher volume, longer-lead   time orders. In contrast, shipments of household appliances and construction   materials continued to decline.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Banking and Finance
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Credit conditions tightened   moderately over the course of the reporting period. Volatility in financial   markets increased dramatically in early August. Contacts cited S&amp;P's   downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, increased concerns about a European   sovereign debt default, and reduced expectations for growth in the second half   of the year as reasons for the increase in volatility. Corporate funding costs   moved higher as a flight to quality caused credit spreads to increase. Business   loan demand fell, with bank contacts indicating that heightened uncertainty had   led many customers to adopt a "wait-and-see"attitude. Private equity investment   also slowed. On the supply side, the availability of commercial and industrial   credit continued to improve both for large and small borrowers, with stiff   competition for the highest quality customers. Some traditional real estate   lenders were reportedly moving into the commercial and industrial market,   increasing competition and further lowering the cost of capital for these   borrowers. That said, contacts expressed concern that recently announced layoffs   at several large commercial banks and declining bank stock prices do not bode   well for future credit availability.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Prices and Costs
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Elevated commodity prices continued to   put pressure on costs in July and August. While prices for industrial metals   like copper and steel eased some, they are still elevated. In addition, several   manufacturers reported extended material lead times, particularly for specialty   metals. Energy prices also moved lower, but contacts indicated that these lower   prices have not yet been reflected in reduced fuel surcharges. In contrast, food   prices continued to rise. Manufacturers and retailers both indicated a high rate   of pass-through to downstream prices. Wage pressures remained moderate, but a   few contacts noted that wages were starting to increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Agriculture
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Corn and soybean crop conditions declined   markedly in the primary production areas of the District due to hot temperatures   and a lack of precipitation during July and August. Reports that lower quality   corn was being used to produce biofuel despite its higher production costs were   indicative of just how low stocks have fallen. Cash prices for corn, soybeans,   and wheat rose during the reporting period. Ethanol plants were pushing up the   bidding for corn to be used in fall production. Hot weather stressed animals,   lowering the output of meat and dairy products. Hog prices set nominal records,   while milk and cattle prices moved up as well. Sale prices for farmland   continued to move higher.
