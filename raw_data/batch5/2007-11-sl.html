      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Eighth District  expanded more slowly in the period since our previous report.  Retail and auto sales in October and early  November were down, on average, compared with year-ago levels.  While the services sector continued to  expand, manufacturing activity softened.   Home sales and residential construction continued to weaken throughout  the District, but commercial real estate market conditions remained  positive.  Overall lending activity at a  sample of District banks was mostly unchanged in the three-month period ending  in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer  Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that retail sales  in October and early November were down, on average, over year-earlier levels.  Half of the retailers saw decreases in sales,  while 38 percent saw increases.   Approximately 23 percent of the retailers noted that sales levels met  their expectations, 65 percent reported that sales were below what they had  anticipated, and 12 percent reported sales that were above expectations.  Men's apparel and office products were strong  sellers, while women's apparel and furniture were moving more slowly.  Two-thirds of the contacts noted that  inventories were at desired levels, while 25 percent reported higher-than-desired  inventories and 8 percent reported lower-than-desired inventories.  About 54 percent of contacts expect that  sales for the rest of 2007 will increase over 2006 levels and another 17  percent expect sales to be similar to last year, but 29 percent expect  decreased sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported  that, compared with last year, sales in October and early November were down,  on average.  About 52 percent of the car  dealers surveyed reported a decrease in sales, while 32 percent reported an  increase.  About 24 percent of the car  dealers noted that used car sales had increased relative to new car sales and  28 percent reported an increase in low-end vehicle sales relative to high-end  vehicle sales.  About 28 percent of the  respondents reported recent increases in rebates and incentives.  About 20 percent of the car dealers surveyed  reported that their inventories were too high (mostly on trucks and sport  utility vehicles), while 16 percent reported that their inventories were too  low.  About 60 percent of the car dealers  expect increased sales over 2006 for the remainder of the year, and another 12  percent expect unchanged sales, but 28 percent expect decreased sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing  and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity softened since  our previous survey.  While some contacts  reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near future, a  larger number of contacts reported plans to close plants or lay off  workers.  Firms in the plastics and the  furniture manufacturing industries reported plans to hire workers, and firms in  the sanitary paper product and the chemical manufacturing industries reported  plans to open new facilities and hire workers.   In contrast, a number of firms in the fabricated metal product industry  reported plans to close plants and lay off workers.  Firms in the motor vehicle parts and the transportation  equipment manufacturing industries also reported similar plans to downsize.  Firms in the wood product and the food  manufacturing industries reported plans to lay off workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's service sector  continued to expand steadily in most areas since our previous report. Contacts  in the business support services and health care industries reported plans to  expand operations and hire additional workers in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real  Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales continued to slow  throughout the Eighth District.  Compared  with the same period in 2006, September 2007 year-to-date home sales declined  14 percent in Memphis, 8 percent in St. Louis, and 2 percent in Little Rock; they were virtually unchanged in Louisville.   Residential construction continued to decline throughout most of the  District.  September 2007 year-to-date  single-family housing permits fell in most District metro areas compared with  the same period in 2006.  Permits  declined 27 percent in Memphis, 18 percent in Little Rock and St. Louis, and 6 percent in Louisville.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate market  conditions were generally positive throughout the District.  The third quarter 2007 industrial vacancy  rate decreased from the second quarter rate in St. Louis, Louisville, and Little Rock, while Memphis's industrial vacancy rate increased  slightly.  During the same period, office  vacancy rates decreased in St. Louis, Louisville, Little Rock, and Memphis.   Contacts in Little Rock reported that the number of new  commercial building permits for year-to-date September 2007 are more than  double the number for the same period last year.  Contacts in Memphis and Louisville reported a strong outlook for  commercial construction projects, while a contact in Madison County, Tennessee,  reported that new commercial construction permits were at their lowest level in  three years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking  and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a  sample of District banks showed little change in overall lending activity in  the three months ending in October.   Credit standards and demand for commercial and industrial loans remained  unchanged for both large and small firms.   Credit standards for commercial real estate loans tightened somewhat,  while demand for these loans was moderately weaker.  Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer  loans ranged from somewhat tightened to unchanged, while the change in demand  for these loans ranged from about the same to moderately weaker.  Credit standards for prime residential  mortgage loans remained basically unchanged, while credit standards for  nontraditional mortgage loans tightened.   The change in demand for both prime and nontraditional mortgage loans  ranged from about the same to moderately weaker.
     </p>
     <strong>
      Agriculture  and Natural Resources
     </strong>
     <br/>
     At least 95 percent of the corn, 89  percent of the soybean, 94 percent of the sorghum, 98 percent of the cotton,  and all of the rice in the District states have been harvested.  Yield estimates for most crops in most  District states stayed roughly the same between October and November, but yield  estimates for soybeans and cotton in Tennessee decreased by more than 10  percent.  Winter wheat planting was ahead  of its normal pace, and each District state has planted at least three-fourths  of its intended crop.  Over 60 percent of  the emerged winter wheat in each District state was in good or excellent  condition.
