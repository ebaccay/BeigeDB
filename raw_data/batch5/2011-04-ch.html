      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 13, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to increase in February   and March. However, contacts' optimism was tempered by elevated uncertainty   surrounding recent global events. Consumer and business spending increased.   Manufacturing production expanded, though construction was again subdued. Credit   conditions continued to improve. There was some further pass-through of higher   commodity prices to downstream prices. Expectations were for more corn and fewer   soybean acres to be planted in the District this spring relative to last   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased from the   previous reporting period. Consumers continued to be drawn toward promotional   items, now in part because they are dealing with the impact of higher food and   energy prices on household budgets. The expiration of manufacturers' incentives   contributed to a slight decline in auto sales in March. Auto dealers reported   inventories were relatively low given the recent strength of sales. Contacts   noted that potential production disruptions stemming from the events in Japan   and the effects of rising gas prices on demand add a good deal of uncertainty to   the outlook for the auto sector. Some dealers have already seen a shift in sales   from new trucks to more fuel efficient vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending continued to increase   in February and March. Inventories were little changed, overall, although a few   contacts indicated increasing their inventories of raw materials in anticipation   of further price increases in the coming months. Capital expenditures continued   as planned with several manufacturers noting equipment purchases and other   efficiency improving investments. Merger and acquisitions activity picked up   some. Hiring increased with contacts adding both temporary and permanent   employees. Job postings also increased, and manufacturers reiterated the   difficulty in finding appropriately skilled workers. A large staffing firm   reported solid growth in billable hours and a substantial increase in permanent   placement and recruiting activity. Furthermore, a recruiting firm noted that   small business' hiring plans are beginning to show signs of improving.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity was   again subdued in February and March. Single-family homebuilders indicated that   the spring building season was likely to be slower than previously anticipated.   They also reported a drop in the contract conversion rate. Buyers appear to be   waiting for home prices to stabilize from their recent declines and the   availability of financing remains a concern. In the multifamily sector, several   contacts reported developing strength in the rental market and a corresponding   pick-up in conversions of condominiums into apartments. Nonresidential   construction slightly improved. Contacts reported greater activity in both the   institutional and industrial sectors, including from the healthcare and   automotive industries. Commercial real estate conditions were marginally better   with commercial rents flattening out and small improvements in vacancy   rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing production continued to   expand in February and March. Activity in the steel, auto, and heavy equipment   sectors remained strong. Several contacts reported significant current order   backlogs and firming second-quarter order books. Capacity utilization in these   industries has increased, but ample idle capacity remains available. For   example, a contact in the steel industry noted that active furnaces are   operating at high rates of utilization while idled furnaces are expected to be   brought back on-line only slowly this year given the high costs of reactivation   and uncertainty in the outlook. Lead times continued to lengthen as supply   chains were stretched further for some parts. In addition, concerns, and a great   deal of uncertainty, were expressed about the potential impact of the Japanese   disaster. Contacts expected that supply chain disruptions would take place,   although it was too early to tell their full extent. Auto suppliers reported   that shortages are most likely to occur first in parts such as electronics, as   well as for parts that were already in short supply like tires. Some domestic   suppliers have already seen increases in demand for their products as a result.   Automakers reported that dealers' vehicle inventories were lean enough to make   them consider adding shifts at existing plants; but if parts shortages arise,   production schedules may be pared back now and made up as necessary later in the   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions continued to   improve in February and March. Banking contacts indicated that the business loan   pipeline was still not robust, but that there were some areas of growth in   manufacturing, food processing, and healthcare. Competition continued to be   fierce for high-quality commercial and industrial loans (both large and small)   leading to more aggressive terms and pricing. In addition, bank and non-bank   investment in commercial real estate assets was also noted to be increasing.   Consumer lending was little changed from the previous reporting period. Mortgage   applications decreased and those made were primarily for purchase, as   refinancing slowed with a rise in mortgage rates. Several contacts raised   concerns about the impact that uncertainty surrounding the future of Fannie Mae   and Freddie Mac and the regulatory environment were having on mortgage credit   availability.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cost pressures rose in February and   March. Wage pressures remained moderate, but raw materials prices increased. The   most notable increases were for steel and other industrial metals, but the   prices of plastics, paints, resins and cotton also rose. Fuel and transportation   surcharges were also noted to be rising. Pass-through to downstream prices was   moderate, however. Retailers indicated that they were trying to limit raising   prices, though pass-through was noted to be increasing, particularly for food   and energy-related items. In contrast, several manufacturing contacts reported   an increase in pricing power, with less pushback from customers in accepting   higher prices. Commercial builders have been able to pass along minimal price   increases to offset some of their higher raw material costs, although   residential builders have not been able to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts predicted normal timing for the   start of planting this year, and that fields were in good enough shape so that   planting should proceed quickly. Ground moisture across the District is   sufficient for a good start to the crop year, although some areas do not have   adequate subsoil moisture to weather dry spells. More corn and fewer soybean   acres were expected to be planted this year. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices   were volatile, but on net edged lower during the reporting period. With stocks   lower than a year ago, contacts saw the potential for upward pressure on corn   and soybean prices in coming months. Moreover, feed mills have been actively   seeking alternatives to blend into livestock rations. Milk prices continued to   rise. Hog and cattle prices moved higher, with premiums being offered to attract   the delivery of more animals for slaughter.
