      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Fourth District grew at a moderate pace since early 
  October; however, the housing market, restructuring in the auto sector, and 
  some raw material prices have tempered enthusiasm. Production at District manufacturers 
  was steady to increasing with the expectation that production will remain at 
  current levels for the next six months. Several commercial builders report activity 
  has slowed, but business remains relatively strong overall. New residential 
  construction was mixed with a few builders experiencing a pick-up in activity. 
  Sales by District retailers were more in line with expectations after a somewhat 
  disappointing September. Loan demand at District banks was flat while core deposits 
  were up slightly. And the demand for trucking and shipping services continues 
  to soften.
     </p>
     <p>
      On net, hiring across the District was stable. Staffing firms reported increased 
  job openings since early October with some contacts saying that openings were 
  up across the board. Wage pressures are not seen as an issue at this time. Almost 
  all contacts said that, with the exception of metals, the rise in input costs 
  continues to moderate. Manufacturers attempting to raise their prices met with 
  a mixed degree of success. And almost all retailers reported that they were 
  holding their prices steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since early October, production by the District's durable goods manufacturers 
  was stable or up slightly with higher production levels reported on a year-over-year 
  basis. Demand for steel products continues to soften due to weakness in the 
  auto, appliance, electrical distribution, and residential construction markets. 
  Although District auto production increased in October, a decline was seen on 
  a year-over-year basis. The outlook by most durable manufacturers is for production 
  to remain at current levels over the next six months. Two contacts expecting 
  lower production attribute it to seasonal adjustments. Almost all manufacturers 
  said they were operating at normal capacity and that capital expenditures remain 
  on target. Although a majority of the producers expect little change in spending, 
  five respondents said they were going to increase capital expenditures in 2007. 
  Input costs were mixed with higher costs being attributed almost exclusively 
  to metals. Hiring has been limited over the past six weeks; however, four contacts 
  said they are planning some hiring in the near future. Wage pressures are largely 
  contained. Several contacts reported that benefits, especially health care, 
  continue to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production levels at the District's nondurable goods facilities were steady 
  to increasing since early October and on a year-over-year basis. Expectations 
  for the next six months are mixed with one manufacturer saying that the auto 
  industry could affect their output. About half of our contacts reported idle 
  capacity. Most manufacturers said capital expenditures met or exceeded projections; 
  further, about half expect to increase spending during the next few months. 
  Input costs were relatively stable. Most manufacturers said they have no plans 
  to hire in the near future and three reported reducing their workforce during 
  the past six weeks. Wage pressures remain contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales by District retailers since early October were more in line with expectations 
  after a somewhat disappointing September. However, customers are highly selective 
  in their purchases. Drug stores report particularly strong sales driven primarily 
  by pharmaceuticals. Overall, vendor prices have remained stable during the past 
  six weeks with decreases seen in lumber and generic drugs. Retailers have passed 
  on this price stability to customers. Most contacts report wage pressures are 
  contained, but the cost of health care benefits continues to rise, albeit at 
  a more moderate rate. Aside from normal seasonal hiring, retailers are limiting 
  employment opportunities to new store openings. One contact reported reducing 
  their workforce through attrition. Retailers are expecting a very competitive 
  Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts said that new car sales declined in October for a second straight 
  month; further, purchases continue to be heavily dependent on dealer incentives. 
  Reports on SUV sales are mixed with high-end SUVs holding their own.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential contractors in the District are continuing to adapt to the housing 
  market correction through workforce cutbacks, delaying land purchases, and building 
  fewer spec homes. Since early October, new home sales have been mixed with about 
  half our contacts reporting a pick-up in sales while the other half report slow 
  to declining sales. Almost all builders expect that the correction will continue 
  until at least mid-2007. Backlogs for most contractors have decreased about 
  30 percent. Discounts or incentives being offered to prospective buyers are 
  in the range of 5-8 percent of a home's asking price. Material costs are mixed 
  with builders seeing declines in lumber, drywall, and cement; however, petroleum-related 
  products remain high. Contacts report that land and development costs continue 
  to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's commercial contractors reported that activity has slowed since 
  early October, but remains relatively strong overall. Most contacts have experienced 
  an increased level of business on a year-over-year basis. Contractors are anticipating 
  a strong first half in 2007 due to current backlogs and stable inquires. Segments 
  continuing to show strong activity are health care and public works; manufacturing-related 
  construction is beginning to pick-up. Material cost increases continue to slow 
  or have stabilized which is contributing to a small increase in profit margins. 
  Contractors reported little change in the size of their workforce, although 
  a few have hired or are looking to hire.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since early October, commercial and consumer loan demand was flat to declining 
  for most District banks. Nearly all contacts reported a slight gain in core 
  deposits. Activity in the mortgage market continues to be slow; customers looking 
  to refinance are showing a preference for fixed-rate mortgages. Several bankers 
  are concerned about small increases in delinquencies; however, credit quality 
  remains relatively strong. The consensus outlook by District bankers is for 
  a continuation of tight margins and a modest deterioration in credit quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for trucking and shipping services continues to soften with a slight 
  volume decrease on a year-over-year basis. Most contacts reported a slowdown 
  in the shipment of auto-related products. Trucking companies continue to pass 
  on fuel costs using surcharges; however, it's becoming more difficult due to 
  competition and customer resistance. Trucking companies were hiring, but activity 
  was limited to finding replacements due to driver turnover. One contact reported 
  laying-off workers. Wages have remained stable during the past six weeks.
