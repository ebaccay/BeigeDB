      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 6, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy improved moderately in late April and May. Retailers   and restaurant contacts reported stronger sales, while auto sales declined. Both   retailers and auto contacts expected increased activity in the months ahead.   Manufacturing activity rose, and the high-tech services industry experienced   modest growth. Transportation activity was flat and was expected to remain   unchanged in the months ahead. Residential and commercial real estate activity   increased solidly with higher sales and lower vacancy rates. Banking contacts   reported slightly higher loan demand, improved loan quality and increased   deposits. Agricultural growing conditions improved, and farmland values   continued to climb. The energy sector expanded further, but the oversupply of   natural gas was leading to a slower pace of expansion. Most sectors reported   higher input prices and final goods prices, and expected further increases in   the coming months. Wage pressures increased, and firms reported some difficulty   in filling positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased in the   retail, restaurant and tourism sectors but declined in the auto sector. District   contacts from every consumer sector expected stronger sales over the next three   months. Retailers reported sharply higher sales compared to a month ago. Most   product lines experienced gains including home goods such as dining tables,   bedroom sets and appliances. Auto sales fell sharply with large SUVs and trucks   continuing to be weak sellers. However, most auto contacts remained satisfied   with current inventory levels. Restaurant contacts reported increased traffic   and higher check amounts. Tourism activity increased in the District due in part   to good spring weather. Hotel occupancy held steady as average room rates edged   up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   activity in the Tenth District improved in May, and expectations for future   activity were stronger than in previous months. Both durable and non-durable   goods manufacturers reported increased production. New orders and factory   shipments increased during the survey period. Manufacturing contacts reported   that capital spending plans were much improved, and several noted plans to   expand into new products and markets. Growth in transportation activity was   flat, and contacts reported higher input prices. Capital spending plans at   transportation firms continued to be sluggish, and firms expected future   activity to be unchanged. High-tech services firms reported moderate growth in   sales, and expectations for future activity were strong. Several high-tech firms   reported difficulty in finding experienced workers, especially qualified   software developers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity improved during the most recent survey period, and commercial activity   was solid. Housing starts were down compared to the previous survey, but   builders expected new home construction to increase over the next three months.   Housing materials were readily available, but several respondents had trouble   finding skilled workers. Sales activity at construction supply firms surged   during the survey period across all types of materials, and expectations for   sales continued to be strong. Residential sales were much improved from the   previous survey, and inventories continued to fall. Contacts reported that homes   priced between $150,000 and $300,000 sold particularly well, but homes at the   upper end of the market continued to be difficult to sell. Overall mortgage   lending activity grew this survey period, but refinancing activity was flat. The   majority of refinancing activity was due to lower payments in response to low   interest rates. Commercial real estate activity was solid during the survey   period, but there was some uncertainty about future activity. Vacancy rates   fell, and contacts expected them to continue to fall over the next three months.   Prices and rents were flat, but expectations were for some increases in the   future. Several respondents believed that political uncertainty could create   some weakness in the construction and commercial real estate markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the recent survey period, bankers generally   reported slightly stronger loan demand, improving loan quality, and increased   deposits. Overall loan demand was improving as most respondents reported stable   to increased loan demand for residential real estate loans, commercial and   industrial loans, and commercial real estate loans. Demand for consumer   installment loans remained steady. Credit standards remained largely unchanged   in all major loan categories, and the majority of respondents reported steady or   increased deposits. Most bankers reported improving loan quality compared to a   year ago. Additionally, every banker believed the outlook for loan quality over   the next six months would be steady or improving.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions improved since the   last survey. District contacts reported that winter wheat development was   roughly three weeks ahead of normal. Most of the winter wheat was rated in   fair-to-good condition. Spring planting was nearly complete, and early emerged   crops were rated in good condition. Tight crop supplies kept cash prices high,   while the prospects of a bumper 2012 crop weighed on futures prices. High feeder   calf prices continued to support strong profits for ranchers. In contrast,   profits at cattle feedlots were strained by high feed and feeder calf costs.   Strong export demand underpinned profits for pork producers. Farmland values   rose further, buoyed by farm incomes and revenues from mineral rights leases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity continued to expand in May.   Drilling activity increased since the previous survey. However, contacts   reported that storage reservoirs were full and that an oversupply of natural gas   was beginning to result in a slowdown in the pace of drilling. Oil prices fell   during the survey period, and contacts believed that a slumping world economy   would keep prices steady over the next three months. Natural gas prices rose   somewhat but remained near historically low levels, and contacts expected prices   to stay low due to oversupply. Firms reported that they would like to expand   their workforces in the coming months, but noted that it had been difficult to   find experienced field workers and engineers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported higher prices   for both inputs and finished goods, and wage pressures increased from low   levels.
      <strong>
      </strong>
      Manufacturers continued to report higher raw material   prices, but prices increased at a slower pace than earlier this year. Finished   goods prices rose slightly in April and were flat in May. Manufacturers expected   higher prices for both raw materials and finished goods over the next six months   although the number of contacts expecting an increase fell slightly. Builders   reported higher input prices, and retailers reported higher sales prices. Both   builders and retailers expected further increases over the next three months.   Higher food costs and menu prices were noted by restaurant contacts who also   anticipated raising menu prices further as food prices continue to rise. Wage   pressures increased since the previous survey but remained fairly low. The   number of contacts reporting labor shortages remained stable, but contacts   reported difficulty in filling a variety of positions including housekeeping,   sales, drivers, mechanics, engineers, and skilled workmen.
