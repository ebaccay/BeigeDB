      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <strong>
      December 1, 2010
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District has been varied across sectors since   the last Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported increases in shipments   and new orders in November. Retailers have been making year-over-year gains in   sales. Motor vehicle dealers have also posted year-to-year sales increases.   Third District banks reported practically unchanged loan volume outstanding   since the last Beige Book. Residential real estate agents and homebuilders   indicated that the recent sales trend has been downward. Contacts in the   commercial real estate sector said market conditions remain soft. Service-sector   firms reported that activity has been roughly steady in the past month. Business   contacts indicated that prices of most goods and services have shown no change,   although retailers noted recent increases in prices for goods ordered from   foreign suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Third District business contacts foresee slow improvement ahead.   Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next six   months. Retailers expect sales for this year's holiday shopping period to exceed   sales for the same period last year. Bankers expect just slow growth in lending   in the next few months. Contacts in residential real estate expect activity to   move up slowly, at best, but contacts in commercial real estate do not   anticipate a meaningful change from current soft conditions in the near future.   Service-sector companies expect slow growth from now into next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported   increases in shipments and new orders from October to November, on balance.   However, the improvement was uneven among the region's major manufacturing   industries. Increases in demand for their products was more common among makers   of furniture, industrial materials, and testing and measuring instruments, but   makers of construction-related goods continued to see flat or declining demand   for their products. Manufacturers in general continued to report that the flow   of new orders has been variable. One said, "You don't know from one week to the   next what the workload will be." Another said, "Conditions continue to be   choppy."
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms surveyed in November, about half   expect increases in new orders and shipments, and about one-fifth expect   decreases. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers have increased   somewhat in recent months, although many noted that implementation of new plant   or equipment is primarily to replace obsolete equipment, increase efficiency, or   meet pollution control requirements. Several firms said they will not expand   production facilities until they get orders they are unable to fill with their   current capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally reported   small-to-moderate year-over-year increases in sales in October and early   November. Gains appeared to be relatively greater for apparel than other product   lines, according to area merchants. Store executives said discounting has been   widespread to stimulate sales of fall and holiday merchandise, and the recent   sales pace has mostly met expectations. "Consumers are definitely responding to   low prices," one contact said. Looking ahead, most of the retailers surveyed for   this report said they expect sales to continue to move up through the   end-of-year shopping period, but some noted that, due to discounting, they will   have to sell more merchandise than last year to meet dollar-sales targets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers reported rising sales and improved profitability   since the last Beige Book. Inventories were generally described as appropriate   for the current sales rate. Dealers expect sales to rise until the end of the   year, but some expressed concern that the sales pace might slip during the first   quarter of 2011, after the better than expected results of 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total outstanding loan volume at most of the   Third District banks contacted for this report has been flat since the last   Beige Book, with practically no change in any credit category. Bankers continued   to report low demand for both consumer and business loans. Commercial bank   officers generally indicated that credit quality measures have been roughly   steady. However, one noted that "there is continued stress in the commercial   real estate and construction portfolio."
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the Third District bankers surveyed for this report, the outlook   is that there will be only slow growth in lending to both consumers and   businesses in the months ahead. Although bankers in most parts of the District   believe economic conditions are improving gradually, they do not expect a   parallel rise in loan demand. And one banker expressed concern that economic   recovery will come too slowly to reverse deteriorating financial conditions   among some local firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In most parts of the Third   District, residential real estate activity has slowed since the last Beige Book.   Residential real estate agents generally indicated that sales of existing homes   have been declining and that inventories have edged up. Most of the residential   builders contacted for this report also said sales have been on a downward   trend. Sales of higher-priced homes have been slower than sales of lower-priced   homes in most areas. Home prices have been flat to down in most markets,   although contacts noted that the rate of price decline has eased recently.   Residential real estate contacts expect sales to remain slow until economic   conditions improve. The widely shared view among agents is that "the real estate   market will not come back until there are more jobs," as one contact said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that there has been little change   in conditions in commercial and industrial markets since the last Beige Book.   Contacts said that vacancy rates and rents have been nearly steady, although   there have been increased reports of landlord concessions. Several contacts   reported that tenants have been taking advantage of lower effective rents,   resulting in increased leasing activity and relocations, but no increase in   leased space. Some contacts noted recent signs of growing investor interest in   apartment buildings and some Class A office buildings, but retail buildings   continued to be out of favor. The pace of commercial construction remains slow,   although there have been some recent increases in renovation and remodeling   activity. Commercial real estate contacts expect current market conditions to   persist. "Next year will be a lot like this year," one contact said. Building   owners and agents agree that a significant increase in demand for commercial and   industrial space will not take hold until employment begins to grow more   strongly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service-sector firms gave mixed reports, but on   balance activity has been roughly steady since the previous Beige Book. Contacts   said the health care and information technology sectors were showing some   growth, but service-sector activity related to real estate, construction, and   finance was flat to down. Also, some firms that provide services to governments   indicated that their clients were making less use of their services as part of   overall budget tightening. Looking ahead, most of the service firms contacted   for this report expect only slow growth. One said, "We don't expect much   improvement next year." Another said, "We will have to look to new markets for   growth."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from manufacturers since the   last Beige Book indicated some increases in raw material costs, but mostly   steady output prices. Goods mentioned as rising in price were food products,   metals, and electrical equipment. Retailers generally noted that most wholesale   costs and retail prices have been steady, but some contacts reported that   foreign suppliers, especially in Asia, have raised the prices of many products   being ordered now for delivery next year.
     </p>
     Business firms in the region   reported no major changes in wages since the last Beige Book. Employers   generally reported that they were not having difficulty filling positions at   current compensation levels. However, some said they were becoming somewhat   concerned that sufficient numbers of qualified workers will be more difficult to   obtain when they do decide to increase staffing levels.
