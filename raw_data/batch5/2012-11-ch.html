      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a slow pace in   October and early November. Contacts noted heightened uncertainty over the   near-term economic outlook as the deadline for the fiscal cliff approaches, but   remained cautiously optimistic that growth would pick up to a moderate pace in   2013. By sector, gains in consumer spending were up slightly from the previous   reporting period, while growth in business spending moderated further.   Manufacturing production decelerated, while construction increased at a slow but   steady pace. Credit conditions continued to improve gradually. Cost pressures   were little changed, although food prices eased. Corn and soybean production in   the District did not suffer as much from the drought as previously had been   expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
        <br/>
       </strong>
       The pace of consumer spending, while   still moderate, increased slightly from the previous reporting period. Furniture   sales improved slightly, while sales of electronics were flat from the previous   reporting period. In contrast, retail auto sales fell, in part because   incentives have become more directed towards leasing. Overall, retail sales   surpassed expectations, which contacts attributed to promotions and generally   improving consumer confidence. Nonetheless, some retailers noted a slower sales   pace in early November, and many lowered their expectations for the first half   of 2013. In particular, contacts expressed concern over the impact of potential   changes in federal tax policy on consumers' willingness to spend.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Spending
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Growth in business spending moderated   further in October and early November. Inventory investment continued to slow.   Retail contacts reported no transportation delays stemming from Hurricane Sandy;   and inventories, although slightly elevated, were indicated to be within typical   seasonal ranges. Steel service center inventories were also slightly elevated,   and manufacturers reported that material lead times decreased significantly.   Capital spending on equipment and structures also slowed. A number of contacts   reported that given the heightened uncertainty surrounding the near-term   economic outlook, they were reluctant to make capital expenditures beyond   productivity enhancements. Labor market conditions improved slightly from the   previous reporting period. Job growth in manufacturing slowed, but there was an   increase in professional services employment. However, a number of firms noted   that they have put hiring plans on hold and have delayed temp-to-perm conversion   decisions until next year. Those that did report ongoing plans to hire continued   to note difficulty in finding skilled workers, and many have created internal   training programs as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Construction activity   continued to increase at a slow, but steady pace in October and early November.   Multi-family construction remained a source of strength with the continued rise   in residential rents and declines in apartment vacancies. Single-family   construction also increased. For the first time in several years, homebuilders   reported new land development projects were underway, although these remained   limited to a handful of desirable locations. Demand for nonresidential   construction continued to increase at a slow pace, with contacts noting that   many of their customers are waiting for the resolution of the fiscal cliff and   stabilization in Europe before moving ahead on capital spending projects.   Vacancy rates remained elevated for many property types, and contacts indicated   that few leasing and acquisition deals are being made in the retail and office   spaces. That said, contacts also noted some signs of improvement in commercial   real estate conditions, pointing to moderate declines in vacancies and space   available for sublease.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Manufacturing production decelerated in   October and early November. Contacts expected activity to remain subdued in the   coming year, and voiced concerns about the potential impact of the fiscal cliff   and weaker global demand for their products. Exports to Europe and Asia as well   as many parts of South America softened, but remained stronger to North America,   particularly to Mexico. Capacity utilization in the steel industry decreased,   but an industry contact reported that orders were anticipated to pick up some   over the next two quarters. Specialty metal manufacturers also reported weaker   orders. There was continued strength in demand from the power generation   industry, and the heavy equipment and auto industries also remained sources of   strength. However, contacts expect demand for heavy machinery to flatten in 2013   as dealer rental fleet growth returns to more a normal pace. In contrast,   improving housing demand continued to benefit manufacturers of construction   materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Credit conditions continued to   gradually ease in October and early November. Credit spreads and financial   market volatility remained low, and asset quality steadily improved. Banking   contacts reported modest growth in small business loan demand, but also slower   growth in debt restructuring and leveraged finance deals as well as lower   utilization of credit lines. Contacts attributed the decrease in credit demand   from middle market customers to heightened uncertainty about future tax rates on   capital spending. Loan pricing and standards remained broadly unchanged, with   the exception of commercial and industrial and auto lending, where credit terms   and availability continued to ease. Contacts noted that community and regional   banks have been particularly aggressive in pricing and covenants to compete with   larger banks for a limited supply of new loan opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Costs
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Cost pressures were little changed in   October and early November. Several contacts noted that even though steel and   scrap prices were lower than they were a few months ago, both had increased in   recent weeks. A contact in the steel industry noted that the recent rise in   scrap prices may reflect the impact of Hurricane Sandy as well as slightly   higher global demand. Construction contacts also reported an increase in prices   of raw materials such as lumber. Retail food prices eased, on balance, as higher   prices for meat were offset by lower prices for produce, dairy, and some other   grocery items. More generally, retailers indicated that discounting and   promotions for non-food items also eased some over the reporting period, but   were expected to pick up again after Thanksgiving. Wage pressures remained   moderate, but nonwage costs increased as many contacts again cited higher   healthcare costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
        <br/>
       </strong>
       The corn harvest was completed ahead of last   year's pace, while the soybean harvest was proceeding more quickly than typical.   Much of the District reported higher yields than had been expected during the   previous reporting period, reflecting in part timely local rains, later   planting, and irrigation. Nonetheless, the drought still cut the District's   output of corn and soybeans substantially relative to last year. Concerns about   crop quality due to the drought seemed to diminish, although there were some   reports of deliveries rejected for crop diseases. Corn and soybean prices--and   with them livestock feeding costs--fell further, though they remained elevated   from the levels of a year ago. Milk, hog, and cattle prices edged up from the   prior reporting period, which also helped the cash flow of livestock operations.   Sugar beet output in Michigan was higher than a year ago, and sugar prices were   higher as well. Farmland values continued to rise despite the drought. Moreover,   there seemed to be more farmland available to buy, partly due to uncertainty   about future tax rates.
