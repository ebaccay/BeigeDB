      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       January 19, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Seventh District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace around 

  the turn of the year. Consumer spending remained relatively soft, but business 

  spending continued to pick up. Construction and real estate activity experienced 

  a typical seasonal lull. Manufacturing output was steady at robust levels, and 

  new orders were still strong. Bankers said that demand was down somewhat for 

  household loans, but up slightly for business loans. High input costs persisted, 

  but retail price pressures were largely subdued. The farm sector continued to 

  profit from sales of bumper crops and relatively stable livestock prices.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       On balance, consumer spending was again fairly soft in December and early January. 

  Most retailers said that holiday sales were at the low to mid range of their 

  expectations, as a strong finish to the shopping season largely offset a relatively 

  weak start. Sales of electronics, jewelry, and entertainment goods (movies, 

  books, music, etc.) were strong, while sales of appliances were weaker. Apparel 

  sales picked up as the weather cooled in the region. Merchants also suggested 

  that solid increases in gift card purchases will likely boost January's sales 

  results. District auto dealers reported better-than-average light vehicle sales 

  in December, although results varied greatly by make and model. Light vehicle 

  inventories remained somewhat bloated. Some dealers noted a slight pickup in 

  service and body shop sales from weak levels. Tourism and travel was mixed, 

  as contacts in Wisconsin and Illinois reported increases from the previous year, 

  but those in Michigan noted declines.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Business spending continued to increase modestly. Most firms surveyed indicated 

  that they planned to increase capital outlays in 2005 from 2004 levels. Of those 

  that planned to increase spending, most had already begun to place orders for 

  those outlays. The remaining firms said they would begin placing orders in the 

  first half of the year. Airlines suggested that business travel held up in December, 

  especially on international routes. With regard to hiring, temporary help firms 

  reported a normal seasonal slowdown in December's orders. Still, year-over-year 

  growth remained solid. Demand for professional and technical workers was said 

  to be stronger than other categories, while it was weaker for office and clerical 

  workers. Fees for temp-to-perm conversions and permanent placements continued 

  to rise. Outside of the temporary help industry, fewer contacts reported new 

  permanent hiring, but fewer also indicated that they were laying off workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction/real estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports on construction and real estate activity were mixed. Realtors and builders 

  in many areas noted a typical seasonal slowdown in December, while some reported 

  a slight pickup in activity during the first week of January. Nonresidential 

  activity also experienced a seasonal lull during December. Despite a slowdown 

  in leasing activity last month, some office markets saw significant net absorption 

  for the fourth quarter as a whole. However, contacts in the Chicago area said 

  that the office market remained soft, with little net absorption. In general, 

  office rents remained under downward pressure, though one contact reported that 

  landlords in a "smattering of markets" were able to increase rents modestly 

  in the fourth quarter after several years of decreases. Leasing and construction 

  of light industrial space picked up somewhat and retail activity remained strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing output was relatively steady in December, at high levels. Steel 

  production was solid, although producers reported a slight slowdown in December. 

  However, worldwide demand for steel products remained strong and contacts expected 

  production to increase in coming months. Machine tool makers indicated that 

  new orders and shipments were strong, with one firm adding that business was 

  "the best it has been in years." Production of heavy equipment remained strong 

  in December. One producer of heavy capital equipment indicated that production 

  and shipments in December were buoyed by expiring tax incentives; looking ahead, 

  this company's order backlogs had eased and its inventories were slightly higher. 

  One contact in the heavy truck industry noted that "the window to replace the 

  fleet before the 2007 change in environmental regulations is closing," with 

  order books already filled for the first half of 2005. Trailer orders were reportedly 

  strong as well. Nationwide light vehicle sales exceeded expectations in December, 

  which helped bring inventories down to more desirable levels. However, inventories 

  were still high and some automakers cut their production plans for the first 

  quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking/finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall lending activity was slightly softer in December than during the previous 

  reporting period. On the consumer side, one large bank reported slower growth 

  in revolving credit, and many other banks said that mortgage lending had decreased. 

  Margins continued to be squeezed, especially for mortgages. Standards and terms 

  on the household side were largely unchanged, and quality was stable in most 

  areas at good levels. On the business side, lending was still sluggish, although 

  some bankers reported very slight increases in loan volumes. A contact with 

  one large bank, however, noted a pickup in loan applications in the pipeline, 

  which may boost volumes in coming months. Margins were still thin on business 

  loans, standards and terms were largely unchanged, and loan quality continued 

  to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices/costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall cost and price pressures remained in check at the end of 2004. Broad-based 

  wage gains remained very modest, though increases were greater for workers in 

  professional and technical occupations. Manufacturers reported that materials 

  cost pressures eased somewhat toward the end of the year, but were still intense. 

  Moreover, input costs were not expected to decline much further in the first 

  quarter, and some were even expected to rise again. Some retailers plan to increase 

  prices on selected merchandise (notably appliances and toys) to offset cost 

  increases. However, many contacts said that the retail environment remains too 

  competitive to increase prices substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural contacts reported that farmers were upbeat. Net farm income jumped 

  last year as a result of profitable livestock operations and record corn and 

  soybean harvests, much of which was forward-contracted at unusually high prices. 

  Farm income was also supported by federal loan deficiency payments, which are 

  tied to spot market prices. The biggest problem reported was the slow movement 

  of crops stored in the open air, which can be damaged by precipitation. Yet 

  few storage facilities were under construction, which one contact thought was 

  due to the large increases in steel costs. Farmland prices again moved higher 

  amidst continued strong demand from non-farm investors and recreational buyers.
