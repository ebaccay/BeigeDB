      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 13, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District continued to expand at a   modest pace. Manufacturers reported some improvement in new orders and   production. Information received from retailers and auto dealers was generally   positive. Freight transport volume increased, while energy producers noted   little change in output. New home construction remains sluggish, whereas   nonresidential building showed some pickup in activity. The demand for business   and consumer credit rose slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rising payrolls were limited to the manufacturing and retail sectors.   Staffing-firm representatives noted moderate growth in the number of new job   openings, with vacancies concentrated in health care, professional business   services, and energy. Wage pressures remain contained. Reports of elevated   prices for commodities, steel, fuel, and other raw materials were widespread. As   a result, manufacturers, retailers, and freight carriers felt mounting pressure   to pass through some of their rising input costs to their customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District factories indicate   that new orders and production were mainly steady or up slightly during the past   six weeks. Declines were attributed to seasonal factors. Compared to a year ago,   production was generally higher, with some of our contacts experiencing low   double-digit increases. Manufacturers have a favorable outlook, and they expect   at least modest growth during 2011. Steel producers and service centers reported   that shipping volume met or exceeded expectations, with shipments being driven   by energy-related, transportation, and heavy equipment industries. They   anticipate volume remaining at current levels through at least the first half of   this year. District auto production dipped slightly during February on a   month-over-month basis. Compared to a year ago, domestic auto makers showed a   substantial rise in production, while foreign nameplates posted a modest   decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of our contacts indicated that capacity utilization rates continue   to trend higher but are somewhat below normal levels. Inventories are balanced   with incoming orders. Many of the manufacturers we spoke with said that capital   outlays will be higher in the upcoming months relative to year-ago levels. Some   noted that projects delayed in 2010 will be started this year. Others said that   business conditions warranted raising capital budgets for 2011. Prices for metal   and agricultural commodities, steel, and petroleum-based products remain   elevated. Many of our contacts reported passing rising input costs through to   their customers. A few manufacturers commented that they expect steel prices to   begin falling back during the second half of this year. The pace of hiring among   manufacturers has picked up since our last report; however, several contacts   said that they are using temporary workers instead of creating new positions.   Wage pressures are generally contained, with some companies planning to   reinstate merit increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although new home construction remained   overall at a low level, a few general contractors noted a pick up in traffic and   sales. Purchases were mainly in the move-up buyer categories. Little change in   sales was noted on a year-over-year basis. Home builders expressed somewhat more   of an optimistic outlook than during the past several months, which they   attributed to seasonal factors and slightly better-than-expected activity during   February. List prices and discounting of new homes have held steady since our   last report, while some upward pressure on the cost of building materials was   reported. Little movement was seen in land positions or spec inventories. A few   builders said they want to construct more spec houses, but they are unable to   obtain financing. We heard many reports of subcontractors struggling to stay in   business, while general contractors continue to work with lean crews. No hiring   is expected in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in nonresidential construction is being driven primarily by   healthcare projects, and to a lesser degree, by manufacturing and energy.   Information on current business conditions varied widely, though a number of   high-end projects (greater than $100 million) are now entering the construction   phase, after several years of planning. Most of our contacts expect that   activity will slowly improve as the year progresses. Two builders noted that   banks must loosen credit restrictions in order for projects to move into the   construction phase. Another builder said that some of his manufacturing clients   have the cash, but there is no sense of urgency on their part to begin   construction. We heard widespread reports of increased prices for building   materials, particularly steel and petroleum-based components. Contractors are   absorbing these rising costs in their margins. Other than seasonal employment,   general contractors held payrolls steady, and they do not expect any new   permanent hiring in the upcoming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from retailers indicate that   sales for the period from mid-February through mid-March were generally on or   ahead of plan, and were mostly higher relative to year-ago levels. Sales of   warm-weather apparel and recreational products have picked up. A few of our   contacts reported that the low- to mid-market segments still face considerable   stress. For the second quarter of 2011, retailers expect transactions to rise on   a year-over-year basis, with several anticipating low to mid-single digit gains.   We continued to hear about increasing prices from vendors, which were primarily   attributed to a rise in the cost of agricultural commodities. Accordingly, some   retailers have raised their prices, especially for food products. Profit margins   were generally steady or showed a slight improvement. Capital spending is mainly   for store remodeling, new store openings, and e-business expansion, with a   corresponding increase in payrolls. No change in employment is expected at   existing stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers reported that new-vehicle sales improved between mid-February   and mid-March when compared to the prior 30-day period, while on a   year-over-year basis, vehicle purchases rose substantially for most of our   contacts. Several noted that they are beginning to see a pickup in sales of more   fuel-efficient cars. Dealers expressed concern about a potential slowdown in the   pace of the recovery. As a result, they are more cautious in their outlook for   vehicle purchases during the spring and summer months. A majority of our   contacts said that new- and used-vehicle inventories are too lean. Used-vehicle   prices are trending up. Reports about lenders loosening credit requirements were   fairly widespread, with credit prices remaining very competitive. Dealers are   waiting for more details from automakers before committing to major capital   investments in their facilities. However, several of our contacts said that they   are currently undertaking some minor upgrades. Most auto dealers are beginning   to hire on a selective basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported that demand for business loans   grew at a modest pace since our last survey. Although demand was characterized   as broad-based, some bankers commented that applications were strongest from   health-care providers and energy companies. On the consumer side, a majority of   our contacts indicated that credit demand has picked up slightly, primarily for   vehicle purchases (direct and indirect) and home equity lines of credit.   Interest rates for business and consumer credit were stable, but competitive.   Demand in the residential mortgage market is mainly for refinancings, although   applications have slowed due to rising interest rates. Core deposits continue to   grow, but at a lower rate, with almost all growth occurring in nonmaturing   products. Credit standards were unchanged. The credit quality of businesses and   consumer applicants was characterized as stable or improving, while delinquency   rates were steady or trending down across most portfolios. Staffing levels have   shown little change during the past few weeks, and only selective hiring is   expected during 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports indicate that oil and gas output from   conventional wells was fairly steady during the past six weeks, with little   change expected in the near term. Spot prices for natural gas were steady to   trending down, while wellhead prices paid to independent oil producers showed a   modest increase. Coal production was stable to moderately lower since our last   report, with little change anticipated in the near term. Coal prices held   steady. We heard widespread reports of increased costs for diesel fuel and other   equipment and materials used in coal production. Energy payrolls are expected to   remain at current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight transport executives reported that   shipping volume rose from early February through mid-March, after a   greater-than-expected seasonal decline during January. Two of our contacts noted   that they are seeing a slight pickup in shipments of residential construction   materials. Looking ahead, carriers expect that markets will continue to recover.   The price for diesel fuel remains elevated, with most of the increase being   passed through to customers via surcharges. We also heard about rising prices   for tires and packaging materials. One executive said that he plans to increase   his shipping prices as customer contracts come up for renewal. Capital outlays   are expected to rise modestly during 2011 to replace aging equipment. Little   capacity expansion is expected. Hiring has been for replacement and seasonal   work. Slight wage pressures are emerging due to a tightening of the driver   pool.
