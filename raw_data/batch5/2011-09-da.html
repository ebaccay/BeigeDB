      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <p>
        The Eleventh District economy grew at a modest pace since the last report.   Reports from manufacturers were mixed, and activity in the services sector rose   slightly. The single-family housing sector remained weak, but activity in the   multifamily sector was strong and the commercial real estate sector saw   continued improvement. Financial services respondents said overall loan demand   was flat during the reporting period. The energy industry continued to expand at   a robust pace, while agricultural conditions deteriorated further in the   District. Employment levels were stable at most responding firms and price   pressures were unchanged. Numerous contacts said stock market volatility,   declining consumer confidence and uncertainty regarding national economic   conditions had dampened their outlook.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Prices
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Overall, prices were unchanged from the last   report, although there were some reports of price increases. Food producers   noted a continued rise in commodity prices, particularly for corn. Accounting,   legal and staffing firms reported slight increases in rates charged for their   services, and airlines noted fare increases in the high single digits compared   to last year's levels. Contacts in rail transportation said they had rolled back   some earlier instituted increases in shipping rates, and airlines and cargo   service firms reported benefitting from lower fuel prices. Retailers noted   slight declines in overall prices, although increases were seen for high-end   goods and certain products affected by higher cotton prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The price of WTI fell from near $100 per barrel in early July to $85 at the   end of the reporting period in late August. Natural gas, gasoline and diesel   prices fell since the last report, and prices for most petrochemical products   were flat or down. Labor Market Most responding firms reported steady employment   levels, and some noted slight hiring activity. Staffing firms continued to see   steady demand at high levels. Most transportation equipment, food and metals   manufacturers reported an increase in payrolls, and some said they had increased   work hours as well. A few contacts at legal services, auto sales, energy, and   transportation service firms reported modest employment increases. Wage   pressures remained minimal, although upward pressure was noted by one   transportation equipment manufacturer.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Reports from construction-related   manufacturers were mixed, but suggest overall activity levels were unchanged.   Manufacturers tied to residential construction generally reported continued   sluggish demand. Primary metals manufacturers saw a broad-based increase in   activity, and producers of lumber and wood products noted a pickup in demand   partly due to remodeling projects. Construction-related outlooks remained weak,   and some contacts expressed concern about the uncertainty surrounding the   national economy and lack of sufficient backlogs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondents in high-tech manufacturing report that growth in sales and orders   weakened since the last report. Demand for basic memory products such as DRAM   has weakened, while continued growth in demand for servers to store and process   data has kept orders for microprocessors growing at a solid pace. Slow growth in   Asia and increased uncertainty about the European and US economic outlooks has   reduced business investment in high-tech products. The outlook for the next   three to six months is for weak but positive growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paper manufacturers reported that demand growth softened slightly during the   reporting period, but remained better than last year's levels. Manufacturers of   transportation equipment reported strong sales with demand flat to up since the   last report and well above year-ago levels. Outlooks are optimistic, with   contacts expecting demand to hold steady at current high levels over the next   few months. Food producers reported a seasonal uptick in demand, but noted that   they had seen a significant decline in overall sales compared with earlier in   the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Petrochemical producers reported that after about six months of extensive   plant outages, shortages of key materials, and dramatic price increases, resin   and plastics markets have settled. Contacts said demand for most products   remained good since the last report, with the exception of PVC products due to   weak construction markets. Refiners said capacity utilization rates were the   highest since 2007, and margins were strong based on good demand. Orders for oil   products slipped in July, but strengthened again in August, according to   contacts.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail Sales
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Retail demand was unchanged since the last   report, but sales rose in the mid-to-low single digits from a year ago. Back-to   school sales activity picked up slightly. Apparel, especially women's clothing,   and fine jewelry are segments that have shown strength recently. There is some   concern regarding recent stock market volatility and its potential impact on   consumer confidence, but this has not affected store activity, reported   contacts. Sales in Texas and the Southwest region continued to outpace those   nationwide by a slim margin, according to two large retailers, and expectations   are for continued modest growth through year-end.
       </p>
       <p>
        Automobile sales continued to improve, and contacts say supply issues from   Japanese manufacturers should resolve by the end of September. Demand for used   cars remained high, along with their prices. Contacts were optimistic and expect   sales to increase through year-end.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Overall demand for staffing services held steady   at high levels, although several firms noted slight declines in activity. One   contact reported that temporary placements were being outpaced by direct hiring   activity. Outlooks were more cautious than the previous reporting period, with   contacts expecting demand to remain flat or decline through year-end. Demand for   accounting services was flat, although contacts noted some strength in mergers   and acquisitions activity. Legal firms reported continued solid demand for   intellectual property, energy, IPO, and mergers and acquisitions services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports from transportation service firms were mostly positive, but suggest   that uncertainty surrounding the national economy has somewhat weakened   outlooks. Intermodal cargo volumes increased since the last report. Railroad   shipments rose slightly, with particularly strong volume growth in metallic   ores, petroleum products and non-commercial building products. Container volumes   declined during the reporting period, and contacts reported a weaker outlook   than during the earlier reporting period. Small parcel shipments rebounded in   August after declining in July, in part due to growth in retail trade activity.   Airline traffic held steady over the past six weeks. Demand for travel within   the US and to Latin America was solid, but travel to Asia and Europe remained   weak. Airline contacts expect to see modest improvement in revenues in the   fourth quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction and Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Contacts in the   single-family housing industry said new and existing home sales rose slightly   since the last report, although the market remains weak overall. Existing home   inventories declined and new home inventories remained lean. Respondents are   cautious in their outlooks, but most expect a slight improvement in sales in the   second half of the year, with a slow recovery taking hold by early 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apartment demand was strong during the reporting period, and rental rates   continued to rise. Contacts also noted increased sales of apartment properties.   Leasing activity for office and industrial space continued at a moderate pace   since the last report. Contacts noted strong demand in Houston stemming, in   part, from energy activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Financial Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most financial firms reported   relatively flat loan demand, with the exception of one contact who noted a   slowdown in lending activity. Contacts at national banks said they are concerned   about the loss of momentum for a self-sustaining recovery and are seeing   customers approach borrowing decisions conservatively. Regional banks said loan   pricing remained aggressive. Outlooks are generally less optimistic than the   prior reporting period, although outstanding loan quality remains stable and   there continues to be gradual improvement in lending conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Energy
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Texas drilling activity rose since the last   report, with the state adding 43 rigs over the past six weeks. Most of the   demand is from land-based drilling, led by horizontal drilling and fracturing.   Initially applied to natural gas formations, success is growing in application   of these technologies to oil basins, such as the Permian Basin. Contacts noted   that activity in the Gulf of Mexico remained weak, with only a few recent   permits approved for drilling.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Agriculture
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Drought conditions remain severe and   agricultural losses in the state have reached $5.2 billion, surpassing the 2006   record of $4.1 billion, according to Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates.   Dry weather and high temperatures have reduced yields and increased abandonment   of crops. The livestock sector has also suffered greatly, with very poor grazing   conditions necessitating costly supplemental feeding and in many cases the   selling off of herds. An increase in the number of cows and calves being sold   has dampened cattle prices. Grain prices have generally increased since the last   report, partly driven by lower production expectations. Strong export demand for   beef has benefitted the district's livestock sector.
