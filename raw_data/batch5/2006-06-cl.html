      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's economy continued expanding in late April and May, as it has 
  throughout the year. Most manufacturers reported steady to increasing production 
  in recent weeks. Retailers also reported better-than-anticipated increases in 
  sales relative to this time a year ago. Demand for trucking and shipping services 
  remained strong and broad-based. While commercial building continues to recover, 
  homebuilding has slowed. Some of this slowdown is reflected in weaker consumer 
  loan demand at District banks, though commercial borrowing continues to be steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      On hiring, more firms reported that they are looking to add workers, and contacts 
  from the staffing-services industry said that some types of skilled workers 
  remain in short supply. Nevertheless, outside of a few areas, there were no 
  reports of any accumulating wage pressure. Nonlabor input-cost increases, however, 
  were widely reported. Specifically, contacts cited increases in the prices for 
  petroleum-based products, some building materials and metals, and natural gas. 
  Attempts to recover these increases in costs varied by industry; in general, 
  about half of the contacts from construction and manufacturing firms reported 
  attempts to increase prices in response to cost changes, while reports of retailers' 
  increasing their prices were few.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts at the District's durable goods facilities generally reported that 
  production was above year-ago levels at the end of May. Most contacts, including 
  those in the steel industry, expect this trend to continue into the summer months. 
  One industry with weaker current and prospective production was autos: At District 
  auto assembly plants, production fell notably from last year's levels. Regarding 
  capital expenditures, responses were roughly evenly divided between those firms 
  that planned to increase spending in the next six to twelve months and those 
  that did not. In terms of hiring, half of respondents reported hiring in April 
  and May, but only a quarter plan any additional hiring in the near future. Wage 
  pressures are not a concern. Input costs, however, increased in late April and 
  early May, notably for petroleum-based products and metals. A quarter of those 
  reporting indicated that they successfully increased prices in response.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production at the District's nondurable producers improved in April and May 
  but remains roughly the same as at this time last year. Several contacts reported 
  an increase in new orders. Hiring and planned increases in capital spending 
  were limited. Though nondurable good producers also reported price increases 
  in energy-related items, most contacts reported that their overall input costs 
  were stable. According to contacts, firms that attempted to increase their prices 
  had more success passing price increases along to smaller customers than to 
  larger customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers generally reported improving sales trends through the six 
  weeks ending in May. Specialty apparel retailers reported higher sales than 
  at this time last year. Sales at the District's drug stores were also above 
  last year's levels, though sales trends for these retailers were less than the 
  national average. Lastly, department store sales were a bit below last year's 
  levels, but better than anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some segments, however, did see a softening. Reports from the District's discounters 
  indicated that their sales were slightly weaker than anticipated, though sales 
  still grew relative to a year ago. Some of this weakness was attributed to increases 
  in gasoline prices. Several contacts suggested that consumers were more value 
  conscious than in the recent past and that consumers may have been trying to 
  limit spending to necessities. Increases in gasoline prices also affected retailers 
  through rising freight costs; nevertheless, retailers' prices remained relatively 
  flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most auto dealerships reported sluggish sales in late April and early May, 
  though sales of foreign nameplates fared significantly better than their domestic 
  counterparts. In response, some manufacturers are attempting to spur sales with 
  incentives. For instance, in early June, Ford announced a new incentive offer, 
  wherein buyers would receive $1,000 for gasoline purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New home sales were mixed in April and early May compared to the first quarter, 
  with more contacts reporting declines than increases. Second-quarter sales for 
  most builders have declined on a year-over-year basis. About a quarter of the 
  builders indicated they have increased their base prices in the last few months 
  to offset increases in materials costs. However, a slightly larger proportion 
  increased their discounts or incentives. Sales over the next several months 
  are expected to fall from last year's levels. Many contacts reported significant 
  increases in plumbing and electrical costs due to the increase in copper prices. 
  Most contacts said subcontractors are less busy and more available than usual, 
  and several builders reported reducing their payrolls, possibly pointing to 
  net reductions in the industry's overall employment levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost all commercial contractors reported that business has tended to improve 
  throughout 2006 and is better than at this time in 2005. Contractors are optimistic 
  about the remainder of 2006. Building segments reportedly doing well include 
  office construction, particularly for professional service and health care concerns, 
  and public projects. Contacts reported rising materials costs, notably for copper, 
  concrete, drywall, and petroleum-related products. As a result, almost all contractors 
  are planning to increase prices sometime in the future. About half reported 
  increasing staff sizes, some significantly. Subcontractors are also seeing an 
  increase in work and are charging higher rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      At District banks, commercial loan demand was steady while consumer loan demand 
  was soft in late April and May. Home equity loans were up, while auto-loan demand 
  continued to be weak. The mortgage market softened in May and is expected to 
  remain this way for the remainder of 2006. Credit quality remained strong for 
  both consumer and commercial customers. Core deposits changed little at most 
  banks. At this time, most bankers expect 2006 to be a challenging year due to 
  narrowing net-interest margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for trucking and shipping services remained strong through the six weeks 
  ending May. Higher fuel costs concerned contacts, even though trucking companies 
  have been able to maintain their surcharges. Carriers continued to report difficulty 
  attracting and retaining drivers; however, few firms planned to increase wages. 
  As previously reported, capital spending in the industry is strong, as firms 
  attempt to purchase trucks that don't need to meet impending EPA guidelines.
