      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 28, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District held steady during the   past seven weeks. Manufacturers reported that the rise in production which began   late last year is leveling off. Contacts in nonresidential construction cited   fewer inquiries and a small drop in backlog, while residential builders noted   that new home construction has slowed. Retail sales were flat to up slightly,   whereas auto dealers reported a slight downturn in new vehicle purchases. Energy   production increased modestly, and reports indicated a continuing upturn in   freight transport volume. Demand by businesses and consumers for new loans   remained weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       A small pickup in employment was limited to the manufacturing sector.   Staffing-firm representatives reported some improvement in the number of new job   openings, with opportunities concentrated in the healthcare field. Wage   pressures continue to be contained. Apart from a downward trend in steel and   lumber prices, raw materials and product pricing was generally stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from District factories show that   production levels were mainly steady or down slightly during the past seven   weeks. Manufacturers who cited increased output attributed it to seasonal   factors. Production was higher on a year-over-year basis, with many contacts   citing double-digit increases. A large majority of respondents believe that   demand growth seen earlier this year is tapering off, and they expect production   will stabilize at current levels or show a modest decline. Most steel producers   and service centers reported a slight downturn in volume, which was expected.   Shipments are being driven primarily by energy-related and metal fabrication   industries. Construction volume remains very weak. Although this time of year is   traditionally slow for the steel industry, our contacts are not overly confident   that shipments will pick up in the fourth quarter. District auto production was   fairly stable in June on a month-over-month basis, while year-over-year it rose   substantially for both domestic and foreign nameplates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little movement was seen in inventories, although we heard a few reports that   finished durable goods inventories were beginning to rise. A majority of our   contacts stated that their capacity utilization rates are below pre-recession   levels, with little change during the past few weeks. Capital outlays continue   at relatively low levels, and business owners are approaching spending decisions   with caution. Steel producers and service center representatives reported that   their prices are on the decline, reflecting a downward trend in steel production   input costs. Other raw material costs have been fairly stable. Companies   continue to expand payrolls and extend work hours, but at a slower pace. Wage   pressures are contained.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In general, new home sales have slowed during   the past seven weeks and on a year-over-year basis. Most of our contacts cited   tight credit as one of the primary factors contributing to the slowdown.   Homebuilders are not expecting a turnaround in new home construction this year,   with several anticipating a further decline in sales. Our contacts tell us that   entry-level homes are beginning to regain sales momentum, with lessening   activity in the move-up and third-time home-buyer categories. Little change was   noted in the list prices of new houses, and reports indicate that the rise in   construction material costs is leveling off, especially for lumber products.   Skeleton crews remain the norm for general contractors and subcontractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Signs of a pickup in nonresidential construction cited in our past two   reports are beginning to diminish. Although building activity remains steady,   several of our contacts reported declining inquiries and a slight drop in their   backlogs. Most inquiries and new projects underway fall within the industrial   and government-funded infrastructure categories. The glut in commercial space   shows no signs of lessening. Half of our contacts expressed a heightened level   of uncertainty about construction activity in the near term, though others   remain cautiously optimistic. Little change in construction material costs was   reported. We heard numerous accounts of contractors and clients struggling to   obtain financing. Other than seasonal hiring, employment rolls are steady. Many   subcontractors remain underutilized and are taking on projects at cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       For the period from mid-May through   mid-June, retail sales were generally flat or up slightly when compared to the   previous 30-day period. Purchases of apparel and food products are doing well,   while spending on discretionary items has weakened. Retailers are somewhat less   optimistic about future sales than in our last report; however, they still   expect buying to show a small improvement going into the fourth quarter. Vendor   and store pricing has been stable. Most auto dealers saw new vehicle sales slow   from mid-May through mid-June, when compared with the previous 30 days. Dealers   indicated that the rising sales trend present in the spring has leveled off, and   they are not expecting a return to robust growth in the near term. Many dealers   said that their inventories are low, which was attributed to seasonal factors.   Used vehicle purchases were characterized as holding up reasonably well. Our   contacts told us that they are finding it more challenging to arrange financing   for customers with less than the highest credit rating. Reports show little   change in staffing levels at retailers or auto dealers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The market for business lending remains soft,   with bankers characterizing the demand for new loans as flat to improving   slightly. Interest rates are stable. On the consumer side, loan demand is   generally weak. Those seeing a slight uptick attributed it to draw-downs on home   equity lines of credit. We heard a few reports of downward pressure on auto loan   rates. The residential mortgage market continues at a slow pace, with several   bankers noting that activity is below expectations, given current mortgage   rates. Core deposits are steady or up at most banks, with much of the growth   occurring in transaction accounts. Reports on credit quality were mixed.   Delinquency rates declined or held stable for nearly all banks; still, several   of our contacts noted that delinquencies remain above historic norms. Employment   rolls and wages are stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports show little change in oil and natural gas   output during the past seven weeks, with output expected to remain flat in the   near term. Spot prices for natural gas rose slightly, while oil prices dropped.   Reports on coal production have grown more positive. Export producers are   experiencing increased demand for both steam and metallurgical coal, while   unseasonably warm weather increased the demand for coal by electric utilities.   Prices for coal were mixed but are tending to the up side. Production equipment   and materials costs were generally flat. Staffing levels are steady, and little   hiring is expected in the near future. Wage pressures are contained.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Transportation
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Freight transport executives reported   continuing favorable volume trends, with only moderate gains to their bottom   lines. Although most of our contacts are cautiously optimistic in their outlook,   they expect that the rate of volume growth experienced in the second quarter   will begin to moderate. One contact noted industry-wide concern over the   strength of consumer demand. Several respondents commented that they are   attempting to negotiate rate increases, with some degree of success. Major   capital purchases remain at or near replacement rates. However, due to aging   fleets and growing demand, the need to replace equipment may grow toward   year-end. Several of our contacts noted that quoted prices for tractors and   trailers are rising. Current hiring is primarily for replacement only. If volume   continues to build, freight executives expect to add capacity in the near   term.
