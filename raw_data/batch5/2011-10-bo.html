      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business contacts in the First District mostly continue to see demand growth,   but many are toning down their outlooks. Contacted retailers' year-over-year   percentage sales changes range from low single-digit declines to high   single-digit increases. Responses from manufacturers are mixed, but most   continue to report revenue growth. Advertising and consulting firms generally   cite strong results, but note a slowdown in the pace. Commercial and residential   real estate markets remain soft. Net hiring remains very limited except for   advertising and consulting; even there, contacts see restrained hiring going   forward. Price pressures continue to ease; some commodity prices are down and   many firms are holding their own prices steady. Contacts in several sectors cite   uncertainty as a key factor restraining demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District retailers contacted in   late September and early October provide mixed messages about sales trends and   many note they are having a difficult time gauging their current circumstances.   On a year-over-year basis, sales range from being down 3 percent to up 8   percent, with several in the "generally flat" middle. One big-ticket retailer   saw sales steadily moving up over the last few weeks, although he cautions that   a few weeks do not constitute a trend. Another retailer notes that sales have   been up and down, on both a daily and a weekly basis, and attributes this   volatility to consumer sentiment gyrating with positive and negative news about   the domestic and global economy. Furniture sales are reportedly up a bit in some   markets and apparel sales are said to be good. Some retailers still face "high"   vendor prices and say they are passing them on to consumers. Contacts are   uncertain about what to expect for the 2011 holiday sales season. Firms say they   are budgeting about 2.5 percent wage increases for 2012, are hiring selectively,   and are not planning layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The travel and tourism sector reports strength despite the generally downbeat   global economic climate. Within the sector, leisure travel is slowing, while   domestic and international business travel remains 5 percent to 7 percent higher   than in 2010. September growth slowed to 4 percent from the 5 percent to 7   percent year-over-year gains seen earlier in 2011. Advance hotel bookings for   2012:Q1 are up. The industry is expecting positive but slower growth in   2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions at   contacted manufactures are mixed. Most respondents continue to report revenue   growth, but the vast majority also report that they are less optimistic about   the next six to eighteen months than they were the last time they responded.   Demand continues to be strong for firms in the automotive and aerospace   components industries, as well as for a medical device firm, a semiconductor   firm, and companies manufacturing industrial-related products. In comparison,   sales growth remains positive but slow at an instruments manufacturer, a   business services firm, and a company that makes entertainment products. Reasons   contacts give for this sluggish demand include continued tepid sales to   government-related institutions and financial services firms being very cautious   about their expenditures. Demand was noticeably lower than in previous   quarters--beyond the typical slowdown during the summer months--at a food   products manufacturer. In addition, a business products firm and a manufacturer   whose sales are dependent on the residential investment sector report even   weaker demand than in the previous quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hiring at contacted manufacturers is limited to replacing workers who depart   through retirement and/or attrition. A semiconductor firm says it is   implementing a hiring freeze because incoming orders for 2012 have dropped   sharply in recent weeks, especially from China. A business products firm   continues to reduce headcount as part of a strategic restructuring plan and the   manufacturer with sales tied heavily to residential investment is also reducing   its workforce for the first time since 2009. A repeated theme from the majority   of contacts is that they are implementing changes to keep costs low and/or   reduce operating expenses. A couple of firms note that merit increases in 2012   will likely be lower than in 2011, while another firm plans to restructure its   healthcare benefits to shift more of the costs to employees without offsetting   pay increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are fewer reports of input price pressures from manufacturers than in   recent months, even though prices for some food-related commodities such as milk   remain high. In fact, copper prices have dropped substantially in the last month   or so and other precious metals prices have also declined; oil prices are also   lower. Thus some manufacturers are facing noticeably lower costs; for the most   part, they say they are waiting to see if commodity prices stay lower before   adjusting their selling prices. More generally, contacted firms say their   selling prices remain stable, although they are raising prices "as needed," as   indicated in previous reports. Some manufacturers note, however, that consumers   are currently reluctant to spend on discretionary items, so they are offering   promotions to partially offset price increases and/or promote their products so   as not to lose customers to lower cost competitors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the uncertain economic environment, contacted manufacturers continue   to look for worthwhile investment opportunities, and some have made recent   acquisitions. To the extent that manufacturers are holding back on investment,   they say it is not because of a lack of credit or insufficient cash holdings.   Overall, firms are less optimistic about business conditions heading into 2012   than they were in the last round. Many firms are shifting any pickup in demand   they previously anticipated for 2012 forward to 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Selected Business Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consulting and advertising   contacts in the First District report generally strong business conditions,   although weaker than three months ago. Marketing and advertising contacts report   robust growth--between 10 percent and 25 percent year-over-year. The higher end   of the growth figures are driven by demand from financial firms, including   private equity, who need to market new products in the changing financial and   regulatory environment. Strategy and business consulting contacts report weaker   demand in the third quarter than earlier in the year; they say clients are   focusing on services that can be directly tied to the bottom line such as sales   and process efficiency rather than strategy and management. Economic consulting   firms report varying degrees of success, with firms doing government work   experiencing stagnant demand, while firms focused on litigation see strong   growth (close to 20 percent) reflecting growing caseloads involving large   financial firms and the financial crisis. A healthcare consulting firm cites   growth of only 2 percent year-over-year, attributing it to weakness in the   pharmaceutical industry, with most growth coming from developing countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts say they are generally raising prices about 3 percent to 5 percent   to cover cost increases and maintain profit margins. Two strategic consulting   contacts, however, made bigger price changes: one firm dropped prices by 10   percent to compete with cheaper foreign firms, primarily in India, while the   other raised prices 10 percent to keep up with compensation costs. Hiring   activity is mixed, with firms spread along the spectrum from a 25 percent   addition to a 10 percent layoff. Nearly all contacts, however, say hiring is   likely to be restrained or flat for the foreseeable future.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the most part, contacts have revised their expectations downward since   the last conversation in July. Although many still expect business conditions   and profitability to remain strong, they note that they are in a highly   pro-cyclical industry and economic indicators point towards a pessimistic   outlook. The one exception is firms that primarily provide services to the   financial industry, who expect strong growth as financial firms continue to deal   with the aftermath of the financial crisis and regulatory overhaul. Several   contacts say they believe the increasing prospect of continued political   stalemate in Washington is having serious deleterious effects on both their   firms and the economy as a whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from commercial real   estate contacts around the District contain a mix of good news and bad. On the   good news side, in both Boston and Providence significant amounts of office   space were absorbed in the third quarter as tenants took advantage of attractive   rents for prime locations. In the column of bad news, the outlook turned more   pessimistic among roughly half of contacts in light of a perceived increase in   national and global risks to growth. Respondents also report a number of other   mixed or contradictory signals. While one contact perceives that leasing   activity in downtown Boston has increased in recent weeks, another contact notes   that the pace of office absorption year-to-date in Boston, while positive,   remains well below what would be expected in a healthy recovery. Sales activity   remains limited in Providence, while Boston continues to enjoy robust investment   demand for prime office and apartment properties. The lending environment is   characterized, on the one hand, by aggressive competition to fund loans on   low-risk properties, such as well-leased buildings in prime Boston locations,   and, on the other hand, by a decline in credit availability for properties   carrying higher risk, such as those experiencing high vacancy rates.   Construction activity in Boston continues at a moderate pace in the apartment,   education, and health sectors, while office construction activity is described   as negligible.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Notwithstanding substantial   increases in home and condo sales in August compared to a year ago, residential   real estate markets in New England remain weak and sluggish. Contacts note that   the enormous decline in buyer activity last year following the expiration of the   tax credit largely explains the year-over-year increases observed this year.   Meanwhile, the median sale prices of homes and condos decreased slightly in   August throughout the region, with the exception of the Greater Boston area   where prices rose. Inventory levels in Greater Boston reached very low levels in   August. Residential respondents throughout New England describe buyers as   cautious and patient, reflecting fears over job security. Some contacts express   concern about the ability of consumers to secure home-purchase financing. At the   same time, several contacts note an increase in investors purchasing   single-family properties to rent out.
     </p>
     <p>
      Forecasts for the remainder of the year remain bleak, with contacts   anticipating 2011 sales will fall short of last year's total. Respondents do not   expect a significant improvement in residential real estate within the next one   to two years.
