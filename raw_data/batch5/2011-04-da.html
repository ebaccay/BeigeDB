      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 13, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy grew at a moderate pace over the past six   weeks. Energy activity remained strong, refining activity picked up, and demand   was strong for most petrochemical products. Reports from the manufacturing and   non-financial service sectors were mostly positive. Financial services firms   noted a slight improvement in loan demand. Conditions continued improving in the   commercial real estate leasing market, and apartment demand was strong. The   single-family housing sector remained weak however, and widening drought   conditions were reported in the agricultural sector. Many responding firms   across a wide variety of industries noted uncertainty about events in Japan and   the Middle East, and some voiced concerns about shortages of parts in the   near-term. Since the last report, price pressures increased, and there were more   reports of hiring activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures continued to build since the last   report. Many responding firms said high fuel prices were causing their input   costs to rise, and contacts in the lumber and transportation services industries   increased selling prices in response. Some manufacturers noted steel prices had   risen, and most construction respondents said metal and petroleum based   products, such as rebar, copper and asphalt had increased in price. In the   service sector, airline fares were up significantly due to increases in the   price of jet fuel. Legal contacts noted slight increases in billing rates, and   retailers continued to report upticks in food prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The price of crude oil rose from $85 per barrel in mid-February to over $100   per barrel in late March. Natural gas prices receded early in the reporting   period as cold weather subsided, but strengthened again to over $4 per Mcf at   the end of March, due to geopolitical uncertainties and rising crude oil prices.   Prices for most petrochemical products increased since the last report,   according to respondents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There were increased reports of hiring   activity compared with the previous reporting period. Staffing firms continued   to note strong demand and were hiring for their own needs at a stronger pace   than in the last report. Some transportation, food and primary metals   manufacturers reported employment increases. A few contacts in the auto sales,   railroad and airline sectors also noted a rise in hiring activity. Wage   pressures were minimal, although some fabricated metals contacts were   considering increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for construction-related products   improved slightly, according to most contacts. Even after accounting for pent-up   demand following bad weather in early February, cement, glass and primary metals   firms and some lumber manufacturers reported some increase in activity.   Apartment construction, residential repair and remodeling, and custom commercial   projects were said to be driving the uptick. Fabricated metals producers said   orders rose, but at a slightly slower pace. While overall activity is at low   levels, most construction-related manufacturers' outlooks were more optimistic   than they were six weeks ago, although there were some concerns regarding recent   world events.
     </p>
     <p>
      High-tech manufacturing firms said the fallout from the ongoing natural   disaster in Japan was the major factor impacting the industry since the last   report. Contacts that ship a significant share of output to Japanese factories   noted their profits will be negatively impacted, particularly in the first and   second quarters of this year. One respondent estimated that shipments coming   from at least one factory in Japan may not return to normal until September.   Other than events in Japan, most firms said that conditions were stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper manufacturers said demand had mostly recovered from the slump due to   bad weather in January and February. Most firms said demand was stable or   improved. Expectations are mostly for stable to improved demand over the next   several months, although the longer-term outlook is more uncertain.   Manufacturers of transportation equipment said demand was unchanged from the   previous report. Outlooks remain cautiously optimistic, although some contacts   noted concern about rising fuel costs and global uncertainties. Food   manufacturers said orders rose at a moderate pace, and the outlook for sales was   positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District petrochemical producers said domestic demand remained   strong for plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Still, higher U.S.   prices for some petrochemicals have made exports less attractive. The major   exception is PVC which is used in construction, as ample supplies and   competitive prices due to low domestic demand have kept exports solid. Refiners   said activity had picked up since the last report, with stronger demand for   gasoline and oil products. Refinery margins rose despite the increase in crude   prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Eleventh District retail sales rebounded   from weather-related sluggishness in the previous reporting period and grew   modestly compared to the prior year. Home furnishings sales benefitted from   strong seasonal trends. According to one large retailer, the Eleventh District   continues to grow at a stronger pace than the nation, on average. Expectations   are for a modest improvement in 2011 over 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales continued to improve; however, respondents note concern over   potential supply chain disruptions due to the ongoing natural disaster and   nuclear calamities in Japan. Aside from these concerns, automobile dealers   reported a favorable outlook for the balance of 2011 due to strong foot traffic   consisting of high-quality customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing firms said demand held steady at high   levels. Strength remains broad-based, with particularly strong demand coming   from the steel, oil, customer service, IT and professional industries. All   contacts had positive outlooks and expect continued strength in 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for accounting services increased since the last report, as is typical   for this time of year. One large firm noted that activity picked up noticeably   for transactional business and mergers and acquisitions services. Continued   improvement in business has reduced the pressure to keep fees low. Legal   contacts noted mostly steady demand, with some strength in corporate   services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from transportation services contacts were mixed, but mostly   positive. Intermodal transportation firms noted cargo volumes declined due to   weaker demand from international clients. Railroad shipments increased   moderately, with particularly strong volume growth in ores, motor vehicles,   petroleum products and industrial construction materials. Container trade   volumes flattened over the reporting period. Airlines reported continued steady   traffic, although contacts noted that fare increases stemming from higher fuel   costs could slow bookings. Most transportation services respondents were   optimistic in their outlooks and expect growth in demand this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Eleventh District housing   activity remains weak, and contacts expect more of the same in the coming   months. Outlooks for the second half of the year were slightly more upbeat.   Respondents said the first-time homebuyer market continues to deteriorate, but   some realtors and builders said higherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“end homes sales had increased   modestly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment demand accelerated since the last survey, and contacts said   occupancy rates were improving and rental rates were rising. While construction   activity is picking up, demand continues to outpace supply suggesting conditions   will continue to improve in the near-term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office and industrial leasing activity picked up slightly since the last   report. With construction of office buildings and warehouses at very low levels,   contacts say the modest acceleration in demand for space is likely to have a   positive impact on vacancy rates this year. Sales of commercial property   remained at low levels, although contacts noted a small uptick in sales of   foreclosures and distressed properties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial firms reported a slight   improvement in overall loan demand. National banks reported some pickup in   commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loan demand with increased corporate   activity, while they continue to see weakness in commercial real estate (CRE).   Regional banks noted that loan demand remains pretty flat, although there was a   small increase in optimism regarding homebuilding and some CRE lending at the   community-bank level. Most contacts said loan pricing remains aggressive amidst   a highly competitive lending landscape. Outlooks are gradually improving in   light of better outstanding loan quality and continued slow progress in lending   conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drilling activity remained strong in Texas since   the last report, with the state accounting for much of the increase in the U.S.   rig count. The trend toward more oil-directed drilling continues. Although fewer   rigs are directed to natural gas, those drilling for gas provide high levels of   activity for service companies according to respondents. Contacts noted growing   backlogs for horizontal drilling equipment and for crews used for both oil and   natural gas activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought conditions became more widespread in   March, covering more than 90 percent of the district. Hay production was down   and wheat and oat crop conditions were poor. The lack of soil moisture is a   large concern for spring crops, although planting was underway and mostly on   schedule. Demand for agricultural products remained strong. Commodity and beef   prices generally moved up, with scattered reports of rising food prices at the   retail level. Input costs such as fuel, fertilizer and feed have risen, pushing   up the cost of crop and livestock production.
