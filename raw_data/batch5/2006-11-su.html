      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Federal Reserve Districts reported continued moderate growth since the 
  last report. However, New York and Richmond observed that growth accelerated, 
  whereas Dallas said the pace of activity continued to decelerate from high levels, 
  and Atlanta described activity as mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite continuing softness in automobile and housing-related sales, most 
  Districts reported that consumer spending increased during October and early 
  November, and the retail sales outlook for the holiday season was cautiously 
  optimistic. According to most reports, growth in other service-producing industries 
  remained generally solid. Manufacturing activity was positive overall, with 
  the weakest reports concentrated among auto and housing-related producers. Reports 
  on housing markets continued to indicate an overall decline in single-family 
  home sales, and there were some reports of lower home prices. Indicators of 
  single-family construction continued to weaken in most Districts. However, housing 
  demand continued to be strong in a few specific markets, and nonresidential 
  activity generally improved. Many Districts noted a continued slowing in mortgage 
  lending, while reports on other lending were mixed. Some Districts reported 
  a slight increase in delinquencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of Districts continued to report that labor markets were tight, especially 
  for high-skilled occupations. Wage growth remained generally moderate, although 
  some Districts gave accounts of stronger wage pressures for some specialized 
  professions. Most Districts reported that prices moderated for construction 
  materials and energy products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported increased consumer spending overall. However, there 
  was some regional variation in the rate of increase. For instance, solid increases 
  were reported by Kansas City and Richmond, while modest improvements in retail 
  spending were noted in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, and St. 
  Louis Districts. Meanwhile, sales softened in the Boston District and were below 
  expectations in the Dallas District. Strong selling products varied by region, 
  but most Districts reported that sales of home-related items remained weak. 
  Several Districts noted a cautiously optimistic outlook for the holiday season. 
  Atlanta reported that high-end and electronics merchants were upbeat, while 
  more modest gains were expected from other retailers. Kansas City and Minneapolis 
  District merchants were said to be positive headed into the holiday season, 
  and sales in the New York, San Francisco, and St. Louis Districts are expected 
  to exceed year-ago levels. However, retail contacts in Boston remained concerned 
  about the downturn in the housing market, and Dallas described retailers as 
  more guarded.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts reported continued softness in vehicle sales, led by weaker 
  sales for the Big Three U.S. auto makers. Slow or declining sales were noted 
  by Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, and high 
  vehicle inventories were reported by several Districts. The only account of 
  improved vehicle sales came from St. Louis, while Chicago described auto sales 
  as steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The demand for services remained healthy according to most reports. Boston reported 
  that conditions were good for firms providing software and information technology 
  services, particularly for companies catering to the health care and energy 
  sectors. San Francisco noted that service providers experienced generally strong 
  demand, especially in the food and beverage, health care, and transportation 
  sectors. New York and Richmond noted solid business activity in the financial 
  services sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond Districts indicated 
  that temporary staffing firms experienced solid demand for their services, although 
  Chicago and Dallas noted that the demand for temporary workers had softened. 
  The Atlanta and Cleveland Districts reported disappointing demand for freight 
  services. Atlanta noted that much of the weakness was concentrated in businesses 
  specialized in moving building materials, while Cleveland reported softness 
  for shipments of auto-related products. St. Louis noted that the local freight 
  transportation sector was expanding. Dallas observed that transportation demand 
  was good, although contacts are anticipating slower growth in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the tourism industry were generally positive. Atlanta said that 
  the Mississippi Gulf Coast gaming revenues returned to near pre-Katrina levels 
  in October on the strength of re-opened casinos. Kansas City noted continued 
  high hotel occupancy and solid airport traffic. Boston reported that tourism 
  was currently "going gangbusters" and that business travel was strong. 
  Richmond and New York also observed that tourism was stronger than in the last 
  report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity was generally positive in most Districts. New York said 
  manufacturers noted brisk growth in activity. Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, and 
  San Francisco reported that production trends in high-tech industries were positive. 
  Cleveland reported that durable goods production was up slightly on a year-over-year 
  basis, although demand for steel products continued to soften. Manufacturing 
  in the Chicago District expanded at a modest pace, with manufacturers of machine 
  tools and equipment reporting strong demand outside of the motor vehicle industry. 
  Dallas noted that energy-related manufacturing activity remained strong. In 
  the Philadelphia region, manufacturers posted small increases in shipments, 
  but there were also marginal declines in new orders. Most Districts reported 
  that orders for homebuilding materials and related equipment have trailed off 
  substantially. In addition, some softness in auto and auto-related production 
  was noted by Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, and St. Louis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Almost all Districts reported that overall housing market activity continued 
  to slow, especially in the single-family segment. Most Districts cited declining 
  sales and rising home inventories. There were also scattered reports of price 
  reductions, while the use of non-price sales incentives was reported in the 
  Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Most 
  Districts reported declines in residential construction. For instance, according 
  to Cleveland, contractor backlogs decreased about 30 percent and fewer spec 
  homes were being built. Several Districts indicated that weak conditions are 
  expected to persist over the next several months. New York and Dallas noted 
  improved demand for rental housing, while Dallas reported that condominium construction 
  remained robust. Atlanta observed rising condominium vacancy rates in some markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to most reports, nonresidential markets improved since the last 
  report. Strengthening demand for office space was seen in the Boston, Dallas, 
  Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, and Philadelphia regions. However, some 
  slowing was noted in the Chicago District. Atlanta noted that the overall level 
  of nonresidential construction remained modest. In the San Francisco District, 
  commercial and public project activity continued to expand, although the pace 
  of growth was slower than earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity was mixed since the last report. Most Districts noted fewer 
  mortgage originations, although Chicago reported that mortgage refinancing activity 
  firmed. The demand for commercial and industrial loans was stable or slightly 
  higher in some Districts. Overall credit quality was described as good, although 

  Chicago, Cleveland, and San Francisco reported small increases in delinquencies. 
  Tighter credit standards were noted in the St. Louis and Richmond Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports suggest that labor markets remained tight since the last report, especially 
  for high-skilled occupations. Richmond reported strong demand for workers with 
  sales, life sciences, engineering, and financial skills. Boston said that there 
  was strong demand in industries such as health care, biotechnology, and engineering. 
  Kansas City noted shortages of engineers, oil field workers, accountants, welders, 
  sales people, and truck drivers. New York said that labor markets have strengthened 
  in a number of industries, including manufacturing, legal services, and banking. 
  Atlanta and Philadelphia reported that retailers were finding it difficult to 
  fill holiday-related positions. Dallas noted that labor shortages were acting 
  as a capacity constraint for some firms. Overall labor market conditions were 
  little changed according to Chicago, with small gains in employment on net.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage growth remained generally moderate, but Boston, New York, and San Francisco 
  reported faster wage growth for some specialized professions. San Francisco 
  noted continued rapid wage growth for health care, finance, and construction 
  workers. According to Boston, pay levels for professional and technical jobs 
  were being boosted in order to recruit new workers and reduce staff turnover. 
  Employers in the Philadelphia District indicated that wages have been rising 
  more rapidly in the past few months than earlier in the year, whereas the pace 
  of wage increases was steady according to Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts reported that prices moderated for construction materials and 
  energy products. Kansas City noted that prices for some building products have 
  moderated because of the combination of lower demand and reduced transportation 
  costs. However, Minneapolis reported further price increases for roofing shingles 
  and foam rubber, and Cleveland noted that prices for petroleum-related products 
  remained high. Atlanta and Chicago observed that lower energy prices had led 
  to a decline in some fuel surcharges. According to Philadelphia, price increases 
  were not as widespread as they were earlier in the fall. Richmond said that 
  prices for manufacturing inputs and finished goods rose since the last report, 
  and Chicago noted that toolmakers and food processors reported raising prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farm conditions were generally good, although there were reports that excessive 
  rains delayed harvest and field work in the St. Louis and Richmond Districts. 
  Higher prices for corn and soybeans benefited farmers in the Minneapolis and 
  Kansas City Districts. However, the higher feed costs hurt poultry and livestock 
  producers in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the energy and mining sectors was generally robust in late October 
  through mid-November. Dallas, San Francisco, and Minneapolis reported that energy 
  extraction activity was strong, while Kansas City noted that activity declined 
  moderately but remained high by historical standards. Atlanta said that much 
  of the post-hurricane infrastructure repair work had been completed in the Gulf 
  of Mexico, and Dallas noted that the Gulf Coast refineries are now operating 
  at high levels.
