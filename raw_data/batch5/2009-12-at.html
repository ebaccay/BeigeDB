      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity was mixed in October through mid-November, according to   reports from Sixth District business contacts. A majority of retailers described   activity as exceeding their modest expectations, while tourism-related spending   and automobile sales remained weak. However, the outlook for tourism improved as   year-end bookings surpassed expectations. Home sales for most District   residential real estate markets were above low year-ago levels. New residential   construction activity remained minimal and concentrated in lower price points.   The District's office and industrial markets worsened as construction levels and   rents declined and vacancy rates rose. However, several contacts indicated that   commercial construction activity showed signs of bottoming out at low levels.   Although overall manufacturing activity continued to decline, the decline   moderated and more manufacturing contacts reported improved orders. Bank lending   activity continued to be sluggish because of weak demand and tight credit   standards. The pace of layoffs in the District slowed, and some businesses   reported hiring temporary workers in response to an uptick in activity. Price   pressures remained stable and most businesses had no plans of increasing prices   in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District merchants   indicated that retail sales were better-than-expected in October and early   November. Businesses continued to keep inventory levels lean, however. The   outlook among retailers improved, with over half of respondents anticipating   increased sales over the next three months. Auto dealers across much of the   District reported dismal sales and traffic compared to their experience during   the cash-for-clunkers program over the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism-related spending remained sluggish throughout the District. Industry   contacts reported that hotel reservations, particularly related to conventions,   were down and room rates continued to decline. Cruise ships remained fully   booked because of deep discounts. The outlook for tourism was more optimistic   with several reports indicating that year-end and early 2010 bookings were   coming in above expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of District   homebuilders and Realtors reported that home sales remained above weak levels   from a year earlier in October to mid-November. However, homebuilders reports   indicated a modest increase in new home sales, while Realtors said existing home   sales were more robust. Construction activity remained weak overall, but a few   Florida homebuilders reported a pickup in activity on a year-over-year basis.   The majority of construction activity remained concentrated at lower price   points.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contractors commented on the difficulty in competing with bank-owned homes   and lots that continued to enter the market. Realtors noted that the housing   stimulus continued to drive sales at the low-end of the market, while sales at   the high-end of the market remained weak. Several real estate contacts remarked   that qualifying for loans remained challenging. The outlook over the next   several months softened somewhat for homebuilders but improved notably among   Realtors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial construction activity continued to decline, but several   contractors noted that the amount of projects in development has improved   modestly in recent months. Vacancy rates increased and contacts continued to   report downward pressure on rents. Declines in net absorption began to abate   across much of the District, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On balance, District   manufacturers indicated that activity declined, although at a slower pace than   in previous months. Roughly one-third of manufacturers reported an increase in   new orders in October, a modest improvement from the previous month. However,   one-third of manufacturers surveyed also reported further reductions in finished   inventory levels, while half noted that inventories were unchanged. The outlook   for production continued to be modestly positive. Transportation contacts   continued to report weak freight demand. Rail industry shipments through   mid-November were below year-ago levels for most industry categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks continued to hold credit   standards high and the pool of qualified loan applicants remained low. Some   financial contacts commented that increased lending was not anticipated given   the current economic environment; they were, however, willing to increase   lending if loan demand was healthy and credit quality supported the application.   Banking contacts remained focused on repairing their balance sheets, making   adjustments based more on risk avoidance and asset quality. Some indicated that   they were charging higher fees and/or paying lower rates to discourage deposit   growth, while others reported limiting CD growth and were working to increase   earnings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Layoffs continued throughout the   District in October through mid-November, although at a slower pace than in   previous months. Firms continued to hire temporary workers in response to   increases in business activity, but they remained reluctant to expand their   permanent workforce. A few firms noted taking advantage of the increase in   talented individuals looking for work to increase the quality of their   workforce. Many businesses reported that they are requiring more skills of new   hires.
     </p>
     <p>
      District contacts from a wide variety of industries continued to report   stable prices relative to last year. Most businesses reported having little   pricing power and felt that they would need to see a sustained increase in sales   before raising prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District crude oil   production continued to increase moderately in October through mid-November,   with the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico increasing slightly from   lows seen in August. Industry contacts reported that demand for petrochemicals   continued to stabilize, prompting producers to scale back inventory   reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      District growers enjoyed improved weather conditions through mid-November,   which allowed them to resume normal fieldwork activities. Some Georgia growers   were negatively affected by excessive rains.
