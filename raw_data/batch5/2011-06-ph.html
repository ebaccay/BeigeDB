      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District has improved overall since the last   Beige Book, although the pace has softened. Manufacturers reported increases in   shipments and new orders in May, although at a much slower pace than the past   two months. Retailers posted slight year-over-year sales increases in May. Motor   vehicle dealers reported a slowdown in sales during May compared with the first   four months of the year. Third District banks reported little overall change in   loan volume outstanding, on balance, since the last Beige Book. Residential real   estate agents said sales have increased seasonally, but house prices have been   flat to down. Contacts in the commercial real estate sector said that market   conditions have shown little change since the first quarter. Service-sector   firms reported modest increases in activity. Business contacts reported further   price increases for inputs as they did in the previous Beige Book. There have   been some retail price increases, and more firms in a range of sectors have   implemented fuel surcharges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expectations among Third District business contacts are mostly for slow   growth. Manufacturers forecast a modest rise in shipments and orders during the   next six months. Retailers expect sales to advance slowly on a year-over-year   basis. Auto dealers say the outlook is uncertain. Bankers expect only slight   growth in lending. Contacts in residential real estate expect moderate seasonal   gains in sales, but they expect sales for this year as a whole to be about the   same as sales last year. Contacts in commercial real estate expect conditions to   improve slowly, with markets firming around the end of the year. Service-sector   companies expect continued slow growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of widespread, robust demand growth   for manufactured products as of the last Beige Book gave way to two months of   easing in the breadth and pace of recovery. Less than 30 percent of Third   District manufacturers reported increases in shipments and orders in May --   slipping from over 50 percent since the last Beige Book. Among key manufacturing   sectors in the Third District, the number reporting increases of both shipments   and orders narrowed to 7 from 13 since the last Beige Book. The strongest   reports of orders came from producers of chemicals; food; stone, clay, and   glass; and fabricated metal products. Since the last Beige Book, declines in   orders broadened from producers of apparel and rubber products to include   producers of electronic equipment and instruments. Failure to pass a multiyear   transportation infrastructure reauthorization bill and the ongoing real estate   slump were cited by five different manufacturing sectors as hampering the   recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers remain mostly positive about business conditions   over the next six months; however, the percent of firms expecting increases fell   off sharply since the last Beige Book, from 66 percent to 36 percent. Among the   firms contacted in May, about 38 percent expect increases in new orders and   shipments, while about 20 percent expect decreases. A little uncertainty has   crept back into manufacturers' expectations, with several contacts citing   "swings" in activity. Capital spending plans over a six-month planning horizon   have changed little since the last Beige Book, with about one-third of firms   projecting increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally reported small   year-over-year increases in sales in May, although results varied by store type.   Discount stores and some luxury goods retailers posted better increases than   mid-price retailers and department stores. Retailers said sales of spring   apparel have been held back by cool, rainy weather. Several merchants said that   high gasoline prices were deterring shopping trips and constraining consumers'   discretionary buying. Looking ahead, store executives expect just slow growth in   sales. One merchant's comment expressed the general opinion: "The consumer is   responding to value. Only confidence in the job situation will prompt broader   buying."
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers generally reported that sales slowed in May from   the pace set from January through April. Some dealers said they were facing   supply constraints resulting from the interruption of Japanese vehicle and parts   production, and some dealers said demand has slowed as consumers reconsider   model preferences in response to higher gasoline prices. Dealers are uncertain   of the future course of sales; most said the sales rate going forward will be   more sensitive to gasoline prices and consumer confidence than it had been   earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District banks contacted in May gave mixed   reports on loan volume outstanding. Some posted increases in consumer and   business loans, but others reported drops in these categories since the last   Beige Book. On balance, total credit extended by banks in the region has been   flat in recent weeks. Although some bankers have had recent increases in loan   demand from small and medium businesses, most said demand for credit from this   sector has been weak. "Loan demand hasn't moved at all," one said, even as   competition among lenders has increased. Most of the banks surveyed in May   indicated that credit quality has been improving, although some said the pace of   improvement has been slow. Looking ahead, the general view among the region's   bankers is that loan demand will move up slightly, at best, in the near   future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity has picked up since the previous Beige Book in most parts of the Third   District, according to residential real estate agents contacted for this report.   Agents continued to note that the sales pace has been relatively stronger for   middle- and low-price homes and weaker for high-price homes. Agents attributed   the improved sales pace to the usual seasonal gain and buyers' concern that   mortgage loan rates are likely to increase in the future. Looking ahead,   residential real estate agents expect sales for this year as a whole to be level   with last year. An agent who remarked that "we are off the bottom, but it's   going to be a slow comeback" expressed a common opinion. Residential agents   generally reported flat to slightly falling house prices for existing homes. New   homebuilders indicated that these lower existing home sales prices further   reduced their customer traffic in May. While they see more committed buyers   among the traffic, overall demand for new homes remains flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial market conditions in the Third District have shown   little change since the previous Beige Book, according to area nonresidential   real estate contacts, although some noted that office vacancy rates have edged   down slightly in some areas. Rents have been steady in most areas, and   concessions remain common. Contacts in commercial real estate reported that   demand for space in Class A office buildings has strengthened relative to Class   B space as local companies relocate upon lease expirations. "Companies are   trading up for higher quality," one contact said. This trend is expected to   continue for the rest of this year, and any reduction in vacancy rates for less   desirable buildings is expected to lag the modest decline in Class A vacancy   rates that commercial real estate agents forecast for the balance of 2011.   Industrial rents have been flat, but some contacts expect them to rise toward   the end of the year as demand for space grows in the absence of new supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District service-sector firms contacted   for this report generally described demand for their services as growing   modestly. Business-service firms noted some increased activity as a result of   both greater usage by current clients and demand from new client companies. An   executive at a business-service firm said, "Our activity in cyclical sectors is   starting to improve." Contacts in the transportation sector reported some recent   easing in the slow, steady growth rate that held for the first four months of   the year. Contacts in engineering and architectural services reported slight   gains in current activity and a somewhat stronger upturn in inquiries. Most of   the service-sector firms polled in May expect growth to continue at around its   recent pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since the previous Beige Book, nearly   half of all manufacturers reported rising factor prices, especially for energy   and commodities, but less than half of those firms are able to pass costs   through to their customers. However, imposition of fuel surcharges by service   firms in the region has increased. Retailers generally indicated that selling   prices have been steady, except for food products and some petroleum-based   products and imports. Retailers noted that consumers continue to favor lower   price-point merchandise, and stores are continuing to alter merchandise   selection to include more of those items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business firms in the region reported mostly steady wages since the last   Beige Book. Reports on nonwage employment costs varied; some firms indicated   that benefits costs, primarily for health insurance, have been stable, but   others indicated that they have had increases ranging up to 10 percent or more   compared with a year ago.
