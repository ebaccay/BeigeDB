      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       July 27, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity strengthened from late May to early July, 

  driven by strong construction- and energy-related activity. Many contacts expressed 

  increased optimism about the economic outlook, noting surprise that activity 

  had strengthened more than they had expected. Manufacturing and service sector 

  activity was up. Retail sales increased. Contacts say real estate investment 

  is very strong. There has been a pickup in all types of construction and real 

  estate activity, leading to a very hot housing market and construction of speculative 

  office space in the Dallas area. The financial sector continued to report solid 

  loan growth and good credit quality. Hot, dry weather hurt agricultural conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy prices were higher than during the last survey period. Strong demand 

  pushed up crude oil prices. Pump prices for gasoline and diesel fuel were also 

  higher. Exceptionally strong demand for diesel raised concern about the refinery 

  system's ability to build inventories for next winter. Natural gas prices have 

  risen along with crude prices, helped by warmer-than-normal temperatures in 

  the South. Despite high temperatures, natural gas inventories remained 12 percent 

  above normal for this time of year. Refinery margins on the Gulf Coast remained 

  very strong throughout June, about the same as May and better than $3.50 per 

  barrel higher than last June. Prices for energy services were sharply higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts expressed concerns about rising freight, fuel and utility costs. 

  Transportation firms said they are passing these costs on to customers as much 

  as possible, and even airlines have been able to raise fares. The ability of 

  manufacturers and retailers to push through price increases remained mixed, 

  however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong demand pushed up prices for cement and most other construction-related 

  materials. Selling prices were lower for scrap steel, nickel, and aluminum. 

  Excess inventory led to price declines for a variety of basic chemical and plastics 

  products, but increased orders and unplanned outages were helping inventories 

  adjust and prices stabilize.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The labor market continued to strengthen, with more reports of hiring, employees 

  being bid away and scattered problems hiring skilled workers. Only a few industries 

  noted any significant wage pressures, notably accounting firms and the energy 

  industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity increased, with very strong demand for most construction-related 

  and energy-related manufactured products. Very strong demand for cement has 

  led to shortages in Texas, and inventories are rapidly depleting--despite manufacturing 

  plants working at capacity. Some producers said they imported cement from abroad 

  to keep up with demand. Producers of clay, brick and glass continued to report 

  robust demand. Demand for fabricated metals has been good and steadily improving, 

  spurred by particularly strong sales for highway and commercial construction. 

  Demand for lumber was above last year's pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in high-tech manufacturing said sales and orders continued to 

  grow at healthy rates since the last survey. Industrial demand for semiconductors 

  has picked up in the past six weeks. Apparel producers say demand has been decreasing 

  due to import competition, which has resulted in another plant closure. Sales 

  of primary metals have cooled from very strong growth earlier this year, and 

  producers continued to report increased import competition. Inventories are 

  higher than desired for some metals but are being pared down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chemical producers continued to struggle through a patch of weak demand. Sales 

  to Asia have slowed. There was some improvement in orders in late June, which 

  contacts said was an early indication that demand was stabilizing. Refinery 

  capacity utilization averaged rates near 98 percent in the District, higher 

  than the U.S. average.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the service sector picked up slightly. Temporary staffing firms 

  said demand edged up over the past six weeks. Transportation firms also reported 

  an increase in demand. Legal firms reported no change in demand. Demand continues 

  to be strong in the accounting sector, keeping pace with last year's strong 

  growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that sales growth has been stronger than expected, and early 

  signals suggest a healthy back-to-school season. Contacts thought high oil and 

  gasoline prices would restrain growth, but reported that consumers have kept 

  spending, and there has been no deterioration in bad debt portfolios. Auto dealers 

  also reported a pick up in sales growth. Contacts noted some uncertainty because 

  they said sales were being stimulated by manufacturer price reductions, and 

  the underlying market is not strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts say real estate investment is extremely high in part because the District's 

  competitively-priced markets are attracting investment capital from more expensive 

  coastal markets. Construction of new homes picked up over the past six weeks. 

  Demand is strong, and sales are ahead of this time last year. With few regulatory 

  or land development constraints, the supply of new homes has been sufficient 

  to meet demand, and prices are not increasing faster than inflation. Existing 

  home sales in major metropolitan areas remained above last year's record levels, 

  but sales growth was less robust than earlier this year and some contacts expressed 

  concerns about rising inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for apartments rose over the past six weeks. Contacts noted an upturn 

  in market conditions with occupancies tightening in Dallas and Austin, and rents 

  rising modestly. Apartment construction continued to be at high levels in Dallas, Houston and 

  San Antonio, and developers remained optimistic that conditions will continue 

  to improve. Several high-end condo and town-home projects are slated to break 

  ground in Dallas, and contacts noted that most are at least 60 to 70 percent 

  pre-leased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office markets also continued to improve. Occupancy rates increased, although 

  they are still low in comparison with other parts of the country. Contacts say 

  rents are "firm" to "rising." There is limited office construction activity 

  in Houston and Austin, but speculative space is being developed in the Dallas 

  area. Industrial activity is also picking up, especially near the Port of Houston. 

  Hotel markets are "hot."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Loan growth remained solid, according to contacts, who said 

  that there has been a pickup in consumer auto loans as a result of an increase 

  in purchase incentives. Credit quality was still good. The banking environment 

  is very competitive, they said, particularly for large, commercial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drilling activity continued to expand. The rig count increased, and contacts 

  say the outlook for future drilling activity has picked up. Oil service companies 

  reported extremely strong demand, limited capacity, and strong pricing power. 

  Service firms say they are turning down work and have expressed more willingness 

  to expand capacity, given current pricing and the potential durability of this 

  drilling cycle. Expanding manufacturing capacity for oil field equipment poses 

  few barriers, but finding qualified engineers and training crews is difficult 

  and time consuming. Technical skills will increasingly have to be found abroad, 

  they say.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dry weather has reduced yields and increased the cost of production. Irrigated 

  land crops remained in fair condition but the outlook for dry land crop yields 

  worsened. Range and pasture conditions also deteriorated substantially since 

  the last report, and hay production has been very limited. Corn producers expressed 

  concern about aflatoxin.
