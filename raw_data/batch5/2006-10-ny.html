      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District has shown signs of strengthening since the last report, 
  with few signs of increased price pressures. Labor markets have been steady 
  to stronger, according to firms in manufacturing and most service industries. 
  Manufacturers report steady growth in activity since the last report, along 
  with less widespread increases in input prices. Retailers indicate that sales 
  picked up in September, while prices remained flat. Tourism activity remained 
  robust in New York City, with both hotels and Broadway theaters reporting double-digit 
  increases in prices over the past year. Consumer confidence in the region rose 
  to a five-month high in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing markets have been mixed since the last report: New York City's 
  co-op and condo market has remained fairly strong, and the rental market has 
  tightened further; however, housing markets in New Jersey and upstate New York 
  show continued weakness. Commercial real estate markets across the New York 
  City metro area generally strengthened in the third quarter, for both office 
  and industrial space. Finally, bankers again report weakening in loan demand--particularly 
  for home mortgages--somewhat tighter credit standards in the commercial 
  sector, and little change in delinquency rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that sales were on or above plan in September, and noticeably 
  stronger than in August. Same-store sales gains ranged from 2 percent to more 
  than 10 percent compared with a year ago. Retail contacts note that premium 
  merchandise lines have continued to sell relatively well. Furniture and other 
  home goods continued to lag, while sales of apparel, accessories and jewelry 
  have been robust. Retailers report that selling prices remain steady and that 
  inventories are at favorable levels. Looking ahead to the upcoming holiday season, 
  retailers generally expect same-store sales to be up in the range of 2 to 5 
  percent from comparable 2005 levels. Contacts report that they plan to hire 
  about the same number of holiday-season workers as in 2005, though most of the 
  increased staffing capacity is again expected to come from extending hours of 
  current part-time workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity has been fairly steady at a high level since the last report. 
  The occupancy rate at Manhattan hotels edged up to 87 percent in August, slightly 
  higher than a year earlier, while room rates climbed more than 10 percent from 
  comparable 2005 levels. Broadway theaters report mixed results for September: 
  attendance was down roughly 3 percent from a year earlier, but total revenue 
  jumped 11 percent, reflecting sharply higher admission prices. Based on the 
  Conference Board's survey of Middle Atlantic (New York, New Jersey and 
  Pennsylvania) residents, consumer confidence, which had drifted down in July 
  and August, jumped to a 5-month high in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The region's housing market has shown mixed results since the last report, 
  with further weakening noted in northern New Jersey and upstate New York, but 
  signs of underlying strength reported in New York City. New Jersey homebuilders 
  report that the housing market has continued to slacken since the last report: 
  both buyer traffic and sales activity have declined substantially, the inventory 
  of homes on the market has risen substantially, and prices have continued to 
  slip. One New Jersey contact also notes pronounced weakening in the sub-contracting 
  business, attributing much of the recent weakening in home remodeling to reduced 
  home equity. Similarly, real estate firms in western New York State report that 
  both sales and prices were down moderately in August, compared with a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, Manhattan's co-op and condo market showed signs of resilience 
  in the third quarter. Based on quarterly data from a leading appraisal firm, 
  both the number of apartments sold and the price per square foot were up roughly 
  6 percent from a year earlier, despite a sharply higher inventory of available 
  units. Manhattan's rental market has tightened further since the last 
  report, particularly at the high end, reflecting a dearth of large rental units 
  on the market at the end of the third quarter; a major real estate firm estimates 
  that rents on studio and one bedroom apartments are up 5 to 10 percent from 
  a year earlier, while rents on larger units are up 10 to 15 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets across the New York City area showed further 
  signs of tightening in the third quarter. In Manhattan, office vacancy rates 
  continued to edge down, reaching their lowest levels since early 2001, while 
  asking rents accelerated, rising more than 10 percent from a year earlier. One 
  industry contact notes that large blocks of space have become nearly impossible 
  to find in Midtown Manhattan. In the nearby suburban markets, vacancy rates 
  were also down from a year earlier and at or near cyclical lows, though rents 
  increased more moderately. The industrial market has been mixed but, on balance, 
  stronger in the third quarter: vacancy rates declined to cyclical lows in Long 
  Island, Westchester and Fairfield Counties, but continued to rise in northern 
  New Jersey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing contacts report steady improvement in business conditions since 
  the last report, along with further abatement in price pressures. Manufacturers 
  also indicate increased employment, along with higher levels of capital spending 
  in the months ahead. Surveys of purchasing managers in the Buffalo, Rochester 
  and New York City areas also indicate some lessening in price pressures in September, 
  but signal some slowing in manufacturing activity. Outside of manufacturing, 
  contacts in most industries report little change in overall business conditions, 
  along with steady or rising employment levels; however, contacts in the publishing 
  industry note some weakening in employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts at small to medium-sized banks in the 2nd District report decreased 
  demand for all types of loans since the last report--particularly residential 
  mortgages, for which more than two-thirds of bankers reported decreases. Respondents 
  also continue to report widespread declines in refinancing activity. Bankers 
  report tightened credit standards for commercial loans and mortgages, while 
  standards remained unchanged for the consumer and residential mortgage categories. 
  Bankers report little change in loan rates overall, with somewhat higher rates 
  on consumer credit and commercial and industrial loans but somewhat lower rates 
  on home mortgages. Delinquency rates are again reported to be little changed 
  across all categories.
