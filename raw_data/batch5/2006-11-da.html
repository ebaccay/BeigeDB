      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In October and the first half of November, the Eleventh District economy continued 
  to decelerate from high levels. While there remains strength in the manufacturing, 
  construction, finance and service sectors, there are also areas of softness. 
  Many industries reported increased caution about the outlook. Energy activity 
  was strong overall, but there was still little change in the rig count. Retail 
  sales were weaker than expected. Manufacturing activity remained strong to supply 
  the energy industry but continued to report slowing sales to residential building. 
  Service sector activity was also mixed, with a dip in demand for temporary workers. 
  Nonresidential building is strong, but home sales and home building weakened 
  further. Financial service firms reported softer consumer lending, but credit 
  quality is healthy and commercial lending is good. Agricultural conditions improved 
  over the past six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy prices have stabilized at relatively high levels. West Texas Intermediate 
  crude oil prices have floated between $57 and $61 in recent weeks. U.S. demand 
  for crude oil has risen as refiners return from seasonal maintenance, but crude 
  oil inventories remain high. Gasoline prices at the pump fell sharply, boosting 
  gasoline consumption and reducing inventories. Demand for heating oil and diesel 
  has been strong, but inventories have built up with mild weather, while pump 
  prices have stayed near $2.50 per gallon as the result of reduced sulfur requirements. 
  Natural gas prices strengthened seasonally during the period, from $6 to $8 
  per million Btu at Henry Hub. Inventories are at very high levels and a mild 
  winter is expected, which has some contacts raising the possibility that natural 
  gas prices might take a downward bounce.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other prices were mixed. Overall home prices are unchanged, but prices have 
  declined in some metropolitan areas, particularly in Dallas and Fort Worth. 
  Building costs to supply nonresidential construction are unchanged, but prices 
  are lower for products supplying home building. Paper prices were unchanged, 
  but prices of corrugated boxes were lower. Accounting firms raised fees to cover 
  rising salaries. Prices for corn, grain sorghum and wheat were up sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The labor market remains very tight, and wages were rising in many industries. 
  Workers shortages were reported by service, manufacturing, finance and energy 
  firms. A lack of labor is a capacity constraint for some firms and, in some 
  areas, companies have resorted to using billboards in an attempt to attract 
  workers. While the shortage extends to many types of skilled and semi-skilled 
  workers, of particular note in this survey were reports of difficulty finding 
  engineers, electricians, high-tech technicians, certified mechanics and accountants. 
  Some firms have reached out to community colleges in an attempt to boost the 
  supply of qualified workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the labor market remains tight, softening sales have led some manufacturers 
  to slow hiring as a precaution. The shortage of qualified truck drivers seems 
  to have eased some.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to cool. Demand remained strong for refining, 
  some chemicals, and for products to supply commercial construction and oil and 
  gas drilling. However, sales to homebuilders slowed further, pushing up inventories 
  for some products and causing some firms to reduce production. Food producers 
  report an increase in demand. Sales of paper products increased slightly, but 
  demand for corrugated boxes softened some. High-tech manufacturers reported 
  generally good growth in production and orders, although there were a few firms 
  that reported some recent softening in orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gulf Coast refineries are now operating at high levels. The return from maintenance 
  was delayed in some cases by labor and construction shortages or by relatively 
  weak margins that offered less incentive to produce. Refining margins have been 
  strong by historical standards, but are only half to one-third of the high margins 
  enjoyed over the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemicals were mixed. Ethylene production was affected by a series of 
  planned and unplanned outages that have supported prices and kept profit margins 
  high. There was a sharp seasonal decline in demand for polyethylene, and the 
  decline in homebuilding has hurt demand for PVC pipe. In contrast, demand for 
  synthetic rubber is very strong. Prices are high, and margins are excellent. 
  Demand for isobutylene, used in many consumer products, weakened in September 
  and October but returned strongly and has been pushing capacity limits in early 
  November.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Temporary staffing firms say activity slowed earlier than expected and the volume 
  of new orders was below last year levels. The slowdown was concentrated in manufacturing; 
  however, contacts noted that they had seen a fall off in demand in other industries 
  as well. Demand for legal services held steady over the past month but activity 
  was up compared with a year ago. Accounting firms saw no change in activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shipping firms report good demand but anticipate slower growth in coming months. 
  Cargo volumes remained flat and continued to be buoyed by domestic demand for 
  nondurable goods. Container trade activity rose sharply, with growth partly 
  coming from an increase in steel imports. Railroads indicated no change in overall 
  volumes but noted that shipments of lumber, wood and other building products 
  were down substantially over the past month. Trucking firms said demand softened 
  further which, according to contacts, helped ease the shortage of truck drivers 
  in the industry. Airlines report continued good demand overall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales growth has been weaker than expected. Some contacts had expected 
  a greater pick up in sales following the drop in gasoline prices. Sales continue 
  to be weakest to lower income customers who were more affected by high energy 
  costs. Sales were weakest for home items, particularly for furniture. Respondents 
  have become more cautious about the outlook for holiday sales, which they say 
  will be very competitive. Inventories are in good shape, although retailers 
  say they are watching them closely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for autos remains soft, although lower gasoline prices have resuscitated 
  sales of some domestic vehicles. There were reports of higher than desired inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District home sales continued to slow, but activity has been mixed. Sales are 
  still strong in some areas, such as Houston, but sales and traffic are down 
  significantly in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Cancellations have edged up, especially 
  for lower priced homes. Homebuilders and real estate agents noted increased 
  uncertainty and uneasiness among buyers that they blamed partly on reports of 
  weakness in other parts of the country. Builders have pulled back on starts 
  and increased buyer incentives in an attempt to manage rising inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment demand remained solid, and rents are rising. Despite the departure 
  of Katrina evacuees, apartment occupancies are at or above 90 percent in most 
  Texas metros. Multifamily construction activity was still strong, but contacts 
  said a shortage of building sites and high construction costs have held back 
  construction of Dallas-area apartments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for office space remains strong, and rents continue to increase. Contacts 
  say investor interest remains high. Occupancy rates are edging up--and in Austin 
  have reached a five-year high. A Houston respondent said rents were up dramatically 
  in some areas. Office construction continues in all major metros. Dallas contacts 
  remain optimistic that demand will be sufficient to absorb the increased volume 
  of speculative projects currently under construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer lending continued to slow for all types of products, including mortgages, 
  credit cards, personal and auto loans. Credit quality is still good, and mortgage 
  delinquencies do not appear to be a problem for District lenders. Commercial 
  lending is very good, although contacts expect activity to slow. Competition 
  for experienced and talented lenders continues to be intense.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity remained generally strong, but the rig counts continued to be 
  mostly unchanged in the United States and Texas. Oil service companies are working 
  through an extensive backlog of orders, and there are still shortages of people 
  and equipment. Day rates continue to rise but more slowly than earlier in the 
  year. International activity continued to grow strongly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts are cautious about weak natural gas prices and rising drilling costs, 
  and say that drilling for natural gas in high cost areas is the most vulnerable. 
  Firms have completed extensive hiring and training of new employees and made 
  large commitments to internal capital expansion and R&amp;D. Companies say they 
  can shift crews and equipment across basins or around the world, wherever backlogs 
  continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rains boosted cattle grazing conditions, and many producers are optimistic 
  they will get a good cutting of hay before the first freeze. Still, supplemental 
  feeding of herds continues in the driest regions, and rapidly rising feed costs--particularly 
  for corn--have substantially lowered calf prices. Rain has helped wheat and 
  oat crops get off to a good start, but were too late for cotton, pecan, peanut, 
  soybean and sorghum. Harvest of these crops is underway, and yields are better 
  than expected but below last year's levels.
