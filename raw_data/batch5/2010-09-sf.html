      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 8, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to expand modestly during   the reporting period of mid-July through the end of August. Upward pressures on   prices and wages were quite limited. Sales of retail items and services were   mixed but grew on balance. District manufacturing activity firmed a bit further,   with continued strength evident for manufacturers of information technology   products. Agricultural producers reported robust sales, and demand strengthened   further for energy resources. Activity in District housing markets continued to   slide, while demand for commercial real estate remained weak. Contacts from   financial institutions reported slight declines in lending activity but further   improvements in credit quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Upward price pressures remained very   limited on net during the reporting period. Commodity prices in general were   largely stable, with the exception of rising grain prices and pronounced   short-term volatility in oil prices. Excess capacity and extensive competition   continued to hold down final prices for most retail items and service   categories. The primary exception was health care, for which prices continued to   rise. Looking forward, contacts in general anticipate that prices for their   products will change little over the balance of 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upward wage pressures were largely absent, as high unemployment and limited   demand for new employees held down compensation gains in most regions and   sectors. Contacts continued to report significant increases in the costs of   employee benefits, most notably for health insurance. Reports indicated that   most businesses remain cautious in their approach to hiring and continue to rely   on improved productivity rather than increased employment as a means to expand   output.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales were mixed.   Traditional department stores and discount retail chains alike reported further   sales increases for small household items, with generally balanced inventories   noted. By contrast, sellers of major appliances and furniture reported a   slowdown and "difficult" conditions in July and August. Grocers reported largely   flat sales and noted an ongoing shift towards less-expensive generic labels.   Sales of new domestic and imported automobiles improved near the beginning of   the reporting period but slowed subsequently. Used vehicle sales improved   marginally, while dealers faced a limited supply that kept inventories   tight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for services improved modestly on balance but remained lackluster   overall. Demand for professional, media, and entertainment services was mixed   across sectors but appeared to be largely stable at low levels on net. Providers   of energy services reported stronger demand for industrial use, with the   exception of wood products. Contacts from around the District noted increased   business travel and tourism activity, as reflected in higher visitor volumes,   hotel occupancy rates, and airline passenger miles, although visitor spending   remained weak. Providers of health-care services reported that demand slipped   somewhat, which they attributed in part to rising postponements or cancellations   of elective procedures and routine tests by individuals who lack health   insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity generally   continued to grow during the reporting period of mid-July through the end of   August. Demand strengthened further for manufacturers of semiconductors and   other technology products, with high levels of capacity utilization and balanced   inventories noted. While new orders remained limited for makers of commercial   aircraft and parts, extensive order backlogs kept production rates near capacity   limits. Activity at petroleum refineries rose in response to increased demand,   although inventories remained at elevated levels. Food manufacturers reported   further growth in sales. By contrast, demand for wood products deteriorated,   reportedly as a result of a slowdown in new home construction as well as   residential repair and remodeling activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand   remained strong for agricultural products and improved further for natural   resources used for energy production. Orders and final sales continued to be   robust for assorted crops and livestock products. Contacts generally noted   stable input costs and supply conditions, although unseasonably cool weather in   parts of California compressed the growing seasons for some crops. Oil   extraction activity expanded further as a result of recent increases in global   demand, and strong demand for natural gas caused the number of rigs in service   to rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Housing demand in the   District weakened somewhat from the previous reporting period, while demand for   commercial real estate remained largely stable at depressed levels. The pace of   home sales continued to be mixed across areas but fell on balance, and contacts   noted that the slowdown in home sales has placed renewed downward pressure on   new home construction. Despite sluggish sales activity, home prices edged up   further in some parts of the District. Demand for commercial real estate   remained at very low levels, as reflected in elevated vacancy rates and subdued   leasing activity for office and industrial space in many parts of the District.   However, one contact reported further increases in the sales prices of selected   commercial properties in some areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District banking contacts reported   that loan demand slipped somewhat. Commercial and industrial loan volumes waned   a bit, reportedly restrained by businesses' cautious attitudes towards capital   spending stemming from their uncertainty about the future economic environment.   While a majority of respondents across all industries indicated that they   anticipate no change in the pace of economic growth in their respective industry   or area in the second half of the year compared with the first, most of those   who do expect a change foresee a slowdown as opposed to a pickup. Consumer loan   demand also remained weak overall. By contrast, venture capital financing   continued to be a bright spot, with contacts noting increased levels of funding,   as well has heightened IPO activity. Although contacts noted slight improvements   in overall credit quality, lending standards stayed relatively restrictive for   business and consumer lending.
