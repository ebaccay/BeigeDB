      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 13, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded moderately during the   reporting period of late February into the beginning of April. Price increases   for final goods and services remained modest overall despite gains for selected   commodities, and upward wage pressures were limited as well. Sales of retail   items and demand for business and consumer services continued to expand.   Manufacturing activity in the District grew further. Sales of agricultural   products were robust, and demand edged up for natural resource products. Demand   for residential and nonresidential real estate remained subdued. Contacts from   financial institutions reported small but widespread increases in loan   demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price inflation for final goods and   services was modest during the reporting period. Although prices remained   elevated for an assortment of raw materials and commodities and rose further for   some, such as oil, the pass-through to final prices was quite limited, with the   noteworthy exceptions of food and gasoline. For most other retail goods and   services, prices continued to be held down by subdued demand and vigorous   competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in most sectors reported that upward wage pressures remained weak.   High unemployment and limited hiring kept compensation gains at low levels in   most regions and sectors, although significant upward wage pressures were noted   for workers with advanced skills in technology fields. Looking ahead to the next   six months, the reports indicated that wage gains are likely to pick up somewhat   as more businesses eliminate wage freezes established during the downturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales continued to   improve overall. Traditional department stores and discount retail chains alike   reported further increases in sales. Similarly, sales revenues rose for grocers;   contacts attributed the gains in part to higher food prices in addition to   increased sales volumes. Despite some indications of rising appetites for   discretionary spending, consumers remained largely focused on necessities and   lower-priced options across a wide spectrum of products. Retailers of major   appliances and furniture reported that activity remained subdued. Demand for new   automobiles strengthened further, propelled partly by manufacturers' rebates and   improved availability of credit. Looking forward, some retail contacts expressed   concern that elevated gasoline prices will reduce sales of other items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business and consumer services rose further. Activity expanded   among providers of transportation services, with gains in cargo traffic reported   for major District seaports. Providers of professional services, such as law and   accounting, reported modest demand growth. Suppliers of energy services noted   further increases in deliveries to households and businesses, and sales   continued to grow for providers of technology services. Contacts from several   parts of the District reported further growth in business travel and tourism   activity, although Japanese tourist visits to Hawaii fell significantly   following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Demand fell slightly for   providers of health-care services, as some patients reportedly have been   forgoing elective procedures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District   posted further gains during the reporting period of late February into the   beginning of April. Makers of commercial aircraft and parts reported modest   ongoing growth in new orders, attributed in part to increased demand from   airline companies for aircraft with greater fuel efficiency. For manufacturers   of semiconductors and other technology products, demand continued to grow, with   high levels of capacity utilization and balanced inventories noted. Sales rose   further for metal fabricators, although contacts reported minor production   challenges arising from constrained supplies of raw materials. Demand remained   especially weak for manufacturers of wood products, with the exception of firms   in the pulp and paper segment of the industry, which saw increases in orders and   output. Petroleum refiners reported slight gains in gasoline sales volumes   compared with twelve months earlier, despite the demand constraints arising from   higher prices and poor weather, and capacity utilization rates were up   accordingly. Demand continued to grow for food manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production   activity and sales were robust for agricultural products and grew further for   metals and natural resources used for energy production. Final sales and orders   for most agricultural products, including livestock and a wide variety of crops,   continued to expand. As a result, contacts noted rising prices and constrained   availability for selected inputs, including fertilizer, seeds, and machinery   such as tractors. District mining activity expanded, as higher prices for   assorted metals have spurred investments in new capacity. Demand for crude oil   was slightly above its level from twelve months earlier, while extraction   activity for natural gas expanded, increasing supply and causing the price to   decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in District   residential and nonresidential real estate markets remained at very low levels   overall, albeit with slight improvement noted in some market segments and areas.   The sales pace for new and existing homes was mixed across the District but   remained very weak overall, and contacts again noted that the limited   availability of nonconforming "jumbo" loans held back sales of higher-priced   homes in some areas. In response to sluggish sales, new home construction stayed   quite subdued. However, demand for residential rental space grew further in some   areas, and reports noted modest increases in the construction of apartment   buildings. Demand remained weak overall in commercial real estate markets, as   vacancy rates for office and industrial space remained elevated throughout the   District. However, further gains in leasing activity were noted for some major   markets in the District, particularly in technology-intensive portions of the   San Francisco Bay Area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was up compared with the prior reporting period. Demand for   commercial and industrial loans rose perceptibly, as businesses in a variety of   sectors reportedly showed increased interest in expansionary capital spending.   Demand for consumer credit also grew slightly. The reports indicated that   competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and   medium-sized businesses has intensified, placing downward pressure on rates and   fees. Overall, however, lending standards remained somewhat restrictive for most   types of consumer and business loans. Venture capital financing activity and   investor interest continued to grow, particularly for companies focused on   Internet and wireless applications and digital media.
