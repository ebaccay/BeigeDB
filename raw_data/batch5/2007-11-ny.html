      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has continued to expand since  the last report, though at a somewhat more subdued pace than in recent months.  The labor market has remained strong in  October and early November.  Manufacturers  report ongoing expansion in activity in early November, with increased price  pressures.  In contrast,  non-manufacturers report some weakening.   But respondents in both sectors express less optimism about the future  business outlook than in recent months.  Retailers  show mixed sales results for October and some have scaled back expectations for  the holiday shopping season.  Tourism  activity in New York City is said to have remained strong,  despite a mid-November strike shutting most Broadway theaters.  Housing markets remain mixed, with Manhattan's co-op and condo market showing  continued resilience but single-family housing markets across New York State increasingly soft.  Manhattan's office market, though still fairly  tight, eased off a bit in October.   Finally, bankers report weakening loan demand in all categories but  particularly for home mortgages; they also report tightened credit standards on  commercial loans and mortgages, and moderate increases in delinquency rates  across all categories, most notably on residential mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report mixed sales results for October, with  unseasonably mild weather hampering purchases of winter clothing, though some  contacts express concern that the weakness is more than just  weather-related.  A trade survey  conducted in October indicates that New York State retailers, on balance, expect  holiday season sales to be higher than in 2006.   However, two major chains have scaled back their expectations for the  holiday shopping season and now anticipate that sales will be flat to  down.  Stores in New York City generally continued to out-perform those  elsewhere in the region, which some contacts attribute to tourism.  Sales of home goods, though still generally  described as soft, did show some signs of picking up since the last  report.  Retail inventories were  generally described to be in good shape, though one large chain reports some  overhang; selling prices were characterized as stable, though promotions have  been somewhat steeper than last year; more discounting is anticipated in  advance of and during the upcoming holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity in New York City has been steady at a high level,  despite a Broadway theater strike.  Manhattan hotels report that occupancy  rates exceeded 90 percent in October, little changed from last year, while room  rates are reported to be up by 16 percent.   Broadway theaters report  that attendance and revenues were at high levels in October and early November  but down a bit from a year ago.  A strike  starting November 10 shut most Broadway theaters but there is, thus far, no  sign of deleterious effects on tourism overall.   Consumer confidence has waned since the last report.  The Conference Board's survey of Middle  Atlantic residents indicates a pullback in confidence in October, reversing an  increase in September.  Similarly, Siena College's survey of New York State residents shows confidence falling  in October, led by a particularly steep decline in upstate New York.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New York City's commercial real estate market  continued to be fairly tight in October, though less so than in recent  months.  Manhattan's office vacancy rate, which had  been steady near a cyclical low at the end of September, rose fairly sharply in  October--from 6.8 percent to 7.6 percent--with most of the increase among non-prime,  as opposed to Class A, properties.   Asking rents, however, continued to rise, though at a slower pace; still  rents are up roughly 30 percent from the same time last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manhattan's co-op and condo market showed  continued resilience in October and early November, with prices continuing to  run modestly above year-ago levels and sales volume picking up moderately  compared with the third quarter.  The  inventory of units on the market is reported to be down by roughly a third from  comparable 2006 levels.  Long Island's market is reported to remain  somewhat sluggish, though demand remains strong in the pricier Hamptons area.  Reports from Realtors across New York State indicate continued weakness in the  market for single-family homes, with prices down 7 percent from a year ago and  unit sales down nearly 20 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major New York City employment agency, reports that  hiring activity has picked up somewhat in early November--contrary to typical  seasonal slowing--following some pullback in September and October.  Demand for workers remains fairly strong in  the legal industry; financial-industry hiring has picked up somewhat as well,  though from smaller firms, not the major institutions.  Scattered layoffs on Wall Street have are  said to have created only a slight increase in the supply of available workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      New York State manufacturers report steady  improvement in business conditions in early November; however, contacts express  considerably less optimism about the six month outlook than in recent  months.  Firms report increasingly  widespread escalation in both current and expected input prices in early  November.  Overall, a growing proportion  of non-manufacturing firms in the District report some weakening in general  business activity as of early November, and express a good deal less optimism  about the general outlook; however, considerably more firms continue to report  rising than falling employment at their firms, and the same is true with  respect to expected changes in the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small- to medium-sized banks report  weakening demand for all types of loans, but most widely in the residential  mortgage category, where more than half of those contacted report declines in  demand.  Bankers also report ongoing decreases  in refinancing activity.  Respondents  indicate tightening credit standards, most notably in the commercial mortgage  category.  No bankers reported eased  standards in any loan category.  For all  types of loans, however, the majority of respondents (two-thirds or more) report  no change in standards.  Bankers report a  decline in the spreads of loan rates over cost of funds for all types of loans--again,  most noticeably in the commercial mortgage category.  Reports on delinquencies were split amongst  the different loan types.  Bankers  indicated a slight increase in delinquencies, on balance, for consumer and  commercial and industrial loans, and a somewhat more pronounced rise in  delinquencies in both the commercial and residential mortgage categories.
