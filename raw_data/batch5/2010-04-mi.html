      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew moderately since the last report. Consumer   spending, tourism, residential real estate and construction, services,   manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture saw increases. Commercial real   estate was flat at low levels, and construction activity was slow. Labor markets   remained weak, but some signs of hiring were noted. Overall compensation levels   were flat, and price increases were moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased   modestly. A Minneapolis-St. Paul area mall noted that February same-store sales   were up 7 percent compared with a year ago; traffic levels were up even more. A   major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in February were   up about 2 percent compared with a year earlier. Recent retail activity in Great   Falls, Mont., has picked up modestly; Canadian traffic was solid. A   Minnesota-based restaurant and bar chain noted that March sales and guest counts   were up over 5 percent compared with a year ago, while another Minnesota-based   restaurant chain reported that March sales were down 2 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicle sales picked up in March compared with a year ago when sales were   substantially down. A number of dealerships in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area   reported that sales were up over 40 percent in March compared with a year ago;   strong incentives by automakers helped boost sales. Recent vehicle sales have   been steady in North Dakota, according to a representative of an auto dealers   association.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall travel and tourism activity was up slightly. A ski resort in northern   Minnesota noted that February and March ski lift sales and lodging were higher   than a year ago. A Minnesota-based travel agency noted that corporate travel   during February and March was up slightly from a year ago. Winter tourism   activity was about even with a year ago in Montana, but tourism-based businesses   noted an uptick in February and March, according to an official. In northwestern   Wisconsin, excellent snow conditions boosted snowmobiling and cross-country   skiing in February; warm weather in March brought an early end to snow sports,   but tourism businesses are optimistic for the summer season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction was   weak. February nonresidential permits in Sioux Falls, S.D., were substantially   lower than a year earlier. A producer of commercial construction materials said   demand has been slackening. However, several hotel and medical developments are   in progress in Great Falls, Mont.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meanwhile, residential construction showed signs of strengthening. March home   building permits for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area more than doubled in value   from the same month a year earlier--their highest level since 2007--primarily   due to gains in the multifamily sector. In contrast, February residential   permits in Sioux Falls decreased 21 percent from a year earlier. Construction   activity in western Montana continues to be very slow, according to developers   there.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate was flat at low levels. A commercial real estate   broker in Fargo, N.D., said vacancy rates were down slightly for office   properties, but the industrial segment was weaker. A Minnesota commercial broker   said rents there were at their lowest levels since 1990.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate continued to rebound. Closed sales in late March were   11 percent higher than a year earlier in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and sales prices   increased. Sales also picked up in western Montana, due in part to big   reductions in asking prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall activity increased slightly in the   professional business services sector since the last report. Contacts from   information technology and Web development firms noted solid orders. A law firm   that specializes in debt collections and another that specializes in   bankruptcies were expanding due to strong demand. However, contacts from other   law firms indicated that new business was unchanged. Architects indicated flat   activity at low levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output was up since the last   report. A March survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,   Neb.) showed that manufacturing activity increased significantly in Minnesota   and South Dakota and was flat in North Dakota. A small Minnesota transmitter   maker plans to expand into a larger facility. In North Dakota, a wind energy   component manufacturer plans to build a plant.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased since the last report. Late-March oil exploration increased   significantly from early February. A major electrical utility recently announced   plans for a large-scale wind energy farm in western Minnesota. Several sources   noted solid prices and demand for iron ore, as production in February increased   slightly from January levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural activity increased. The calving   season was progressing very well due to the mild end to winter across most of   the District. Cattle producers were optimistic, as they expected a continued   uptick in output prices. District farmers planned to plant 3 percent more   soybean acres, 4 percent fewer wheat acres and about the same number of corn   acres as last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Meanwhile,   producers of organic agricultural products noted a decrease in demand, and dairy   producers were concerned about softening in output prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained weak,   but some signs of hiring were noted. A tractor supply store in eastern Montana   reported receiving more than 30 applications for every job opening. Employers in   the Sioux Falls area noted a relatively large number of applications for   seasonal jobs. Also in South Dakota, 35 workers were laid off at a technology   firm, and about 25 workers were laid off at a business outsourcing company. A   North Dakota manufacturer announced plans to lay off 60 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, two employment placement firms in Minnesota reported an increase   in hiring for some entry level positions and an increased interest in executive   placement services. Also in Minnesota, a bank announced intentions to hire more   wealth management advisors, a wind energy project just under way will create 150   jobs and an auto dealer will hire 15 salespeople.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall wages were flat, as a number of contacts noted that wages and   salaries at their companies were level with a year earlier. The University of   Minnesota's faculty senate recently approved a measure to cut pay temporarily   for most University employees by about 1 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases were moderate. Minnesota gasoline prices at the end of March   were up slightly from the end of February. However, copper and nickel prices   increased since the last report, as well as some prices for lumber and steel   products.
