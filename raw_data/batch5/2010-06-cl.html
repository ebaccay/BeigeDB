      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy in the Fourth District showed further signs of strengthening   during the past eight weeks. Manufacturers reported that the rise in production   which began late last year continued, although orders remain below pre-recession   levels. Contacts in non-residential construction noted some signs of renewed   growth, while residential builders cited only a modest uptick in activity. Sales   figures from auto dealers showed a moderate improvement, whereas District   retailers saw their rate of sales growth slow. Energy production was mixed, and   reports indicate a better-than-expected rise in freight transport volume. Demand   by businesses and consumers for new loans remains weak, while some bankers   commented that the lending environment is starting to grow more competitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      There was a broad-based pickup in employment in the manufacturing sector,   where businesses are recalling workers and increasing production hours.   Staffing-firm representatives had mixed reports on the number of new job   openings, with opportunities concentrated in the healthcare field. Wage   pressures continue to be contained. Apart from rising prices for steel and   lumber, raw materials and product pricing was generally stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District factories generally   show that production levels continued to increase during the past eight weeks   and on a year-over-year basis, though by varying amounts. Some respondents   attributed recent increases to seasonal factors. Most manufacturers are   confident about near-term prospects and expect their sales to remain on a   moderate upward trend. However, they do not expect a strong rebound to   pre-recession levels this year, and a few anticipate a leveling off in new   orders. Steel shipments remain on the upswing, with half of our contacts   characterizing volume as better than expected. Rising volume is being driven by   autos, energy, and construction equipment. Although some underlying uncertainty   remains, there is a sense that the current level of business activity is   sustainable, at least through the third quarter. District auto production was   stable in April on a month-over-month basis, while year-over-year it rose   substantially for both domestic and foreign nameplates.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large majority of our contacts told us that their inventories are now well   balanced, reflecting increased demand. Capacity utilization rates continue to   improve, with a few reports indicating that it is now moving toward historical   norms. Capital outlays remain at relatively low levels, and business owners are   approaching spending decisions with caution. However, the number of respondents   who plan on additional spending during the second half of 2010 has increased   substantially since our last report. Several steel producers and service center   representatives reported that they are beginning to see signs of a leveling off   in steel prices. Nonetheless, a few manufacturers are contemplating, or have   already put in place, higher product prices that reflect the rise in the cost of   steel. Even though new hiring is limited, we heard numerous reports of recalling   laid-off workers and increasing work hours. Wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, new home sales improved slightly   during the past eight weeks and on a year-over-year basis. Our contacts tell us   that the move-up and third-time home-buyer categories are gaining momentum,   while activity by entry-level buyers is lessening. Homebuilders are not   expecting a turnaround in the housing market this year, and they are concerned   about the effect of foreclosures and real estate owned properties on housing   inventories. Builders also reported that their current spec inventory is in line   with market demand. Little change was noted in the list prices of new homes, and   reports indicate an overall rise in construction material costs, especially for   lumber. Skeleton crews remain the norm for general contractors and   subcontractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in non-residential construction continues to show signs of a pickup.   Inquiries have improved, and many contractors said that their backlogs are   higher than year-ago levels. Most projects currently under-way fall within the   industrial and government-funded infrastructure categories. The glut in retail   space shows no signs of diminishing. Almost all of our contacts are fairly   optimistic in their outlook for the remainder of the year. Increased costs for   construction materials were limited to steel and lumber. General contractors   reported a small amount of seasonal and permanent hiring. While opportunities   for subcontractors are beginning to improve, many of them are still struggling   and taking on projects at cost.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, retail sales were stable or   down slightly during April on a month-over-month basis and showed some   improvement from year-ago levels. Although consumers continue to focus on buying   necessities, retailers noted that they see a pickup in purchases of   discretionary items, especially for those used in the home. Looking forward,   retailers are cautiously optimistic, and most expect sales to show a slight   improvement going into the third quarter. Vendor and store pricing has been   relatively stable. Auto dealers saw new vehicle sales increase from mid-April   through mid-May, when compared with the previous 30-day period, and on a   year-over-year basis. Reported increases varied widely. Used vehicle purchases   were characterized as doing well. Overall, dealers are cautiously optimistic and   expect slow, steady sales growth through the summer months. Reports on vehicle   inventories were mixed. Half of our contacts said they need more cars on their   lots, while others noted that inventories are in line with sales. Contacts also   said that buyers are finding it easier to obtain financing from banks, credit   unions, and captive financing companies. Reports show little change in staffing   levels at retailers or auto dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The market for business lending remains soft,   with most bankers reporting that demand for new loans is steady to down   slightly. Interest rates were stable, although a few of our respondents noted   that competition is putting downward pressure on their rates. On the consumer   side, most bankers characterized loan demand as weak or flat. Those seeing a   slight increase attributed it to draw downs on home equity lines of credit. The   residential mortgage market continues at a slow pace, with several bankers   noting that activity has diminished further since the end of the home-buyer tax   credit. Core deposits continued to grow at most banks, while deposit rates   remain low or fell further. Reports on the credit quality of loan applicants   were mixed. Delinquencies were improving almost across the board, with the only   problem areas continuing to be those related to real estate. Bankers expect that   current credit standards will persist for the foreseeable future. Overall   employment levels are stable, although two large banks reported some workforce   growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports show little change in oil and natural gas   production during the past eight weeks, with only a modest increase expected   going into the summer. Spot prices for oil and gas are trending down. We heard   mixed reports on coal output. One producer attributed very strong demand for   metallurgical coal to the global upswing in steel production, while long-term   expectations by electric utilities for flat demand and excess capacity is   putting downward pressure on coal output. Prices for coal were mixed. In   general, capital expenditures by energy producers are flat to down. However, two   of our contacts said that they expect to increase capital outlays during the   second half of 2010. With the exception of steel pipe, production equipment and   materials costs were flat. Employment was steady, and little hiring is expected   in the near future. Wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight transport executives reported   favorable volume trends, with corresponding gains in their bottom lines.   However, profits remain below historical norms. Several contacts noted that the   increased volume was above expectations. Most freight executives characterized   their outlook as optimistic. Nonetheless, there remains some underlying concern   about the sustainability of the recovery and credit availability for working   capital. Several of our contacts noted that they are attempting to negotiate   moderate rate increases, with some degree of success. They also reported a   significant rise in the cost of packaging materials and much higher quotes for   tractors and trailers to be delivered in the summer, which they attributed to   new engine regulations. Major capital purchases remain at low levels. However,   due to aging fleets and growing demand, the need to replace equipment may grow   toward year-end. Current hiring is for replacement only. If volume continues to   build, freight executives expect to add capacity in the near term.
