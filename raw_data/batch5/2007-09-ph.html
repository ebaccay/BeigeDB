      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity expanded in the Third    District in August, although the pace of expansion appeared to ease somewhat.    Manufacturers, on balance, reported increases in new orders and shipments,    although the number of firms reporting increases declined from a month ago.    Retailers generally reported year-over-year gains in August in line with    previous months, although some stores had weaker than expected sales. Auto    sales improved slightly from July to August but remained below the level of a    year ago. Overall bank lending rose slightly, with gains in business and    personal lending, but residential mortgage activity declined. Residential    real estate demand has weakened considerably since our last report, but    demand for commercial real estate has remained strong. Firms reporting on    labor costs generally noted moderate, steady rates of increase in wages, but    several said increases in non-wage benefits costs were large. Firms reported    increases in input costs and output prices in August, although the extent of    the increases did not appear to have changed much since July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District firms generally foresee    continued growth in the next few months, although several contacts said they    expect the rate of growth to ease. Manufacturers expect some increases in    demand for their products in the months ahead, and, except for some    manufacturers of building products, they have plans to increase capital    spending. Retailers generally expect sales to increase at their current rate.    Auto dealers are not certain of the near-term outlook, although they expect    sales for the year as a whole to be below those of last year. Bankers    anticipate further growth in business and personal lending, albeit at a    slower pace, but they expect residential mortgage lending to decline. Home    builders and residential real estate agents expect sales to remain slow. Most    contacts in commercial real estate anticipate continued strong demand for    office and industrial space, but several contacts believe office construction    activity could decline late this year and into next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers, on balance, reported    increases in shipments and new orders in August. Around one-third of the    manufacturers surveyed noted increases and around one-fifth noted decreases.    However, compared with the previous month, fewer firms reported increases and    slightly more reported decreases. Order backlogs, overall, were unchanged    from July to August. Firms    producing apparel, chemicals, and industrial equipment reported increases in    orders in August, but firms producing lumber, building materials, and    transportation equipment reported decreases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Half the manufacturing firms contacted    for this report expect increases in new orders and shipments over the next    six months, and only a few expect decreases. Firms in most of the major    manufacturing industries in the region have scheduled increased capital    spending in the next six months, although makers of wood and metal products    have trimmed planned capital expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the Third District reported    that sales in August picked up for back-to-school shopping. Most indicated    that the year-over-year gain was similar to the annual increases that were    posted in previous months. However, some apparel specialty stores noted    weaker gains. Merchants also said sales of consumer durable goods,    particularly appliances and home furnishings, have slackened. Some store    executives said price discounting increased during the back-to-school    shopping period compared with spring and early summer. Retailers expect sales    to increase in the months ahead at around the current rate, although several    of those contacted for this report said the outlook is becoming more    uncertain, and some said they were putting expansion plans on hold.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the region generally    reported a slight pickup in sales from July to August, but they are uncertain    that the higher rate of sales will continue. Most expect sales for this year    as a whole to be below those of last year. Foreign makes continued to have    better year-over-year sales comparisons than domestic makes, and dealers    believe reorganization and other managerial changes at domestic manufacturers    could hamper marketing efforts and limit possibilities for increasing sales    of their vehicles. Consolidation and closings of dealerships continue, mainly    for domestic makes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The volume of outstanding loans at Third District    banks remained on a slight upward trend in August, according to lending    officers contacted for this report. Loan growth is mainly in business and    credit card lending. Demand for residential purchase mortgages has declined,    but refinancing    applications have increased as borrowers seek to switch from adjustable-rate    to fixed-rate mortgages. Demand for home equity loans has been gaining, but    the rate of expansion has eased, according to some of the bankers surveyed in    August. In general, bankers noted slight increases in delinquencies on    mortgages and credit cards. Looking ahead, bankers foresee continued growth    in business and personal lending, although many expect the rate of increase    to be slower in the next several quarters than it was in the first half of    the year. Virtually all contacts concerned with residential mortgage lending    expect activity to remain slow for the rest of this year and into next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in secondary debt markets    reported a sharp drop-off in demand for collateralized debt obligations in    mid-August affecting securities backed by residential as well as commercial    real estate debt. Contacts said that concern about underlying credit quality    has risen among investors in collateralized debt obligations. However, some    contacts reported that further decreases in prices would probably prompt    purchases of secondary market securities that can meet more critical scrutiny    for risk. Despite any possible improvement in secondary markets, however,    most contacts do not expect the residential mortgage origination business to    rebound soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity has    slowed dramatically since mid-summer, according to home builders and real    estate agents contacted in late August. The sales rate for new homes has    declined by half or more, according to some builders, and cancellations have    increased. Builders reported making large price reductions with little effect    on sales. Sales of existing homes have also dropped. Inventories of existing    homes for sale remain high, but the rate of new listings has slowed. The    falloff in sales of both new and existing homes has occurred in nearly all    parts of the region, including areas that had recently experienced strong    sales. Contacts among builders and real estate agents do not expect a quick    turnaround. Several said they expect housing demand to remain subdued for a    year or more, even if mortgage credit becomes more readily available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate firms report that    office vacancy rates in the region have continued to decline over the past    several months, and rental rates have increased. Demand for office space has    grown as firms in the region have expanded. Although new buildings have added    to available space, conversion of older buildings to other uses has removed    some space from office markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction    is up in many office markets in the region, on both a build-to-suit and a    speculative basis. Industrial real estate firms report that overall demand    for industrial space remains strong. Vacancy rates have moved down and rents    have risen moderately. Construction of industrial buildings has increased.    Looking ahead, some contacts in the commercial real estate sector are not certain    that construction of commercial buildings will continue to rise, but several    contacts indicated that they expected public infrastructure construction to    pick up, mainly for roads and bridges and for utilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of increases in input costs and    output prices from Third District business contacts were about as prevalent    in August as they were in July. Grain prices have been rising, leading to    higher prices for meat and bakery products. Prices of some metals, chemicals,    and industrial machinery were also reported to be increasing. In contrast,    prices of lumber and wood products were reported to be easing. Price    discounts to boost back-to-school sales were fairly common among retailers,    limiting the year-to-year increase in effective prices of much seasonal    merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the firms reporting on    employment costs in August indicated a continuing trend of moderate wage    increases. Several firms noted that increases in benefit costs continued to    be large, although not accelerating. Nevertheless, employers in the region    said they were continuing to look for ways to reduce benefit costs.
