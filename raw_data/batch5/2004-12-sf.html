      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 2004
      </strong>
      <p>
       The Twelfth District economy expanded solidly in October and early November, 

  maintaining the pace of growth of the previous survey period. In terms of inflation, 

  retailers reported stable prices despite increasing costs and makers of IT products 

  noted ongoing price declines for many of their goods and services. Other contacts 

  continued to comment on the higher cost of energy, shipping, and building materials. 

  Wage increases remained modest, but rising benefits costs continued to push 

  up total compensation. Retail sales reportedly were solid and demand for District 

  services remained strong. District manufacturing activity was mixed, with some 

  sectors reporting solid growth and others noting some softening. District agricultural 

  producers reported strong demand for most products. Activity in District residential 

  real estate markets generally was robust, with slight moderation in some areas. 

  Contacts indicated modest improvements in commercial real estate; office and 

  industrial vacancy rates fell slightly in several markets. District banking 

  and financial conditions were little changed, with solid overall loan demand 

  and good credit quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Wages
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In terms of inflation, District retailers reported stable final prices despite 

  rising costs for wholesale merchandise and shipping; retailers noted that they 

  continue to hold the line on prices, taking cost increases out of margins. Makers 

  of IT products reported additional price declines for some of their goods and 

  services. Consistent with softer IT investment, price declines for some types 

  of semiconductors reportedly accelerated. Several other contacts noted increases 

  in transportation costs--land, sea, and air--and some reported paying surcharges 

  on international shipping. Respondents continued to comment on the higher costs 

  of energy and building materials. Wage and salary growth remained modest overall, 

  although most District businesses continued to report that increases in benefits 

  costs were pushing up total compensation bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from District retailers indicated solid retail sales in October and 

  early November. Recent sales have boosted expectations for the coming holiday 

  season. Despite a relatively good holiday sales outlook, contacts reportedly 

  are keeping inventories and seasonal hiring in line with last year. In contrast 

  to other retail goods, sales of autos slowed somewhat, reflecting soft demand 

  for domestic brands; sales of foreign makes remained solid. Slower sales of 

  domestic makes reportedly left some District auto dealers with unplanned inventory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts reported robust demand for District services. District seaports continued 

  to handle very high volumes, boosted by surging imports and a pickup in exports. 

  The volume of traffic, especially on the import side, has caused considerable 

  congestion, resulting in a backlog of unloaded inbound ships in southern California. 

  Contacts reported that shipping lines recently increased their prices for ground 

  and sea transport in response to the bottlenecks. District travel and tourism 

  also has been vigorous, with increases in both domestic and international traffic. 

  Contacts noted improvements in hotel occupancy and increases in average daily 

  room rates in many markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Conditions in District manufacturing were mixed across industries in October 

  and early November. Makers of machine tools reported a pickup in new orders 

  for their products, allowing them to work down previously accumulated inventories. 

  Improved sales of lumber, wood, and other building products boosted production 

  in that sector. Demand for apparel and textile products was robust in recent 

  weeks. In IT manufacturing, semiconductor orders and sales were flat; inventories 

  of chips increased and capacity utilization dropped slightly. Respondents at 

  IT firms other than semiconductors noted that demand softened relative to earlier 

  in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District agricultural producers reported strong domestic and foreign demand 

  for most agricultural products. Agricultural exports continued to rise. District 

  natural gas providers reported a slight rise in both wholesale and retail prices. 

  The high and rising natural gas prices have kept drilling activity at full capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for residential real estate generally remained strong, although in some 

  areas the pace of home sales and price increases slowed slightly from previous 

  rapid rates. On the commercial side, contacts indicated modest improvements; 

  office and industrial vacancy rates edged down in several markets. The robust 

  demand for homes, improved demand for commercial properties, and some increased 

  public spending kept overall construction activity at high levels. Contacts 

  noted that the supply of some construction materials, such as steel, improved, 

  but other building materials, such as cement, continued to be in short supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District banking contacts reported little change in overall loan demand or credit 

  quality in recent weeks. Construction lending remained strong and commercial 

  and industrial lending edged up slightly in some areas. Residential mortgage 

  lending continued to soften, pulled down by a drop in refinancing activity, 

  but remained at high levels. Contacts reported that loan quality remained good.
