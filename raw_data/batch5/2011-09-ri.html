      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic activity in the Fifth District slowed since our last report.   Manufacturing activity pulled back markedly in August, following a sluggish   July, and retail sales weakened. Residential construction and housing sales   declined further, while commercial real estate activity was mixed. Banking   activity was also mixed, with some commercial lenders citing some improvement   but mortgage bankers reporting continued weakness. In contrast, activity at   non-retail services firms edged up. After earlier improvements, coastal   hoteliers watched their guests flee as Hurricane Irene approached. However,   inland hotel managers reported no change in their solid bookings. Labor markets   were mixed; while temp services reported some improvement, employment remained   nearly flat at manufacturing establishments. Price pressures in the District   edged higher over the last month. Manufacturing prices paid and received   accelerated, while prices in the service sector picked up slightly. Finally,   recent precipitation improved agricultural conditions in most parts of the   District, although Hurricane Irene damaged coastal crops.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        District manufacturing activity contracted   in August after stalling in July. A producer of modular homes stated that   "business is terrible," citing this as the worst year in his 40 years in the   business. Several textile manufacturers mentioned that markets for their   products had grown considerably weaker since our last report, which they   attributed in part to declining confidence among customers. Similarly, a   producer of packaging film mentioned that his firm had cut production over the   last three months. Moreover, a manufacturer of bottled and canned soft drinks   noted sales were down sharply from last year, producing lower-than-normal sales   for this time of year. Low-end cabinet makers reported that their firms   continued to struggle with below-average profits. In contrast, high-end cabinet   manufacturers affirmed that sales continued to improve, albeit at a slower rate   than in the spring. The District manufacturing survey for August revealed that   prices for both raw materials and finished goods grew at a somewhat quicker pace   than a month ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Retail sales mostly weakened in late July through   August. A wide range of retailers indicated that sales had declined in recent   weeks as shoppers searched for bargains, while polled store managers at general   merchandise stores mostly reported little change in revenues. A manager of a   chain of hardware stores noted a decline in sales in recent months. Also, a   contact told us that a Baltimore jeweler had little business over the last month   other than engagement rings. A grocery executive reported higher revenues, while   also indicating that his input prices had risen, putting pressure on margins.   The pace of retail price increases stepped up from a month ago, according to our   most recent survey.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Non-retail services firms saw an uptick in   revenues in recent weeks, according to most contacts. Stronger consumer demand   for services was reported in telecommunications and healthcare, and a food   distributor in the Baltimore area noted increased demand from locally owned   restaurants and delicatessens. A financial data services firm reported improving   demand from restaurants and retailers in Maryland and Virginia, although other   business services providers noted negative ripple effects from a slower economy.   In contrast, an executive at a Virginia linen service stated that low bookings   at hotels had reduced demand. Contacts at senior care facilities in Maryland and   North Carolina remarked that expected new residents had postponed their move-in   date while their homes remained on the market. Service sector prices grew at a   slightly faster pace, according to our latest monthly survey.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Finance
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Lending activity was mixed since our last   assessment. A banker in North Carolina stated that loan volume was "pretty good"   in recent months, but added that most of the activity was market share gains   rather than a piece of a growing market. Indeed, several bankers noted an   increase in calls from businesses that were looking for new banking   relationships, but few were ready to make a loan application. An official at a   large bank in the District noted some improvement in loans for capital spending,   but added that most was limited to replacing worn out capital. A commercial   banker in Richmond cited recent cutbacks in loan demand from several   manufacturers. A banker in rural Virginia described his loan demand as   "extremely flat," with modest gains on the commercial side offset by weak demand   on the consumer side. Several bankers noted weaker-than-expected mortgage demand   over the last month. Most contacts stated that loan quality continued to   improve, but several bankers indicated that they eased lending terms in order to   compete for quality borrowers.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Real estate activity weakened over the last   four to six weeks. Several Realtors reported that sales had dropped considerably   in recent months and that their markets were less active than a year ago. A   Realtor in eastern Maryland indicated that home sales as well as average home   prices were down notably from earlier in the year. A West Virginia Realtor said   potential buyers were calling and looking for bargains, but that there were few   actual sales. He mentioned that some sellers were starting to reduce prices   significantly. Similarly, an agent in central Virginia noted that asking prices   continued to fall. Most Realtors said that the high-end market was suffering,   which they attributed to devalued portfolios of the wealthy, as well as   uncertainty about employment and job stability. In contrast, a Realtor in the   D.C. area reported that properties in the $900 thousand to $1.5 million price   range moved quickly over the last month. He added that low interest rates and   lean inventory, which reached its lowest level since February 2006, should help   improve area sales in the fall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial real estate activity since our last report was mixed across most   segments of the market. Virtually all contacts described market conditions as   remaining weak, in terms of both leasing volumes and rental rates. While a   Realtor in South Carolina reported that activity had picked up over the last few   months, gains were mostly due to consolidations and renewals that often occurred   at reduced lease rates. A Realtor in North Carolina noted that leasing   incentives were still being offered aggressively in local markets. An agent in   the D.C. area said that renewals often required owners to offer significant   improvement packages. In contrast, a real estate agent in West Virginia remarked   that further softening of lease rates was constrained by the limited amount of   vacant space in the area. Most retail leasing activity in the District was   limited to national chains, according to several contacts, in part because   financing remained an obstacle for small retailers. Contacts generally noted   that greater uncertainty about the market and the economy had pushed clients to   prefer leasing over buying. One contact stated that sales to leases had recently   fallen from a typical one-to-four ratio to one-to-fifteen.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Labor Markets
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Reports on Fifth District labor market   activity were mixed in August. Several employment agencies reported somewhat   stronger demand for temporary help in recent weeks, particularly in the   healthcare and automotive industries. The branch manager of a temp agency in   North Carolina stated that manufacturers had openings for skilled positions, but   they had difficulty finding machine operators with at least one year of   experience. Likewise, a contact from South Carolina reported that three large   manufacturers in the area were trying to hire, but could not find qualified   candidates. In contrast, an executive from the D.C. area said that a major   corporation had initiated a hiring and advertising freeze. Also, a banker   indicated that some of his clients said that they would rather pay workers   overtime than hire new workers, due in large part to the recent environment of   heightened uncertainty. According to our latest survey, job losses in the   service sector were somewhat more widespread than in our last report; wages in   the retail sector weakened on average, while average wage growth slowed at   services firms. Survey respondents from most manufacturing industries indicated   that hiring inched up over the last month, while the average workweek declined   and wage growth slowed.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Tourism
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Tourism generally strengthened over the last   month, although contacts along the Atlantic coast lost significant end-of-summer   business as Hurricane Irene came ashore one week before Labor Day weekend. Local   evacuation orders in areas along the coast of North Carolina resulted in   cancellations and shortened stays for the end of August. In addition, an   hotelier in Virginia Beach reported several cancellations and early check-outs,   as guests left the area ahead of the storm. Inland, however, hotel managers   reported solid bookings, and several were experiencing a rush of hurricane   evacuees. In the weeks prior to the hurricane, bookings had been strong,   although some beach resorts used incentives to bolster reservations. According   to a local contact, hotels in the D.C. area discounted room rates to boost   reservations over the summer, which increased volume but held down margins.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Agriculture
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Scattered precipitation over the last two   months promoted crop growth in many sections of the District, but more recently   crops along the coast were damaged by Hurricane Irene. Rain in early August   aided late summer peaches in West Virginia and soybean harvests in Virginia.   Virginia growers were also busy cutting hay and preparing for the corn harvest   and the flue-tobacco harvest was in full swing. Ninety-six percent of the corn   crop in South Carolina had matured and was forty percent harvested up to the   hurricane. However, post-hurricane inspections by state officials in North   Carolina revealed widespread damage to field crops, poultry and other   agricultural businesses. Moreover, agricultural agents in that state reported   damage to greenhouses, grain storage facilities and aquaculture operations.   Fortunately, cotton bolls had not been stripped from their plants by high winds,   and tobacco farmers may have been saved by rushing their crops to curing barns   before the storm stuck, according to the agricultural agents.
