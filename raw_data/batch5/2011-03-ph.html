      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District has improved overall since the last   Beige Book. Manufacturers reported strong increases in shipments and new orders   in February. Retailers achieved modest year-over-year increases in sales in   January and February. Motor vehicle dealers also reported year-over-year sales   increases in February. Third District banks reported little overall change in   loan volume outstanding since the last Beige Book, although business loan and   residential mortgage volumes edged up, while consumer loan volume eased.   Residential real estate agents and homebuilders indicated that activity, which   was already at a seasonal low along a low part of the business cycle, was   dampened further by poor weather. Contacts in the commercial real estate sector   said that leasing and construction activity have remained at low levels since   the last Beige Book. Service-sector firms reported that activity has increased   modestly. Business contacts reported still more instances of price increases for   inputs than they did in the previous Beige Book, and output price increases   emerged in February as reported by contacts in several sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District business contacts is positive but not   strong. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next   six months. Retailers expect sales to increase moderately on a year-over-year   basis. Bankers expect only slight growth in lending over the next two quarters.   Contacts in residential real estate expect little or no increase in activity for   the year as a whole. Contacts in commercial real estate expect market conditions   to improve slowly during the year. Service-sector companies expect continued   slow growth through the first half of 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported   strong increases in shipments and new orders from January to February. Producers   across a broad spectrum of 11 manufacturing sectors reported increased demand.   Declines in orders were predominant only among producers of apparel and of   testing and measuring instruments. Producers within the furniture, petroleum,   and fabricated metals sectors reported no overall change in demand. Some   manufacturers credited global markets and energy markets as drivers of new   demand, and one specifically cited China's rising costs as allowing them to   reclaim work previously lost overseas. Several manufacturers mentioned "tough   winter conditions" as affecting shipments and lowering demand.
     </p>
     Third District   manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the next six months,   on balance. Among the firms surveyed in February, about half expect increases in   new orders and shipments, and less than one-tenth expect decreases. Executives   from several sectors that supply the construction industry cited very low levels   of highway construction in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic region and   expressed concern over future federal and state highway funding. Capital   spending plans among area manufacturers remain positive, but lessened somewhat   over the past two months, mostly from January to February.
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally reported modest   year-over-year increases in sales in January and February. Snowstorms deterred   shopping and limited the advance in sales in January, retailers said, but most   of those contacted for this report indicated that sales rebounded in February.   However, revenue increases have been adversely affected by clearance sales of   winter merchandise. The consensus among merchants in the region is that sales   will continue to grow as the spring selling season gets underway. Most of the   merchants who gave forecasts expect sales to increase moderately. The general   opinion was expressed by one store executive who said, "We are cautiously   optimistic, although we do not think the consumer will step up buying strongly   until employment picks up."
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers contacted in February reported that sales were   above the year-ago level and rising gradually from the January level. Dealers   generally considered their inventories to be in line with near-term sales   expectations. Dealers anticipate sales this year to exceed sales last year,   although some remained concerned that further increases in gasoline prices could   limit the improvement in sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      At most of the Third District banks contacted for   this report, total outstanding loan volume has been roughly level since the   previous Beige Book. Overall, business loan and residential mortgage volumes   outstanding have edged up at commercial banks in the District, but consumer loan   volume outstanding has eased. The outlook among Third District bankers   interviewed in February is that total loan volume will expand only slightly over   the next two quarters. Bankers said that consumers will remain reluctant to   borrow until employment begins to improve more steadily and that business firms   are still focused on strengthening balance sheets rather than taking on more   debt. One banker expressed a view shared by many when he said, "Creditworthy   businesses are not looking to borrow."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity remains "in the doldrums," according to builders and brokers throughout   most parts of the Third District. A builder described traffic as "anemic"   through January, as the typical winter lull was depressed further still by harsh   weather across the District. While some builders noted a pickup in traffic in   early February, the "slower-than-normal January means we won't know for awhile"   whether overall trends are improving. While home prices continue to fall in most   parts of the District, the softness is primarily in higher-end homes. The   greater than usual prevalence of distressed property sales creates some   additional competition for new homebuilders. While market participants "want to   be positive," most seem to have grown weary and wary of anticipating any   near-term improvement in the housing sector. They are positioned for a year of   little or no growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      There has been little change in commercial and industrial markets in the   Third District since the previous Beige Book, according to area nonresidential   real estate firms. Contacts said that vacancy rates and rents have been nearly   steady for most property types, although vacancy rates for apartment buildings   have been moving down. Contacts in some parts of the District also reported some   slight gains in occupancy of industrial buildings. Construction activity has   been roughly steady at a slow pace. Looking ahead, commercial real estate   contacts expect market conditions to improve slowly during the rest of the year,   with increases in construction and occupied space held back by restrained   financing and slow employment growth in the region. One contact said, "It will   probably take some office markets several years to recover the loss of occupancy   caused by the recession."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service-sector firms generally reported modest   increases in activity since the previous Beige Book. Business-service firms   generally have been posting slight gains as their customers see gradual   improvement in their own activity. However, as one business-service firm noted,   "Customers are keeping within their budgets, and we have to be responsive to   that." Moderate improvement was also noted by firms in the telecommunications,   professional services, and health care sectors. Most of the services sector   firms contacted for this report expect slow growth in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from manufacturers since the   previous Beige Book indicated still more pervasive increases in input costs.   While much less prevalent, output price increases are becoming more widespread   throughout the manufacturing sectors. Retailers generally indicated that selling   prices have been steady or declining as they clear out winter merchandise.   However, a growing number of retailers mentioned that wholesale costs are rising   for goods they are purchasing for sale during the second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business firms in the region reported mostly steady wages since the last   Beige Book, although some said they have raised wages and salaries for certain   skilled occupations. Employment agencies said there has been some growth in   demand for workers recently, and some colleges in the region reported that more   companies plan to recruit on campus this year than last year.
