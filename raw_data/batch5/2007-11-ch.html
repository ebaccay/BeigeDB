      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the  Seventh District continued to expand in October and early November, but at a  slower pace than in the previous reporting period. Consumer spending was mixed,  and business spending rose at a reduced pace. Labor market conditions varied by  industry and location. Residential construction continued to decline, while  nonresidential construction increased overall. Expansion in manufacturing eased  from the previous reporting period. Credit standards tightened, but this did  not appear to crimp household or business borrowing. Wage and cost pressures  changed little from those in the previous reporting period. Corn and soybean  prices moved higher, despite a record corn harvest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was mixed, with slower retail  sales in some areas of the District and slight increases in others. Retailers  attributed the declines to households' worries about the economy, higher  gasoline prices, and above normal temperatures. A report from Michigan indicated that people were  spending less when they shopped and ate out. In contrast, a restaurant chain  found demand to be "surprisingly robust" for the Midwest. Furthermore, consumer  electronics, luxury goods, and online sales performed well. Retailers continued  to be cautious about the upcoming holiday season. Auto dealers reported flat  sales during October and early November. Vehicle inventories generally remained  a bit elevated, though had come down to comfortable levels for some dealers.  Tourism activity declined slightly with a contact from Michigan saying that leisure travel  was weaker because people were being more cost-conscious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Business spending moved somewhat higher during the  reporting period. Overall, capital spending plans for 2008 remained above the  levels of 2007. One firm even noted that, unlike the past several years, they  were not curtailing their capital spending for next year from their initial  plans. In contrast, some planned increases in capacity have been delayed or  cancelled, notably in the construction materials and biofuels sectors. Labor  market conditions improved slightly in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, but declined in Indiana and Michigan. Layoffs were announced in  manufacturing, mainly related to the auto and construction materials  industries. Yet hiring continued in other sectors, and shortages of skilled and  professional workers lingered. A staffing firm experienced flat volume in  District states. Traditional seasonal retail hires lagged those of previous  years, as hiring plans shifted toward staffing online sales departments. Looking  ahead, contacts thought that permanent additions to the retail work force would  be limited. In addition, the potential for fallout from the housing and finance  sectors on economic activity was contributing to uncertainty about future  hiring needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction and home sales in the  District continued to decline slowly. Many contacts said that a tightening of  credit has contributed to declines in local housing markets. Showroom traffic  slowed throughout the District. Cancellations began to edge up again in both Illinois and Michigan, as customers had to  withdraw from new home contracts after failing to sell their existing homes.  Residential rents came under pressure, as builders put vacant homes up for  rent. Contacts projected that building conditions would be weak until at least  mid-2008. However, there was some positive news. Several contacts thought that  activity may be bottoming out in some areas. Another contact said that the  declines in home prices in Michigan have begun to pull some  buyers into the market. The rate of increase in overall nonresidential  development slowed, though infrastructure construction quickened. Contacts said  that the ongoing volatility in financial markets has decreased the financing  available for nonresidential development projects. One contact reported that  construction of retail space was still strong; another commented that banks  were still being built. One builder thought that nonresidential construction  would become more competitive as residential construction companies move into  the market. Nonresidential rents rose gradually, though in Michigan office rents were flat from  the last reporting period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing growth eased compared with the previous  reporting period. Manufacturers in many industries reported increases in the  already strong demand for exports. An electronics manufacturer reported  "phenomenal" growth to the point that they had to turn away business. Domestic  steel production continued to move ahead, especially with the moderation of  imports. Demand for large agricultural machinery, energy extraction, and mining  equipment continued to be robust. In contrast, domestic demand for other types  of heavy equipment, including construction machinery and trucks, was weak. Aerospace  production schedules slowed, though backlogs for some aircraft parts, which are  as high as a year for engines, persisted. Automakers lowered expectations for  light vehicle sales, especially for less fuel efficient vehicles and older  models. In response, third shifts will end at some assembly plants in the near  future with repercussions likely for parts suppliers. Gypsum wallboard capacity  and utilization declined, even as older plants were being shut down to make  room for more efficient operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit markets tightened again during October and  early November. Mortgage originations showed stability in some areas, but were  subject to tighter lending guidelines and more likely to have fixed-rate terms.  Inquiries picked up for refinancing to fixed rate mortgages, though there was  less demand for cash-out refinancing. Home equity loans and lines of credit  drew a little more interest due to lower interest rates. A bank reported  reduced competition in the market for mortgages as restricted access to credit  forced out some competitors who lacked adequate liquidity. Business loan demand  continued to show modest growth despite slightly higher credit standards, and lending  from banks increased to meet the needs of commercial and industrial borrowers.  The commercial paper market improved some, as pricing structures adjusted to  changes in the market environment. However, there was general concern and  uncertainty about how prolonged declines in real estate prices would affect the  lending industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Pressure from wages and costs did not change much compared  to the previous reporting period. Manufacturers indicated that most input costs  were stable, but they were waiting for increased costs due to higher oil prices  and metal prices continued to be volatile. The slowdown in construction has led  to further declines in wallboard prices and held down price increases for some  other construction materials. More expensive raw materials have started  catching up to firms that had successfully hedged against earlier cost  increases. The ability to pass higher wholesale prices onto consumers varied by  product category. Concerns were expressed about higher food costs resulting  from the increased use of agricultural products to produce fuels. Wage  pressures were evident in areas experiencing shortages of skilled labor, but  were minimal in other sectors. Contacts cited union wage increases in the  construction industry as a factor in the cost base of new homes. A few contacts  reported that health insurance cost increases were a major issue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Corn  and soybean prices moved higher during the reporting period, despite a record  corn harvest. The District corn harvest was boosted by both a large increase in  acres planted and by higher yields; the District soybean harvest was smaller  than a year ago due to both a reduction in acreage and lower yields. Cash  prices for both corn and soybeans rose enough relative to futures prices to  reduce incentives to store crops into 2008. More farmers than usual have sold  corn and soybeans from future harvests. Demand from local ethanol plants helped  to ease transportation problems for crops. Cattle prices were stable; milk and  hog prices moved down. The pace of hog slaughter firmed compared to September.  There was a shortage of pastures, and hay was at a premium.
