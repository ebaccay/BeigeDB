       July 27, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity 

  continued to expand in June and early July. Richmond and Dallas reported that 

  the rate of economic growth increased, and Cleveland said economic growth was 

  stronger and more balanced than in the spring. New York was the only District 

  to report a slowing in the rate of economic growth. Among the other Districts, 

  Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco characterized the pace 

  of expansion as solid, while Chicago described the rate of economic growth as 

  moderate. Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis did not characterize the overall 

  pace of expansion, although Boston noted that locally-based retailers were not 

  sharing in the expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts reported increases in retail sales, and vehicle sales in nearly 

  all Districts were boosted by a new round of price discounting. Demand for most 

  services, including tourism, continued to increase across the country, and most 

  Districts noted moderate to solid expansions in manufacturing activity. Commercial 

  real estate activity improved in most Districts. Residential real estate activity 

  remained strong overall but showed a few signs of cooling in some Districts. 

  Bankers reported solid or increasing loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets generally continued to improve, although hiring in several Districts 

  was mixed. Skilled worker shortages were reported in several Districts, but 

  nearly all Districts said wage pressures remained moderate. Overall price pressures 

  eased slightly or remained unchanged in most Districts, despite substantial 

  increases in energy costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported increases in retail sales, and reports on retailers' 

  expectations were generally positive. Dallas said sales growth had been stronger 

  than expected given high gasoline prices, and Atlanta noted that higher gasoline 

  prices did not appear to have cut into spending on other items; Cleveland and 

  Chicago said warmer weather may have boosted sales in their Districts. Minneapolis 

  and Kansas City reported solid year-over-year retail sales gains, and sales 

  also increased in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts. The 

  weakest report on retail sales came from the Boston District, where sales were 

  flat or down from a year ago and retailers were less optimistic than in previous 

  surveys. New York also reported a softening in sales in early July following 

  solid growth in June, while St. Louis said reports on retail sales were mixed 

  in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly all Districts that reported on vehicle sales noted improvements, which 

  were generally attributed to a new round of price discounting by some automakers. 

  Cleveland reported dramatic gains, saying all types of dealerships benefited 

  from increased buyer traffic. San Francisco also said vehicle sales rose substantially 

  in response to the price cuts. Only St. Louis cited mixed reports on auto sales. 

  Sales of most types of vehicles were characterized as strong, although Philadelphia 

  and Kansas City reported some weakness in sales of large SUVs. Auto dealers 

  in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts were somewhat concerned about future 

  auto sales, but Kansas City said dealers expect strong sales to continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for services continued to increase in June and early July. Boston reported 

  healthy growth in demand for advertising and management consulting, and Philadelphia 

  contacts noted increased activity in information services and business support 

  services. Richmond also reported increased demand for business-to-business services. 

  Demand for health care was reported to be flat in the Richmond District but 

  robust in the San Francisco District. Dallas and San Francisco noted an increase 

  in demand at transportation firms, while Cleveland and Chicago said that demand 

  for trucking was steady and that overall conditions for the industry remained 

  favorable. On the other hand, Atlanta reported some transportation firms have 

  seen activity fall slightly from the high levels experienced earlier in the 

  year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism continued to show strength throughout much of the country. New York 

  reported that hotel occupancy rates in Manhattan were near record levels and 

  that room rates were up substantially from a year earlier. In addition, Atlanta 

  said hotel occupancy rates in the Miami area were at record levels, and theme 

  park attendance was ahead of last year's pace. Chicago and Kansas City also 

  noted an increase in demand for hotel rooms since the previous survey. Tourism 

  activity over the Fourth of July was characterized as being particularly strong 

  in parts of the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. San Francisco reported continued 

  strong growth in visits to key tourist destination states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported moderate to solid expansions in manufacturing activity, 

  and expectations for future factory activity were generally upbeat. New York 

  saw a rebound in manufacturing production in July, adding that manufacturers' 

  expectations had also risen. Chicago reported continued solid growth, and Atlanta 

  said that reports from District manufacturers were positive. Boston said sales 

  and orders remain on an upward trend. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas 

  noted increases in activity as well. St. Louis and Kansas City reported moderate 

  expansions in factory activity, and San Francisco said demand for manufactured 

  goods rose slightly after slowing in the previous survey period. Cleveland said 

  durable goods production had been flat since the previous survey but nondurable 

  goods production was steady or rising. Richmond reported a softening in factory 

  activity in June but a solid increase in shipments and new orders in July. Despite 

  the overall expansion in manufacturing activity, as well as generally positive 

  reports on capital spending, factory hiring remained sluggish in most Districts 

  that reported on employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in a wide variety of manufacturing industries was characterized as 

  strong. Boston and San Francisco reported strength in aircraft and high-tech 

  manufacturing, and Atlanta and Dallas said refineries were doing quite well. 

  Several Districts also noted strong activity for producers of construction materials--especially 

  cement--as well as for producers of industrial equipment and materials. While 

  most factory sectors were strong, some weakness was noted among producers of 

  metals and textiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity remained robust overall but showed a few signs 

  of cooling in some Districts. Boston reported that residential real estate markets 

  were still strong. However, housing activity and home price appreciation in 

  Massachusetts moved from "hot" to "normal," and housing inventories in the District 

  as a whole became somewhat less tight. Housing activity was described as robust 

  in the New York District, but housing inflation slowed in New Jersey and the 

  condo market in Manhattan was less frenzied than in the spring. In the Richmond, 

  Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, housing activity remained strong but eased 

  in a few markets that had been especially hot--Washington, D.C., several Florida 

  markets, and parts of southern California. Dallas also described housing demand 

  as strong but noted that the supply of new homes was sufficient to keep housing 

  inflation from exceeding overall inflation. Housing activity was brisk in the 

  Chicago District and solid in the Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts, although 

  homebuilding edged down in the Kansas City District. The weakest report came 

  from the Cleveland District, where homebuilders have faced slightly softer conditions 

  since early spring and new home prices have been flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity improved in most Districts. Cleveland said 

  commercial builders were experiencing steady improvement and higher backlogs 

  of orders. In the Atlanta District, new construction projects moved forward, 

  and office vacancy rates trended downward but were still high. Contacts in the 

  Chicago District described commercial activity as busier than normal, although 

  activity was slower in Michigan. Commercial real estate activity was described 

  as strong in the Richmond District and as improving in the Minneapolis, Kansas 

  City, and San Francisco Districts. Dallas reported that speculative office construction 

  increased, apartment construction remained high, and hotel markets were hot. 

  Some of the increased real estate demand in the Dallas District was attributed 

  to outside investors attracted by the area's lower real estate prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In Districts reporting on banking conditions, loan demand increased or remained 

  solid. Overall lending increased in most Districts, with growth ranging from 

  slight in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts to solid in the Dallas District. 

  Atlanta and San Francisco both characterized loan demand as strong. In most 

  Districts, loan growth was attributed to increases in home mortgages, home equity 

  loans, or business loans. Credit quality was generally strong, although there 

  were some concerns about loans to auto suppliers and farmers in the Chicago 

  District and loans for Florida condominium developments in the Atlanta District. 

  Dallas indicated that competition for large commercial loans had intensified, 

  and Chicago said that competitive pressures had led to some easing of commercial 

  credit standards. Outside of the banking sector, cash inflows to investment 

  companies increased in the Philadelphia District, and venture capital rose for 

  the first time in five years in the Chicago District. New York and Richmond 

  also reported increased activity in the financial services sector as a whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although conditions remained favorable in most agricultural Districts, dry weather 

  was a problem in some areas. Richmond reported that substantial rainfall brought 

  on by two tropical storms generally improved soil conditions in the District. 

  Atlanta reported only limited damage to crops from the storms and favorable 

  crop conditions overall, although citrus canker continues to be of some concern 

  in Florida. Kansas City and Minneapolis also said that crop conditions were 

  mostly favorable, and winter wheat yields were above year-ago levels in both 

  Districts. Some Kansas City contacts reported concern about higher energy prices 

  boosting irrigation costs. Drought conditions were reported in the Chicago, 

  St. Louis, and Dallas Districts, and Chicago noted these conditions had led 

  to an increase in corn and soybean prices. The lack of rain caused pasture conditions 

  to deteriorate substantially in the St. Louis and Dallas Districts. San Francisco 

  reported little or no impact on cattle prices from renewed fears about mad cow 

  disease, while Kansas City reported that the resumption of live cattle imports 

  from Canada was contributing to downward pressure on cattle prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the energy industry remained strong. Oil and gas activity increased 

  in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts and remained steady in the Minneapolis 

  and Kansas City Districts. Kansas City reported that drilling was constrained 

  due to a shortage of available rigs and regulatory factors, and some oil service 

  firms in the Dallas District were turning down available work due to limited 

  capacity. Dallas contacts also noted difficulty finding qualified engineers 

  and training crews. Atlanta reported a temporary shut-in of some oil and natural 

  gas supplies in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Dennis. Minneapolis respondents 

  said that mines are operating at full capacity, with exploration activity in 

  full swing across the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The demand for labor continued to increase in most Districts, although hiring 

  in several Districts was mixed. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, 

  Dallas, and San Francisco all noted an overall firming in labor markets. Boston 

  reported moderate increases in services employment and mostly steady employment 

  in retail and manufacturing. In the Richmond District, jobs increased moderately 

  at services firms but declined slightly at manufacturing firms. New York said 

  labor markets were a bit softer overall despite a pickup in hiring in financial 

  services. Several Districts reported increased demand for temporary workers, 

  while no Districts reported weaker demand for temps. Skilled workers were said 

  to be in shorter supply in several Districts, and truck drivers were reported 

  as scarce in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite generally tighter labor markets, nearly all Districts said overall 

  wage pressures remained moderate. The only wage pressures cited by the Dallas 

  District were in the accounting and energy industries, and Chicago said the 

  only sizable wage gains were in some skilled professions experiencing labor 

  shortages. San Francisco also reported only modest overall wage growth but noted 

  an increasing use of incentive compensation by some employers to attract workers. 

  Rising health-care costs continued to be a concern for contacts in the Atlanta 

  and San Francisco Districts, but Chicago reported that one large health insurance 

  firm plans to implement the smallest premium increase in a decade.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall price pressures either eased slightly or remained unchanged in most 

  Districts, despite substantial increases in the costs of energy and some building 

  materials. Manufacturers in the New York District reported a marked deceleration 

  in input prices and expect substantially less upward price pressure in coming 

  months. Some moderation in input price increases was also noted in the Richmond, 

  Kansas City, and Cleveland Districts. Overall cost and price pressures were 

  described as mild in the Richmond District, moderate in the Chicago District, 

  and largely unchanged from the second quarter in the Philadelphia District. 

  Kansas City and Minneapolis noted some softening in the costs of steel. However, 

  many Districts reported substantial increases in the costs of energy, petroleum-based 

  products, and building materials such as concrete and plywood. Chicago, Cleveland, 

  and Dallas said that transportation firms were able to pass on much of their 

  increased fuel costs to customers. However, in a number of Districts, firms 

  outside the transportation sector were reported as having only limited success 

  passing on cost increases. Retail prices were reported as either flat or up 

  moderately from the previous survey.
