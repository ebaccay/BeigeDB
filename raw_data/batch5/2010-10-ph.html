      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District has been mixed since the last Beige   Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported slight decreases in shipments and new   orders in September. Retailers posted modest year-over-year increases in sales   during the back-to-school shopping period. Motor vehicle dealers generally   reported steady sales in September and year-over-year gains for the month. Third   District banks reported level loan volume outstanding in the past few weeks.   Residential real estate agents indicated that sales of existing homes have edged   up in the past few weeks, but homebuilders indicated a mostly flat sales pace   for new homes. Contacts in the commercial real estate sector said there has been   practically no change in market conditions since the last Beige Book.   Service-sector firms reported mostly marginal increases in activity in the past   month. Business contacts indicated that prices of most goods and services have   shown no change, although there were continued reports of rising prices for   metals and new reports of increases in lumber prices. Some retailers said there   have been increases in some wholesale prices and international freight   charges.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District business contacts is positive, on balance,   but not robust. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the   next six months. Retailers expect sales to expand slightly through the end of   the year. Bankers expect only minimal growth in lending in the near term.   Contacts in both residential and commercial real estate expect flat to slowly   rising activity into the middle of 2011. Service-sector companies also expect   slow growth during the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported   slight decreases in shipments and new orders from August to September, on   balance, as well as a decrease in order backlogs. Despite the generally slower   activity among the region's manufacturing industries, some sectors reported   increases in demand for their products, notably makers of industrial machinery   and equipment, producers of wood products, and food processers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms surveyed in September, about 45   percent expect increases in new orders and shipments, and about 20 percent   expect decreases. Manufacturing executives continued to remark that recovery in   their business has been slow and halting. One said, "Some parts of our business   begin to pick up but others decline," and another described business as   "choppy." Capital spending plans among area manufacturers remain positive,   overall, but are not strong. About 20 percent of the firms polled in September   plan to increase expenditures for new plant and equipment and about 10 percent   expect to reduce spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers reported modest   year-over-year gains for the back-to-school shopping period, and most of those   contacted for this report said sales have continued to move up in recent weeks.   Some store executives noted that customer traffic and discretionary spending   appeared to be increasing somewhat. One said, "Sales of home goods have begun to   pick up, as well as sales of things that are not necessarily must-have, but the   price has to be right. The consumer is incredibly price-sensitive." Looking   ahead, most of the retailers contacted for this report said they expect sales to   continue to increase at around the current growth rate through the end-of-year   shopping period. Most agreed that stronger growth will not set in until economic   conditions, particularly employment, show clear evidence of significant   improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers reported steady sales during September at a rate   slightly above the year-ago pace. Inventories were generally described as light,   and supplies of popular models were said to be particularly lean. Dealers expect   sales to improve slowly during the rest of this year and into next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total outstanding loan volume at most of the   Third District banks contacted for this report has been level since the last   Beige Book. Commercial bank lending officers said there has been virtually no   change in any credit category. Bankers continued to report slack demand for both   consumer and business loans. "Business loan demand is incredibly weak," one   said. Another banker said, "Credit line usage is well below normal." With low   demand for credit, some bankers reported increased competition among lenders,   especially for business loans. Commercial bank officers indicated that credit   quality has continued to improve as borrowers work down debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus outlook among the Third District bankers surveyed for this   report is that there will be minimal growth in lending until both consumers and   businesses regain confidence that the economy is improving. Several bankers said   that in recent discussions with their commercial customers, both business owners   and managers said they are postponing expansion and other capital spending   programs until current political and economic uncertainties are resolved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in residential real   estate markets reported some increases in sales of existing homes in recent   weeks but relatively flat sales of new homes. However, the recent sales rate   remained below the year-ago rate for both new and existing homes. Contacts   continued to report that lower-priced homes are selling at a relatively better   pace than higher-priced homes. Residential real estate contacts expect sales to   remain slow until overall economic conditions and the employment situation begin   to improve. Real estate contacts generally indicated that prices of existing   homes have shown little change recently. However, one agent reported that "more   sellers are just saying no to offers substantially below the asking price."
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that conditions have been mostly   unchanged in commercial and industrial markets since the last Beige Book.   Contacts reported that vacancy rates and rents have moved very little since   mid-year in most parts of the District. Among property types, market conditions   were said to be weakest for retail space. Some contacts also noted declining   demand for industrial space, where many firms have taken a "wait and see"   attitude toward new construction, according to one contact. Commercial real   estate contacts expect market conditions to improve very slowly, and some   estimate that a significant increase in nonresidential construction will not   begin until mid-2011 at the earliest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service-sector firms generally reported marginal   increases in activity since the previous Beige Book. Some contacts said growth   in customer counts, measures of output, or dollar value of sales had recently   fallen below their forecasts. Among firms providing services to both businesses   and individuals, there were several reports of increasing competition in terms   of pricing or level of service. In the current environment, "a lot of growth is   market share gains," one contact noted. Looking ahead, most of the service firms   contacted for this report expect growth to be slow for the rest of this year and   into next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on input costs and output prices   indicate little change since the last Beige Book. Most of the manufacturing   firms polled in September reported no change from August in the costs of the   commodities they use or the products they make. However, some producers of   primary metals raised prices. Construction firms gave mixed reports on prices,   with some noting steady materials costs and some indicating increases for steel,   lumber, and rubber products. Retailers generally noted that most wholesale costs   and retail prices have been steady, although some contacts noted recent   increased costs for some commodities and higher costs for international   shipping. One large retailer said foreign suppliers have indicated that they   plan to raise wholesale prices next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business firms in the region reported no major changes in wages, although   many continued to report current or prospective increases in costs for employee   health care benefits. Employers generally reported that they were not having   difficulty finding workers with requisite skills at current compensation levels.   Employment agencies reported that client companies are filling positions as   workloads increase, but do not appear to be adding employees in anticipation of   increased activity.
