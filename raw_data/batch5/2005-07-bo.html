      Beige Book Report: Boston

     <p>
      <b>
       July 27, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The First District economy continues to expand, with the exception of New England-based 

  retailers. Contacted retailers say sales are flat or down compared with a year 

  ago. By contrast, most responding manufacturers are enjoying 
  year-over-year 

  revenue growth, as are advertising and consulting firms in the region. Both 

  retailers and manufacturers report cost increases that they are unable to pass 

  along fully to their customers. New England's residential real estate markets 

  are still going strong, although the pace of activity and rate of increase in 

  home prices in Massachusetts are moving toward normal from "hot," and region-wide 

  inventories of homes for sale are rising somewhat toward more normal levels.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District retailers cite flat or poor sales results in the second quarter. 

  According to one contact, furniture sales are sluggish compared to this period 

  last year, and slowed in June and early July compared to May, possibly because 

  of good vacation weather and soaring gas prices. Another respondent reports 

  a slowdown in casual dining compared to previous months and year-ago levels 

  but remains unsure of the cause. A contact selling discount apparel and home 

  fashions relayed that business has been "okay," but still slightly below year-earlier 

  levels and below plan. Another contact selling apparel notes that year-over-year 

  sales are down, but believes that the decrease is due to poor merchandising 

  decisions and not a lack of consumer demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventory levels remain flat or have decreased according to most respondents. 

  One exception is the apparel retailer who has increased inventories in order 

  to shift to more-salable merchandise. Several retail contacts note cost increases 

  for utilities, steel-based items, and paper; they remain hesitant to pass these 

  increases on to customers. Employment levels are mostly steady, with increases 

  occurring only in connection with the opening of new stores. Respondents also 

  report increased capital spending associated with these new store openings, 

  as well as for improvements in distribution and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most contacted retailers are less optimistic than in previous months, and 

  remain cautious in their outlook. Many hope that sales will at least remain 

  flat compared with a year ago. Respondents also express uncertainty and caution 

  about consumer demand, rising healthcare costs, and geopolitical instability.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District contacts in manufacturing and related services mostly report 

  that sales and orders remain on an upward trajectory, with levels in the second 

  quarter of 2005 higher than a year earlier. Makers of aircraft, medical equipment, 

  pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and IT and information-related products used by 

  the financial services industry are doing particularly well. However, a fabric 

  manufacturer indicates that business is falling off, while a fabricated metals 

  firm reports a temporary downturn in sales to the automotive industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices for some materials and services continue to increase. Respondents cite 

  cost pressures from freight and transport, energy, and petrochemicals and other 

  synthetic products in particular. In general, manufacturers cannot fully pass 

  along these higher costs to their customers. Some have managed to offset margin 

  pressures by introducing greater efficiencies in purchasing and production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies are mostly keeping their domestic headcounts steady. A few are laying-off 

  employees or shortening the factory workweek. Hiring generally is restricted 

  to sales and marketing and high-end technical positions. Labor markets typically 

  are tight for these types of positions, but contacts do not complain of hiring 

  delays except for positions requiring government security clearance. Wage and 

  salary increases are mostly in the range of 3 to 3.5 percent. Most companies 

  are increasing their capital spending, but they describe their added investments 

  as modest or careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Respondents tend to characterize the revenue outlook in terms such as "satisfactory," 

  "decent," or "on plan." Companies in information-related businesses stress that 

  they expect to grow more slowly than in the 1990s. Manufacturers say they intend 

  to remain focused on cost containment, especially given their limited ability 

  to pass on high oil prices and competition from producers in low-cost locations 

  such as China.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Selected Business Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       New England advertising and management consulting companies experienced healthy 

  demand growth in the second quarter of 2005. Most companies believe clients 

  are now more liberal with their discretionary spending than they were in 2004. 

  Although still generally cautious, these clients seem to be shifting toward 

  strategies of growth and expansion, rather than focusing on efficiency. Responding 

  companies have earned moderate price increases over year-ago levels, but costs 

  are also increasing, most notably for labor. Headcounts are growing in response 

  to demand, but at a slightly slower rate than revenues. Looking forward, most 

  respondents call themselves optimistic and expect revenue growth in the second 

  half of 2005 to continue at the first-half pace or to go higher. Nonetheless, 

  contacts see the possibility of a general economic slowdown, higher oil prices, 

  or terrorism as sources of risk to their positive outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Residential Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate markets in New England remain strong and active. Contacts 

  report that brokers are busy throughout the region, even though markets typically 

  slow down this time of year. In Massachusetts, the number of sales of single-family 

  homes declined in April and May compared with year-earlier levels, but the number 

  of condominiums sold reached new record highs for both months. However, inventory 

  of both types increased and sale prices rose by only single digits compared 

  to last yearâ€”a more moderate rate of appreciation than in the last few reports. 

  Contacts in other states have not observed much slowdown in price appreciation. 

  Average sale prices have increased in Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and 

  Vermont. Nevertheless, some contacts report that there is "finally" a little 

  more inventory for buyers to choose from. Most contacts expect prices to continue 

  rising for the rest of the year.
