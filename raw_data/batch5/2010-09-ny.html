      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 8, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       On balance, the Second District's economy showed signs of decelerating since   the last report. Input prices have continued to rise moderately, while consumer   prices appear to be steady to down slightly. General merchandise retailers   report that sales have slowed since the last report, though auto dealers   categorize sales as fairly good. Commercial real estate markets have generally   been steady to softer since the last report. Residential real estate sales   markets weakened to very low levels, though New York City's rental market   continued to improve modestly. Manufacturing-sector contacts report some further   deceleration in business activity. Tourism activity in New York City has been   steady at a strong level since the last report, buoyed by rising business   travel. Overall, the labor market, though still slack, has shown further modest   signs of improvement. Finally, bankers report steady to weaker loan demand,   steady to higher delinquency rates and some tightening in credit standards, but   also some narrowing in loan spreads.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Non-auto retailers report that sales   have slowed across the District since the last report, with comparable-store   sales running just 2-3 percent ahead of a year earlier, on average, in July and   up just 1-2 percent in the first few weeks of August. The slowing has been   particularly pronounced at New York City stores. Two major shopping malls in   western New York State also report that sales weakened in July through early   August, and they report substantial discounting--especially at clothing   retailers. Despite this recent slowing, most contacts continue to report that   inventories generally remain at favorable levels. Contacts report steady to   modestly declining selling prices and acquisition costs. One contact notes that   steep discounting has been necessary to move merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto dealers in the Rochester area report that sales of new autos were down   roughly 10 percent from a year ago in July and down 15 to 20 percent in the   first half of August, while Buffalo-area dealers report a 5 percent   year-over-year increase in July and project a moderate decline in August. Still,   contacts in both areas describe the current sales pace as fairly good, with the   12-month comparisons depressed by last summer's "Cash for clunkers" program.   Dealers report that both retail and floor-plan credit conditions have continued   to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourism activity in New York City has been steady at a strong level since the   last report. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates remained close to 90   percent in July and August, even as the number of hotel rooms has risen by more   than 5 percent over the past year. Moreover, room rates continued to run 10-15   percent ahead of this time last year. Business travel has reportedly increased   in recent months, accounting for a growing share of revenues. Broadway theaters   report that attendance picked up a bit in the latter part of July and remained   brisk in August--up roughly 5 percent from a year earlier, though the average   ticket price was down 4 percent in August from comparable 2009 levels. Overall   revenues were up moderately from a year earlier in July but flat in the first   three weeks of August.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Housing markets have shown   further signs of softening since the last report, with much of the weakness   again attributed to the expiration of the home-buyer tax credit. Buffalo-area   Realtors say the market has cooled dramatically and describe home sales activity   as "totally dead" in July and early August; historically low mortgage rates are   said to be having little if any positive effect. They also report that pending   sales activity has fallen sharply and that the number of active listings has   increased. One contact in western New York State anticipates consolidation in   the real estate industry, as some agents and brokers are likely to merge or exit   the market. Across New York State more broadly, the number of sales transactions   fell by roughly half from June to July--a far steeper drop than the seasonal   norm--and was down 35 percent from a year earlier. The median reported sales   price rose in July and was up from a year earlier, though one industry contact   notes that this may reflect a shift in the mix, as the expiration of the tax   credit predominantly affected the lower end of the market. An authority on New   Jersey's housing industry reports that market conditions appear to be weak but   concedes that underlying fundamentals are difficult to gauge during this   perennially slow season. With builders holding off on new construction,   inventories have gotten quite low, though prices still seem to be drifting   lower. Most of the multi-family development along New Jersey's "Gold Coast"   (across from Manhattan) has now shifted to rentals.
      </p>
      <p>
       In New York City, conditions were more mixed. Activity in the city's co-op   and condo market has fallen off by somewhat more than the seasonal norm in July   and August, following a brisk second quarter; activity has dropped off   particularly sharply on Long Island and, in general, at the lower end of the   market. A leading appraisal firm reports that prices remain essentially flat in   Manhattan and across New York City generally. The appraisal business has   reportedly remained strong. Manhattan's rental market, though still somewhat   slack, has continued to recover: rental activity has remained stable at a   moderate level, while effective rents have rebounded--contract rents have risen   only modestly, but landlords are offer fewer concessions (i.e. fewer months free   rent). A considerable volume of new development will be coming onto the market,   probably largely as rentals, in the months ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Office markets across the District were generally steady to weaker since the   last report. Vacancy rates were steady throughout most of the District, though   they increased modestly in Manhattan and the Albany area. Asking rents were also   little changed overall; they edged up in the Long Island and Syracuse areas but   edged down in the northern New Jersey and Albany markets. Asking rents are still   down sharply from a year ago in Manhattan and down moderately in Long Island and   northern New Jersey; however, rents are up from a year ago in the Buffalo,   Syracuse and Albany areas. Industrial markets were also steady to weaker across   the District since the last report. Industrial vacancy rates rose modestly   across the New York City metro area and held steady in the Buffalo and Rochester   areas. Asking rents were generally down 3-4 percent from a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing firms in the   District report some leveling off in conditions in July and August, after   reporting fairly widespread improvement during the first half of the year.   However, a sizable number of manufacturing contacts indicate that they are   increasing employment. Non-manufacturing firms report ongoing improvement in   general business conditions and continue to report moderate increases in   employment; they remain fairly optimistic about the near term outlook. Both   manufacturers and other firms report ongoing increases in prices paid but only   modest changes in selling prices. Separately, a trade association survey of New   York State firms, conducted in July, indicates fairly widespread optimism about   revenue growth and notes that far more respondents plan to increase than   decrease head-counts in the next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       A major NYC employment agency, specializing in office jobs, reports that,   while the job market is difficult to gauge during the slow summer season, market   conditions appear to be improving gradually and conditions are not as dire as   last summer. The pool of available candidates is not as large as it was last   summer; however, some people who had given up looking are starting to come   back.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts at small to medium sized   banks in the District report decreased demand for consumer loans and commercial   mortgages, and steady demand for commercial and industrial loans. Demand for   residential mortgages picked up, but this may largely reflect refinancing of   existing loans (which rose sharply). Respondents indicate a tightening of credit   standards for all categories--particularly in the commercial mortgage category.   For the first time in well over a year, bankers report a decrease in spreads of   loan rates over costs of funds--primarily for residential mortgages. Bankers   report little or no change in spreads for other loan categories. Finally,   bankers' responses point to increased delinquency rates for residential   mortgages, commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans but little   change in delinquencies for consumer loans.
