      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to expand at a moderate 
  pace on net during the survey period of October through mid-November. Reduced 
  energy prices reversed upward price pressures for some products, while the pace 
  of wage growth remained contained overall but exerted upward price pressures 
  in some industries and areas. District retailers generally reported improved 
  sales and service providers saw strong demand. Orders and output grew further 
  for most manufacturers and agricultural producers. District housing markets 
  continued to cool, while demand for commercial real estate expanded but at a 
  slower pace than previously. Banks reported solid loan demand and good credit 
  quality in general.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures diminished somewhat, as prices for energy and related 
  products receded from previously high levels, reducing overall production costs 
  in some sectors. Prices fell further for selected building materials used primarily 
  for residential construction. More generally, respondents noted relatively stable 
  input prices. The primary exceptions were selected commodities such as flour 
  and sugar: significant price increases of late for these inputs are expected 
  to show up in the final prices of some food products in early 2007.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall wage growth remained moderate. However, wage growth continued to be 
  more rapid for selected groups of skilled workers, notably in the health-care, 
  finance, and construction sectors, and in areas with very tight labor markets 
  overall, such as Idaho and Utah. Scattered reports also suggested employers 
  were becoming increasingly reliant on using hiring bonuses to recruit skilled 
  workers who are in short supply. These compensation increases exerted noticeable 
  upward pressure on final prices in some cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported improved sales growth and balanced inventories for 
  items other than motor vehicles. Sales at department stores and specialty shops 
  picked up relative to the previous survey period, spurred in part by increased 
  spending power arising from lower gasoline prices. Considering early sales figures, 
  retailers are cautiously optimistic in their forecasts for the holiday season 
  as a whole, with expected sales growth generally in the range of 4 to 6 percent 
  relative to last year. Demand for automobiles weakened slightly compared with 
  the previous survey period. Sales of fuel-efficient import vehicles continued 
  at a solid but slightly reduced pace, while the recent drop in fuel prices did 
  little to offset sluggish sales for large, fuel-inefficient domestic models; 
  inventories of domestic light trucks and SUVs reportedly were at record highs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Service providers reported generally strong demand. Sales grew significantly 
  in the food and beverage, health-care, and transportation sectors. Contacts 
  in various sectors reported that fuel surcharges have been trimmed due to lower 
  energy costs, reducing the price of transportation services. Overall tourist 
  activity remained at high levels, although a Southern California contact noted 
  that recent convention business there has not kept pace with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for District manufactured products expanded further in October and early 
  November. Sales of semiconductors grew at a solid pace in line with industry 
  forecasts, and capacity utilization generally remained in the range of 90 percent. 
  Producers of commercial aircraft and their parts suppliers continued to operate 
  at full capacity to meet ongoing order backlogs, while makers of machine tools 
  indicated that new orders grew but at a slightly reduced pace. Food manufacturers 
  reported continued strong sales. By contrast, demand for selected building materials 
  used primarily for home building fell further, and some sawmills in the Pacific 
  Northwest have sharply curtailed production or closed due to reduced demand 
  for wood products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for District agricultural and resource-related products was strong and 
  production conditions were stable overall. Sales rose for livestock and most 
  crops, and prices received for these items increased compared with a year ago, 
  notably for selected commodities such as corn. Prices for fertilizers and freight 
  services have fallen significantly, easing upward pressures on production costs. 
  In the resources sector, producers of oil and natural gas continued to see robust 
  demand, although one contact reported that demand for natural gas slowed somewhat 
  due to reduced sales of new homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in residential real estate markets fell further, while demand for commercial 
  real estate expanded but at a slower pace than previously in some areas. The 
  pace of home sales and price appreciation continued to slow for existing and 
  new homes, with particularly weak conditions noted for the latter. To work down 
  unsold inventory, home builders have been offering significant incentives to 
  entice buyers; these incentives reportedly have been valued as high as 10 percent 
  of the listed prices. Residential construction activity has fallen substantially 
  along with demand for homes. On the nonresidential side, vacancy rates for commercial 
  space fell further and rents rose a bit in most areas. Construction activity 
  for commercial and public projects continued to expand, largely offsetting the 
  decline in residential construction, although the pace of growth was slower 
  than earlier in the year. Some contacts noted that investors and builders have 
  grown more cautious about committing to nonresidential projects, due in part 
  to the high costs of land, labor, and building materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported solid loan demand and good credit quality 
  overall. Further growth in commercial and industrial loans continued to offset 
  declines in residential mortgage originations. Demand for consumer loans fell 
  slightly in some areas but remained relatively strong. Credit quality was high 
  in general with few delinquencies. However, contacts provided scattered reports 
  of delinquencies on loans to home builders, and banks have increased their vigilance 
  over these loans. Venture capital and private equity financing reportedly remained 
  on a modest but steady growth path.
