      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       July 27, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District's solid economic expansion remained on track during the 

  survey period of early June through mid-July. Price inflation for final goods 

  and services moderated somewhat. Labor markets tightened further and an increasing 

  number of employers relied on incentive compensation to meet recruiting challenges. 

  District retailers and service providers reported sales gains, and growth in 

  manufacturing activity picked up following a slight lull during the previous 

  survey period. Demand rose further for District agricultural and resource-related 

  products. The pace of home sales and price appreciation remained rapid but slowed 

  slightly in some markets, while demand for commercial real estate continued 

  to improve. District banks reported strong loan demand and good credit quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported modest inflationary pressure on net in recent weeks. Energy 

  costs rose significantly, increasing prices of production inputs for which energy 

  costs are a significant component, such as transportation services, fertilizers, 

  and some construction materials. However, contacts in most sectors noted that 

  pricing power for final goods and services remained muted more generally, citing 

  vigorous competition from domestic and foreign producers and continued gains 

  in production efficiency as restraining factors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for labor increased, and District labor markets tightened further. 

  The most significant recruiting and retention challenges were reported for skilled 

  occupations in the financial, construction, information technology, and health-care 

  services sectors. Contacts in the agricultural, retail, services, and financial 

  sectors reported substantial reliance on temporary workers to meet demand. Although 

  wage growth generally remained in the modest range of 2 to 4 percent, contacts 

  in several areas reported rising use of incentive compensation, including signing 

  bonuses to attract qualified workers. Employer costs for health insurance benefits 

  remained on a relatively steep upward trajectory, causing total compensation 

  to rise more rapidly than wages and salaries. Looking ahead, about one-third 

  of respondents plan to increase their pace of hiring for permanent staff during 

  the second half of 2005 compared with the first half, and virtually none plan 

  to reduce their pace of hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales expanded during the survey period. Automobile sales climbed 

  substantially, as demand remained strong for imported makes and purchases of 

  domestic makes surged in response to price discounts by manufacturers. Sales 

  of apparel and other small retail items also rose, and prices for these items 

  generally were flat or fell because of extensive discounting.
     </p>
     <p>
      District service providers reported a substantial increase in demand on net. 

  Sales were robust for providers of food, transportation, and health-care services. 

  Contacts reported continued strong growth in tourist visits to key destination 

  states such as Hawaii, California, and Arizona, with further increases in hotel 

  occupancy rates and average daily room rates noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for District manufactured products picked up a bit, following a mild 

  slowdown during the previous survey period. Orders and sales of semiconductors 

  and other technology products generally remained at high levels. Makers of machine 

  tools and industrial equipment reported that demand expanded and was particularly 

  strong for small and medium-sized capital equipment items. Demand for commercial 

  aircraft and defense products grew further, and makers of these items reported 

  ample capacity to accommodate a rising number of new orders. Manufacturers of 

  certain construction materials, notably wallboard and roofing products, have 

  expanded capacity to meet booming demand, and sales of these products have increased 

  commensurately.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Orders and sales of District agricultural and resource-related products grew 

  further during the survey period of early June through mid-July. Demand was 

  strong and prices generally were stable for dairy products and most fruits and 

  vegetables, particularly for items filling market niches, such as organic foods. 

  Cattle sales and prices remained high, with little or no adverse impact from 

  recently renewed fears about the BSE ("mad cow") virus. In the energy sector, 

  producers of oil and natural gas continued to operate at or near full capacity, 

  and extensive new drilling is underway to help meet steadily growing demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand and sales of residential real estate remained vigorous in most parts 

  of the District, and demand for commercial real estate continued to improve. 

  The pace of home sales, price appreciation, and construction was rapid in most 

  areas, fueled in part by rising purchases of second homes and investment properties. 

  The market reportedly heated up further in some areas, such as Seattle, but 

  a few respondents reported evidence of slight cooling in parts of Southern California, 

  where houses remained on the market longer and price appreciation slowed. Demand 

  for commercial real estate strengthened further; office vacancy rates fell and 

  rental rates increased in many District markets, with especially strong demand 

  reported in Southern California. Growth in demand for residential and commercial 

  properties kept overall construction activity at high levels throughout the 

  District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that loan demand was strong overall and credit quality remained 

  good across all loan categories. The number of commercial and industrial loans 

  rose, and demand for construction, commercial real estate, and home loans remained 

  at high levels in most areas and grew further in some.
