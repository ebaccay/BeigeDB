      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 4, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     The economy of the Eighth  District weakened further since our previous report. Retail and auto sales were lower in January  and early February compared with a year ago.   Manufacturing activity continued to decrease and activity in the  services sector declined in most District areas.  Residential real estate markets continue to  be weak.  Reports from commercial and  industrial real estate market contacts were mixed.  Overall lending at a sample of large District  banks decreased moderately.
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported that retail  sales in January and early February were down, on average, over year-earlier  levels.  About 63 percent of the  retailers saw decreases in sales, while 33 percent saw increases.  About 47 percent of the respondents noted  that sales levels met their expectations, 37 percent reported that sales were  below what they had anticipated, and 16 percent reported sales above  expectations.  Apparel items were strong  sellers, while furniture moved more slowly.   About 58 percent of the contacts noted that inventories were at desired  levels, while 29 percent reported that inventories were too high, and 13  percent reported that inventories were too low.   The sales outlook among the retailers for March and April is  pessimistic.  About 72 percent of the  retailers expect sales to decrease over 2008 levels, while 28 percent expect  sales to increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Car dealers reported that,  compared with last year, sales in January and early February were down, on  average.  About 74 percent of the car  dealers surveyed reported a decrease in sales, while 9 percent reported the opposite.  About 35 percent of the car dealers noted  that used car sales had increased relative to new car sales.  About 48 percent reported more rejections of  finance applications.  About 42 percent  of the car dealers surveyed reported that their inventories were too high  (mostly for new cars), while 17 percent reported that their inventories were  too low (mostly for used or low-end cars).   About 62 percent of the car dealers expect decreased sales over 2008  levels for March and April, but 24 percent expect sales to increase.  The remaining contacts expect sales to be  similar to last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity continued  to decline since our previous survey.   Several manufacturers reported plans to reduce operations and lay off  workers, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to open plants and  expand operations.  Firms in the auto  parts, rubber products, machinery products, household appliance products,  electrical equipment, and wood product manufacturing industries reported plans  to lay off workers because of weak product demand.  Firms in steel product, primary metal, and  heavy metal manufacturing also reported job losses and temporary plant  shutdowns.  Several auto parts and auto  manufacturers offered early retirement buyouts to reduce their labor  forces.  In contrast, firms in the heavy  machinery and household appliance manufacturing industries reported plans to  open new facilities, and contacts in the plastics/rubber products and airplane  manufacturing industries reported plans to expand existing facilities and  operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The District's services sector  continued to decline in most areas since our previous report.  Firms in the leisure/hospitality, business  support, education, and transportation services industries cut jobs.  In addition, firms in medical services,  transportation services, business support services, and information services  reduced payroll expenses through pay cuts, required time off without pay, or  demotions.  In contrast, two contacts in  the financial services industry reported plans to expand operations and hire  additional workers.  A firm in business  support services also hired new workers to handle increased demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Home sales remained weak  throughout the Eighth District.  Compared  with the same period in 2008, January 2009 home sales were down 14 percent in  St. Louis, 23 percent in Little Rock, 34 percent in Louisville, and 39  percent in Memphis.  Residential  construction also remained weak throughout the District.  December 2008 year-to-date single-family  housing permits fell in nearly all District metro areas compared with the same  period in 2007.  Permits declined 35  percent in Little Rock, 42 percent in Louisville, 43 percent in St. Louis,  and 59 percent in Memphis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate market  conditions were mixed throughout the District while commercial construction  markets were generally slow.  Compared  with third-quarter 2008, fourth-quarter 2008 industrial vacancy rates decreased  in Little Rock and Louisville but increased in Memphis and St. Louis.  During the same period, suburban office  vacancy rates decreased in Louisville and Memphis but increased in Little Rock  and St. Louis.  Downtown office  vacancy rates decreased in Memphis but increased in St. Louis, Louisville,  and Little Rock.  A contact in northeast  Arkansas reported that overall commercial construction is at a standstill.  A commercial construction contact in  Louisville reported fewer requests for new project bids as business owners are  holding back in the uncertain environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A survey of senior loan officers  at a sample of large District banks showed a moderate decrease in overall  lending activity during the fourth quarter of 2008.  During this period, credit standards for commercial  and industrial loans tightened somewhat, while demand for these loans was  moderately weaker.  Credit standards for  commercial real estate loans were tightened somewhat, while demand for these  loans was moderately weaker.  Meanwhile,  credit standards for consumer loans ranged from unchanged to tightened  somewhat, while demand ranged from moderately weaker to moderately  stronger.  Credit standards for  residential mortgage loans ranged from unchanged to tightened somewhat, while  demand for these loans ranged from about the same to moderately weaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Natural Resources
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Total production of corn,  sorghum, and cotton decreased from 2007 to 2008, while total production of  soybeans, winter wheat, and tobacco increased, and total production of rice did  not change.  The prices of winter wheat,  rice, and tobacco increased from 2007 to 2008 in all District states that  produced them, while the prices of corn, sorghum, and cotton were mixed among  states, and the price of soybeans was down in most states.  The total value of field crops in District  states fell by 1 percent from 2007 to 2008.
