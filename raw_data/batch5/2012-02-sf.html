      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to grow at a moderate   pace during the reporting period of January through mid-February. Price   increases for final goods and services were limited, and upward wage pressures   were minimal. Sales of retail items rose on balance, and demand improved   modestly for business and consumer services. District manufacturing was mixed   but appeared to expand overall. Demand grew further for agricultural producers   but was uneven for providers of energy resources. Activity in District housing   markets remained sluggish, and demand for nonresidential real estate stayed weak   overall. Financial institutions reported a small increase in overall loan   demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures remained very   limited during the reporting period. While price increases were reported for   some commodities, including oil and assorted construction materials such as   cement and wallboard, declines were noted for others, such as natural gas. Price   increases for most goods and services continued to be restrained by weak final   demand and stiff competition among businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were quite modest, as high levels of unemployment and   limited demand for new workers kept a lid on compensation gains. However,   contacts continued to point to notable increases in the costs of employee   benefits, particularly in regard to defined benefit pension plans, although they   reported slight easing in upward pressures on health benefit costs. Consistent   with prior periods, upward wage pressures remained pronounced for workers with   specialized skills in the application of information technology in assorted   sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales continued to   expand. Modest improvements in sales were reported for general merchandise such   as apparel and smaller household items, with stronger gains noted for   traditional department stores than for discount chains. Demand also improved   modestly for retailers of major appliances and furniture, but it remained   lackluster for electronics. Sales held relatively stable for grocers, although   upscale chains saw gains. For retailers of pet products, demand continued to   show robust growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business and consumer services rose a bit on net. Sales grew   further for providers of technology services to businesses and consumers.   Similarly, demand for professional services such as legal services and   accounting ticked up on balance. For providers of health-care services, demand   was largely stable, with declines in inpatient admissions and surgeries offset   by higher emergency room visits. Sales activity was reported to be largely   unchanged for restaurants and other food-service providers. Conditions in the   District's travel and tourism industry continued to strengthen, reflecting   growth in both the business and tourism segments of the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District was   mixed but appeared to expand further during the reporting period of January   through mid-February. Manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology   products reported moderate sales gains; reports of ongoing investments in   information technology equipment by firms in most sectors suggest that demand   growth is likely to continue for these manufacturers. For makers of commercial   aircraft and parts, strong demand for narrow-body aircraft along with an   extensive order backlog kept production rates near capacity. Activity was   essentially flat for metal fabricators, and slack demand combined with a   diminishing backlog have raised concerns that production activity may decline   going forward. Capacity utilization rates for petroleum refiners held largely   stable as robust global demand for distillate products, especially from Latin   America, continued to offset weak domestic demand for gasoline. Output and sales   of wood products remained extremely weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand   continued to improve for agricultural products and mined metals, but it was   mixed for natural resources used for energy production. Orders and final sales   grew further for most crops and livestock products, with little or no change   indicated for the cost and availability of inputs. Mining activity in parts of   the District expanded further for a variety of precious metals and metallic   elements used for specialized industrial purposes. Strong foreign demand for oil   prompted additional increases in extraction activity. By contrast, warm weather   held down demand for natural gas relative to seasonal norms, causing further   declines in recent and planned extraction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home demand in the District   persisted at very low levels, and conditions were little changed for commercial   real estate. The sales pace for new and existing homes remained quite subdued,   although scattered reports suggested modest improvement. Inventories of   available homes stayed quite high, putting continued downward pressure on prices   and construction activity. By contrast, demand for rental space remained robust,   prompting further increases in construction of multifamily units. Conditions in   commercial real estate markets were largely unchanged, and vacancy rates for   office and industrial space stayed high in most parts of the District. However,   additional declines in vacancy rates were noted for selected geographic areas   such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. Contacts also noted recent   improvement in financing availability and investor activity for well-leased   office buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District banking and   business contacts indicated that loan demand improved a bit overall compared   with the prior reporting period. The volume of new commercial and industrial   loans edged up. The reports suggested that businesses generally remained very   cautious in regard to capital spending decisions, but many continued to invest   in information technology equipment aimed at enhancing productivity. Moreover,   many businesses expect to modestly increase their capital spending in the first   half of the year compared with the second half of last year, suggesting that   growth in business loan demand may continue. The reports also noted continued   stiff competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and   medium-sized businesses, placing further downward pressure on loan rates and   fees. Strong recent financial performance by technology companies backed by   venture capital reportedly has spurred further investments of late. On the   consumer side, the reports suggested little change in loan demand. Contacts   reported slight improvement in overall credit availability, although lending   standards remained relatively restrictive for many types of business and   consumer loans.
