      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on   information collected on or before August 20, 2012. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic   activity continued to expand gradually in July and early August across most   regions and sectors. Six Districts indicated the local economy continued to   expand at a modest pace and another three cited moderate growth; among the   latter, Chicago noted that the pace of growth had slowed from the prior period.   The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported slow growth in most sectors and   declines in manufacturing, while Boston cited mixed reports from business   contacts and some slowdown since the previous report.
       <p>
        Most Districts indicated that retail activity, including auto sales, had   increased since the last Beige Book report, although Cleveland, Chicago, St.   Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco noted the retail improvements were small.   Atlanta said that retail growth had slowed, while Philadelphia indicated growth   in retail sales was somewhat faster than in the previous report. Boston, New   York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco recorded strong   performance in tourism. Many Districts reported some softening in manufacturing,   either a slowdown in the rate of growth or a decline in the level of sales,   output, or orders; among those with declining shipments and orders, Philadelphia   noted that the rate of decline was tempering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Districts mentioning nonfinancial services noted increased activity, although   at a slowing pace in Boston, softening in New York, and "flattening" in   Philadelphia; Kansas City reported that sales of high-tech services declined   slightly. Several Districts cited declining demand for staffing services.   According to District reports, bankers in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland,   Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City saw increases in demand for most loan types in   recent months; by contrast, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that   loan demand was mixed, softening, or slightly weaker.
       </p>
       <p>
        Real estate markets were generally said to be improving. On the residential   side, all 12 Districts cited increases in home sales, home prices, or housing   construction. Reports on commercial real estate markets were also generally   positive, although San Francisco noted stable demand, Boston indicated   conditions were not much changed since the last report, and Richmond, Chicago,   and St. Louis said commercial real estate conditions were mixed.
       </p>
       <p>
        District reports indicated that energy and mining activity was generally high   and increasing. However, Cleveland noted softening demand for coal, while   Minneapolis and Kansas City had some energy sectors up and some down. The   Midwest drought has reduced actual and expected farm output, especially cotton,   soybean, and/or corn crops in the Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most Districts reported that the selling prices of manufacturing and retail   products were largely stable. By exception, several Districts noted concerns   about rising agricultural commodity prices, and Richmond mentioned a small   uptick in retail prices. Hiring was said to be modest across the Districts, and   wage pressures were characterized as contained.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending and Tourism
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most Districts reported   that retail spending in July and early August was up compared with the previous   Beige Book. New York and San Francisco noted strengthening sales compared with a   softer May and June, although in San Francisco's case, the rise was only "a bit   further." Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported stronger   retail sales, while Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas all said that   sales were up "slightly." In the Atlanta District, most retail contacts reported   slower sales, while Boston's retail contacts provided a mixed assessment. The   Atlanta and San Francisco reports noted that discount retailers performed better   than traditional department stores, while the Chicago report attributed the pace   of growth in consumer spending to heavy discounting by retailers clearing space   for back-to-school items. Boston and Chicago reported continuing weakness in   furniture sales; Boston also reported weak sales of electronics, but Chicago   noted some improvement in this category. Adult clothing sold well in Boston,   Chicago, and Dallas. The Atlanta District said that luxury goods merchants,   while still largely positive, provided more mixed reports compared with earlier   this year; Kansas City cited weaker sales for high-end jewelry. For the   remainder of 2012, Boston retailers have mixed sales expectations, Philadelphia   retailers are cautiously optimistic, and those in Atlanta are conservative;   retail contacts in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas expect sales to rise   through the end of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Automobile sales are up in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis,   Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, flat in Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas,   and a bit slower paced in Richmond and San Francisco; nonetheless, vehicle   demand in the latter two Districts is still strong, especially for used cars.   The New York District reported that new car sales are "particularly robust" and   Kansas City cited a sharp increase in new vehicle sales. Atlanta, St. Louis, and   Kansas City indicated that car dealers in their Districts expected these strong   automobile sales to continue, while the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts   reported concerns that consumer uncertainty might depress vehicle sales in   coming months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondents in the Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San   Francisco Districts reported that tourist industry performance remains strong.   The Atlanta District mentioned that Florida contacts reported a drop in European   travelers, but said this decline was offset by an increase in business from   Central and South America. Contacts in Boston noted some concern that weakness   in Europe could soften tourist activity and that rising gas prices could affect   leisure travel. The San Francisco District reported that the pace of growth had   slowed in Las Vegas and other areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing and Related Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The picture in   manufacturing was mixed. The Boston, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco   Districts reported increasing demand and sales since the previous Beige Book,   although the improvement was generally small and uneven, with two of these four   Districts reporting that demand growth, while positive, was slowing. Six   Districts reported that demand for manufactured goods was actually falling,   although none reported a dramatic fall. The outlook was somewhat more positive,   with six Districts reporting that manufacturers expected increasing demand and   only two reporting the opposite.
       </p>
       <p>
        Areas of strength were varied. The Cleveland and Philadelphia Districts both   pointed to the revolution in natural gas production in the United States as a   driver of demand, but the Chicago District said that a contact blamed cheap   natural gas for weakness in demand for coal. Several Districts noted that   improvements in residential construction boosted demand for products such as   lumber, PVC, cement, and home goods. The Chicago and Philadelphia Districts said   that auto production was positive, but Richmond said the opposite.
       </p>
       <p>
        Weakness overseas remains a problem for U.S. manufacturing. Reports from the   Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts explicitly mentioned it. Although Europe   represented one notable problem, several Districts also mentioned weakness in   demand in Asia as an issue. In general, District reports indicate that the cost   and availability of raw materials has not been an issue for manufacturers   recently, especially as compared with the situation in previous years. Four   Districts reported lower input costs, but contacts in New York reported a slight   increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the employment front, there was little movement. Across all Districts, few   manufacturing firms reported any major hiring or layoffs, and the ones that did   usually attributed it to idiosyncratic factors like new products or   restructuring related to a merger. The Cleveland District reported that firms   continued to have trouble finding skilled workers. Capital spending also showed   little change; in addition, several Districts reported that contacted   manufacturers had not revised their investment plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Nonfinancial Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Activity in nonfinancial services   generally picked up since the previous report, although results were mixed   across Districts and service industries. New York and Philadelphia reported that   overall service-sector activity was flat to down slightly, whereas Minneapolis   and San Francisco noted expanding activity. Several Districts, including Boston,   Richmond, and San Francisco, reported steady to increasing demand for   information technology services; Kansas City, by contrast, cited decreased sales   at high-tech services firms. Reports from the healthcare sector were also   somewhat mixed, with Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting positive results and   San Francisco noting a drop in the frequency of elective procedures. Advertisers   in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts continued to report strong   revenues. In the Dallas District, legal firms reported continued increases in   demand for services, while accounting firms cited seasonal slowness. Demand for   staffing services was generally lower than expected, with decreases reported by   Boston, New York, Richmond, and Dallas. Even so, demand remained strong for   highly skilled IT personnel in the Boston and Richmond Districts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports on transportation services were generally positive. Rail contacts   reported continued increases in intermodal shipments in the Atlanta District and   increased cargo volumes in the Dallas District, with both Districts recognizing   gains in lumber shipments. Atlanta and Dallas also reported steady to increasing   demand for trucking services, whereas logistics firms and carriers in the   Philadelphia District reported a relatively sluggish start to the traditional   "freight season."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Banking and Financial Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Credit conditions have   improved over the reporting period according to District reports. Credit spreads   were lower and competition for high-quality borrowers among lending institutions   has increased. The New York District noted that shrinking spreads were observed   particularly in commercial and industrial loans as well as in commercial   mortgages. Some bankers in the Cleveland District mentioned a moderate loosening   of lending guidelines. The New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts   reported unchanged credit standards; New York and Cleveland cited declining   delinquency rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        The direction and magnitude of changes in loan demand varied among the   Districts and also with respect to type of loan. The Richmond and Atlanta   Districts reported generally low demand for loans, but some pockets of growth.   The Chicago District noted that growth in business loan demand was generated   mostly from small and mid-size firms and for the purpose of refinancing rather   than financing capital expenditures. Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco   mentioned small positive or negative changes in business credit demand, and   relatively strong demand for consumer credit. The Kansas City District reported   stable demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate   loans, while Dallas noted softer demand for loans overall; however, both   Districts cited increases in demand for residential real estate loans. The New   York and Philadelphia Districts observed growth in most lending categories.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Real Estate and Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Housing markets across most   Districts exhibited signs of improvement, with sales and construction continuing   to increase. Dallas reported significant levels of buyer traffic, Richmond noted   strong pending sales, and Minneapolis and St. Louis mentioned increases in   building permits. New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago indicated improvements as   well, but characterized the progress as slow and modest. Declines in inventory   levels were reported in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San   Francisco; these declining inventories put some upward pressure on prices   according to Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas. A reduction in the stock of distressed   properties was mentioned in New York, Richmond, and San Francisco. In   Philadelphia and Kansas City, the possibility of shadow inventory entering the   market remains a concern. In general, outlooks were positive, with continued   increases in activity expected, although the projected gains were more modest in   Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial real estate market conditions held steady or improved in nearly   all Districts in recent weeks. New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas   City all reported that commercial leasing increased and vacancy rates fell. New   York and Kansas City reported increases in office rents as well; Kansas City   also cited a rise in commercial construction. Commercial building permits were   up significantly from one year ago in portions of the Minneapolis District.   Chicago's report was mixed: office vacancy rates remained high, restraining   demand for new office construction, but office leasing demand improved modestly   and industrial construction picked up. Atlanta reported rising apartment rents   and small gains in office leasing, with weakness in the retail and industrial   sectors. Boston reported that office fundamentals were flat on average, with   rising rents in portions of Boston proper and muted but steady activity   elsewhere in the District. Nonresidential construction picked up in the Boston   and Cleveland Districts. Office and industrial real estate markets remained   healthy in Dallas. The St. Louis report noted an increase in commercial   construction across much of the District and varied reports on leasing across   areas within the District. In San Francisco, demand for commercial property was   stable while commercial construction was limited. Richmond reported a decline in   office leasing volume in Washington, D.C., but some portions of the District   recorded increasing sales and construction. Multifamily real estate remained a   strong submarket and a key driver of construction in many Districts, including   Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis,   Dallas, and San Francisco.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Agriculture and Natural Resources
        </strong>
        <br/>
        According to District   reports, agricultural conditions were mixed largely because of severe drought   conditions that affected the Midwest more than the rest of the country.   Producers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts were all severely   affected by the drought, with cotton, soybean, and corn crops particularly   damaged. Cotton production in the Dallas District was also badly damaged, while   the northern part of the Minneapolis District reported good corn, soybean, and   wheat crops, and the San Francisco and Richmond Districts reported strong demand   for their healthy cotton crops. Although nearly all agricultural commodity   prices rose, higher feed costs led to reduced herd sizes and lower livestock   prices in nearly all Districts reporting on livestock. Reports from the Richmond   and Kansas City Districts indicated that farmland values have continued to rise,   although contacts in the Kansas City District expected them to hold steady for   the rest of the year. Farm incomes generally rose or stayed the same in the   Minneapolis District.
       </p>
       <p>
        Oil and gas activity continued to be robust across most Districts. Extraction   of natural gas and petroleum remained at high levels in the Dallas and   Minneapolis Districts and expanded in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts,   partly because of increased demand from electrical utilities. Production   increased in Gulf Coast oil refineries in the Atlanta District as a result of   closures along the East Coast, while higher demand for crude oil, diesel, and   other distillates supported prices. However, natural gas producers in the   Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported a decline in   exploration and drilling of new wells on account of high inventories and low   prices. Coal demand was unchanged from 2011 in the St. Louis District but was   expected to fall below 2011 levels in the Cleveland District due to reduced   demand for thermal coal from domestic utilities and metallurgical coal from   Europe and Asia. Iron ore, taconite, and sand mines in the Minneapolis District   continued to operate at high capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Employment, Wages, and Prices
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most Districts reported   that employment was holding steady or growing only slightly. Several Districts   including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond noted a softening in   employment relative to expectations; upcoming layoffs were reported by a defense   contractor in the Boston District and by firms in sectors such as air   transportation, appliances, and business support services in the St Louis   District. Almost all Districts indicated that manufacturers were continuing to   hire, albeit modestly. Demand has been strongest for skilled manufacturing and   engineering positions, as well as for IT services. Contacts in the Cleveland,   Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts all reported some   difficulty meeting demand for truck drivers.
       </p>

        Overall, upward wage pressure was reported to be very contained across   Districts. The Philadelphia and Chicago Districts both noted that despite little   wage pressure, some contacts reported upward pressures for medical benefits.   Sources from Boston and Atlanta mentioned that continuing demand was putting   some upward pressure on wages for highly-skilled positions in software,   engineering, and information technology. The San Francisco District also noted   specialized IT positions as an exception to generally limited wage growth. The   Dallas District reported upward wage pressure for truck drivers and construction   workers, and the Minneapolis District noted wage increases in areas with   increased oil drilling.

        Most Districts reported that overall prices for finished goods were   relatively stable despite somewhat increased input prices. Higher prices for   grain and other food commodities were cited by many Districts, primarily due to   the drought. The Cleveland District noted increased upward pressure on lumber   prices, while contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis reported higher   gasoline prices as a potential concern. Chicago mentioned some pass-through of   higher crop prices to wholesale prices, while contacts in the Kansas City and   Richmond Districts expected to raise future prices in response to more expensive   raw materials.
