      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on   information collected before November 14, 2012. This document summarizes   comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
       </strong>
       <p>
        Economic activity expanded at a measured pace in recent weeks,   according to reports from contacts in the twelve Federal Reserve Districts.   Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco   grew at a modest pace, while St. Louis and Minneapolis indicated a somewhat   stronger increase in activity. In contrast, Boston reported a slower rate of   growth. Weaker conditions in New York were attributed to widespread disruptions   at the end of October and into November caused by Hurricane Sandy. Philadelphia   reported general weakness that was exacerbated by the hurricane. However, in the   Boston and Richmond Districts, the storm's effects were mostly limited. Contacts   in a number of Districts expressed concern and uncertainty about the federal   budget, especially the fiscal cliff.
        <p>
         Among key sectors, consumer spending grew at a moderate pace in most   Districts, while manufacturing weakened, on balance. Seven of the twelve   Districts reported either slowing or outright contraction in manufacturing, and   two others gave mixed reports. In some cases, such as high-tech equipment and   steel production, an industry slowed in one District while strengthening in   another. Several Districts reported slight gains in residential and commercial   real estate. Travel and tourism varied by District; for example, Minneapolis   contacts marked levels of activity above a year ago, and tourism fell in the   Kansas City District. Non-financial services also differed among Districts, with   Philadelphia businesses indicating softer demand, while firms in other Districts   reported pockets of robust demand for professional, scientific, and technical   services. In transportation, reports were, again, mixed. In addition, hurricane   disruptions slowed freight shipments in some Districts, while simultaneously   boosting demand for shipments of emergency supplies. In banking and financial   services, higher demand for home mortgage loans and auto loans increased   consumer lending in some Districts, although small business loan demand was   generally described as weaker to only moderately higher. Credit quality improved   on net.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed, as drought conditions   persisted in several Districts, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City; other   areas reported solid production and, in some cases, increased investment. In the   energy sector, extraction expanded on balance in San Francisco and activity   remained at high levels in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts. However, there   were fewer active oil rigs in Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. In   addition, coal production fell in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. Most   Districts reported modest gains in hiring, while wage and price pressures   remained mostly subdued. Employment increased in more than half of the twelve   Districts. Wage growth was described as modest at best, constrained in part by   an abundant labor supply. However, a few Districts reported pockets of strength   in wage growth, notably in North Dakota, where oil drilling had pushed up demand   for workers, and in the Kansas City District, where wages were rising for   specialized workers in transportation, high-tech, and energy. San Francisco   reported stronger wage growth for truck drivers and health-care workers. Price   increases, for the most part, remained in line with the modest pace reported in   our last assessment. Examples of some exceptions were input prices for   construction in Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.   Richmond reported generally slower retail price increases, and in Chicago,   retail food prices eased, except for meats. In contrast, Kansas City contacts   indicated that retail prices had edged up.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Consumer Spending and Tourism
          <br/>
         </strong>
         Consumer spending   increased at a moderate pace in most Districts in recent weeks, with mixed   reports from Dallas. In New York, sales were ahead of plan prior to Hurricane   Sandy, and merchants expect to recoup sales lost during the storm as residents   replace destroyed or damaged property. Philadelphia contacts reported slower   growth since the last report. Apparel sales picked up in Boston, and Richmond   indicated that home and garden stores reported stronger sales ahead of Hurricane   Sandy. Durable goods sales varied across Districts. For example, Boston and   Chicago noted an improvement in furniture, while sales in that category declined   in Cleveland. Chicago reported flattening in electronics sales, whereas San   Francisco contacts reported significant sales gains for consumer technology   products.
        </p>
        <p>
         Automobile sales varied by District, with Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis,   and San Francisco indicating strength. Sales of both new and used vehicles in   the San Francisco District were reported as running well above year-ago levels.   Car sales were strong in Atlanta, although a bit less robust than earlier in the   year. Richmond car sales were mixed. New York contacts said sales had flattened,   and sales held steady in Kansas City. In contrast, auto sales slowed in   Philadelphia and new vehicle sales fell at dealerships contacted by Chicago and   Dallas. Sales of used vehicles were also mixed. Used car sales remained robust   in New York and rose in Cleveland, with Cleveland District inventories remaining   tight; in St. Louis, a majority of dealerships noted that used car sales had   decreased relative to new car purchases, and in Minneapolis, used car sales   softened.
        </p>
        <p>
         Looking to the holiday sales season, the Districts whose contacts gave an   outlook noted mostly upbeat expectations. New York retailers anticipated   recovering lost sales during the holiday season, and in Philadelphia,   expectations remained bright overall for holiday sales, despite somewhat less   optimism among general retailers. Boston contacts indicated that they were   positioning their businesses for increased internet sales, and a Richmond   retailer commented that he was competing with his suppliers for online sales.   While retailers anticipated a good holiday season in Minneapolis, mall contacts   reported recent declines in traffic and sales. Contacts in Boston, Cleveland,   and Chicago remarked on their uncertain sales expectations because of the   potential for tax changes in 2013, as the national budget outlook remained   uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tourism slowed in some Districts while strengthening in others. New York   District tourism was mixed prior to Hurricane Sandy; hotel bookings initially   dropped off following the storm, but business bounced back the next week. In   addition, late cancellation of the New York marathon likely brought large   numbers of visitors to the city in early November. Hurricane Sandy affected   areas of the Philadelphia District along the coastlines of Delaware and southern   New Jersey, in some cases demolishing houses and devastating businesses. New   Jersey also suffered losses in revenue from the closure of Atlantic City casinos   and the cancellation or delay of conventions there; expectations were that most   areas along the Jersey shore would be rebuilt and ready for the summer season.   Richmond reported seasonally slower autumn bookings, along with scattered   cancellations caused by Hurricane Sandy, and in the Kansas City District,   tourism spending fell, leading to price reductions by hoteliers. In contrast,   travel and tourism remained strong in Atlanta, with international visitors   bolstering activity in Florida and District convention bookings picking up. The   exception there was at cruise lines, for which bookings continued to fall below   expectations. Travel and tourism rose in Minneapolis.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Nonfinancial Services
          <br/>
         </strong>
         Reports from nonfinancial services   providers differed among Districts. Boston reports were generally weaker than   expected for tech services, while New York businesses indicated that the effects   of Hurricane Sandy had negatively impacted both workers and customers. In the   New York District, prolonged power and communications outages and extreme   flooding hurt firms and residents, particularly on Long Island and in northern   New Jersey. Slowing demand for nonfinancial services in the Philadelphia   District was further hampered by the hurricane. St. Louis reported a net   decline, but with expansion in some categories such as business support,   telecommunications, casinos, legal, and crisis management services. Dallas noted   steady demand overall, and contacts reported robust demand for insurance, audit,   and legal services. However, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported   net expansion, with examples of growth at engineering, technology, and   architectural firms. A number of contacts across Districts expressed uncertainty   about business conditions for the months ahead as the firms and their customers   waited for the outcome of federal budget negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Transportation sector activity was generally mixed since the last assessment.   Dallas noted that intermodal cargo volumes were down. Declines in rail cargo   volumes were led by such products as coal, metals, and forest materials. Atlanta   also cited declines in coal shipments, due to softening global demand for   metallurgical coal and less demand from domestic utility plants. Cleveland   reported fewer freight shipments, which their contacts attributed to hurricane   disruptions and weakness in Europe, even as freight demand was boosted by   housing, motor vehicles, and retail. Kansas City also noted a pickup in trucking   traffic due to emergency food shipments in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Shippers   in that District also reported an increase in their capital expenditures.   According to contacts for the Dallas District, domestic airline demand was flat   to down, and in the St. Louis District, air transportation firms announced plans   to reduce operations.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Manufacturing
          <br/>
         </strong>
         Conditions in the manufacturing sector were   mixed, though on balance, most Districts reported that conditions had weakened   since the previous report. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago,   Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported that activity had either slowed   or declined somewhat, with most reports leaning toward the latter. Activity was   mixed in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, while reports from the   Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts were positive. The Boston, Dallas,   and San Francisco Districts noted slower growth for information technology   equipment, while business activity expanded at high-tech firms in the Kansas   City District. Car and auto parts producers in the Atlanta District said that   orders softened slightly. Similarly, auto production in the Cleveland District   declined somewhat for domestic nameplates but increased for foreign nameplates.   In contrast, heavy equipment and auto industries remained sources of strength in   the Chicago and the Kansas City Districts. Demand was flat to down for   transportation equipment in the Dallas District, and the Philadelphia District   indicated that makers of primary metals, industrial machinery, and electronic   equipment reported further declines.
        </p>
        <p>
         Noteworthy gains in manufacturing related to the aerospace industry were   reported in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, while demand for aviation   equipment held steady in Dallas. Steel production was down slightly in   Cleveland, while the demand for steel in the San Francisco District improved a   bit from low levels. Manufacturing contacts from five of the twelve Districts   expressed concern about the outlook for 2013, in part, due to the uncertainty   regarding the outcome of the fiscal cliff.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Real Estate and Construction
          <br/>
         </strong>
         Overall, markets for   single-family homes continued to improve across most Districts with the   exception of Boston and Philadelphia. Residential real estate markets in the New   York District were mixed but generally firm prior to the storm. Selling prices   were steady or rising. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and   Dallas noted declining or tight inventories. The Cleveland District indicated   that the number of single-family housing starts had increased since our last   report and from a year ago; most sales contracts were in higher price-point   categories. Similarly, Richmond noted more residential work in the high-end home   category for the first time in three years, and builders cited significant   pent-up demand in the first-time buyer segment. Atlanta indicated that existing   home sales were up slightly compared to a year ago and reported that investors   were more active in Florida than in the rest of the District. In Chicago,   residential construction increased at a slow but steady pace in October and   early November, and construction increased for single-family as well as   multi-family homes. St. Louis reported that residential real estate market   conditions continued to improve, and Minneapolis indicated that segments of   construction and real estate were growing at a double-digit clip. Kansas City   characterized residential real estate activity as brisk and noted that a solid   rise in home sales had reduced home inventories. Dallas noted that single-family   housing activity remained strong, with both new and existing home sales activity   increasing. San Francisco reported that home demand continued to strengthen and   that home sales continued to grow on a sustained basis in most areas, spurring   new home construction. However, sales growth generally slowed for both the   condominium and single-family home markets in the Boston District, and the   Philadelphia District noted that October began as a disappointing month for some   Realtors, only to be punctuated by Hurricane Sandy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Construction and commercial real estate activity generally improved across   Districts since the last report. Gains, albeit modest in most cases, were   reported by Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis. The gains among   Cleveland's contacts were tempered by reports in recent weeks of a slowdown in   inquiries and a decline in public-sector projects. Kansas City described   activity as holding firm and noted that real estate markets remained stronger   than a year ago. Demand for office and industrial space continued to increase in   Dallas, although contacts at some businesses said they were "holding back on   expansions due to uncertainty." Several Districts noted segments of little   change in commercial real estate activity. Boston described market fundamentals   as flat, and San Francisco depicted market conditions as stable but with pockets   of strength for large infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges.   Commercial and industrial conditions were mixed in the St. Louis District and   throughout most of New York prior to the hurricane. New York added that, while   office markets across upstate New York were unaffected by the storm, there were   some signs of recent softening.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Banking and Financial Services
          <br/>
         </strong>
         Loan demand generally was   either mixed or slightly stronger across most Districts in recent weeks. Among   those noting mixed results, New York reported that demand for consumer and   especially commercial and industrial loans weakened, but commercial and   residential mortgage demand was steady. Richmond said that a small commercial   banker was encountering a slight improvement in overall loan demand but added   that consumer loans were unchanged from "meager" levels and small business loans   were virtually non-existent. Chicago noted that small business loan demand   experienced modest growth, but a decrease in credit demand occurred among   middle-market customers. According to St. Louis contacts, overall lending   activity was essentially unchanged over the period. St. Louis added that, while   credit standards for commercial and industrial loans were largely unchanged,   both the demand for these loans and the number of inquiries ranged from   moderately lower to moderately higher. Used car loan demand was weak in the   Dallas District, although first mortgage and energy-related lending increased.   San Francisco cited weak-to-moderate business loan demand, but consumer lending   expanded further with the help of auto loans and home mortgage refinancing;   however, San Francisco noted that lending activity as a whole was unchanged.   Most remaining Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas   City reported moderate increases in total loan demand. In the Philadelphia   District, banks reported widespread bank and ATM closings due to Hurricane   Sandy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Credit standards and credit quality were somewhat improved, on net, since the   last report. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City noted that credit standards on   most types of loans were unchanged, and Dallas cited a loosening of credit   standards, which contributed to very competitive loan pricing. Atlanta cited   contacts who reported that underwriting standards had become more restrictive   and burdensome since its last report, both in terms of credit scores and   information requests. With respect to loan quality, New York reported that   delinquency rates increased in the consumer and commercial and industrial   segments but held steady in the residential and commercial mortgage segments.   Philadelphia contacts cited moderate improvement. Cleveland and Richmond noted   improvements in delinquency rates across consumer and business loan categories.   Richmond added, however, that some contacts were concerned that banks were   increasing their risk exposure by making longer-term loans in an effort to get   higher yields. Kansas City and San Francisco also mentioned moderate improvement   in loan quality.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Agriculture and Natural Resources
          <br/>
         </strong>
         Assessments of   agricultural activity were mixed. Varying degrees of drought conditions   persisted in several Districts, while Hurricane Sandy's agricultural damage was   minimal and localized mainly in coastal areas. In the Atlanta District, much of   Georgia experienced drought conditions, while Chicago reported that corn and   soybean production in their District did not suffer as much from the drought as   previously expected. Correspondingly, Minneapolis indicated that their District   crop producers remained in mostly good shape, despite this year's drought. Low   soil-moisture levels in the Kansas City District hindered winter wheat   emergence, raising concerns that persistent drought could strain U.S. crop   production, keep crop and feed prices high, and force further livestock herd   liquidations. However, Richmond stated that most farmers in Virginia were   relieved that Hurricane Sandy brought much needed rain without significant   damage to the corn and soybeans still in the fields. San Francisco noted that   production activity and sales of most crop and livestock products have been   growing at a solid pace, as had investment spending on new production equipment.   Moreover, the St. Louis District reported that harvest completion rates were   considerably higher than the five-year average there.

         Activity in the energy industry was generally mixed since the last report.   Coal production was above year-ago levels in the St. Louis District but was   lower in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. More electricity was being   generated from natural gas in Kansas City. In the Atlanta District, Hurricane   Sandy's damage to refineries and infrastructure in the Northeast caused   southeastern regional refiners to increase production and transportation of oil   products to supply affected areas. Minneapolis reported that oil and gas   production remained at record levels but noted that exploration activity was   flat to down in some areas since our last report. Similarly, extraction activity   in the San Francisco District expanded on balance for petroleum and natural gas,   although the number of rigs used for natural gas extraction fell as producers   shifted their activities toward higher-valued oil formations. The number of   active oil rigs also fell in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Minneapolis   mentioned that iron mines in northern Minnesota remained busy, although   production fell slightly compared to recent months.

          Employment, Wages, and Prices
          <br/>
         </strong>
         Modest improvements in   hiring activity were reported by most Districts. Labor markets were generally   described as improving modestly by Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and   Dallas. Staffing firms, according to Boston and Cleveland, experienced improved   business conditions. However, Richmond reported that labor markets in general   were weaker than in the last report, citing examples of soft demand and an   unwillingness of some manufacturers to hire long-term unemployed workers.   Contacts for Boston noted that demand for office and clerical assistants and   accountants remained weak, and Cleveland reported that hiring across industries   was generally sluggish except in autos. Atlanta indicated that employment   agencies were seeing a pickup in orders for temporary help. Some large   employers, however, announced plans to move toward hiring more part-time, rather   than full-time, employees. Chicago reported that a number of firms were putting   hiring on hold and had delayed temp-to-perm conversion decisions until next   year. With respect to the upcoming holiday season, Cleveland reported that   retailers were planning to hire the same number of temporary workers as last   year, while Boston and Atlanta noted that some retailers were expecting to hire   more help over the holidays. Finally, contacts in a number of Districts reported   difficulties finding qualified workers in some specialized occupations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Wage pressures were generally characterized as "subdued" or "contained"   throughout much of the nation, according to the latest District reports.   Virtually every District described wage growth as modest at best. Contacts in   the Atlanta District attributed flatness in wages to the large number of   applicants for newly posted positions. Richmond reported that manufacturing and   retail wage growth edged up, but wage growth slowed at non-retail firms. In   addition, non-labor costs were increasing in the Chicago District, mostly due to   health-care costs. St. Louis cited stable wages but added that non-labor costs   in manufacturing were rising. Minneapolis noted pockets of stronger wage growth   in some geographical areas, such as North Dakota where oil drilling was pushing   up demand for workers. However, even this pressure was easing in recent weeks.   Kansas City noted strengthening in wage growth among specialized positions in   transportation and high-tech firms. Finally, San Francisco noted that limited   hiring and abundant labor supply were holding down wage and compensation   increases. However, San Francisco added that a few cases of wage pressures were   occurring among truck drivers, health-care workers, and entry level positions in   areas with low unemployment.
        </p>
        <p>
         As with wages, price pressures changed little from the modest pace that was   reported in the last assessment. Almost every District described price growth as   modest, although examples of higher price growth were occasionally cited. For   example, Atlanta noted that, even though overall input price increases had   eased, firms were being challenged by higher energy and crop-related input   prices and by rising health-care costs. Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas   City, and San Francisco all reported increasing prices of construction-related   materials, and Chicago and Minneapolis also cited increases in metals prices. In   addition, Kansas City remarked on rising prices in construction materials and   manufacturing raw materials in general. Richmond reported increasing raw   materials prices and slower increases in finished goods prices. Retail prices in   general eased in the Richmond District, and Chicago noted that retail food   prices eased, except for meats. According to contacts in the Kansas City   District, however, retail prices edged higher. In the Richmond District, the   pace of increases in services prices also moved up.
