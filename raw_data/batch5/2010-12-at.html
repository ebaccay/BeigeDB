      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <strong>
      December 1, 2010
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <p>
      Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that economic   activity rose modestly in October through mid-November. Retailers noted some   increase in traffic and sales, and expectations for holiday sales were generally   positive. Tourism related spending improved largely as a result of an uptick in   international visitors and business travel. Realtors and homebuilders cited   ongoing weakness in sales and construction. The District's office and industrial   real estate markets softened as construction levels declined and vacancy rates   rose. However, several contacts indicated that modest improvements were noted in   leasing activity. Manufacturers reported continued increases in new orders and   production. Credit conditions remained constrained and weakness in loan demand   persisted. District labor markets continued to recover slowly, but businesses   expressed cautiousness regarding adding full-time employees. Labor and material   prices rose slightly, but most firms noted that they had little ability to pass   costs through to customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, most business owners suggested that the lack of robust sales growth   was the major factor holding back their hiring plans and their demand for   credit, although several also cited ongoing tax and regulatory policy   uncertainty as additional constraining factors. Limited capital spending was   focused primarily on required maintenance and efforts to increase   efficiencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retail stores and auto   dealers reported that traffic and sales increased in October through   mid-November. The outlook among retailers was positive and expectations for the   holiday season were cautiously optimistic. Retailers noted that customers remain   quite value conscious and responsive to price changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity improved relative to a year earlier and the outlook was   generally positive for the holiday season. Hotel occupancy rates rose in several   of the District's major markets compared to last year and cruise bookings were   strong. However, discretionary spending at both hotels and cruise ships was   relatively soft. International visitors remained a major source of tourism   growth in the District. Contacts also reported solid increases in business   travel and group travel bookings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from residential   brokers indicated existing home sales weakened in October through mid-November   on a year-over-year basis. Many brokers, most notably in Florida, reported that   the moratorium on distressed sales led to a stall in activity. District   homebuilders indicated that new home sales growth and construction activity   weakened further. Home prices remained below the year-earlier level, but   declines moderated somewhat. Contacts noted downward pressure on prices across   much of the region from distressed property sales. Despite weak buyer traffic,   the outlook for sales growth over the next several months improved somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity softened across the District.   Contractors noted that the pace of commercial development was below the   year-earlier level and backlogs remained low. Vacancy rates remained elevated   across much of the region, although modest improvements were noted in leasing   activity. Most contacts expect the commercial real estate market to remain weak   over the next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers   indicated that the pace of new order growth moderated slightly, while production   growth remained flat compared to the previous report. Several respondents noted   plans to increase production in the short-term, however. District transportation   companies continued to report improved freight volumes from year-earlier levels,   although the pace of growth has moderated from earlier this year. Regional rail   companies noted strong growth for metal and chemical goods, while shipments of   motor vehicles and parts softened. The outlook among transportation firms was   optimistic as rail companies noted benefits from rising international shipments   of coal and farm products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks continued to report little loan   demand. Troubled real estate loans continued to increase, negatively affecting   bank profitability. Overall, access to credit among small businesses slightly   improved, although several noted ongoing difficulty obtaining credit on   favorable terms. Reports indicated that credit standards for smaller firms eased   more at community and regional banks than at large national banks. However, many   small businesses indicated that although banks were willing to lend, the terms   were unacceptable to the borrower. Firms related to construction and real estate   experienced the most difficulty obtaining credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continued to   slowly recover in October through mid-November. Business contacts reported that   they were waiting for clearer signals of improved business prospects before   adding significantly to payrolls. Businesses that were hiring were doing so   cautiously, and many noted that they were being selective in choosing the most   productive and versatile applicants. The majority of businesses cited a strong   preference for using part-time or temporary staff in response to an increase in   sales, allowing for more efficiency and flexibility.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business contacts expressed considerable uncertainty about cost pressures   over the coming year. Most felt that any pressure from higher labor and   materials costs would be largely absorbed by reductions in profit margins.   Overall, businesses remained reluctant to pass higher input costs through to   customers given the relative softness in sales and orders. However, some   transportation and food service firms indicated they plan to raise some of their   prices because of cost increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional oil production   remained above earlier levels as production from existing offshore platforms   came online. Although drilling activity remains well below pre-oil spill levels,   the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico has crept up since hurricane   season ended. Contacts have noted some concern that the pace of drilling permit   issuance continues to lag, which could weigh on future energy output in the   Gulf.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most District areas benefitted from improved weather conditions in late   October and early November. The outlook for the region's key agricultural   products was brightened by favorable market conditions. Strong global demand and   tight supplies have particularly boosted soybean and cotton prices, recently   reaching historic highs.
