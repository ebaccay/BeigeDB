      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy expanded at a moderate pace over the past six   weeks. Activity in the energy sector remained strong, and staffing firms   reported continued high demand for their services. Reports from the   manufacturing and non-financial service sectors were mostly positive. Loan   demand increased slightly. Conditions improved somewhat in the commercial real   estate sector, while activity in the housing market remained sluggish. Severe   winter weather stressed crops and ranching conditions and dampened retail   sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures increased somewhat since the last   report. Many contacts reported higher input prices for fuel, metals, and other   commodities, and some shipping and manufacturing firms said they had increased   selling prices in response. Retailers reported increases in the price of food   and sundry items, while cement producers noted that they had announced selling   price increases for spring 2011. Some service-providing firms noted continued   downward pressure on bill rates, while staffing firms said they were successful   in raising fees for direct hire placements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil fell from $90 per barrel   in January to about $86 in early February. Despite severe winter weather across   much of the country, natural gas prices remained weak. Most petrochemical prices   held steady during the reporting period, with the exception of increases in   polypropylene and polystyrene prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There were increased reports of hiring   activity compared with the previous reporting period. Staffing firms reported   continued strong demand for their services. Some primary metals, fabricated   metals, transportation, lumber, food, and high-tech manufacturers reported   moderate employment increases. Accounting firms noted audit and tax work had   prompted seasonal hiring. A few contacts in auto sales, legal, accounting and   energy services expect to expand payrolls this year. In addition, retailers   reported offering full-time positions to some workers that had been hired for   the holidays, while others were laid off. Wage pressures remained minimal. There   were, however, reports of higher wages at some firms in the accounting, airline   and aviation industries, and high-tech manufacturers reported slight increases   in wage pressures for high-skilled positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall demand for construction-related   products was flat over the past six weeks, although there were a few reports of   an uptick in demand related to remodeling, commercial construction and   multifamily housing activity. Contacts expect conditions to remain unchanged or   improve slightly this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      High-tech manufacturers reported that growth in orders and sales picked up   slightly. Demand was particularly strong from Asia and for products such as   smart phones and other hand-held devices. Inventories were at or near desired   levels. Most respondents expect demand to continue to increase at the current   rate or at a slightly faster pace over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall conditions in the paper products sector were largely unchanged since   the last report. Aviation and aircraft parts manufacturers reported continued   solid demand, and outlooks are for moderate growth over the next few months.   Sales of emergency vehicles picked up and demand is stronger than year-ago   levels, according to contacts. Demand for food products improved over the past   month, and the three-month outlook for sales was optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domestic demand for petrochemicals was stable or rose moderately, and margins   were robust during the reporting period. Growth in exports of polyethylene and   polypropylene slowed, while exports of caustic soda stayed strong. Domestic   orders for PVC used in residential and commercial construction remained weak,   but exports were solid according to contacts.
     </p>
     Consumers have scaled back   consumption of gasoline and diesel due to high prices. Refinery utilization   rates have declined from 88 to 85 percent and margins are weak.
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Severe winter weather adversely affected   sales activity. Excluding the week of inclement weather, sales were flat to   slightly higher compared with the previous reporting period. Discount retailers   have seen year-over-year sales growth in the mid- to high-single digits,   although about half of the increase in sales is due to higher gasoline prices.   Contacts at discount retail firms noted sales of apparel and domestic goods   strengthened recently. Overall inventories were at desired levels. The   environment remains competitive but the outlook is for continued moderate growth   in sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for automobiles held steady, apart from severe winter weather that   significantly reduced sales in early February. Demand is gradually picking up as   business and consumer confidence improves. One contact noted that most of the   improvement has been at the retail level and fleet sales have lagged. Dealer   inventories are being kept in line with the pace of sales. Contacts remain   modestly optimistic and expect sales to rise moderately this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing firms reported continued strong demand,   particularly for high-skilled IT positions. Other areas of strength were   transportation services, insurance, healthcare, and banking. Direct hiring   activity picked up pace, and outlooks remained optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for accounting services has improved since the last report. One large   firm noted that activity is strengthening across all service lines, particularly   for consulting and transactional work. Despite the recent improvement in   business, pricing remains competitive. Demand for legal services has picked up,   and contacts expect reasonable growth in activity this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from transportation services contacts were mixed, but mostly   positive. Intermodal transportation firms noted cargo volumes declined due to   weaker demand from international clients. Growth in small parcel shipments   improved during the reporting period, and volumes were above year-ago levels.   Railroad shipments and container trade volumes increased moderately since the   last report. Airline traffic was steady over the past six weeks. Contacts noted   that demand has improved from a year ago, particularly for business travel, and   the outlook is for modest growth in sales in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Eleventh District housing   activity remains sluggish, but contacts were slightly more optimistic in their   outlooks. While comparisons with year-earlier levels are difficult because of   the 2010 homebuyer tax credit, some contacts said traffic had picked up recently   and that buyers were becoming more serious. Respondents noted tighter credit   standards continued to hinder first-time homebuyer sales, although some realtors   and builders noted sales in the higher-priced, move-up market had improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity improved slightly since the last report.   Contacts said that while the sector remains fragile, there are signs that a   recovery is beginning to take place. Office and industrial leasing rental demand   edged up and contacts noted several deals in the works in Texas, with high-tech   and energy-related firms leading the expansion. Commercial property sales   remained at low levels, but some contacts noted a pickup in investor interest.   Nonresidential construction remained subdued since the last report, and contacts   do not expect a significant turnaround in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial firms report a slight uptick   in overall loan demand. Commercial and industrial loan activity remains mixed,   but demand for residential real estate loans has picked up from very low levels.   Loan pricing is highly competitive, and contacts at community banks report   increased competition from larger banks moving "down market" in order to attract   new business. Credit quality appears to have stabilized and in some cases is   improving. Increased cost of regulatory compliance is restraining lending   activity, especially for community banks. Outlooks have improved slightly due to   improving credit quality, some deposit run-off, and increased optimism regarding   the overall direction of economic activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drilling activity remains strong. Growth in the   rig count has slowed as the disparity between oil and natural gas prices   continues to shift activity away from natural gas and toward oil-directed   drilling. Unconventional shale is the dominant factor driving U.S. drilling   activity. Expectations are for the rig count to flatten out or decline slightly   but margins are expected to remain strong through most of 2011. The rig count in   the Gulf edged up during the reporting period, and there is little optimism   about the short-term revival of activity in the Gulf as permitting remains slow   for shallow and deepwater drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Exceptionally dry conditions along with   extended periods of below-freezing temperatures adversely affected the vegetable   crop in Texas, greatly stressed livestock and necessitated increased   supplemental feeding. Demand for agricultural commodities was strong. In   particular, the relatively high price of oil spurred demand for corn for ethanol   production. Prices of agricultural commodities remained high, and rose further   for corn, cotton, soybeans and wheat. High costs for corn and feedstock has led   to a slight decline in feedlot profitability.
