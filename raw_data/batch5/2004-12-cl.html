      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 2004
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      For the six-week period through the middle of November, economic activity appeared 

  to expand little in the Fourth District. Production levels at the District's 

  durable and nondurable goods manufacturers remained flat, as in August and September. 

  Sales at the District's retailers also remained largely unchanged throughout 

  this period, conforming to the pattern of reports since late spring. Residential 

  construction continued to slow, while seasonal declines in demand weakened some 

  of the momentum that nonresidential builders had been reporting. District banks 

  reported steady loan demand among their commercial and consumer clients. Finally, 

  shipping firms continued to report robust demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      There were some signs that input costs began to stabilize for manufacturers, 

  and retail price pressures remained limited. While hiring still seemed to be 

  modest among many business contacts, staffing services companies are optimistic 

  about their prospects for the first quarter. Contacts at staffing services companies 

  also reported an increase in the number of employed workers interested in switching 

  to a new job.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the District's durable goods producers continued to see steady levels 

  of production in October and through the middle of November. However, year-over-year 

  comparisons were less favorable for firms through this period than in the recent 

  past: Almost half reported less production than at this time last year. Some 

  of the slowing can be traced to auto producers' production cuts. Domestic steel 

  shipments also slowed somewhat, but they are still substantially higher than 

  at this time a year ago. Contacts attributed the slowing shipments largely to 

  seasonal changes in demand. However, increases in steel inventories and imports 

  are also likely having an effect. Nondurable goods producers described production 

  levels as steady in recent weeks, as well as relative to this time last year. 

  Nevertheless, most expect weaker activity through the next several months. By 

  contrast, expectations among durable goods producers are almost evenly split 

  between those anticipating more production and those anticipating less.
     </p>
     <p>
      As in the most recent report, roughly half of the respondents from durable 

  goods manufacturers reported having higher inventories than desired. By contrast, 

  most nondurable goods producers reported that their inventories were not above 

  acceptable levels. In general, durable and nondurable goods producers are planning 

  little hiring and few increases in capital outlays over the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the first time in months, cost pressures appeared to moderate for many 

  manufacturers through the six weeks ending in mid-November. In fact, several 

  firms reported that their input costs were flat throughout this period. Lower 

  prices for petroleum-based products and steel appeared to account for much of 

  the change. Nevertheless, manufacturers' materials costs remain higher than 

  at this time last year, and, accordingly, firms continue to attempt to raise 

  their prices--many successfully so--to recover the increases in input costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The economic environment for the District's retailers remained largely unchanged 

  in recent weeks. Most contacts continued to characterize sales as flat, with 

  business conditions little changed since the spring. On a year-over-year basis, 

  specialty stores and discounters reported a slight increase in sales, while 

  department stores saw sales decline. Auto dealers reported falling sales for 

  the six weeks through the middle of November. Finally, it was reported that 

  cosmetics and other personal care products, home appliances, and certain apparel 

  categories sold well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some contacts had expected sales to strengthen following the presidential election, 

  but sales through the first half of November don't appear appreciably better 

  than before. Accordingly, firms are cautious in their forecasts for the upcoming 

  holiday selling season, anticipating, at most, only slightly better sales than 

  at this time a year ago. Most retailers reported that their inventories were 

  well-managed and about the same as a year ago, though auto dealers generally 

  had higher inventory levels than desired.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealerships continued to offer an array of sometimes substantial 

  incentives. One newly introduced incentive allows buyers to lock in current 

  interest rates on a subsequent purchase for a five-year period. Prices for used 

  cars also continued to fall. For other retailers, reports regarding changes 

  in prices were mixed. For firms that attempted to increase some product prices, 

  these changes were reportedly resisted by consumers. Regarding hiring, seasonal 

  workforce additions were expected to be about the same as at this time a year 

  ago; plans for permanent staff additions are still few.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of residential construction continued to weaken slightly throughout 

  the District, even after accounting for the typical seasonal slowing. Reports 

  of declines in activity were particularly prominent in the Cincinnati area. 

  Building also appeared to be down for most firms on a year-over-year basis. 

  Nevertheless, nearly half of the firms contacted continued to expect their sales 

  in 2004 to ultimately surpass those seen in 2003. Contractors' costs for most 

  materials declined throughout the fall, but often are still above their levels 

  from a year ago. Increases in cement and concrete prices have also been reported. 

  Finally, firms that were expanding planned to continue to add to their staffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      After recent reports indicated better business conditions for nonresidential 

  builders, activity appeared to slow in the six weeks through the middle of November. 

  However, many contacts attributed this to a normal seasonal slowing. While many 

  firms don't anticipate much more activity through the remainder of this year, 

  there is optimism about stronger activity in 2005. Materials costs were flat 

  for most firms in recent weeks, though higher than at this time last year. No 

  nonresidential builders reported plans to hire, but several indicated that they 

  may shed some workers in the weeks ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most institutions in the District reported moderate increases in deposit growth 

  through the six weeks ending in mid-November. Throughout this period, District 

  banks also characterized their commercial clients' demand for credit as steady. 

  There were some isolated indications that commercial clients were seeking funding 

  for expansions, as some bankers suggested that business confidence had improved 

  in recent weeks. Lending to consumer clients was also characterized as steady, 

  though mortgage activity appeared to vary by region. Finally, credit quality 

  continued to be good at most institutions in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trucking and Shipping
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for trucking and shipping services remained robust in October and through 

  the middle of November. As has been the case in recent reports, demand continued 

  to come from an array of sectors, with demand from retailers especially strong 

  in advance of the holiday selling season. Shipping firms' fuel surcharges continued 

  to insulate them from increases in fuel expenses. Many shippers are also beginning 

  to increase their base rates. As firms attempted to expand capacity, they continued 

  to report trouble hiring drivers. Wage rates have risen as a result, and one 

  firm reported attempting to attract drivers by offering benefits such as routes 

  closer to a prospective hire's home. Capital spending by shipping firms continued 

  to be strong through the middle of November.
