      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy expanded at a solid pace from
      <br/>
      mid-April through 
  the beginning of June, with slight moderation evident in some sectors. Wage 
  and price inflation reportedly were modest on net, although wage growth remained 
  rapid for selected worker groups with specialized skills. Retail sales expanded 
  somewhat and demand for services was strong. Demand for District manufactured 
  products grew overall but fell for some construction materials. Producers of 
  agricultural and resource-related products saw solid demand. Residential construction, 
  sales activity, and price appreciation softened further, while demand for commercial 
  real estate continued to expand. District banks reported strong loan demand 
  on net but further easing in mortgage demand; credit quality remained very high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported little or no change from the modest upward pressure on prices 
  noted in the previous survey period. Significant increases in final prices were 
  largely confined to products and services for which energy costs are a significant 
  component, such as construction and transportation services. More generally, 
  contacts reported that vigorous competition and ongoing productivity gains sharply 
  limited their ability to pass rising input costs on to final prices, although 
  they provided scattered reports of increased pricing power for some retail items.
     </p>
     <p>
      District labor markets tightened a bit further during the survey period. Upward 
  wage pressures were moderate overall, but wage increases remained rapid for 
  workers with specialized skills in the construction, health-care, information 
  technology, and financial services sectors. More generally, contacts reported 
  healthy hiring activity, although the pace of hiring has slowed in parts of 
  California.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales grew modestly during the survey period. Demand for domestic automobiles 
  reportedly improved in recent weeks, although sales remained below year-earlier 
  levels as high gas prices held down demand for large SUVs and light trucks. 
  By contrast, sales of selected fuel-efficient imported vehicles reportedly remained 
  at record highs. Sales of apparel and other small retail items expanded, although 
  performance varied substantially across retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most service providers saw robust demand. Activity was brisk in the health-care 
  services, professional services, and transportation sectors. Sales and hiring 
  activity grew further for providers of technology services, although the employment 
  outlook in this sector was clouded slightly by a report of reduced use of temporary 
  employees. District travel and tourist activity was vigorous. In Hawaii, substantial 
  increases in domestic tourist arrivals and spending offset recent declines in 
  Japanese tourist activity relative to year-earlier levels. For major District 
  tourist destinations in general, hotel occupancy rates remained high and room 
  rates rose further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for District manufactured products grew further on net. Orders and sales 
  of semiconductors continued to expand, and capacity utilization generally hovered 
  at or above 90 percent. Orders for commercial aircraft grew further and production 
  continued at a rapid pace in the Pacific Northwest, keeping aircraft manufacturing 
  establishments and their subcontractors operating near full capacity. Demand 
  for processed food grew further and demand for apparel picked up, with balanced 
  inventories reported in both sectors. In contrast, demand declined and prices 
  fell slightly for building supplies commonly used for residential construction 
  purposes, most notably wood products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for District agricultural and resource-related products was strong during 
  the survey period of mid-April through the beginning of June. Sales remained 
  robust for most crops and livestock; inventories were balanced in general and 
  prices were stable to down slightly, despite supply constraints imposed by continued 
  drought conditions in Arizona and earlier excess moisture in California. Contacts 
  reported that the cost of fuel and fertilizers increased further from high levels, 
  although the rate of increase abated. In the resources sector, producers of 
  oil and natural gas saw robust demand and operated at close to full capacity, 
  although one contact noted that inventories of natural gas are very high, putting 
  downward pressure on prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in residential real estate markets continued to decelerate, while demand 
  for commercial real estate picked up further. The pace of sales and price appreciation, 
  along with other indicators such as time on the market, point to significant 
  cooling in residential real estate markets in most areas; the exceptions are 
  Utah and parts of the Pacific Northwest, where housing markets reportedly remain 
  hot. On the commercial side, office and retail vacancy rates fell and rental 
  rates rose further in most major markets. Overall construction activity was 
  at high levels, with rising activity for commercial and public structures offsetting 
  declines for residential construction projects in some areas. Contacts reported 
  that some builders continued to face cost increases and minor project delays 
  as a result of tight availability of skilled workers and selected materials 
  such as steel and cement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported robust demand in most loan categories, with 
  the exception of declining demand for residential mortgages. Commercial and 
  industrial lending continued to grow steadily, and asset quality remained excellent. 
  Originations for new residential mortgages fell, but contacts reported that 
  home refinancing activity was brisk in some areas, as borrowers switched from 
  variable to fixed terms in the face of rising interest rates.
