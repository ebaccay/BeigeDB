      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, Sixth District business conditions appear to have improved   modestly in April and May. Most retail contacts continued to experience   increased traffic and sales, and their outlook remained generally optimistic.   Reports on tourism were also generally positive; however, considerable   uncertainty was expressed about the potential impact from the Gulf oil spill and   the recent floods in Tennessee. Overall, homebuilder and Realtor reports   suggested that the pace of new and existing home sales slowed somewhat, whereas   commercial construction contacts reported ongoing weak conditions. The   District's manufacturing and transportation segments extended their previous   gains in new orders and production. By most accounts, bank credit conditions   remained tight. Firms across several sectors reported increasing hours worked of   existing staff and expanded the utilization of temporary hires. However, firms   generally remained reluctant to add permanent staff. According to manufacturers   and homebuilders, transportation and material costs rose slightly, but they did   not plan to pass these increases along to customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most retail merchants   reported continued improvement in traffic and sales, and a slight increase in   confidence among consumers in April and May. Despite the uptick in sales,   retailers continued to keep their inventory levels relatively low, preferring   instead to have more inventories held at the wholesale level. The outlook among   retail contacts was positive with the majority expecting continued sales growth   over the next couple of months. Vehicle sales increased from weak year-ago   levels, with foreign brands experiencing the strongest demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tourism sector continued to improve. Hospitality contacts in Atlanta,   Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Orlando, and Tampa all noted hotel occupancy   rates above the national average. Business-related travel and convention   bookings were up and future bookings looked strong. Convention hotel contacts   began noting some pricing power. Cruise-line bookings were gradually trending up   and many were able to increase prices slightly. Similarly, contacts in the   restaurant industry experienced a modest increase in activity and projections   for the near-term were optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the recent Gulf oil spill and the floods in Tennessee have tempered   the outlook in those areas. Contacts indicated that the potential impact on the   tourism industry along the coastline of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and   western Florida could be substantial. In some cases, vacation lodging   cancellations have been replaced by bookings from clean-up crews, laborers, and   the National Guard. The Nashville area is expected to see a decline in   tourism-related receipts because of damage to several tourist venues there. The   near-term outlook among hospitality contacts varied greatly, reflecting the high   level of uncertainty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders   reported that new home sales growth softened, but remained positive on a   year-over-year basis. Most of the weaker reports came from contacts in Florida   who noted a relatively sharp slowing in sales growth. The pace of construction   activity weakened as well and was described as being roughly even with a year   earlier. Most homebuilders commented that tax incentives had been a major driver   of sales in most markets, although access to financing remained a significant   challenge. The outlook among residential builder contacts weakened from the   previous report but remained slightly positive overall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors indicated another modest improvement in existing home sales in April   compared with a year earlier. However, on a month-over-month basis, responses   from contacts showed that sales softened slightly. Realtors reported that   high-end home sales exceeded their year-earlier level for the first time since   early 2006. Inventory levels were described as similar to a year earlier, and   home prices stabilized. The outlook for sales over the next several months   remained positive but was a little less upbeat than recent reports.
     </p>
     <p>
      The   majority of commercial contacts reported that the pace of development was still   well below year-earlier levels and construction backlogs were down sharply. Most   noted that limited access to financing and weak demand continued to constrain   activity. The outlook for commercial construction activity for the rest of the   year remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A majority of District   manufacturers noted increased levels of new orders and production in April   compared with March. Most firms also reported plans to expand production levels   in the short-term. Freight demand continued to improve from weak year-ago   levels. Trucking contacts in the District noted an increase in business.   However, they were uncertain whether the improvements reflected reduced capacity   in the transportation industry or an overall increase in demand. Regional rail   shipments were up notably for automotive, chemical, and other raw industrial   materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking contacts reported that credit   standards remained stringent but that credit was readily available for borrowers   that met the stricter requirements. Bankers also cited increasing foreclosure   rates, bankruptcies, and loan delinquencies in several markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although overall payroll employment   levels appear to have increased across much of the District, many businesses   still reported that they had a strong preference for increasing the hours for   existing staff and using temporary staff rather than hiring fulltime   employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturing and homebuilder contacts cited increases in commodity   prices and transportation costs in April and early May. Several businesses   reported that supply chain capacity constraints were responsible for some of the   price increases. However, little of these cost increases were expected to be   passed on to consumers as lower labor costs continued to relieve pressure on   business balance sheets, and most firms said they faced intense competitive   pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Late April's large oil   spill in the Gulf of Mexico has had little immediate impact on District oil   production. However, industry contacts expressed concern about the potential   impact on future production if stricter regulations restrict drilling activity.   Following the spill, supply vessels were able to reach existing rigs without   interruption, and refinery operations were not disrupted significantly. Gulf   Coast crude oil and gasoline stocks remained near the top of their seasonal   average for this time of year. The regional fishing industry reported a   significant reduction in activity, as fears of water contamination and safety   concerns prompting bans on both commercial and recreational fishing in zones   affected by the spill.
     </p>
     <p>
      In early May, severe rainfall flooded parts of central Tennessee. According   to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's weekly crop survey,   Tennessee farmers reported moderate to severe damages to 39 percent of the   state's corn crop and 21 percent of winter wheat. Damages to fruit and vegetable   crops and nursery stock have also been reported, as well as significant   destruction of farm infrastructure. Elsewhere in the District, recent rains   generally improved soil moisture conditions and crop production.
