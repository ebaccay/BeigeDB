      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded at a    moderate pace in late July and August.    Consumer spending increased, driven by strong tourism spending, and    labor markets continued to expand.    Manufacturing activity rebounded slightly, and commercial real estate    activity continued at a solid pace.    Energy activity remained at strong levels, and agricultural conditions    were favorable. On the other hand,    residential real estate weakened further. Some banks tightened real estate    lending standards, but bankers tended to report that overall loan demand was    up slightly. Wage pressures remained    largely contained and most price pressures eased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Consumer spending increased from the last survey period, and contacts    generally expected solid future growth.    Most retail stores reported a slight uptick in sales from previous    months, with several contacts indicating favorable returns from the    back-to-school season. Sales of    apparel and technology items were especially strong, while sales of    home-related items remained weak.    Store inventories continued to be relatively flat, with a reduction    expected in coming months. Auto dealers    reported a modest increase in sales and saw little effect from high gasoline    prices, though sales of SUVs and trucks slowed somewhat. Some dealers reported concerns about the    slumping housing market and the possible impact on credit availability for    automobile purchases. Travel and    tourism activity expanded solidly in late July and August. Hotel and tourist attraction revenues were    up markedly from a year ago, and contacts expected further growth. Restaurants also reported strong sales    growth, despite rising food input costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Manufacturing activity rebounded slightly following sluggish growth in    the last survey period, and producers remained optimistic about future    activity. Plant managers reported    moderate increases in production, shipments, and orders from earlier in the    summer, particularly among producers of machinery and high-tech    equipment. On the other hand, factory    employment was largely flat, as turnover and the lack of qualified workers    was still an issue for some firms.    Although most contacts reported continued solid capital spending, a    few firms planned slight reductions in expenditures due to the recent    volatility in financial markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential    real estate activity declined further, while commercial real estate activity    continued at a healthy pace. Home    sales weakened in late July and August and were well    below year-ago levels. Most contacts    expected the slowdown to persist for some time, until foreclosures stabilize    and the oversupply of homes is reduced.    Although home inventories leveled off somewhat, they still remained    higher than a year ago and were projected to rise in coming months. Home prices throughout the District edged    down and are anticipated to continue this trend. Builders in several cities reported steady    recent activity, but expected decreases in the future due to a tightening of    mortgage standards. Commercial real    estate activity remained solid.    Vacancy rates edged down in most cities and absorption rates were steady. Rent values remained elevated from a year    ago, and prices for office space were expected to rise in the near    future. Most contacts were upbeat    about future commercial activity despite some decrease in the availability of    credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Bankers reported that loan demand edged up and deposits held steady    since the last survey. Commercial real    estate loans accounted for most of the increase in loan demand. While most banks reported no change in    deposits, a few said they had experienced inflows from commercial customers    with ample supplies of cash. Although    most respondents continued to report no change in credit standards, several    said they tightened standards for real estate loans. Most banks reported little or no exposure    to subprime mortgages. However, some    noted that recent difficulties in this segment could make it harder to sell    mortgages to secondary lenders or reduce the supply of qualified mortgage    borrowers. A few respondents said they viewed the turmoil as an opportunity    to expand their share of the local mortgage market. As a whole, banks expected little change in    overall loan quality over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Energy activity continued at solid levels    in late July and August. The majority    of contacts reported stable drilling activity and expected increased activity    heading forward. However, the lack of    qualified labor continued to put a strain on expansion, and the recent fall    in natural gas prices caused some firms to cut back on exploration. One Wyoming firm reported natural gas    storage capacity at all-time highs due to the lack of available    pipelines.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Agricultural    conditions remained generally favorable in late July and August. Nebraska and Colorado reported    above-average wheat yields after June rains limited the wheat harvest in    Oklahoma and Kansas. After a period of    dry weather, August rains improved growing conditions for the corn and    soybean crops, which placed some downward pressure on crop prices. Livestock prices remained solid, although    rising production costs trimmed margins for hog producers and cattle feedlot operators.    Farm credit conditions continued to be strong and spending on crop equipment    rose, led by a boom in grain storage facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Wages
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Labor markets continued to expand, and wage pressures remained largely    contained. District hiring    announcements outpaced layoff announcements, and a sizeable number of firms    experienced labor shortages. Several    firms reported difficulties in filling sales and manager positions, and in    hiring production, technical, housekeeping, and restaurant wait staff. Wage pressures were flat versus the    previous survey period, although contacts anticipated a slight increase in    coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Price pressures moderated in late July and August, with slower growth    of manufacturing prices and a slight easing in retail prices. District    manufacturing contacts reported fewer increases in raw materials prices,    especially for food and metals, with further easing expected. Factory finished goods price increases also    slowed slightly and were projected to remain relatively constant in coming    months. The majority of retailers    reported flat selling prices but expected prices to rise slightly heading    forward. Restaurants anticipated a further    increase in menu prices in response to pass-through of past food cost increases.
