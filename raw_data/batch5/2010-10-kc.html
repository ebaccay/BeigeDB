      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy posted moderate but uneven growth in the September   reporting period. Restaurants, hotels, and general retailers reported a rebound   in activity but auto sales remained soft. Manufacturing activity rebounded but   did not translate into additional factory hiring. Residential and commercial   real estate markets weakened further. District banks reported stable banking   conditions overall with some deterioration in loan quality. Continued expansion   in the energy sector supported increased hiring and capital spending. In   agriculture, favorable crop growing conditions and attractive profit margins   spurred capital spending and land price gains. Despite higher input prices,   selling prices in most retail sectors remained unchanged, and little evidence of   wage pressures was reported in District labor markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported stronger   than expected sales in September and indicated sales were higher relative to   last year. Retailers remained optimistic that sales would continue to increase   in the coming quarter but expected softness in selling prices. Restaurants   reported much higher sales than a year ago and anticipated future sales gains   going forward. The average check amount at restaurants remained flat, although   menu prices increased. Automobile sales weakened considerably from the last   reporting period but remained slightly above year-ago levels. Auto inventories   continued to decline and dealers expressed satisfaction with current inventory   levels. The lodging industry noted improved hotel occupancy rates with mountain   resort bookings above year-ago rates. Some hoteliers indicated that the   occupancy bounce was likely seasonal in nature but reported improved   expectations for both occupancy and room rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Tenth   District's manufacturing sector reported a mild rebound following softness in   the prior reporting period. Factory operators reported expanded production,   shipments, and new orders, and firms remained optimistic about future production   levels. Despite increased activity, few firms reported planned increases in   capital spending or hiring in the coming six months. The rebound in activity   produced an increase in backlogs and raised expectations for future backlogs.   Some improvement was reported in orders for export markets, though expectations   for further expansion remained modest. Inventories of both raw materials and   finished goods were reported as in balance with no planned changes from existing   levels. The strength reported in manufacturing did not spillover to   transportation firms as contacts noted unexpected weakness in activity. Some   high-tech firms reported sales growth, but expectations for improvement in the   coming two quarters were subdued. Capital spending activity by high-tech firms   continued its upward trend but firms reported somewhat diminished expectations   for the upcoming six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial   real estate activity continued to decline. Residential respondents reported   decreased sales volumes and home prices in the District. However, some movement   was noted in upper-end home sales. Housing inventories continued to increase and   were expected to rise further in coming months. In contrast, residential   builders reported increased housing starts, traffic, and new home prices.   Mortgage refinancing activity continued to expand while home purchase loans   decreased. Construction supply firms noted anemic conditions, with expectations   of continued decline. Commercial real estate respondents reported no vacancy   rate changes, but sales, prices, rents, completions, and absorptions were lower,   with little to no expectation of conditions improving in the next quarter. The   majority of real estate and construction respondents noted economic uncertainty   among customers as a drag on any recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported steady loan demand, stable   deposits, and an unchanged outlook for loan quality. Consistent with the last   several reports, overall loan demand was little changed. Demand edged up for   commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans but decreased   for consumer installment loans. Demand for commercial real estate loans was   stable. Credit standards were unchanged in all major loan categories, after   tightening modestly on commercial real estate loans in the last two reports.   Somewhat more bankers reported deterioration in loan quality from one year ago   than reported an improvement. However, for the fourth straight report,   respondents expected no change in loan quality over the next six months.   Deposits were basically flat, continuing the pattern since late last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy industry activity continued to expand   District-wide in the latest reporting period. Oil and gas respondents reported   sharply increased activity relative to both month-ago and year-ago levels. The   number of active drilling rigs expanded but continued to lag rig deployments   nationally. District exploration remained focused on crude oil and natural gas   liquids, especially in New Mexico and Oklahoma. Gas rig counts expanded in   Colorado but contracted in Oklahoma. Oil and gas firms reported equipment   shortages and some difficulty finding qualified workers, especially in rural   areas. A few firms reported limited access to capital and rising operating costs   as constraints on drilling activity. Wyoming coal production expanded rapidly   since the last report, with train car loadings reaching a yearly high in the   Powder River Basin. Anticipated long-run demand from international nuclear power   projects prompted expansion in District uranium production, despite continued   low market prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions remained favorable   since the last reporting period. The majority of the corn and soybean crops were   rated in good to excellent condition with expectations of bumper yields. The   fall harvest was on schedule and winter wheat planting was progressing well.   Crop prices strengthened further, boosting income expectations for District   farmers. Higher feed costs, however, trimmed incomes for livestock producers.   Stronger profits for crop producers spurred higher cropland values and a rebound   in capital spending on agricultural equipment and grain storage facilities.   Repayment rates on farm loans improved with higher incomes, and lenders reported   a drop in the number of loan renewals and extensions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Raw materials prices increased, although   selling prices and wages remained flat. District manufacturers reported that raw   materials prices remained above year-ago levels and expected the upward trend to   extend into the next six months. Selling prices in most sectors remained flat   since the last reporting period but were generally below a year ago. Menu prices   at restaurants increased modestly from month- and year-ago levels, and   respondents expected prices to continue to increase, pressured by rising food   costs. Firms continued to report little evidence of wage pressures across   District labor markets and did not expect pressure in the near future.
