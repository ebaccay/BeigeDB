      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 27, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded at a moderate pace in the June and early   July survey period. Consumer spending rose solidly and was especially strong   among restaurants and auto dealers. Factory production rebounded from weakness   in the prior survey period, and high-tech and transportation services firms   reported continued growth. District bankers reported weaker loan demand but   increased deposits and improved loan quality. Weak home sales and expanded   inventory levels further pressured single-family home prices, while commercial   real estate activity remained slow but stable. Activity in the energy sector was   robust as drilling expanded in most District states. Conditions in agriculture   were generally strong. Rising input costs were reported in several sectors, but   wage pressures were limited to select industries and occupations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased at a solid   pace in June and early July, and most contacts expected sales gains in the   months ahead. Auto dealers reported strong sales despite reduced incentives,   with demand strongest for small, fuel-efficient vehicles. Dealers noted the   continued benefit of low interest rates on sales and attributed some of the   recent sales boost to tornado damage in areas of Oklahoma and Missouri. Car and   light truck inventory levels were reported as generally satisfactory, although   shortages remained for some Japanese nameplates due to the tsunami. Restaurant   sales accelerated in June, and the outlook for the coming three months remained   strong. However, restaurant profit margins were pressured by increased food   costs and a further decline in the average check amount. General retailers in   the District reported flat sales in the survey period, but activity remained   well above year-ago levels. Current retail inventories were viewed as adequate,   but many retailers planned to expand inventory in the coming months. Sales of   low price consumer goods were strong, while sales of many luxury items remained   sluggish. District tourism visitor counts were generally up, especially at   Colorado mountain resorts, but were slowed by wildfires and drought in northern   New Mexico. District hoteliers reported increased occupancy and daily room   rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tenth District   manufacturing activity rebounded from weakness in the prior survey period, while   high-tech and transportation activity expanded further. Factory operators   reported that both production and shipments bounced back following weakness in   May. The outlook among manufacturers remained positive as new orders and   backlogs similarly rebounded. Inventories of finished goods were stable. Factory   employment increased in June for the eighth consecutive month and the average   workweek expanded slightly. Raw materials costs increased and put upward   pressure on finished goods prices. Factory operators also indicated slightly   weaker capital spending plans in the coming six months. Transportation services   firms reported increased activity in the current survey period and were   optimistic about future bookings. Several trucking contacts cited continued   difficulty attracting qualified over-the-road drivers. Sales growth was strong   at high-tech firms despite some downward price pressure. High-tech firms   remained optimistic about future sales gains and planned to increase capital   spending in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Excess inventory weighed on   single-family home prices, while commercial real estate remained weak but   stable. Real estate firms reported flat existing home sales, higher home   inventory, and lower home prices in June and early July. Contacts reported an   increased share of existing home purchases by investors in all-cash   transactions. Expectations for improvement in the housing sector were subdued.   Home builders reported little new construction activity but noted increased   buyer traffic. Entry-level homes sold well, along with high-end homes in some   Colorado mountain resort communities. Apartment managers reported higher rents   and lower vacancy rates. In commercial leasing, absorption and vacancy rates   were flat, and only small declines in rent and prices were reported. Further   declines in rent and prices were expected and overall commercial leasing terms   continued to favor tenants. Commercial construction remained stable but weak,   with strength reported in multi-family residential projects. Builders indicated   that access to credit improved slightly. Construction supply firms reported   increased sales since the last survey, though inventories increased.   Construction materials prices remained steady excluding petroleum-based   products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In the recent survey period, bankers reported   weaker loan demand but increased deposits and improvements in loan quality.   Overall loan demand was slightly weaker than in the previous survey. Demand for   residential real estate loans was unchanged, while demand for commercial and   industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer installment loans   decreased. Credit standards remained unchanged in all major loan categories, and   deposits increased for the fourth straight survey. Bankers reported improvements   in loan quality compared with a year ago and in the outlook for loan quality   over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District energy activity expanded at a solid pace   since the last survey, and contacts expected continued growth in coming months.   Drilling activity expanded in most District states, however extended permitting   delays were noted on Bureau of Land Management sites in Wyoming. Oil and gas   contacts expected little change in crude oil and natural gas prices in the   coming three months. Energy firms increased hiring in the current survey period   but reported difficulty finding qualified workers. Availability of equipment   remained a constraint to expansion, but financing was viewed as adequate. Weak   coal production in the Powder River Basin kept output well below year-ago   levels. Ethanol production edged up with slightly higher prices and profits this   summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions varied with weather   and input costs. Poor pasture conditions due to drought in the Southern Plains   prompted increased placements of cattle in feedlots. However, initial reports on   wheat yields in drought areas of Kansas and Oklahoma were poor but better than   expected. The corn and soybean crops were progressing normally and generally   rated in good or better condition, especially in Nebraska. Agricultural   commodity prices remained high but volatile in recent weeks, shifting with   export and production forecasts. Rising feed costs trimmed margins for livestock   producers. Higher prices for fertilizer, fuel, and feed boosted farm loan   demand. Elevated crop prices fueled further gains in District cropland   values.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported only limited   wage pressures but noted additional upward pressure on input prices. Labor   shortages and wage pressures were reported in the retail sector and for select   occupations in the high-tech, energy, and transportation sectors. In addition,   several contacts expected future non-wage employment costs to rise as a result   of increased state unemployment insurance premiums. Manufacturers reported   continued upward pressure on input costs; slightly fewer manufacturers reported   increased finished product prices. Builders reported higher overall prices for   construction materials, and transportation contacts remained concerned about the   impact of high fuel costs on profit margins. Expectations across most industries   were for further input price increases in the coming three months. Restaurants   had raised menu prices since the last survey and expected further increases in   the coming months.
