      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 13, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District has improved overall since the last   Beige Book. Manufacturers reported increases in shipments and new orders in   March. Retailers achieved slight year-over-year increases in sales in March.   Motor vehicle dealers also reported year-over-year sales increases in March.   Third District banks reported little overall change in loan volume outstanding   since the last Beige Book, although a few reported increased lending on home   equity credit lines and growth in small business lending. Residential real   estate agents reported some increase in activity since the last Beige Book as   measured by inquiries, showings, and traffic, but little pickup in sales or   construction. Contacts in the commercial real estate sector said that leasing   and construction activity have remained slow since the last Beige Book.   Service-sector firms reported some increases in activity. Business contacts   reported further price increases for inputs as they did in the previous Beige   Book. Output price increases have also been reported in several sectors, but by   fewer contacts than for factor prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District business contacts is positive and has   strengthened slightly. Manufacturers forecast a broad rise in shipments and   orders during the next six months. Retailers expect sales to increase modestly   on a year-over-year basis. Bankers expect only slight growth in lending over the   next two quarters. Contacts in residential real estate have mixed views,   although some expect a pickup in sales of existing homes. Contacts in commercial   real estate expect market conditions to improve slowly during the year.   Service-sector companies expect continued slow growth through the first half of   2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      More than half of Third District   manufacturers reported increases in shipments and new orders in March -- a   stronger response than in February. Producers across a broad spectrum of 13   manufacturing sectors reported increased demand. The strongest reports came out   of the fabricated metal products and industrial machinery and equipment sectors.   Declines in orders were predominant only among producers of apparel and rubber   products. While several manufacturers cited existing customers as the source of   increased orders, other sources included new product offerings and expanding   international opportunities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over two-thirds of Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to   improve during the next six months. Among the firms surveyed in March, over 60   percent expect increases in new orders and shipments, and less than 5 percent   expect decreases. One supplier of construction industry materials reported   receiving contracts extending further out into the fourth quarter. Plans to   increase capital spending became more widespread with over one-third of area   manufacturers projecting an increase over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers generally reported slight   year-over-year increases in sales in March. One merchant said, "Things are   getting a little better, but there is no move to stronger growth." Retailers   indicated that sales of furniture and home goods have risen recently, but sales   of spring apparel have been slow to pick up, which retailers attributed to   unseasonably cold weather and the late Easter date this year. Some retailers   said they have experienced shortages of a few goods produced by Japanese   companies, mainly electronic products, but as of late March there did not appear   to be a widespread interruption of imports of consumer goods from the Far East.   Store executives surveyed for this report expect the current modest rate of   sales growth to continue through the spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers generally reported that sales were above the   year-ago level in March and were continuing to move up. Some dealers of various   brands noted the beginning of supply interruptions due to halts of vehicle and   parts production in Japan resulting from the earthquake and subsequent problems   there. These dealers said the supply problem had not yet become serious, but   they did not know how extensive it might become or how long it might last.   Dealers reported that demand for large vehicles has not declined yet despite the   recent increase in the price of gasoline. Dealers said they see evidence of   "pent-up demand" and they expect sales to remain strong as long as economic   conditions are improving and the price of gasoline does not rise much   higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total outstanding loan volume at most of the   Third District banks contacted for this report has shown little change in recent   weeks. Some banks in the region reported recent increases in lending extended on   home equity credit lines, but other forms of consumer credit have been level or   moved down. Some banks reported increases in commercial and industrial loans and   some types of commercial real estate loans. One banker said, "We're making more   small business loans, and commercial real estate lending is picking up except   for retail properties." The outlook among Third District bankers interviewed for   this report is that total loan volume will expand slowly this year, as overall   economic activity advances, with gains mostly in commercial and industrial and   consumer lending, but lending for residential or commercial construction is not   expected to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity has shown some signs of picking up in most parts of the Third District.   Real estate agents reported a recent increase in inquiries from prospective   buyers of existing homes. A common comment from agents was that "showings are   up." Several agents noted that the inventory of existing homes for sale is below   the level of a year ago. Agents expect sales to pick up by the usual seasonal   amount this spring, and some said they thought a stronger than usual gain might   be attained. However, agents generally expect sales prices to be level with or   slightly below prices recorded a year ago. Sales of new homes do not appear to   have increased notably in the region, according to local builders. Some   contractors reported a rise in remodeling and renovation work, but they also   noted that rainy weather has caused delays in this activity in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      There has been little change in commercial and industrial markets in the   Third District since the previous Beige Book, according to area nonresidential   developers, builders, and real estate firms. While rental concessions were   widely reported "even with renewals," one contact stated that "rents are   bottoming out and building values are starting to improve for top-quality   buildings." The overall market is expected to tighten slowly over the year. One   contact indicated that the market for industrial space "may see positive net   absorption by the end of the year, but three quarters of positive absorption   will be needed to put pressure on rental rates." Another contact identified   "shadow inventory" persisting in the office market and suggested that "a 7   percent unemployment rate is needed before the office market sees positive net   absorption." With anticipated recoveries extending from six months to two years   or more for various segments of nonresidential real estate, construction   activity remains weak with little growth expected through 2011. Some building   activity may increase for industrial space in the latter half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service-sector firms generally reported   increases in activity since the previous Beige Book; however, for most of those   contacted in March, the monthly and year-over-year gains have been modest. Firms   providing services to businesses as well as those providing services to   consumers indicated that activity has been advancing slightly as a result of   both increases in customers and per-customer usage. Most of the service-sector   firms contacted for this report expect growth to continue at around its recent   pace; few expect growth to accelerate in the near future. One contact expressed   the opinion of most in saying, "The cycle has turned up, but our customers are   being very cautious about increases in spending."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from manufacturers since the   previous Beige Book continue to indicate rising factor prices, especially for   energy inputs. Far fewer manufacturers report raising output prices, while a few   indicate resistance to hikes from their customers, if not expectations of   discounts. Retailers generally indicated that selling prices have been steady,   although some reported that they have raised apparel prices in response to   higher wholesale costs. Auto dealers reported continuing high prices for used   cars and recent increases in prices for new cars. Although the predominant view   among Third District firms is that overall inflation will move higher, slightly   fewer firms expressed that view compared to reports from the last Beige Book.   Nevertheless, several firms in the region said they have implemented hedges or   signed forward contracts for motor fuels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business firms in the region reported mostly steady wages since the last   Beige Book, although some continued to express concern about rising nonwage   employment costs. Employment agencies reported growth in demand for workers,   although they indicated that firms were continuing to delay additions to   permanent or temporary staff until the need for more workers becomes   pressing.
