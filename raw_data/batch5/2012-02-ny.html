      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has expanded at a somewhat slower pace since   the last report. Labor market conditions have been little changed in early 2012.   Prices remain relatively stable, although business contacts in various   industries indicate some increase in cost pressures. Manufacturers report   further improvement in general business conditions since the last report.   Retailers indicate mixed sales results for early 2012, though auto dealers   indicate some slowing. Tourism activity has strengthened somewhat since the last   report. Home sales have been steady to slightly softer since the start of the   year, but the rental market has continued to improve. Commercial real estate   markets have been mixed but slightly improved, on balance. Finance-sector   bonuses are reported to be down considerably from last year's levels. Finally,   bankers report increased loan demand, some further tightening in credit   standards for commercial borrowers, and lower delinquency rates across all   categories of loans except home mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report mixed sales results   for January and early February. One retail contact in upstate New York reports   strong sales in January, buoyed by continued strong demand from Canadian   shoppers. By contrast, another major retail contact indicates some slowdown in   sales, with mild weather hampering sales of winter gear in particular. Retailers   report that prices continue to be stable overall. Auto dealers in upstate New   York report that sales activity slowed in January, despite unseasonably mild   weather. Sales of new vehicles were down 3-5 percent from a year earlier, though   the weakness was not quite as pronounced as the figures suggest because January   2011 was a particularly strong month for comparison. Inventories and product   availability have improved and are no longer much of a factor in restraining   sales. Rochester-area dealers report continued strength in used car sales, but   dealers in the Buffalo area describe such sales as sluggish. Wholesale and   retail credit conditions remain favorable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer confidence continued to rebound in January. Both the Conference   Board's survey of residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA), and   Siena College's survey of New York State residents show confidence rising for   the third straight month and reaching its highest level since last spring.   Tourism activity has strengthened since the last report. New York City hotels   report that occupancy rates continued to run moderately ahead of a year earlier,   with room rates up modestly. After a sluggish December, Broadway theaters report   that attendance and revenues surged more than 30 percent above year-earlier   levels in January--apparently boosted by a combination of unseasonably mild   weather and a larger number of shows now running. Business appears to have   remained relatively robust into the first half of February.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The home sales market has   been mixed but, on balance, slightly softer since the last report, while the   residential rental market has continued to firm. Northern New Jersey's home   sales market has stabilized but has yet to show any significant signs of a   pickup; one industry contact surmises that underlying concern about pending   foreclosures and their potential impact on the market continues to weigh on   potential buyers. Apartment rental markets in New York City and northern New   Jersey have continued to strengthen, with effective rents (factoring in the   withdrawal of concessions) up 9-10 percent in Manhattan over the past year.   However, New York City's co-op and condo market has softened somewhat thus far   in 2012: in Manhattan and Brooklyn, apartment prices have held steady but sales   volume has tapered off a bit, while in the other boroughs both home prices and   volume have edged down. On a somewhat brighter note, real estate contacts in   western New York State report continued gradual improvement in home sales   activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets have been mixed but, on balance, somewhat   improved since the last report. Office markets in New York City and on Long   Island showed some further signs of strengthening in early 2012, with vacancy   rates drifting down and asking rents increasing modestly. In contrast, northern   New Jersey's market softened further, as vacancy rates rose to new highs, while   asking rents drifted down. In Westchester and southwestern Connecticut, asking   rents rose, even as office vacancy rates climbed to a multi-year high. Across   upstate New York, office markets were mostly steady, though vacancy rates   declined in the Albany area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major New York City employment   agency specializing in office jobs reports little change in labor market   conditions thus far in 2012; hiring activity and salaries remain flat.   Uncertainty about the economic and regulatory outlook is said to be restraining   hiring in the financial sector. An authority on New York City's securities   industry indicates that Wall Street compensation remains under downward pressure   and that bonuses are down 30 percent or more from last year's levels.   Manufacturers across New York State report increasingly widespread improvement   in business conditions in early 2012 and report steady growth in new orders,   shipments and employment. Non-manufacturing contacts report a modest pickup in   business activity and employment since the last report; both were reported to be   flat during the final months of 2011. Manufacturers continue to report modest   increases in both selling prices and prices paid. Non-manufacturing contacts   also indicate modest increases in their selling prices but more widespread hikes   in prices paid for inputs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small to medium-sized banks report   an increase in demand for all loan categories except consumer loans, for which   demand was little changed. Bankers report a particularly widespread increase in   demand for residential mortgages. Respondents also indicate a continued increase   in demand for refinancing. Bankers' responses suggest a tightening of credit   standards for commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans but no   change for the other loan categories. No banker reports an easing of standards   in any category. Respondents indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over   costs of funds for all loan categories. Bankers also note decreases in average   deposit rates. Bankers' responses point to steady delinquency rates on home   mortgage loans but decreases in delinquencies for all other loan categories.
