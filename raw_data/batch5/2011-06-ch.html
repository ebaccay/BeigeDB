      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District expanded more slowly in April and   May. Growth in consumer spending was slower, while the rate of increase in   business spending was steady. Manufacturing production grew more slowly, and   construction was again subdued. Credit conditions continued to improve. There   was some further pass-through of higher commodity prices to downstream prices.   Planting of corn and soybeans was delayed by wet and cool weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased at a slower   rate than during the previous reporting period. Retailers reported that sales   were mostly flat. Higher food and energy prices caused consumers to make fewer   shopping trips and purchase fewer discretionary items. Auto sales edged up, as   higher demand for passenger cars offset a slight decline in sales of trucks and   SUVs. Auto dealers reported that their inventory levels of small passenger cars   were starting to come under pressure due to higher than anticipated demand for   fuel efficient vehicles and production disruptions related to the situation in   Japan. Dealers of Japanese vehicles expect that supply problems will continue to   affect their inventory levels for the remainder of the year. These supply   constraints were noted to be causing used car prices to rise, as well as   benefitting passenger vehicle sales of the Detroit automakers. Quality   improvements were also said to have put the Detroit 3 in a better competitive   position.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending increased at a steady   pace in April and May. Inventories were little changed on balance. However, a   few manufacturers in the auto industry said they had increased inventories to   guard against potential future supply disruptions stemming from the situation in   Japan. Contacts indicated that capital expenditures were proceeding as planned,   with some manufacturers reporting a slight increase in capacity. There also was   a pick-up in merger and acquisition activity in the manufacturing sector. Labor   market conditions improved with continued strength in manufacturing, where   contacts again cited a shortage of qualified applicants for highly skilled   trades. A large staffing firm reported that billable hours ticked up and   permanent placement activity continued to increase. However, demand for   temporary workers softened in some regional labor markets and remained slow in   some industries, such as finance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity was   again subdued in April and May. Single-family home construction continued to be   constrained by the overhang of distressed properties in the resale market.   However, existing home sales picked up in parts of the District, lowering the   inventory of unsold homes to a degree. In the multifamily sector, the rental   market continued to improve. Residential rents rose further, and credit has   become increasingly more available for the purchase of apartment buildings. With   minimal single-family and condo development planned in the District, contacts   expect to see an increase in the construction of apartments in the near future.   Nonresidential construction edged up with stronger demand from the automotive   industry, small retail projects, and renovation. Contacts indicated that while   more private sector building projects are coming up for bid, stiff competition   continues to put downward pressure on pricing. Furthermore, while public sector   projects remain a source of strength, they are becoming smaller. Commercial real   estate conditions were little changed, with vacancy rates steady and landlords   keeping commercial rents low to maintain occupancy at existing levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing production growth slowed from   the previous reporting period, although contacts expected the recent slowdown   would be temporary with conditions expected to rebound in the coming months.   Capacity utilization in the steel industry was only marginally lower; and while   other manufacturers of industrial metals noted a softening in orders for second   quarter delivery, several also indicated that order books for third quarter   delivery were more positive. A contact speculated that the recent volatility in   industrial metals prices was leading some customers to delay orders, expecting   lower surcharges in the coming months and to avoid getting caught holding   inventory at elevated prices. Manufacturers of construction materials and   household goods also reported a decline in activity. In contrast, orders for   heavy trucks, agricultural and construction equipment were up. Fleet replacement   and robust activity in oil and gas extraction were cited as reasons for the   continued strength in demand for heavy equipment. Supply chain disruptions   reduced activity in the automotive sector, but mostly for the Japanese   automakers and their suppliers. District automakers were able to avoid the most   severe dislocations by reallocating parts to vehicles that are in high demand   and implementing contingency plans for alternative supply sources. Contacts   indicated that while it remains to be seen how effective these measures will be   over an extended period, these supply chain adjustments were occurring at a   faster rate than previously expected. In addition, a contact noted that some   automakers and their suppliers are moving planned summer shutdowns forward into   June to give supply chains time to repair and thus be in better position for a   ramp up in production in the third quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions continued to   improve in April and May. Corporate funding costs for a number of large firms in   the District decreased, and contacts noted that liquidity in corporate credit   markets remains ample. Banking contacts reported a slight increase in business   loan demand. Although much of this continued to be refinancing of existing debt,   contacts noted that they were starting to see more new commercial and industrial   loans in the pipeline. Credit availability, however, remained an issue for some   small business borrowers. A contact noted that larger banks have recently begun   to return to small business lending, but that the loan capacity of community   banks who have traditionally serviced this segment is still impaired. Outside of   banking, conditions in the municipal bond market improved and there was an   increase in investment activity by hedge funds, venture capital firms and other   forms of private equity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cost pressures increased in April before   subsiding some in May. Food and energy prices ended the period mostly lower, as   did prices for steel, copper, and other industrial metals. Despite the recent   declines, commodity prices remain elevated, and surcharges for fuel, metals, and   other commodities increased significantly during the reporting period. Lead   times also continued to be longer than normal, and shortages of some raw   materials were reported. Pass-through of higher costs to prices further   downstream remained moderate. Retailers reported that they were unable to pass   along much of the recent increase in wholesale prices; and in many cases, were   trying to compensate for the impact of higher food and energy prices on consumer   budgets by increasing promotions and discounts. Retail contacts also noted that   margins were tight, particularly for grocery stores, and further increases in   costs would likely need to be passed along. Wage pressures remained   moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Corn and soybean planting lagged the pace of   last spring in the District, as excess precipitation and cool temperatures   slowed field work. Planting conditions were best in Iowa and Illinois, where   planted acres had caught up to five-year averages after a slow start. The   emergence of corn and soybean plants was behind normal, except in Iowa. The poor   start to the growing season reduces the yield potential of the District corn   crop. Even so, there is still the chance of a very large crop. Agricultural   commodity markets were choppy during the reporting period. After peaking earlier   this year, corn, soybean, and wheat prices ended down. Cattle and milk prices   edged lower, while hog prices edged up.
