      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy continued to cool from high levels in September. 
  Falling fuel prices increased profits and optimism for some firms, but increased 
  caution has crept into the residential construction and energy industries. Energy 
  activity is still robust, but drilling has paused amid growing concern about 
  a glut of natural gas in storage. Nonresidential construction is vigorous, and 
  residential building is strong but continuing to cool. Manufacturing activity 
  is also quite strong, despite slowing demand from residential builders. Retail 
  sales were up, and demand in the service sector is still very good, but there 
  continue to be pockets of softness. Financial service firms reported slower 
  consumer lending, but commercial lending remained strong. Rain has slightly 
  improved agricultural conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy costs have fallen, relieving upward pressure on prices. Selling prices 
  have fallen for some products where demand has fallen precipitously, such as 
  for lumber. But in most instances, lower energy costs have halted the rise in 
  selling prices and not yet resulted in price declines. Some firms say lower 
  energy and commodity prices have boosted profits to offset recent sales declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      After peaking near $78 in July, crude oil prices fell to near $60 in September. 
  Demand for crude oil has been strong, but inventories are well above last year's 
  level and the 5-year average. Wholesale gasoline prices fell about 50 cents 
  per gallon in September, and the pump price fell further. Distillate prices 
  fell less rapidly than gasoline because the winter heating season is approaching. 
  Spot natural gas prices dipped from about $6 to just over $4 per million Btu 
  at Henry Hub. Natural gas in storage is roughly 12 percent higher than the 5-year 
  average. Some producers say they are holding natural gas off of the market in 
  anticipation of the higher prices the futures market shows for winter. Other 
  producers are preparing but not perforating their natural gas wells, so they 
  can sell forward the initial surge of production at a higher price.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home prices continued to rise in Houston, but in other cities softer demand 
  has led builders to add incentives. Apartment rental rates are edging up, but 
  at a slower pace than was expected earlier this year. Commercial builders reported 
  higher construction costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While there were scattered reports of hiring freezes or layoffs, the labor market 
  remains tight. Contacts across many sectors are still reporting problems finding 
  skilled labor. Skills in short supply include high-tech engineers, automobile 
  mechanics, truckers, accountants and workers for the energy and commercial construction 
  industries. Wages have increased for most of these types of employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand at a strong pace, boosted by commercial 
  construction and a backlog of orders from the energy industry. Sales of food 
  products were very strong and accelerated this month, which contacts attribute 
  to lower gasoline prices boosting restaurant activity. Demand has slowed for 
  corrugated boxes, and contacts in this industry have become less positive about 
  the outlook. High-tech manufacturers said shipments were still strong, but there 
  is continued uncertainty about the outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand continued to slow for products used in residential construction, but 
  some firms said recent slowing may have been partially weather-related. Producers 
  of stone, clay and glass reported sales declines of as much as 20 percent from 
  a year ago, and inventories are up for some products. Lumber producers reported 
  a significant drop in demand and increase in inventory over the past month, 
  mostly because of reduced demand from national markets, although sales in Texas 
  were also weaker. Producers of wood products, such as cabinets, say demand is 
  unchanged. A few producers of construction-related products report that some 
  large publicly-traded builders have sent letters asking for price reductions 
  to help them achieve quarterly income projections. This has led producers to 
  become wary about doing business with these builders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fabricated metals producers report no change in sales volume but had become 
  more optimistic. Demand for residential construction products has been soft, 
  but sales to the energy industry remain strong. Primary metals producers reported 
  little change in demand overall, with strong demand for commercial building 
  helping compensate for slowing activity from the residential sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gulf Coast refineries continued to operate at very high levels, near 97 percent 
  in recent weeks. Gasoline demand fell seasonally but is still 4 percent stronger 
  than last year. Demand softened for synthetic rubber and ethylene. Plant outages 
  temporarily boosted ethylene prices, and contacts suggested recent weakness 
  in sales is a result of customers using inventory in anticipation of lower prices 
  in the weeks ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity continued to increase for some temporary service firms, particularly 
  in Houston and East Texas, but demand dropped unexpectedly at some companies, 
  leading these contacts to be less optimistic. Accounting firms say demand growth 
  has slowed from last year, mostly due to a slow down in Sarbanes-Oxley related 
  work. Most law firms reported continued strong demand and are optimistic about 
  the outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall cargo shipping continued to increase, with some contacts noting particularly 
  strong international activity. Railroads reported strong demand, but there has 
  been a modest decline in trucking volume. Airlines reported a rebound in passenger 
  traffic, with good loads and bookings for long-haul and international flights. 
  Demand was reported as slower for short hops that are more affected by the increased 
  hassle of increased security restrictions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales improved in September after weakness over the summer. Sales growth 
  was better than expected but lower than earlier this year. Contacts mostly attribute 
  the pickup to lower gasoline prices, but other factors were mentioned. Auto 
  sales continued to be soft according to dealers, who say imported fuel-efficient 
  vehicles are selling well but sales of domestic vehicles remain poor. Sales 
  are strong for luxury vehicles, both domestic and imported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing market continues to soften but remains quite strong. Sales are particularly 
  strong in Houston, Austin and El Paso. Dallas real estate agents say the "buying 
  fervor" is a little slower, but relocations and healthy job growth are 
  still boosting activity. New home inventories have inched up, despite strong 
  demand in some markets. Building is expected to slow from the rapid pace of 
  growth seen earlier this year. While the market remains strong, contacts have 
  become "more nervous and anxious" in their outlook, especially given 
  recent reports of a decline in housing sales and prices at the national level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment construction remains strong, and occupancies are still near or above 
  90 percent in most areas. In Dallas, demand for apartments picked up robustly 
  over the past couple of months, boosting occupancies and rents. Houston contacts 
  attribute some recent softness to the "Katrina effect" as evacuees 
  leave apartments for permanent residences. With many Houston projects in the 
  works, some contacts were concerned with the possibility of overbuilding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and demand for office space is still increasing. Contacts characterize 
  the Houston market as "the healthiest we've seen in a long time." 
  Dallas contacts say the large blocks of space have become more limited, shifting 
  pricing power to landlords.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial loan demand remained strong. The market remains very competitive, 
  but firms say there is no apparent credit quality deterioration. Deposit growth 
  is steady, but deposits are increasingly difficult to get. Consumer lending 
  slowed further, which was attributed to borrowers paying down existing debt. 
  Automobile lending has softened.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After increasing strongly for months, the Texas and U.S. rig counts were virtually 
  unchanged in September. Low natural gas prices have raised caution in the industry. 
  Demand for oil-field equipment and energy services is still strong, stimulated 
  in part by international activity, where the rig count continues to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heavy supplies of natural gas have increased pipeline pressure in parts of 
  the country. Concern is rapidly growing about the possibility that a warm winter 
  would sustain lower prices. Drilling has not yet been cut, which contacts say 
  is partly because of the backlog of equipment and workers in the industry. Firms 
  are hesitant to give up a rig or their place in line for oilfield equipment 
  or services. While oil prices have fallen, this drilling is expected to be more 
  immune from a price downturn because oil projects are larger and based on conservative 
  outlooks for oil prices, have long-term horizons and deeper pockets behind them.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the District continues to suffer from severe or extreme drought, but 
  September rain brought some relief. The moisture helped the wheat crop get off 
  to a good start, improved range and pasture conditions and eased pressure on 
  livestock producers to liquidate herds. Cotton harvesting is under way in some 
  parts of the District, and contacts say production will be 35 percent less than 
  last year. Contacts remain concerned that low crop production and rising costs 
  will make it difficult for producers to repay farm loans. Federal grants recently 
  made available under the livestock assistance program are expected to ease the 
  cash flow situation for some producers.
