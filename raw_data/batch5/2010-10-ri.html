      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Feedback on economic activity in the Fifth District continued to be mixed   since our last report. Activity at retail and services firms was, on balance,   flat to down. Manufacturing activity also edged down over the last month, while   port contacts gave mixed reports. Both residential and commercial real estate   activity was mostly unchanged from the weak levels of the recent past, and   several contacts stated that property values had stabilized. Activity in the   banking sector improved modestly, however, led by gains in business lending and   home refinancing. Tourism continued to strengthen in the District, with bookings   increasing over the last month. Reports on labor markets varied, with permanent   hiring flat to down and temporary employment picking up slightly. Price and wage   growth in the services and manufacturing sectors remained subdued since our last   report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity generally softened since our last   report, although a few contacts reported an uptick in sales. Several building   supply retailers reported declining sales revenues, while a central North   Carolina discount department store manager described sales revenues as "steady."   A store manager in West Virginia indicated that back-to-school sales were "good,   but not shooting off rockets," and a North Carolina department store wholesaler   said business had picked up. However, a North Carolina furniture store manager   said that local unemployment was causing him to sell at close to cost. Indeed,   big-ticket sales, particularly among automobile dealers, fell sharply in our   most recent survey. One exception was a car dealer in West Virginia, who   reported that sales rose modestly. Recently polled retailers noted flat or   declining customer traffic, although a representative of central Virginia   merchants reported a modest increase in credit card use. Price growth   strengthened somewhat at retail establishments, according to our District   survey, while growth in average wages was little changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business activity at services firms weakened   overall, although several services providers reported rising revenues. Demand   for construction-related services was particularly soft, according to recent   survey returns. A contractor commented that he was taking jobs without overhead   or profit just to hold on to his subcontractors, while awaiting a pick-up in   business. According to contacts at healthcare systems that we recently polled,   consumer demand was steady, while changes required by healthcare reform had   mixed effects on their budgets. In contrast, several high-tech firms reported   stronger demand; executives expressed concern about the stability of the   economy, however. Price change at services firms remained modest over the last   month, according to our latest District survey, and average wages grew slightly.   A couple of services providers stated that their wage increases were directed   toward keeping key employees rather than toward standard, across-the-board   increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing edged down in   September after expanding for the last seven months, with reports of sharp   declines that were partially offset by pockets of strength. Several textile and   apparel contacts described their business as having "no depth" and noted that   their customers expressed uncertainty about the direction of their business. A   tire manufacturer reported that a backlog of orders had "tanked" and the company   had cut production, noting that he did not expect any improvement for the rest   of the year. A manufacturer of exterior doors for residential housing said that   his firm had seen a sharp drop-off in orders and shipments over the last several   months, with no indication that the trend might reverse. He anticipated that the   housing and building products sector would be anemic in 2011. However, a   furniture manufacturer reported an increase in orders and noted that his   customers said that Labor Day sales were better than anticipated and held up   throughout September. In addition, an auto parts supplier stated that orders   remained strong and had increased slightly over the last month. Finally, our   survey contacts reported that raw materials and finished goods prices, as well   as wages, increased at a slower pace than in our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Port activity in the District over the last three months was mixed, with   imports generally outperforming exports. Several port officials stated that   imports at their facilities were up slightly in recent months, but exports had,   at best, stabilized over the last few months. However, exports of commodities   were up, according to one port authority, partly due to increased grain   shipments to Russia and Pakistan. Several sources stated that the peak season   had come and gone, with businesses ordering earlier than in past years and now   becoming cautious about building inventory until they have a better sense of   underlying demand over the remainder of the year. Some softness in shipping   rates was noted at several ports, but one shipper reported that utilization   rates of both ships and containers were "getting back to full capacity."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity around the District improved   slightly, according to most bank contacts. Several bankers reported that the   volume of new mortgage loans increased slightly in September, although one   banking executive noted that most home loans went to people moving into the   area. New mortgage activity at a major regional bank in the District, however,   was reported as flat in recent weeks. Most bankers said that the bulk of   mortgage lending was for refinancing, and one loan officer noted that   refinancing activity stopped abruptly whenever the smallest uptick in mortgage   rates occurred. Industrial loans were up slightly for equipment as well as   inventory, according to one lender, while another banker reported very little   commercial real estate lending. Several bankers stated that the competition   among banks for quality loans was increasing. An officer reported that his bank   had lowered rates to recapture auto dealer floor plan loans that had been lost   to larger, more aggressive banks. An increase in merger and acquisition activity   was widely reported. Several bankers cited examples of companies with strong   balance sheets that were buying weaker competitors. Most bank officials reported   improved credit quality, with a decline in both the number of foreclosures and   late payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity remained   soft overall since our last report, despite some signs of a modest improvement.   Several brokers reported that markets in their area were extremely slow,   although they cited prices as generally stable. A market analyst reported that   the number of houses that were under contract in Eastern Virginia was down more   than 20 percent from a year ago, while active listings were up in excess of 10   percent. Moreover, the length of time needed to close a sale was increasing   sharply. In contrast, a Realtor specializing in high-end properties noted that   luxury homes in his area were selling, but only among properties that had been   heavily discounted. And a broker from the Baltimore area reported a slight   increase recently in the number of mortgage applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity continued to be quite weak throughout most of   the District since our last report, with most contacts reporting difficulty in   obtaining loans for new projects. Several commercial Realtors indicated that   financing was not only difficult, but also applications took an exceptionally   long time to be processed. Moreover, local companies needed to be well funded to   get loan approvals from banks. A Realtor in Central Virginia stated that both   local and nationally based companies were less confident about expanding than   they were a month ago. Leasing rates remained on a downward trend, according to   several Realtors, with some firms trying to take advantage of lower rates to   upgrade their office or retail location. In contrast to most other areas, the   D.C. area showed signs of improvement, with one Realtor noting a pickup in   office leasing activity. Another Realtor in that area reported that retailers   were cautiously revisiting development plans that had been abandoned a year   ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity strengthened since our last   report. A contact along the District's coast reported solid bookings in recent   weeks, with modest increases in the length of stay and the level of   discretionary spending over the last month. A Myrtle Beach contact attributed   the boost in visitations to increased spending on tourism promotion and   infrastructure. In Virginia Beach, a hotel manager credited the gains in   business at her hotel to recent renovations and increased group bookings. A   contact on the Outer Banks of North Carolina indicated that discounting, coupled   with a "few value items thrown in", had boosted tourism in her area and noted   that restaurants and recreation venues were doing well. A manager at a mountain   lodge in Virginia reported that sales of time shares rose and bookings had   increased over the last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Assessments of Fifth District labor market   activity were varied. In the service sector, survey respondents reported   moderate hiring at their firms. A contact at a central North Carolina healthcare   system cited plans to hire a significant number of nurses and high-tech workers.   Employment agencies reported somewhat stronger demand for temporary help in   recent weeks, particularly in automotive and other manufacturing sectors. A   branch manager of a temp agency in Raleigh, N.C., stated that manufacturing   companies had openings for skilled positions, but the employee pools for those   positions were weak enough to limit hiring. Moreover, survey respondents from   most manufacturing industries indicated that employment generally edged down,   while the average workweek flattened and wage growth slowed. Several retailers   reported cutting positions in early September, but other merchants indicated   that they were making no changes to employment.
