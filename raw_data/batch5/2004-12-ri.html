      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 2004
      </strong>
      <p>
       The Fifth District economy expanded at a moderate pace in late October through 

  mid November though there were increasing signs that retail sales and manufacturing 

  were losing momentum. District services businesses generally reported solid 

  revenue growth since our last report but retailers said sales barely increased 

  and employment in the sector was flat. Manufacturers said both shipments and 

  new orders expanded somewhat more slowly in October and softened in early November. 

  Housing markets continued to show healthy growth since our last report, although 

  the pace of expansion was less robust than in late summer. In contrast, commercial 

  real estate conditions brightened considerably from the lackluster pace seen 

  earlier in the year. District manufacturers continued to face higher prices 

  for some raw materials, notably oil, gas, and steel, and contacts said that 

  they were not able to fully pass along the higher costs. Business contacts generally 

  reported that prices for their products and services continued to rise only 

  modestly. In agriculture, heavy rainfall hampered harvesting activity, but contacts 

  expected near-record corn and soybean crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Services firms in the District continued to report increased customer demand 

  in recent weeks, though the pace of growth slackened somewhat. A contact at 

  a North Carolina freight company said business was steady despite their charging 

  higher freight rates to offset increased gasoline costs. A physical therapist 

  in Goldsboro, N.C., noted that revenues at her organization had declined in 

  part because of a continued slow economy in that area of North Carolina. But 

  some contacts were relatively upbeat. A financial services business in central 

  Virginia told us clients became more optimistic as the uncertainty surrounding 

  the timely conclusion of the U.S. presidential election was removed. In labor 

  markets services employment expanded at a slower pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from District retailers indicated that sales growth softened in October 

  and early November and contacts were less optimistic about holiday revenues. 

  A furniture store in central North Carolina and a lumber retailer in Columbia, 

  S.C., reported slower growth in their sales since our last report. Automobile 

  dealerships in the District generally reported little change in sales although 

  a dealer in Norfolk, Va., and a dealer in Orangeburg, S.C., reported that sales 

  declined in early November. On a brighter note, a manager at a large North Carolina 

  bookstore said holiday purchases began about a week earlier than usual while 

  a contact at a department store in the lowlands of South Carolina said current-store 

  sales goals had been "easily met."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Growth slowed in the District's manufacturing sector in October and in early-to-mid 

  November. Factory shipments and new orders expanded at a somewhat slower pace 

  and manufacturing employment was flat. A number of firms in the District suggested 

  that sales were little changed from previous months; a packaging manufacturer 

  in North Carolina said that their business was holding its own though a furniture 

  manufacturer in North Carolina was a little more upbeat, noting that new orders 

  were "coming in on a more steady basis." But a plastics manufacturer in North 

  Carolina noted a "dip" in manufacturing activity and a textile producer there 

  said business was "very seasonally slow." Prices for raw materials rose at a 

  quicker pace in recent weeks although continued competition from abroad led 

  many District manufacturers to hold the line on prices. An electric equipment 

  manufacturer in Greenville, S.C., reported moderately higher prices for raw 

  materials, noting that rapid economic development in China had spurred sharply 

  higher demand for steel and the types of metal castings and machined parts used 

  in his business.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District loan officers reported a modest uptick in loan demand from late October 

  through mid November. Lenders said that demand for commercial loans picked up 

  after the presidential election in November as uncertainty regarding the election 

  outcome dissipated. Bankers in Charlottesville, Va., told us that borrowing 

  to finance construction and real estate purchases strengthened considerably. 

  Residential mortgage lending was stable in most areas of the District. A Charleston, 

  W.V., banker reported fairly strong mortgage demand for new home purchases as 

  the housing market there "rocked right along," but the contact said that mortgage 

  refinancing activity remained light. District bankers reported little change 

  in credit standards for borrowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District real estate agents reported generally strong housing markets in recent 

  weeks, but said that growth in home sales continued to tail off. An agent in 

  Asheville, N.C., told us his office set a record for home sales in October and 

  a real estate analyst in the Carolinas noted that the resort and retirement 

  markets remained strong. A contact in Odenton, Md., however, told us that homes 

  in the low to middle-price range were staying on the market a "tad" longer. 

  An agent in Fairfax County, Va., also reported slower growth in home sales but 

  said that homes priced below $400 thousand still received multiple offers. Confirming 

  strength in the Northern Virginia market, a real estate agent in Vienna, Va., 

  said housing markets remained "hot" in all price ranges. On the price front, 

  District homebuilders reported that increases in materials costs had slowed 

  in recent weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate conditions brightened throughout the Fifth District 

  during the past six weeks. Agents stated that the recent improvement had been 

  driven primarily by increased leasing of new retail and office space--much of 

  it by expanding small businesses. "The calls we are getting are from people 

  who want to take their businesses out of their homes and other small spaces 

  and move to somewhere they can grow," noted a contact in Raleigh, N.C. Contacts 

  also noticed "some early signals" of a recovery in industrial leasing. Realtors 

  in Charleston, W.V., Charlotte and Greensboro, N.C., Columbia, S.C., and Washington, 

  D.C., mentioned a rise in industrial activity. The leasing of smaller spaces 

  called "warehouse condos" was particularly strong. Adding to the recent upbeat 

  tone, vacancies across all sectors edged lower and rents held steady. Despite 

  firmer demand, office and industrial construction remained stagnant while retail 

  construction maintained its steady pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District tourist activity was mixed since our last report. Contacts on the Outer 

  Banks of North Carolina and in Virginia Beach, Va., reported little change in 

  tourism in November. A contact in Virginia Beach said that corporate travel 

  budgets appeared to have tightened and that customers at her hotel were increasingly 

  making last minute reservations as a result. In contrast, a contact in Myrtle 

  Beach, S.C., reported somewhat stronger business and indicated that tourist 

  spending continued to grow. Reports from mountain areas were also mixed. A manager 

  at a resort in western Virginia said that holiday bookings were above year-ago 

  levels, while a contact in West Virginia said bookings were under pressure from 

  higher gasoline prices which kept travelers closer to home.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Temporary Employment
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts at employment agencies reported firmer demand for temporary employees 

  in recent weeks. A manager in Raleigh, N.C., said that continued economic recovery, 

  a pick up in jobs creation, and "relief that the political process was done 

  for this year" all led to stronger demand for temporary workers. He expected 

  his temporary, temp-to-hire, and direct-placement business to continue to prosper. 

  An agent in Morrisville, N.C., told us that increased marketing efforts were 

  paying off and that placement of temporary workers was picking up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Heavy precipitation coupled with cooler weather in November delayed field work 

  and hindered harvesting activity in some areas of the District. Cotton and soybean 

  harvesting in South Carolina and in Virginia in particular were slowed by rainfall. 

  Despite the interruptions, analysts expected near-record yields of corn and 

  soybeans. Small grain crops were reported to be in mostly good condition in 

  Maryland, South Carolina and West Virginia. In addition, the harvesting of apples 

  and sweet potatoes was nearing completion in South Carolina. Christmas tree 

  producers in North Carolina reported that they were in full swing for the upcoming 

  holiday season.
