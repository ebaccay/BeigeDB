      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded  modestly from mid-October to mid-November, but with some mixed signals across  industries.  Consumer spending  strengthened overall, and energy and agricultural activity remained strong.  The pace of growth of manufacturing activity  was somewhat sluggish, but plant managers were generally optimistic about the  future.  Residential real estate activity  weakened further, while commercial real estate activity was solid.  Bankers reported softer loan demand and  tightened credit standards.  Wage  pressures increased, although the pace of hiring moderated.  Price pressures were generally modest, with  stable retail prices but slightly higher prices in manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Consumer spending strengthened  since the previous survey.  After easing  in the last survey period, sales at retail stores recovered, with inventories  remaining relatively stable.  Sales of  apparel and electronics were relatively strong, while home furnishings were  weak.  Automobile sales continued to  decline, with especially weak demand for large vans, trucks and SUVs, but  relatively strong sales of fuel efficient and smaller cars.  Following strong travel activity in September,  tourist visits moderated in line with normal seasonal patterns.  Still, most contacts in the hotel industry  reported higher activity compared to expectations.  Average daily hotel room rates were up in  October and hotel occupancy rates remained strong.  Restaurant sales were up slightly since the  last survey period, and contacts anticipated strong activity in the next three  months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Manufacturing activity  grew modestly since the last survey period, and firms remained generally  optimistic about the future.  After easing  slightly in September, production edged higher in October.  The volume of shipments also increased  compared to the previous survey period.   On the other hand, new orders and orders for exports edged down, suggesting  some near-term sluggishness.  Employment  also edged down, and factories continued to reduce inventories of both  materials and finished goods.  Capital  spending remained relatively strong, however, and plant managers reported  positive expectations about activity six months out, with production and  employment expected to improve and the rate of pullback of inventories expected  to moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential  real estate activity declined further, while commercial real estate activity  remained solid.  Home sales weakened in  most areas and many residential contacts reported negative expectations about  near-term activity.  Demand for  higher-priced homes was especially weak.   Home prices fell slightly and inventories of unsold homes rose in most  major markets.  However, home inventories  eased a bit in the Denver metro area market, and some  energy-producing areas registered home price appreciation.  Commercial real estate sales activity remained  solid, with little change in office vacancy rates and absorption rates.  The overall pace of commercial construction slowed,  except in the District's energy-producing regions, where activity remained  robust.  Several District contacts  reported weakness in industries that supply materials and equipment to construction  firms.  Office rents remained higher than  year-ago levels and were expected to continue to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Bankers  reported weaker loan demand, tighter credit standards, and little change in  deposits since the last survey.  Demand  for residential real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans again  fell moderately.  Demand also declined  slightly for commercial real estate loans and consumer installment loans.  Overall loan quality was stable, and  respondents expect little or no change in loan quality over the next six  months.  Some banks reported a further  tightening of credit standards for commercial and residential real estate  loans, although there were fewer such reports than in the previous survey.  Bank deposits held steady, as increases in  money market deposit accounts were offset by declines in CDs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District energy activity remained  robust.  Drilling was particularly strong  in the energy-producing regions of Colorado and in Oklahoma.  Energy contacts reported the availability of  equipment and services as their top constraint.   Many respondents reported labor shortages, particularly for skilled and  professional workers, but most indicated that availability of labor was not a  limiting factor in drilling activity.   Most energy firms surveyed expected to see robust drilling activity in  the next three months.  However, some  companies recently reduced their budgets for international operations due to  higher drilling costs associated with appreciation of foreign currencies, which  have cut into their profits given the pricing of oil in U.S. dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Agricultural conditions remained  favorable.  The fall harvest was almost  complete and winter wheat emergence was progressing normally.  Dry weather aided harvest progress, but  reduced soil moisture levels and eroded pasture conditions, especially in Oklahoma, where some livestock were  placed on supplemental feed.  Strong  foreign and domestic demand for agricultural commodities helped support crop  prices.  Above-average corn and soybean  yields coupled with strong crop prices and rising exports were boosting farm  income, despite rising input costs.  High  feed costs were trimming livestock profits.   Farm credit conditions strengthened as loan repayment rates remained  high and the number of requests for loan renewals and extensions eased  further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Wages
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District  labor markets remained tight since the previous survey, although the pace of  new job growth continued to slow.  Hiring  announcements outpaced planned layoffs, with significant hiring reported by  firms in manufacturing and health care industries.  Reports of labor shortages were most notable  in energy-producing areas of the District, although District energy firms  seemed less concerned about finding workers than firms in other  industries.  District contacts in the  retail and hospitality industries experienced particular difficulty hiring and retaining  staff.  In response to continuing labor  shortages, wage pressures were higher than in previous surveys.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Price  pressures in the District generally remained modest.  Retail prices were stable, with most  retailers expecting no change in prices in the next three months.  Restaurants anticipated raising menu prices,  but said food costs had moderated since the previous survey.  Builders also reported some easing in the  price of raw materials.  The share of  manufacturers reporting higher raw material prices edged up slightly.  After steadying in the last survey,  manufacturing selling prices also increased slightly.  Nevertheless, a much smaller fraction of  manufacturers increased selling prices than reported higher raw materials  costs.  The share of manufacturing  respondents expecting future increases in the price for raw materials remained  high, but did not change from the previous month.
