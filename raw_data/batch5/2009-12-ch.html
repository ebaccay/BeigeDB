      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District edged up in October before leveling   off in early November. Contacts generally expected activity to continue to   "bounce along the bottom" into 2010. Consumer spending was mixed. Business   spending was flat except for an increase in temporary hires. Manufacturing   activity benefitted from inventory restocking, but this slowed in November.   Commercial real estate conditions deteriorated, but residential real estate   conditions continued to improve. Credit conditions, while still tight, improved   marginally. Price pressures increased for some commodities, while wage pressures   were minimal. Wet weather hampered the harvest even further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending since the previous   reporting period was mixed. Auto sales increased in October, but leveled off in   early November. Despite the flattening in sales, auto dealers reported that   inventories remained in line with sales. As a whole, retail sales excluding   autos were down slightly over the same time period, though sales of clothing and   entertainment items improved. In addition, contacts indicated that sales were   better than expected at several large retailers. Optimism for the upcoming   holiday season increased and contacts reported more interest in big-ticket items   like furniture and household appliances. Black Friday promotions were expected   to be substantial as customers remained price sensitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending was little changed   from the previous reporting period. Contacts again indicated that they were   holding the line on costs, adding inventory solely to replace depleted stocks   and limiting capital expenditures and hiring. Labor market conditions remained   weak with hiring limited outside of healthcare and education. Unemployment in   the District increased. A contact noted that the duration of unemployment spells   continued to rise, citing as a factor the growing mismatch between the mostly   entry level jobs available and the experience level of unemployed workers in   many local areas. In the manufacturing sector, the recent increase in activity   resulted in longer hours and temporary hires, but most contacts indicated that   permanent labor force additions were not expected. Contacts in retail trade   indicated some seasonal hiring was taking place, but at reduced hours. However,   a recruitment firm indicated that expectations had improved and some clients had   begun planning for future hiring. In addition, a large staffing firm reported   that billable hours had increased in recent weeks; most of this was in entry   level industrial jobs, but some modest improvement in professional services was   also noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity   decreased in October and early November. Builders indicated that they were   maintaining a minimal level of speculative home capacity to meet the current low   level of demand, and few expected construction to increase much in 2010. This   sentiment seems to contrast with some continuing signs of improvement in   residential real estate conditions: namely, stabilizing rents and prices and   declining inventories of unsold single-family homes. Contacts indicated that the   renewal and expansion of the federal homebuyer tax credit would help to support   demand, as home sales slipped prior to the original expiration deadline for the   credit. The multifamily housing market, on the other hand, deteriorated further   as credit remained very tight for potential buyers of condominiums and   townhomes. Demand also continued to be weak for nonresidential construction,   with public construction accounting for the vast majority of activity.   Competition for stimulus-related projects scheduled to begin in the coming year   was indicated to be fierce. Commercial real estate conditions deteriorated   again. Vacancy rates increased putting further downward pressure on rents, with   owners actively renegotiating lease agreements in order to preserve occupancy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity leveled off from the   previous reporting period as the restocking of inventories slowed. Automakers   reported that sales in early November were weaker than expected as dealer   pricing and customer credit conditions were only marginally better than in   October. However, they see demand gradually firming. In addition, inventories   are at comfortable levels. Auto suppliers benefitted from the increase in auto   sales; although with the rebuilding of auto inventories slowing in early   November, contacts reported that orders had flattened. Steel production   increased on the basis of strong demand from the auto sector as well as low   service center inventories. In contrast, tool and specialty metal manufacturers   indicated that their customer's inventories were still elevated, holding back   activity. Aerospace remained a bright spot with aircraft manufacturers building   inventories. Inventories of heavy machinery remained elevated despite the fact   that increased road building was helping to spur demand for construction   equipment. Orders for medium and to a lesser degree heavy-duty trucks increased   in order to meet pending 2010 EPA admission standards, but overall activity   remained quite low. In contrast, demand for pharmaceuticals continued to be   strong. Furthermore, favorable terms of trade and rising foreign demand led to   export growth, particularly to Asia and South America.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions improved marginally   since the previous reporting period. Credit spreads narrowed, but longer-term   yields increased leaving net corporate funding costs up slightly for a number of   District firms. Banking contacts reported a marginal increase in C&amp;I loan   demand, however most of this borrowing was going to refinance or pay off   existing debt. Contacts also indicated greater interest in mergers and   acquisitions and distressed real estate investment. Lending terms continued to   improve, but credit policy remained tight with standards elevated. Credit   conditions were particularly tight for residential and commercial developers.   Asset quality showed further signs of stabilizing, and some recent improvement   was noted outside of commercial real estate. Banks continued the process of   deleveraging with contacts indicating that the pool of creditworthy borrowers   was not expanding rapidly enough to justify credit expansion. The reluctance of   banks to realize expected losses on commercial real estate loans was also cited   as a factor holding back the flow of credit. Liquidity in the secondary mortgage   market is a concern with the end of the Fed's agency security purchase program   nearing and increasingly stringent GSE guidelines for condominiums and   townhomes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures increased slightly in   October and early November. Contacts cited increases in the price of steel and   specialty metals like aluminum, nickel, and copper as well as higher prices for   resin, plastics, and lumber. An increase in energy prices was also reported,   although natural gas prices remained low. Pass-through of cost pressures to   downstream prices was small on balance, as contacts indicated pricing power   remained limited. Wage pressures were minimal. However, some contacts noted that   they had restored non-wage compensation that they had suspended earlier in the   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Precipitation continued to hamper the   harvest, particularly for corn. Corn harvesting was behind the pace of a year   ago, which was a late harvest as well. Toward the end of the reporting period,   the soybean harvest neared completion. Comments on corn and soybean yields   varied from "so-so" to "better than expected" to "unbelievable." The corn crop   was damaged in some areas, and across the District there were other problems   caused by wetness. Wet corn strained equipment, leading to an abnormally large   number of repairs and shortages of some parts. Moreover, costs were much higher   than normal to dry corn for storage and shipment, and there were also shortages   of liquid propane for dryers. Elevators were forced to limit the amount of wet   corn accepted some days. Corn and soybean prices rallied higher in October and   early November. However, margins for crop farms were thought to range from   negative to slightly positive. Milk and hog prices were up some, but cattle   prices lagged. Losses continued for livestock operations. Expectations increased   that financially stressed farmers would be forced to sell or liquidate assets.   Higher oil prices assisted the ethanol industry in generating enough income to   cover costs.
