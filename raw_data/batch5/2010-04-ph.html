      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity moved up somewhat in the Third District since the last   Beige Book, on balance, although the advance did not include all sectors.   Manufacturers, on balance, reported increases in shipments and new orders.   Retailers generally posted gains from February to March. Motor vehicle dealers   indicated that sales increased. Third District banks reported steady to slightly   decreased loan volume outstanding. Residential real estate agents and   homebuilders said home sales increased from February to March. Nonresidential   real estate leasing and construction activity continued to be weak, but contacts   reported some increase in purchase and investment activity. Business firms in   the region indicated that prices of most goods and services have been steady,   although there were increased reports of rising prices for basic materials and   construction-related products.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District business contacts is that business activity   will continue to move up slowly in most sectors in the months ahead.   Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next six   months, on balance. Retailers expect sales to expand modestly as consumer   confidence is slowly restored. Auto dealers expect the sales rate to remain   above last year's pace. Bankers expect slight increases in lending. Residential   real estate contacts expect home sales to rise somewhat during the balance of   the year, but they are unsure of the immediate trend after the expiration of the   federal tax credit for homebuyers. Contacts in nonresidential real estate expect   leasing to advance slightly as tenants take advantage of concessions and lower   rents, but they do not expect much growth in demand for commercial space until   firms begin to add workers in substantial numbers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported   increases in shipments and new orders in March, on balance, although the number   of firms recording gains was not as large as it was in February. However, most   of the major manufacturing industries in the region posted net increases. In   general, manufacturers indicated that demand for their products was picking up   slowly. One said, "Business is better than a year ago, but not exciting," and   another said, "There is a slow, steady gain."
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers who were queried in March expect business   conditions to improve during the next six months, on balance, and the level of   optimism has been practically unchanged from last month. Among the firms   surveyed in March, about half expect increases in new orders and shipments;   about one-tenth expect decreases. Capital spending plans among area   manufacturers remain positive, on balance, but have weakened since the last   Beige Book. About one-fifth of the firms polled in March plan to increase   expenditures for new plant and equipment, although two-thirds plan to maintain   level spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers reported slight gains in   sales in March compared with February and with March of last year. They   generally indicated that spring apparel sales were moving up in line with   expectations. Some retailers also noted that sales of housewares and home   furnishings had risen recently, and one store executive said this increase   "shows consumers are more willing to spend, although they are still being   cautious." Looking ahead, Third District retailers expect modest year-over-year   increases in sales for the spring season, although they point out that the gain   will be from a low sales level a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers reported an improved pace of sales in March   compared with February. They said inventories remained well under control.   Dealers expect sales to continue to move up through the spring, and they also   anticipate that some domestic franchises that had been discontinued will be   restored in the months ahead. In general, dealers are maintaining their   expectations that total sales for this year will be slightly ahead of last   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total outstanding loan volume at most of the   Third District banks contacted for this report has been level or has declined   slightly since the last Beige Book. On balance, commercial bank lending officers   said there has been a small increase in consumer lending, although some bankers   noted an increase in paydowns and payoffs. Bankers generally reported declines   in most other credit categories. Most of the surveyed banks indicated that   credit quality measures showed little change since the last Beige Book.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District bankers expect some growth in lending. They   expect gains in consumer lending and lending to businesses. Several bankers   indicated they plan to step up business lending, but only to borrowers "with a   sound income stream," as one contact said. Some bankers also said they expected   commercial real estate lending and lending for construction to begin to rise.   Bankers noted that commercial real estate funding by both banks and nonbank   financial institutions was starting to become more available.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of new and existing   homes picked up somewhat in March after falling in February. Sales continued to   be stronger in the lower- and moderate-price segments of the market for both new   and existing homes. Real estate agents said the inventory of homes listed for   sale remained elevated, and sales prices have been steady or declining across   the region. Local real estate agents and homebuilders said it was difficult to   determine whether the recent increase in sales was the result of buyers signing   contracts to take advantage of the federal tax credit before its April   expiration or whether the upturn reflected a more fundamental seasonal increase.   However, the general view among Third District real estate contacts is that any   improvement in home sales during the rest of the year will be modest. As one   contact commented, "We have hit the bottom, but now people are only going to buy   if they need to."
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that leasing and construction   activity remained slow. Contacts reported that vacancy rates have been about   steady for most types of commercial property since the last Beige Book, although   vacancy rates for some retail centers have risen. Effective rents continued to   be under downward pressure as landlords make concessions to keep existing   tenants and attract new ones. Contacts expect nonresidential real estate markets   to remain weak as long as tenants are unwilling to expand. One contact said,   "The office market will suffer until employment returns to more normal levels."   However, some contacts said they believe investor interest in purchasing or   financing commercial property was beginning to increase because expected returns   to real estate investment appeared to be rising relative to other investment   classes. Additionally, some contacts noted that the decline in property values   in the past year has prompted some tenants to purchase the buildings they   occupy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on input costs and output prices have been   mixed since the last Beige Book. Around one-third of the manufacturing firms   polled in March noted increases in the costs of the commodities they use, and   around two-thirds reported steady input costs. Most continued to report that   they have not raised the prices of the products they make, although some   producers of food products and metals have raised prices. Construction firms   noted recent increases in the costs of lumber, drywall, metal products,   oil-based products, and some glass products. Retailers reported mostly flat   selling prices.
