      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 16, 2013
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a slow pace in   late November and December. Many contacts expected that growth in 2013 would   match or outperform 2012, but some remained more cautious than others, citing   the impact of continued uncertainty over federal fiscal policy on the near-term   economic outlook. Consumer spending increased somewhat, while growth in business   spending remained tepid. Growth in manufacturing production was again moderate.   Residential construction continued to increase at a slow but steady pace, but   nonresidential construction remained weak. Credit conditions continued to   improve gradually. Cost pressures eased some, and wage pressures remained   moderate. Cattle and hog prices moved higher; while corn, soybean, and milk   prices moved lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased somewhat   from the previous reporting period. Retailers noted that holiday sales were   slightly below expectations. Multiple retailers reported that store traffic   volumes fluctuated more throughout the holiday season than in recent years.   Apparel and jewelry sales were strong, while sales of toys and electronics were   more in line with expectations, and general merchandise sales were weaker. Auto   sales in the District lagged the national pace, with several dealers indicating   that lower consumer confidence hurt year-end sales. Some auto dealers also noted   that inventory levels were slightly high. However, dealers expected new car   sales to be stronger in 2013 due to pent-up consumer demand, easing credit   conditions, and rising used vehicle prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Growth in business spending remained   tepid in late November and December. Inventory investment was little changed   while spending on equipment and structures continued to slowly increase. Some   contacts again noted a reluctance to spend given heightened uncertainty related   to federal fiscal policy. Labor market conditions were unchanged. Hiring plans   for the coming year were limited. Retail employment increased with some seasonal   hiring, but few significant full-time post-holiday additions were expected. A   recruiting firm noted that customers that are heavily dependent upon government   spending were very cautious about increasing headcount amidst the fiscal cliff   negotiations. Companies with exposures to Europe were likewise being more   conservative in their hiring plans. However, contacts indicated that there is   still strong demand for talent in technology, engineering, accounting and   finance, energy, and skilled manufacturing jobs. Manufacturers indicated a   reluctance to reduce headcount despite the recent slowdown in activity, choosing   to cut overtime hours instead in expectation of a rebound in production in the   first quarter. In addition, some contacts are also beginning to limit hours for   part-time workers to less than 30 hours in order to avoid the 30-hour (full-time   employee status) rule related to the Affordable Care Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate   activity was mixed in late November and December. Residential construction   continued to rise. However, homebuilders noted that new construction would stay   moderate in many regional markets as long as existing home prices remained well   below new home prices. Existing home prices did edge up in some areas of the   District, and rental rates continued to rise. In addition, contacts reported   that in many cases credit for homebuyers remained tight, slowing the pace of   home sales. Demand for nonresidential construction remained weak, but some   improvement was noted in the light industrial and office markets. Several   commercial real estate contacts observed that uncertainty surrounding federal   fiscal policy continues to weigh on structures spending in a number of market   segments. However, commercial real estate conditions improved slightly. Vacancy   rates continued to decrease; and while the pace of leasing and acquisition deals   remained slow, it picked up slightly as financing became easier to obtain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in manufacturing production   continued to be moderate over the reporting period. Capacity utilization in the   steel industry increased slightly and service center inventories were noted to   be at desirable levels. Specialty metal manufacturers reported a decline in   quoting and new orders as customers continued to delay purchases until the last   minute. In contrast, a contact in the defense industry noted a substantial   rebound in orders due to the two-month delay in sequestration. Contacts noted a   slight pick-up in demand for construction equipment due to improvement in the   housing market, although demand from the public sector remained weak. The auto   industry remained a source of strength for manufacturing. Auto suppliers   reported strong orders through the end of the year, and many expected vehicle   production to expand in 2013. Activity in the energy industry appeared to slow.   The lower price of natural gas, in part due to abundant supply, has negatively   affected coal mining. In addition, one contact noted the lower prices had also   led to a pause in shale gas production. However, contacts expected activity in   the energy industry to rebound in early 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions continued to   gradually ease over the reporting period. Credit spreads and financial market   volatility remained low, and asset quality continued to improve. Credit line   utilization rose substantially, with contacts citing end-of-year factors such as   tax planning and special dividends as reasons for the increase. Banking contacts   also reported moderate growth in demand for small business loans, particularly   from manufacturing industries such as machining and packaging. Pricing for   business loans changed little, while contacts cited some loosening of loan   standards. Consumer loan demand, particularly for mortgage and auto loans,   continued to increase. Contacts indicated, however, that less home refinancing   activity was being processed than in the previous reporting period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cost pressures eased in late November   and December. Most raw material prices moved lower, although there was some   pressure on lumber and drywall prices and concerns remained around potential   food and energy price increases. In contrast, manufacturers supplying the   defense industry said their customers were attempting to negotiate large price   decreases; these contacts thought they could instead secure multi-year price   agreements in exchange for more moderate price reductions. A contact in the   grocery industry indicated that they have been unable to fully pass on recent   meat and milk cost increases. More generally, retailers reported that   discounting and promotions increased over the holiday shopping season. Wage   pressures remained moderate, but nonwage costs increased. Contacts again cited   higher healthcare costs; however, a few noted that increases this year were less   pronounced than a year ago. Several contacts also reported increasing 401(k)   payouts and year-end bonuses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although drought conditions eased, depleted   soil moisture remained a concern in much of the District. The low levels of the   Mississippi River hampered barge traffic moving both crops to market and inputs   to farms. Crop operations tended to come out ahead for the year if they had   adequate insurance coverage, and most crop farmers saw their net worth grow.   Uncertainty regarding the tax treatment of capital expenditures led farmers to   move up purchases of equipment and other capital improvements into 2012. Corn   and soybean prices slid during the reporting period. Milk prices decreased,   while cattle and hog prices increased. Of these agricultural products, only hog   prices were below the levels of a year ago. Farmland values trended higher, with   an extra spurt of farm sales at the end of 2012 in anticipation of tax code   changes. Cash rents for cropland increased as well for the upcoming season.
