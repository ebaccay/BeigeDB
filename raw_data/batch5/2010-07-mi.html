      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 28, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The Ninth District economy grew slightly since the last report. Consumer   spending, tourism, manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture saw increases.   Residential construction and the services sectors experienced mixed activity,   while commercial construction remained weak. Commercial and residential real   estate activity decreased. Labor markets continued to strengthen somewhat. Wages   were generally level with a year ago, and price increases remained   restrained.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending increased   modestly. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   June were up almost 2 percent compared with a year earlier. A mall manager in   North Dakota noted that recent sales were up 4 percent over last year and were   running a little ahead of 2008, when activity was relatively strong. In South   Dakota, a mall manager noted that recent sales were mixed; consumers remained   cautious as traffic continued to be driven by promotions. A Montana auto dealer   noted that June sales were behind a year ago, but July sales have picked up   substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Summer tourism was up slightly from a year ago. Representatives of South   Dakota tourism businesses and attractions noted that the early part of the   summer season was going well. In western Montana, hotel bookings were about the   same as a year ago, while Glacier National Park is expected to have a record   year due to its 100th anniversary celebration. Tourism activity in the Upper   Peninsula of Michigan was about the same as last year. Meanwhile, a Minnesota   travel agency noted that corporate sales were up about 20 percent during June   and early July compared with 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial construction   remained weak. A commercial contractor in Montana said that the number of   projects up for bidding decreased; existing projects were smaller and had more   bidders. In contrast, a heavy infrastructure contractor in Minnesota and   Wisconsin saw improvement in its market segment. In addition, the value of June   commercial permits in Sioux Falls, S.D., nearly doubled from the previous June.   Residential construction was mixed. June residential permits increased slightly   in value for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and for Fargo, N.D., compared with   the same month a year earlier. However, residential permits decreased   substantially in value in Sioux Falls and Rochester, Minn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weakness remained in the commercial real estate sector. Office vacancy   increased in Minneapolis-St. Paul. A commercial real estate broker in western   Montana characterized the market as level with last year's slow activity.   Residential real estate activity softened slightly. The number of closed sales   in Minneapolis-St. Paul decreased in June from a year earlier. A real estate   agent in Fargo said activity was steady, but not as active as usual for this   time of year. Meanwhile, a Realtor in northeastern Minnesota recently noticed an   increase in inquiries for properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the professional business services   sector was mixed since the last report. An engineering firm that supports the   mining and energy sector noted an increase in activity. A human resources   consulting firm noted a slight uptick in new business. Architectural firms   reported slow demand. Information technology consultants reported that business   was flat with a lot of maintenance projects rather than new software   development. A firm that assists nonprofits noted a slight decrease in activity.   A Minnesota energy management consultant noted an increase in orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing output was up since the last   report. A June survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,   Neb.) showed that manufacturing activity increased significantly in Minnesota   and the Dakotas. A construction equipment manufacturer in North Dakota was   increasing production. A South Dakota wind energy equipment producer increased   production significantly due to increased demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy and Mining
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased since the last report. Mid-July oil exploration increased from   early June. Wind energy projects have come online, and more are planned in the   western portion of the District. In Montana, a company applied for permits to   develop an underground gold mine. A Montana copper mine was "doing excellent,"   according to an official, due to strong production and prices. However, iron ore   production in Minnesota decreased in June compared with May because of   maintenance at one of the mines.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural activity increased. The U.S.   Department of Agriculture raised the price estimates for corn, soybeans and   wheat. The vast majority of the District corn and soybean crops were rated as   either good or excellent. Meanwhile, drought conditions eased across most of the   District, but some areas were experiencing excess moisture.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages, and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Labor markets continued to   strengthen somewhat. According to respondents to a recent St. Cloud (Minn.) Area   Business Outlook Survey, 28 percent expect to increase staffing levels at their   companies over the next six months, while 9 percent expect to decrease staff. In   last year's survey, 19 percent expected to boost hiring, while 12 percent   anticipated decreases. A recent survey of businesses conducted by the North   Dakota Chamber of Commerce showed that 39 percent expect to increase staffing in   the next six months; the majority of respondents expect to keep payrolls   level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increases in temporary employment were noted. A representative of an   employment services firm in Minneapolis-St. Paul reported that demand for   temporary workers has continued to grow during the past two months. In the   Dakotas, demand for seasonal construction employment was up; however, temporary   construction and manufacturing employment was slow in the Duluth, Minn., area,   according to bank directors. In northwestern Montana, two employment offices   reported that postings for temporary and part-time listings were up; however,   overall job orders by employers were down 50 percent compared with a year ago.   Signs of continued weakness also include an announcement that a bank will lay   off about 80 employees in Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wages were generally level with a year earlier. Over 70 percent of   respondents to the St. Cloud survey expected no changes in employee compensation   over the next six months. A nurses union and 14 hospitals in the Minneapolis-St.   Paul area agreed on a contract that averted an open-ended strike; pension and   health benefits were not changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Price increases remained restrained. Minnesota gasoline prices at the   beginning of July were about the same as prices a month earlier. Bank directors   noted that prices have remained generally level for area businesses with some   exceptions. Significant increases included copper and brass products in   electrical wiring, steel fencing materials and unemployment taxes. Scrap metal   prices were above year-ago levels, but dropped during the past month.
