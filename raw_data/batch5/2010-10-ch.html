      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity in the Seventh District picked up moderately in   September. Contacts were generally more optimistic about the outlook for the   remainder of the year and the beginning of 2011. Manufacturing production   increased, and construction activity improved slightly. Consumer spending   continued at a steady pace and business spending increased. Credit conditions   continued to gradually improve. Price and wage pressures were moderate, while   agricultural prices increased on balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of consumer spending was   little changed from the previous reporting period. Contacts indicated that   consumers were slowly regaining confidence, although they remain very   price-conscious. As such, promotions and sales persisted as the primary driver   of traffic in stores and showrooms. Retail sales excluding autos in September   were nearly on par with the August sales pace. Clothing items continued to sell   well, as did electronics and appliances; but furniture sales were again weak.   Auto sales held steady even as fewer incentives were offered and access to   credit continued to slowly improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending increased in   September. Capital spending rose as recent tax accounting changes pulled forward   demand before the year's end. Contacts indicated that spending was heavily   concentrated in replacement of older equipment and other efficiency improving   investments. While less widespread, new investments in capacity, research and   development, and employee training were also reported. In contrast, inventory   rebuilding slowed. Both manufacturers and retailers reported comfortable levels   of inventories in September, even though they remain relatively lean   historically. The pace of hiring continued to be slow, but engineering,   information technology, and healthcare were exceptions to this trend.   Manufacturers' were reluctant to add permanent employees, continuing to use   temporary hires instead. In addition, the manufacturing workweek leveled off, as   firms pulled back on overtime. Contacts also noted that state and local   government employment was sharply declining given the budgetary constraints   faced by several District states and their local municipalities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity   improved slightly in September. With housing inventory still elevated,   residential building was minimal, particularly for multifamily properties. A   contact noted, however, that a few large builders had begun to rebuild their   inventory of single-family homes after a recent uptick in contract signings.   Attractive pricing led to higher showroom traffic, but contacts indicated that   the limited availability of conventional mortgage financing remained a   constraint for potential buyers. Private nonresidential construction remained   subdued, particularly for office and retail buildings. However, rising vacancy   rates leveled out in many areas of the District, and contacts reported small   improvements in demand for large industrial and small retail facilities. Public   infrastructure construction continued to expand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing production increased in   September, refreshing from the late summer pause. Several metals manufacturers   reported that September sales were the best so far this year. Power generation,   mining, and medical equipment manufacturers also reported an increase in orders.   In addition, export activity continued to be robust with slower growth in   developing countries in Asia and South America offset by strengthening demand   from Europe. The automotive and heavy equipment sectors remained strong sources   of growth. In contrast, a manufacturer of household appliances noted a reduction   in fourth quarter production, and capacity utilization in the steel industry   edged lower. Although contacts in some industries indicated that new orders and   order backlogs had eased as inventory rebuilding slowed going into early   October, manufacturers in general expressed a very positive outlook for the   remainder of 2010 and early 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions continued to   gradually improve in September. Contacts indicated that the corporate financing   environment remains very favorable, but the availability of credit for small   businesses remained a source of concern for some. Business loan demand was   steady, driven mostly by refinancing and merger and acquisition activity. Recent   tax law changes and increasing pressure from shareholders to productively employ   the large amounts of cash on firm balance sheets were seen as contributing to   the latter. Furthermore, a contact noted that private equity funds that are   required to invest funds by year-end or return them to investors were another   likely factor. Investment demand for distressed commercial properties remained   strong. Moreover, limited improvement in the availability of bank loans for   commercial real estate was noted, although it was concentrated among a few   banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price and wage pressures were moderate   in September. Retailers reported wholesale price increases were becoming more   widespread. Prices also moved higher for industrial metals like copper,   aluminum, zinc, and gold. Shortages of silicone and copper contributed to the   increase in industrial metal prices. The depreciation of the dollar was cited as   one of the primary drivers of higher demand for gold. Energy costs, in contrast,   were steady with natural gas prices at historically low levels. Limited pricing   power continued to constrain pass-through of cost pressures to downstream   prices. Wage pressures again increased only modestly on balance, although some   contacts highlighted large expected increases in the cost of healthcare for   employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District harvest started early and   progressed rapidly, although parts of Iowa and Wisconsin had a slower harvest   due to heavy rains. Corn yields varied widely, sometimes even within the same   field. The quality of the corn crop was, however, higher than a year ago.   Soybean yields were reported as above-average in most of the District, with   soybean disease issues in Iowa appearing to be limited in scope. Corn and   soybean prices were above the levels of a year ago. Contacts indicated that   farmers were selling soybeans, but holding on to newly harvested corn in the   hope of even higher prices. Prices for milk, hogs, and cattle remained higher   than last year, helping offset a sudden increase in feed costs for livestock.   Fertilizer costs also increased, but drying costs for corn decreased   substantially from the previous year.
