      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy in the Fourth District grew at a modest pace since our last report.   On balance, manufacturing output moved slightly lower, while residential and   nonresidential construction picked up. Retailers saw a modest rise in sales   during July, and motor vehicle purchases held steady. Natural gas producers   increased production, though the demand for coal has softened. The slowdown in   freight transport volume, which began in the second quarter, has leveled off.   And the demand for business credit showed a modest increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Little net hiring was reported across industry sectors. Staffing-firm   representatives said that the number of job openings has declined during the   past six weeks. Open positions were found primarily in engineering, healthcare,   and manufacturing. Wage pressures are contained. Input prices were generally   stable, although concerns exist about the recent rise in agricultural commodity   prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Representatives from District factories   reported that new orders and production were flat or down slightly during the   past six weeks, with inventories showing a slight uptick. Relative to year-ago   levels, output was mainly higher. The outlook by manufacturers was mixed. While   many contacts are less certain about growth prospects than they had been a few   months earlier, others believe that the abundance of lower-priced energy,   especially natural gas, will boost manufacturing activity in the District. A   weakening in shipping volume by steel producers and service centers was   attributed to seasonal factors, rising imports, and uncertainty. Demand for   steel from the energy sector remained solid, while demand from the   transportation sector softened. Most of our steel contacts do not expect market   conditions to change appreciably in the upcoming months. Steel producers   reported lowering their inventories. District auto production showed a   substantial decline in July on a month-over-month basis, due to normal seasonal   retooling for model changeovers. Compared to a year ago, production figures were   unchanged for domestic producers, while showing a sizeable increase for foreign   nameplates. The latter is attributable to the abatement of supply chain issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of our contacts reported reduced capacity utilization rates, which they   attributed to weakening demand. Capital spending remains on track; however, some   respondents intend to cut back outlays during the upcoming months. Raw material   prices were either stable or declined. Several manufacturers and steel producers   reported reducing their prices to match the lower material prices. Little change   in payrolls was noted, although attracting skilled workers remains difficult.   Wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports from home-builders on single-family   housing starts during July were mixed, although all of our contacts said that   activity had improved compared to a year ago. Sales contracts were in all   price-point categories. Homebuilders anticipate only a modest increase in the   construction of single-family homes in the near term; however, opportunities for   rehabilitating old buildings into apartments and constructing new apartments and   special-needs housing are viewed as strong. Selling prices of new single-family   homes were up slightly during the past six months, and rents increased in the   low to mid-single digits. The volatility seen in building material prices over   the past five months is beginning to subside, although there is still upward   pressure on lumber prices. In the eastern third of the District, existing home   sales (number of units, average sales price, and volume) showed a modest to   moderate increase year-to-date relative to the same period in 2011. Similar   results were seen in the southwest region of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential contractors described current business conditions as improving   and better when compared to a year ago. However, construction activity for small   to medium-size builders is still substantially below pre-recession levels, and   profit margins are tight. Project work is broad based, driven by industrial   (manufacturing and distribution), education, and healthcare clients and   multi-family housing. The short-term outlook is fairly positive, but builders   are concerned about the domestic political climate, events in Europe, and   potential defense cutbacks. Building material prices were stable. Even with the   pickup in work, residential and nonresidential builders are reluctant to hire   additional workers. Wage pressures are contained. Some residential and   commercial subcontractors have attempted to raise their billing rates but were   largely unsuccessful.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retailers reported slightly higher   sales figures for July relative to results seen in June. However, several   reports indicated that consumers, including those in higher-income brackets, are   becoming more cautious when buying and are looking for value. One executive   commented that retailers are pushing back orders for the upcoming holiday   season. Retailers anticipate modest growth at best through the end of the third   quarter. Vendor prices were fairly stable, and little change was noted in store   prices. There is growing concern about the rise in agricultural commodity prices   and the resulting impact on the cost of food products. Inventories continued to   rise modestly, but they were described as manageable. Capital spending for the   year remains on target, with little change anticipated during the next 12   months. Outlays are mainly for new store construction and technology upgrades.   No hiring is expected, other than at new stores, and wage pressures are   contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Little change was seen in the number of new-vehicle purchases during June and   July when compared with the same time period a year ago. Dealers reported that   sales of fuel-efficient vehicles and SUVs are doing particularly well.   New-vehicle inventories are on the light side, which was attributed in part to   model changeovers and tight control by manufacturers. The outlook by dealers for   the remainder of 2012 is mixed, although none of our contacts are expecting a   substantial drop-off. Purchases of used vehicles improved slightly during July   relative to June levels. Capital spending is limited to OEM-mandated remodeling   and image programs. Hiring for sales and service positions remains at a very   slow pace. Dealers have become more efficient at managing labor needs since   prior to the recession resulting in leaner payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Bankers reported a modest increase in the demand   for business credit, mainly for refinancings and acquisitions. A few contacts   cited rising demand for industrial loans and financing multifamily housing   developments. Little change in consumer credit was observed. Auto lending   remains the bright spot on the consumer side, although a few bankers observed   some softening since our last report. In the residential mortgage market, demand   was described as stable to very strong, with a high percentage of applicants   looking to refinance. Several bankers expressed concern about the low interest   rate environment and compliance costs related to new regulations and their   effect on profitability. We heard a few reports about a moderate loosening of   lending guidelines. Delinquencies were steady or improved. Core deposits rose.   Bankers project little change in payrolls for the remainder of this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Conventional oil and natural gas production   increased since our last report, with higher production expected to continue in   the upcoming months. Some of the increase was attributed to rising demand from   electric utilities. Low wellhead prices for natural gas were cited as a reason   for a decline in drilling conventional wells. Additional drilling rigs are being   moved to Ohio from Pennsylvania to take advantage of the higher-priced wet gas   found in the Utica shale. Coal production this year is expected to fall below   2011 levels due to reduced demand for thermal coal from domestic utilities and   slowing markets for metallurgical coal in Europe and Asia. Spot prices for steam   coal have increased slightly, while prices for export metallurgical coal   declined further. Production equipment and materials prices were flat in most   categories, and capital outlays remain at projected levels. Moderate layoffs   were announced by several coal producers, and conventional oil and gas companies   have trimmed back their payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Most reports on freight volume indicated   that the slowdown which began mid way through the second quarter has stabilized   or started to turn around. The outlook for the remainder of 2012 remains   positive, but growth is not expected to be as strong as had been forecasted at   the beginning of the year. Apart from fluctuating diesel prices, costs   associated with truck maintenance held steady. Some carriers are maintaining   their fuel surcharges and successfully negotiated rate increases when contracts   came up for renewal. Capital spending for 2012 remained on plan. Outlays are   allocated for the replacement of aging units and adding capacity. A few   executives reported that rising prices for new trucks combined with difficulty   in obtaining credit is limiting growth opportunities, especially for small   carriers. Driver recruitment remains difficult, resulting in some wage pressure.
