      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 4, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic  conditions in the Tenth District continued to deteriorate in January and early  February.  Consumers retrenched further,  shying away from durable goods and curtailing restaurant dining and  travel.  Manufacturing activity and  capital spending weakened further, and the decline in real estate activity  intensified as construction weakened further and home prices maintained their  downward trend.  Energy activity dampened  significantly as drilling waned and rig counts hit five-year lows.  Farm incomes declined with crop and livestock  prices.  Lack of demand and wide  availability put downward pressure on prices of raw materials and finished  goods, but wages and salaries remained steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retail sales were lower in January and early  February, and a plurality of retailers reported lower sales than expected.  Sales declines were broad-based, but sales of  durables such as home furnishings, lawn and garden equipment, and appliances  were especially weak.  Expectations were  for continued sluggishness in retail sales in the near term.  Mall traffic was down, as were sales in most  stores.  Most auto dealers reported sales  declines and expected sales to retrench further over the next few months.  Used cars were selling well, while sales of  new cars and large vehicles were down significantly.  Auto dealers continued to note tight credit  conditions.  Hotels unanimously reported  lower occupancy rates over the previous month and airline traffic was slower in  many cities; however, some recreational venues such as zoos and botanical  gardens saw modest improvement, suggesting that consumers may be keeping their  entertainment dollars local.  Restaurant  sales were down across the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing and other business activity  contracted further in January and February with some reports of businesses  closing or consolidating.  Finished goods  inventories shrank significantly as factories cut production.  Shipments and new orders slowed since the  last survey period, but a few firms reported stable or improved sales.  Export orders eased slightly and were  expected to slow further.  Many firms  have put capital spending on hold due to weak demand and difficulty obtaining  financing.  Both the number of workers  and weekly hours were lower in most manufacturing enterprises.  High-technology services was a bright spot in  the District economy in January and early February.  About half of contacts reported increased  activity.  The transportation sector  continued to weaken.  Most of the  sustained activity was in the transport of staple products, especially food,  and goods targeted to discount retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All surveyed Realtors reported declines in  home prices in January and early February, and most noted declines in sales,  especially for higher-end homes.  Modest  improvements in sales were expected in the next three months, but Realtors  expected prices to continue on their downward spiral.  Although bargain prices and lower interest  rates spurred some buyers to the real estate market, other potential homebuyers  were waiting on the sidelines, hoping for additional government  incentives.  Mortgage lending was up, due  largely to refinancing.  Commercial  construction continued to weaken significantly in January and early February,  and industry professionals were pessimistic about the future.  Vacancy rates were higher and absorption  rates and rents were lower.  Credit to  commercial construction enterprises remained tight.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported a decline in loan demand, an  increase in deposits, and a modestly improved outlook for loan quality since  the last survey.  Demand fell for  commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer  installment loans.   Banks continued to  report tighter credit standards on commercial and industrial loans, commercial  real estate loans, and consumer installment loans. Standards on residential  real estate loans were generally unchanged.   Assessments of current loan quality were similar to the last survey, but  expectations for future loan quality improved modestly.  Most respondents reported increases in deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drilling activity continued its downward trend in January and early  February in the face of declining prices.   All contacts expected drilling activity to fall further in the future,  despite expectations of higher prices for crude oil.  Contacts were split on expectations of future  natural gas prices.  The District rig  count was down dramatically, reaching its lowest level since late 2003.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions varied with  precipitation levels in late January and February.  The winter wheat crop was reported in good  condition throughout Nebraska and Kansas due to adequate moisture while crop  conditions deteriorated in dry areas of Oklahoma.  Lack of moisture also eroded pasture  conditions and limited winter forage for livestock.  Farm incomes declined with lower crop and livestock  prices.  Loan renewals and extensions  increased as some farmers decided to wait for crop prices to rebound before  marketing remaining inventories.   District contacts reported softer loan demand for real estate and  capital purchases but expected an increase in operating loans as input costs  remained elevated.   Farmland values  declined amid weaker farm incomes and softer demand from off-farm investors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hiring retrenched in January and early  February as businesses struggled to contain costs and respond to faltering  demand in the slowing economy.   Nevertheless, wages and salaries held steady.  Prices continued to ease.  Raw materials were widely available for  construction and manufacturing enterprises, which put downward pressure on input  prices, especially for lumber.   Manufacturers reported reduced prices for finished goods, and retailers  largely reported lower prices as well.
