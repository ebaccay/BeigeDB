      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 28, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to pick up slightly during   the reporting period of June through mid-July. Upward price pressures remained   quite modest, and upward wage pressures were largely absent. Sales of retail   items and services firmed a bit further. Reports from District manufacturers   indicated continued expansion, although excess capacity remained high in some   sectors. Sales were strong for agricultural producers, and demand for energy   resources strengthened. Activity in housing markets was mixed but appeared to   decline on net, while demand for commercial real estate was largely unchanged at   very low levels. Contacts from financial institutions reported largely stable   lending activity and credit quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Upward price pressures remained very   modest on net during the reporting period. While energy prices edged up and   prices also rose modestly for selected industrial commodities such as steel and   copper, final prices for most retail items and services continued to be held   down by weak demand and excess capacity. Contacts in a few industries pointed to   recent increases in shipping costs that they anticipate will be passed on to   final prices later this year or in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts in most sectors characterized wages as largely flat, although some   pointed to significant increases in the costs of employee benefits, especially   for health insurance. Upward wage pressures were negligible in most sectors and   regions, held down by continued high levels of unemployment and limited hiring.   Reports throughout the District indicated that most businesses expect to remain   cautious in hiring for the foreseeable future. Contacts noted that their   reliance on temporary workers over permanent hires will continue above   historical norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Sales of retail items were   mixed but showed further modest improvement on net. While consumers remained   focused on necessities and lower-priced options, reports indicated expanding   consumer appetite for discretionary spending. Discount retail chains and   traditional department stores both reported higher levels of sales, and a few   contacts noted declines in promotional activity. By contrast, sales were   characterized as largely flat for grocers, as well as furniture and household   appliance retailers. Sales of new domestic and imported automobiles weakened   slightly during the reporting period, although contacts noted that activity   rebounded somewhat in recent weeks. Demand for gasoline strengthened but   remained below historical averages for the season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for services remained somewhat weak but exhibited further signs of   improvement on balance. Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry   reported modest increases in demand. For professional and media services   providers, sales were largely stable at low levels. Contacts noted that   potential clients increased their requests for bids, but the added interest   produced only limited numbers of new commitments. Demand for hospital services   was relatively flat, especially for discretionary services. Energy utilities   reported further increases in demand from selected industries, such as   technology, metal, and wood products. Conditions in the District's travel and   tourism sector continued to improve. Business travel and convention activity   picked up further, and visitor volumes and hotel occupancy rates rose in several   of the District's major markets, particularly Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity was mixed   but appeared to strengthen a bit further on net during the reporting period of   June through mid-July. Manufacturers of semiconductors and other information   technology products reported further demand growth, with balanced inventories   and continued strength in new orders. Production rates and deliveries picked up   modestly for makers of commercial aircraft and parts. However, new orders   remained limited and contacts expressed uncertainty about the strength of the   airline industry recovery and prospects for future orders. While capacity   utilization remained at low levels for companies in the metal fabrication   sector, further demand improvements were noted, especially for items used to   maintain or upgrade existing capital equipment. By contrast, apparel makers   characterized conditions as "flat." Despite improved demand, high inventory   levels for gasoline and distillates prompted refineries to slow production.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand was   strong for agricultural products and improved for natural resources used for   energy production. Orders and final sales remained robust for assorted crop and   livestock products. Growing and grazing conditions have been favorable in recent   months, and contacts noted that input costs have been largely stable. Strong   global demand supported an increase in oil extraction activity during the   reporting period, and extraction activity for natural gas continued at a solid   pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for housing in the   District appeared to deteriorate somewhat from the previous period, while demand   for commercial real estate was largely unchanged at very low levels. The pace of   home sales remained mixed across areas but appeared to decline on net, even as   home prices edged up further in some parts of the District. Several contacts   noted again that limited availability of nonconforming "jumbo" loans is holding   down sales of higher-priced homes in some areas. Conditions in commercial real   estate markets remained depressed, as vacancy rates for office and industrial   space stayed at very elevated levels in many parts of the District. One   California contact noted that although only a few large commercial properties   have sold in recent months, the prices received were surprisingly high.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was largely stable compared with the prior reporting period.   Demand for commercial and industrial loans continued to be restrained by   business uncertainty about the economic environment. For most contacts, their   current assessment of growth prospects for their firm and industry are the same   or weaker than was their assessment in early 2010, with corresponding restraint   evident in their planned capital expenditures. Demand for consumer loans was   characterized as largely unchanged at low levels. Lending standards remained   relatively restrictive for business and consumer lending, although reports   pointed to signs of stabilization in overall credit quality.
