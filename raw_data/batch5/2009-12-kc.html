      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy continued to expand modestly in October and early   November. Retail sales increased and were expected rise further, but the travel   and tourism sector remained weak. Manufacturing activity also grew moderately,   with production, new orders, and exports rising since the last survey period.   Residential real estate recovered further, while the commercial real estate   market continued to deteriorate. Energy activity rose slightly, as higher prices   boosted exploration for crude oil in particular. The agricultural outlook also   improved with higher commodity prices. On the other hand, District bankers   reported that loan demand weakened and loan quality declined. Contacts reported   that prices of finished goods and services declined modestly, and no evidence of   wage pressures was reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending rose in October and   early November, but was supported by heavy price discounting. Most District   retailers reported increased sales, especially for mid-priced, durable items   such as appliances. Sales of high-priced and luxury items generally continued to   decline, although some jewelers reported increased sales. Most retailers   reported declines in inventories. Retailers expected sales to strengthen and for   prices to steady over the next three months, along with further inventory   reductions. Auto dealers reported stability in recent sales activity and were   optimistic about their prospects going forward. The market for larger trucks and   SUVs was reported as recovering. In the tourism sector, hotel occupancy rates   were down markedly compared to year-ago levels, and the outlook was   characterized as grim. However, air traffic rebounded somewhat from lower levels   during the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District   contacts reported that manufacturing production increased moderately in October   and November, but production remained well below the previous year's levels.   Volume of shipments and new orders also rose, while employment leveled off   following a year of decline. Export orders expanded moderately, with more   substantial growth expected over the next six months. Expectations for future   factory activity were generally optimistic. Sales and capital expenditures in   the high-tech services sector grew solidly, and sales were expected to increase   more robustly in the near term. Contacts in the transportation sector also   reported increased sales and capital spending. However, one contact said a   reduction in the number of competing carriers had allowed some District trucking   companies to maintain freight volume despite lower shipping demand overall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential real estate   market showed further signs of recovery in October and early November, but   conditions in the commercial real estate market continued to erode. More housing   starts and increased traffic from potential buyers were reported by area home   builders, while new and existing home sales enjoyed a solid rebound from the   previous year's levels, leading to a moderate overall decline in inventories.   Inventory reductions, in turn, helped to stabilize home prices in the District,   although prices remained below year-ago levels in most areas. Realtors reported   that the increase in sales was in large part driven by first-time home buyers   taking advantage of the federal tax credit. Sales were strongest for lower-end   homes and investor properties, particularly bank-owned foreclosure properties,   while sales of luxury homes were anemic. In the commercial real estate market,   already low absorption rates continued to fall, putting downward pressure on   rents. Construction remained very distressed, although some demand for smaller   projects was reported. Sales of commercial real estate continued to decline,   pushing down prices, but fewer contacts reported a sales drop than in previous   survey periods. District contacts reported that valuations have fallen 20 to 30   percent from their peak in some areas of the District. A number of contacts   stated that higher collateral requirements have been impeding smaller businesses   engaged in real estate development projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported weaker loan demand, increased   deposits, and a continued negative outlook for loan quality. Overall loan demand   fell at about the same pace as in the previous survey. Demand for commercial and   industrial loans fell moderately, and demand for commercial real estate loans   edged downward. On the other hand, respondents reported little change in demand   for residential real estate loans and consumer installment loans. Some banks   continued to tighten credit standards on commercial real estate loans, but   credit standards for other loan categories were unchanged. About half of   respondents reported lower loan quality than a year ago, an appreciably smaller   fraction than in the previous survey. However, well over a third of banks expect   loan quality to decline over the next six months, similar to the previous   survey. Deposits continued to rise, with most categories sharing in the   increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Responding to continued gains in crude prices and   a recent upturn in natural gas prices, energy activity rose slightly in the most   recent survey period. However, the rig count remained well below the peak level   of mid-2008. Higher crude oil prices also translated into stronger ethanol   prices and profits, spurring a rebound in ethanol production. Crude oil prices   were expected to build upon recent gains and natural gas prices were expected to   edge up over the next three months. But District contacts reported that natural   gas production had not declined as significantly as expected given the steep   drop in drilling over the last year. The efficiency gains in drilling operations   over the past year and the activation of previously drilled but untapped wells   was expected to preclude any energy sector employment gains in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural outlook improved in October   and November with rising commodity prices. Despite reports of above-average corn   and soybean yields, grain prices have risen due to improved export activity and   a delay in the fall harvest. Wet weather pushed back the fall harvest in all   District states and slowed winter wheat planting, especially in Oklahoma. Cattle   and hog prices have edged up, but remained below breakeven prices due to rising   feed costs. District contacts reported further reductions in livestock supplies   through herd liquidations. District bankers reported having ample funds for   creditworthy borrowers and expected farmland values to hold steady in coming   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported moderately   lower prices for finished goods and services and few wage pressures since the   last survey period. Purchasing managers said that input prices generally rose,   driven by higher commodity prices, and they expected input prices to increase   further going forward. Output prices were reported as modestly lower but were   expected to stabilize over the next six months. Consumer prices largely   decreased as a result of the use of heavy discounting to bolster sales. Hotel   rates were down significantly in light of weak demand, but restaurant menu   prices were stable. District contacts generally did not report any wage   pressures or plans to raise wages in the near term.
