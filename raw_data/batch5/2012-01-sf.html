      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to grow at a moderate   pace during the reporting period of late November through the end of December.   Upward price pressures remained very modest overall, and upward wage pressures   were quite limited. Holiday retail sales reportedly were up over last year's   season, and demand edged up for business and consumer services. District   manufacturing activity grew further on net. Production activity and sales   remained robust for agricultural producers and rose a bit further for providers   of energy resources. Activity in District housing markets stayed at very low   levels, and demand for nonresidential real estate generally was weak. Reports   from financial institutions indicated a slight increase in business loan   demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price inflation remained quite limited   for most final goods and services during the reporting period. Contacts noted   recent price increases for selected commodities such as oil and for assorted   food items at the retail level, in particular for meat. However, intense   supplier competition for existing customers kept a lid on final sales prices for   the majority of retail goods and services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in most sectors reported that upward wage pressure were modest,   although they continued to note rising costs for employee health benefits.   Elevated unemployment rates and limited hiring kept compensation gains modest   across most regions and sectors, with the exception of significant wage   increases for workers with specialized skills in selected manufacturing and   technology sectors. Looking ahead, most businesses expect little change in the   pace of hiring and wage gains next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales were up compared   with last year's holiday season, with gains reported by traditional department   stores as well as discount chains. Inventories generally were at or near desired   levels given the pace of sales, although contacts reported an excess of winter   apparel resulting from unusually mild weather. Demand remained largely unchanged   compared with prior reporting periods for retailers of major appliances,   furniture, and electronics. Sales improved somewhat for grocers. Sales of new   automobiles rose further overall during the reporting period, although slightly   softer demand was noted for the last few weeks. Demand for used vehicles   remained robust, and dealers reported marked improvement in the quality of   trade-ins compared with earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business and consumer services was mixed but appeared to expand   slightly on net. Demand for transportation services remained largely flat, as   did demand for professional services such as legal services and accounting.   Sales were largely stable on a seasonal basis for restaurants and other   food-service providers. For providers of health-care services, demand softened a   bit further, as higher emergency room visits were more than offset by declines   in inpatient admissions and surgeries. By contrast, sales continued to expand   for providers of technology services to businesses and consumers, although the   pace of growth continued to slow. District travel activity picked up further,   with additional growth in demand reported for the tourism and business segments   of the market alike.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity expanded   further on balance during the reporting period of late November through the end   of December. Makers of commercial aircraft and parts reported further expansion   in production activity, with ongoing growth in new orders attributed in part to   rising demand for fuel-efficient aircraft. Activity remained largely stable for   metal fabricators and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. For   manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products, demand growth   continued to slow, and capacity utilization dipped a bit from existing high   levels as companies sought to hold down inventory growth. Capacity utilization   rates for petroleum refiners remained largely stable or rose somewhat as robust   global demand for distillate products, such as diesel and jet fuel, offset weak   domestic demand for gasoline. Activity remained exceptionally sluggish for   manufacturers of wood products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand was   robust for agricultural producers and grew a bit for natural resources used for   energy production. Final sales and orders for most agricultural products,   including livestock and a variety of crops, continued to expand. Elevated price   levels for a range of metals supported further expansion of mining activity in   parts of the District. Overall demand for crude oil rose slightly, largely   reflecting robust foreign demand, while mild winter weather has kept demand for   natural gas subdued and caused extraction activity to wane a bit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home demand in the District   remained at very low levels, and demand for commercial real estate stayed weak.   The sales pace for new and existing homes was somewhat mixed across the District   but sluggish overall. In response to slow sales and continued high numbers of   financially distressed properties, home construction activity remained moribund   and prices were mostly flat. Demand for commercial real estate remained weak   overall, keeping vacancy rates for office and industrial space elevated in most   parts of the District. However, in selected geographic areas, such as the San   Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, expansion in the information technology sector   continued to spur demand growth for office and industrial space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand improved a touch relative to the prior   reporting period. The volume of new commercial and industrial loans inched up,   although contacts noted that businesses remain very cautious in their approach   to capital spending. Contacts again noted stiff competition among lenders to   extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses, causing   sustained downward pressure on loan rates and fees. Contacts from the venture   capital sector noted a slight pickup in IPO and investment activity, on the   heels of a slowdown in the prior reporting period. On the consumer side, loan   demand remained largely unchanged. In general, lending standards stayed   relatively restrictive for many types of business and consumer loans, despite   further modest improvements in overall credit quality.
