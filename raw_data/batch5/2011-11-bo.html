      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 30, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Most business contacts in the First District continue to report   year-over-year revenue increases, but an uncertain outlook. Responding retailers   cite mixed results and increased optimism about 2012; manufacturing contacts, by   contrast, say they are uncertain about the outlook even though most current   results remain good. Software and IT services companies continue to see good   demand growth, while results are mixed, though mostly positive, for staffing   firms. Real estate markets remain subdued. With the exception of software and IT   services, contacts say their firms are doing mostly replacement hiring; some   cite difficulty in filling specific skilled jobs. Cost pressures are said to be   modest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District retailers contacted in   mid-November express less uncertainty about recent business trends than they did   in early October; their estimates of 2011 annual sales are generally more   positive and the 2012 outlook is more optimistic than last time. One large   retailer selling both durable and nondurable goods reports that third quarter   comparable store sales were up 3 percent over 2010:Q3. Another durable goods   retailer reports that sales in recent weeks have been almost 5 percent above   what they consider the benchmark for a solid sales week. Notably, a couple of   contacts who last time expected 2011 sales gains of 4 percent or 6.5 percent   from 2010 have now revised their estimates upward to between 7.5 percent and 8   percent. With one exception, responding consumer-goods retailers expect final   2011 sales to range from 6 percent to 8 percent over 2010, but one foresees   annual 2011 sales to track 1 percent to 9 percent lower than 2010. Respondents   say that consumers are regaining some confidence, although such comments are   still tempered with caution, particularly regarding durable goods purchases.   Budgeted pay increases range from 2 percent to 3.3 percent. Some contacts report   ongoing wholesale price increases, while others say cost increases have   moderated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The travel and tourism sector continues to see strength in overseas and   business travel, while discretionary domestic leisure spending is fueled by the   affluent consumer. One weak spot is booking for end-of-the-year holiday parties.   Hotel bookings for 2012 remain strong. The September tourism slowdown noted in   the last round of calls seems to have been temporary. This contact continues to   expect 2011 tourism growth of 5 percent to 8 percent over 2010 and predicts 2012   tourism revenues to be 10 to 12 percent above 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The First District   manufacturing picture remains mixed. On the whole, contacts report relatively   strong performance continuing in recent months, but ongoing concern about   potential weakness in the global economy is tempering growth forecasts and   leading to only limited capital investment and hiring activity. Of the firms   contacted this month, all but one recorded sales growth year-on-year and many   report double-digit growth. The growth is broad-based geographically; most firms   report strongest growth in Asia, followed by domestic sales, but even Europe   results remain fairly robust, despite the sovereign debt crisis. One contact   making laboratory instruments commented that "reports of Europe's demise are   premature" but others are less sanguine about Europe. A major supplier to the   auto industry reports a September year-on-year sales decline in Europe of 7   percent, but a year-to-date European sales increase of 11 percent, only slightly   less than the almost-13 percent recorded in Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pricing picture continues to improve. Materials price increases and   shortages that characterized the sector in 2010 are said to have largely   subsided. One contact in the chemical business says that input costs are   "falling like a rock" and attributes the attenuation to China "putting the   brakes on." A semiconductor contact says that while the price escalation and   shortages of rare-earth elements endemic at the beginning of the year are no   longer a problem, prices remain high. A laboratory-instrument maker says that   high energy prices are leading them to shift freight from air to ships. In   general, contacts say they have little trouble passing price increases on to   customers. Respondents who cite falling input prices also report increased   downward price pressures on the output side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers in the First District are hiring in general but not a lot; most   report hiring only selectively to fill vacancies. Only one firm is laying off   workers. A contact supplying the auto industry had planned to increase headcount   3 percent in 2012 but has now decided to freeze hiring, approving no new   positions and abandoning approved but unfilled positions. Several firms cite   trouble finding qualified staff, generally for technical positions, with one   contact in the industrial motor business saying that larger firms are "poaching"   machinists from a North Carolina plant. A pharmaceutical firm reports problems   finding technical staff and also accountants and other less specialized   skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts do not, in general, report any major changes to their capital   spending plans. Several firms mention increased expenditure on information   technology, including two who are installing new ERP (enterprise resource   planning) software systems. One contact in industrial distribution said that the   purpose of the increased investment is to "grow the business without increasing   headcount." Several firms report significant capital expenditures overseas,   generally with the goal of supplying overseas markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook for 2012 is very cloudy. Virtually all of our manufacturing   contacts express misgivings. Some are concerned about the crisis in Europe but   others express the vague fears that have characterized our conversations over   the last 18 months. A contact in the semiconductor industry says there is less   "visibility" than at any previous juncture. Most firms have not officially   revised their forecasts for 2012 and continue to plan for growth. A chemical   industry contact says he is "following his head and not his stomach" because, by   the numbers, 2012 looks promising but his experience and intuition tell him   otherwise. A contact in the industrial motor business says that their   "book-to-bill" ratio is 1.07, so backlog is growing, but he describes himself as   "worried."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Software and Information Technology Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       New England   software and information technology contacts report continued growth, with   year-over-year revenue increases ranging from mid-single digits to 20 percent in   the most recent quarter. Contacts report upticks in demand across the board,   including in the manufacturing, financial, and medical sectors. Increased   activity has led all contacts to increase their headcounts relative to a year   ago, many by over 5 percent; at the same time, many report continued difficulty   in attracting and retaining qualified software engineers, programmers, and sales   personnel. Respondents report annual wage increases for most employees between 3   percent and 5 percent, with one firm increasing the wages of software engineers   by more. Many contacts express renewed concerns regarding the federal budget and   the European debt crisis. Nonetheless, First District software and IT contacts   are generally more optimistic than they were three months ago. With strong order   pipelines, most are expecting revenue in early 2012 to be 10 percent to 20   percent higher than in early 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Staffing Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District staffing contacts report   mixed activity through the end of October, with some experiencing downticks and   others posting modest increases. Year-over-year revenue changes vary widely,   from flat to up by more than 25 percent. Labor demand is generally flat relative   to three months ago, although a few contacts report upticks in the software-IT,   manufacturing, and legal sectors. Demand for permanent and   temporary-to-permanent hiring continues to grow. Supply of high-end labor   remains tight in the region, and a few contacts report difficulty finding   medical assistants, CNC operators, and welders. Bill rates and pay rates are   steady or up slightly, with most contacts attributing increases to more high-end   placements as well as a tight supply of skilled workers. First District staffing   contacts say they believe that the labor market is performing better in New   England than in the nation as a whole; they express hope for more consistent   growth in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The majority of contacts in the   First District describe conditions in commercial real estate markets as roughly   unchanged since the last report, although some note small improvements in   fundamentals. In Hartford, vacancy rates for Class A downtown office space   continue to hover around 20 percent and leasing demand remains muted in light of   a flat labor market. In Boston, office leasing activity is roughly steady at a   moderate pace, although tenants reportedly lack a sense of urgency to sign   deals. Boston's Back Bay and East Cambridge submarkets continue to show strong   demand and relatively low vacancy rates, with the result that rents on Class A   office space in Back Bay now exceed those for comparable space in Boston's   financial district, where vacancy rates remain in the mid-teens. Portland saw   modest absorption of retail and Class B office space and in recent weeks amid   strong overall leasing volume, while some new vacancies arose in the Class A   office market. Leasing demand tapered off in recent weeks in Providence, as   suburban Rhode Island experienced a modest uptick in leasing activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investment sales market remains strong in Boston, as prices edge slightly   higher for prime office and apartment buildings. Apartment construction in   greater Boston remains very active, with numerous developments in progress and   more new buildings in the pipeline, although other construction activity remains   limited throughout the region. The lending environment continues to offer   plentiful financing--and on increasingly favorable terms--for premier   properties, especially in Boston, while financing remains harder to obtain for   riskier properties and those in secondary and tertiary markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Residential Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Sales activity in New England for   single-family homes and condominiums continues to languish according to contacts   throughout the region. Sales figures rose moderately in September compared to a   year ago, but these increases reflect several months of dismal sales following   the expiration of the tax credit in mid-2010. Respondents say housing market   conditions have remained largely unchanged in the last several months. Most   contacts characterize the market as stable and consistent, but believe the   beginning of a recovery remains fairly distant. While low interest rates have   made financing more affordable to qualified homebuyers, contacts report tighter   credit standards as a constraint. The median sale price of homes also rose in   September from a year earlier in the region, except for Rhode Island, where   prices have been below year-earlier levels for several months. October data for   the Greater Boston area, by contrast, show a 10.5 percent year-over-year decline   in the median sale price of homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outlooks for the remainder of the year are mixed, with some contacts   anticipating 2011 sales falling short of last year and others predicting sales   to reach last year's level. Respondents expect relatively stable prices in the   coming months, but note the possibility of moderate declines.
