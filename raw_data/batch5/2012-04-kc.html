      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded at a faster pace in late February and March.   Consumer spending improved, residential real estate activity rose solidly, and   commercial real estate activity edged higher. Growth in the energy industry   eased slightly but remained solid. Manufacturing firms reported further   increases in activity, and agricultural conditions improved from the previous   survey. Transportation activity picked up slightly, and high-tech service firms   said sales growth was mostly solid. Bankers noted steady loan demand, better   loan quality, and rising deposits. Prices rose slightly, but wage pressures were   contained outside of a few skilled positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending improved and   expectations for the months ahead remained solid. Retail sales rose moderately   from the previous survey, although several contacts noted concerns about lower   discretionary spending due to rising gasoline prices. Store inventories remained   stable and were expected to rise only slightly in future months. Auto sales   rebounded strongly from the previous survey, with several dealers citing   increased customer traffic and pent up demand as key reasons. Contacts said   rising fuel prices have led to stronger sales of fuel efficient vehicles, and   sales of large SUVs and trucks weakened. Expectations for future auto sales   remained positive and inventories continued to increase. Restaurant sales   improved, with further growth expected in coming months. Tourist activity edged   higher, with several contacts noting increased business travel. Tourism contacts   remained generally optimistic about future months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District   manufacturing activity grew solidly, and expectations for future activity   strengthened. Factory orders and shipments increased, and employment growth   remained steady with some future hiring planned. Continued strong   commodities-related activity boosted machinery production, and high-tech and   aircraft manufacturing growth remained strong. Although rising gasoline prices   and continued economic uncertainty restrained activity in several segments, most   plant managers indicated moderate growth in capital spending plans. Growth in   transportation activity picked up slightly, although several contacts cited   driver shortages and higher contractor fuel costs as barriers to growth.   Expectations for future sales were mostly positive, but capital spending plans   among transportation firms were somewhat subdued. The majority of high-tech   services firms reported solid growth in sales, but the pace of growth slowed   somewhat from the previous survey. Several high-tech contacts noted higher   activity in the energy and health care market, and future capital spending plans   were generally positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial   real estate activity increased in late February and March, and expectations were   solid heading forward. Housing starts edged slightly higher, with several   contacts in Nebraska noting increased demand due to the booming agricultural   industry. Expectations for future homebuilding remained positive, and building   materials were generally available. Sales at construction supply firms were   stable, with some contacts noting increased business among multi-family and   remodeling contractors, and expectations for future activity were favorable.   Home sales rose markedly from the previous survey period and inventory levels   fell, which contacts attributed to seasonal patterns, favorable weather, lower   interest rates, and newfound optimism in the overall economy. Expectations for   future home sales continued to strengthen, and home price levels improved   slightly. Mortgage lending activity was positive and remained above year-ago   levels, though contacts expected refinancing volume to slow somewhat as rates   begin to rise. Commercial real estate activity continued to edge higher, and   expectations for future sales were mostly positive. Vacancy rates dropped and   were expected to fall further. Office prices and rents remained subdued but were   slightly higher than a year ago, and expectations were largely flat. Several   commercial real estate contacts in Oklahoma noted strong sales due to heavy   activity in the energy industry, while a contact in Missouri expressed continued   financing difficulties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers generally reported steady or stronger   loan demand, stable or improved loan quality, and increased deposits. Overall   loan demand was steady or improved. Most respondents reported stable to   increased loan demand for residential real estate loans, while loan demand for   commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans remained   steady. Loan demand was stable to weaker for consumer installment loans. Credit   standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and the   majority of respondents continued to report increased deposits. Most bankers   reported stable or improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and every   banker respondent believed the outlook for loan quality over the next six months   would be steady or improving.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity grew solidly in late February and   March, though the pace of growth slowed slightly from previous surveys. Contacts   reported a sharp slowdown in natural gas drilling, with many noting a shift   towards oil exploration. Natural gas prices reached decade-low levels in recent   months, and most producers expected prices to stay low due to oversupply and   mild weather. Crude oil prices climbed higher from the previous survey period,   which many contacts attributed to continued Middle East conflict concerns.   Contacts reported some shortages in equipment and labor, particularly for   engineers and experienced technical support, and one producer noted continued   delays in receiving permits for drilling on federal land.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural growing conditions improved   since the last survey. Scattered rains increased soil moisture levels in many   areas, although drought conditions persisted in some western areas of Kansas and   Oklahoma. Winter wheat development was ahead of normal with most of the crop   upgraded to good condition. Mild winter weather was favorable for calving and   encouraged forage growth, reducing the need for supplemental feeding. Spring   field work began early, and crop prices moved higher. Low cattle inventories   trimmed beef production, and strong domestic and export demand pushed up cattle   and hog prices. Operating loan demand declined as many producers used cash to   buy crop inputs. Farmland values rose further and were expected to remain at   record highs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices rose slightly and were expected   to continue to increase, but wage pressures were mostly contained outside of a   few skilled positions. Retailers reported a slight uptick in prices with further   increases anticipated. Manufacturing materials price increases continued and   were expected to increase further, although fewer firms planned on raising   selling prices. Higher prices for construction materials narrowed profit   margins, as the majority of firms were unable to pass these costs through to   customers. Transportation firms reported higher input prices, and increased food   costs continued to impact profit margins and selling prices for hotels and   restaurants. Wage pressures were still generally contained in most industries,   although some firms reported continued difficulties in obtaining skilled labor.
