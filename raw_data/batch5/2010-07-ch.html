      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 28, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to improve in June and   early July, but the rate of improvement slowed further. Most contacts remained   cautiously optimistic. However, increased uncertainty about the path of the   economic recovery negatively affected business and consumer confidence and   spending. Growth in manufacturing production eased and orders softened.   Construction decreased apart from public infrastructure. Consumer and business   spending increased at a slower rate. Credit conditions were slightly improved,   and price and wage pressures were small on balance. Crop conditions deteriorated   modestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending increased at a slower   rate in June and early July. Retail sales excluding autos edged up. While   spending on food and other necessities rose, spending on home-related and luxury   items decreased. Retailers reported maintaining relatively low inventories amid   dampened optimism for the back-to-school shopping season. The pace of tourism   activity also slowed with hotel occupancy increasing at a reduced rate. Auto   sales were lower in June, but auto dealers reported showroom traffic picked up   in early July in part supported by increased incentives. In addition, several   dealers indicated inventories were lower than desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The rise in business spending moderated   further in June and early July. Inventory investment continued to slow in   manufacturing, and contacts in retail trade indicated a slower rate of inventory   investment for higher priced goods. However, capital spending on equipment and   information technology continued to steadily grow. Labor market conditions   continued to gradually improve, although the pace of hiring decreased. Contacts   noted more caution in hiring primarily due to an increasingly uncertain outlook   for the second half of 2010. For example, while temporary hiring continued to   increase, it did so at a slower rate. In contrast, a large staffing firm noted   billable hours from the industrial sector remained strong and had accelerated   for the information technology sector. Moreover, employment and hours worked   continued to expand in manufacturing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Construction activity   decreased from the previous reporting period. Residential building was minimal   as builders were not introducing new inventory without a signed contract on a   home. Sales decreased after the end of the homebuyer tax credit, but showroom   traffic and contracts were up slightly in recent weeks. New mortgage   applications were down, but the decline was partly offset by an increase in   refinance activity as mortgage rates moved lower. Elevated vacancy rates and   downward pressure on commercial rents continued to restrain private   nonresidential construction. In contrast, public construction increased at a   faster rate as infrastructure construction picked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Growth in manufacturing production slowed   from the previous reporting period. Orders softened over the course of June and   into early July as inventory replenishment decreased. However, contacts remained   cautiously optimistic, stressing the seasonal nature of the slowdown. Steel   production decreased, and capacity utilization edged lower. A contact indicated   that service centers were being cautious with new orders despite the low level   of inventories due to declining steel prices and a more uncertain outlook for   economic activity. Manufacturers of industrial metals also noted a retraction in   activity. Housing and construction-related manufacturers continued to report   weak business conditions. Nonetheless, a contact in the household appliance   industry indicated that the need to rebuild inventories was likely to boost   production in coming months. In addition, automakers reported that sales through   the first half of July were above expectations, and automotive suppliers   continued to note strength in demand for their products. Demand for heavy   equipment also increased, both domestically and abroad. Exporters, in general,   cited positive business conditions, but several contacts expressed concern about   a potential slowdown in China and European markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Credit conditions were slightly   improved in June and early July. Credit spreads narrowed for a number of   District firms, and overall borrowing costs decreased. Business loan demand   continued to gradually increase, driven mostly by refinancing and acquisition   activity. Several banking contacts noted that fierce competition for high   quality borrowers was leading to greater flexibility in pricing and terms on   business loans. Consumer lending conditions were largely unchanged. However, a   contact noted that the gradual reemergence of private mortgage insurance   companies was beginning to improve the availability of mortgage credit. In   contrast, credit remained limited for commercial real estate. Bank loan quality   continued to improve gradually, although a contact indicated that the pace of   improvement had slowed in recent weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Price and wage pressures, on balance,   continued to be small in June and early July. Contacts noted increases in the   price of energy, paper, plastics, and resins, while prices for industrial metals   like steel, aluminum, nickel, and zinc declined. Similar to the previous   reporting period, wage pressures increased only modestly. Pass-through of cost   pressures to downstream prices remained minimal, with pricing power in most   industries continuing to be weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Crop conditions varied across the District,   deteriorating modestly in June and early July. Excess precipitation in some   areas reduced hay output, damaged corn and soybean plants, and forced   replanting. However, contacts continued to expect good corn and soybean yields   this fall. In the recent period, smaller than expected stocks of corn and   soybeans led to crop price increases amidst concerns about how much rationing   will occur before the harvest. Hog and cattle prices remained above year ago   levels, although they declined during the reporting period. In addition, milk   prices increased, aiding the struggling dairy sector. Problems with disease and   the need for extra fertilizer pushed up input costs, but crop farmers should be   able to cover their production costs for this year. The cost of refinancing debt   also put pressure on margins for many livestock operations.
