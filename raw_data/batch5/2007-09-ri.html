      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance,    economic activity in the Fifth District grew at a somewhat slower pace in    late July and August as weakness in housing and retail sales offset firming    in manufacturing. Residential real    estate agents reported declines in sales and more widespread softness in home    prices. Additionally, mortgage    activity slipped since our last report, though financing continued to be    available for those with solid credit. Adding to the less than upbeat tone,    District merchants reported weaker retail sales as big-ticket categories    continued to slump. Moreover,    agricultural conditions across the District worsened over the last six weeks    as unrelenting heat and a lack of rain took their toll on crops. Assessments of    other sectors were rosier, however. District manufacturers reported increases    in shipments and new orders and tourism activity remained strong. Additionally, services firms noted    continued healthy revenue growth, while commercial real estate and commercial    lending activity were generally steady.    On the employment front, despite complaints of tight worker    availability, District hiring remained fairly brisk, including the first    expansion of manufacturing payrolls in eight months. Price growth in the District edged up    slightly during recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Our contacts reported that retail sales    pulled back sharply in August after posting modest gains in July, as a    further drop off in furniture and automobile sales weighed on overall    growth. A contact at a department    store in the Washington, D.C., metro area reported a drop in furniture sales    during the last six weeks, though he added that apparel and jewelry sales    were up, fueled, in part, by the start of back-to-school shopping. In    contrast, a department store contact in Virginia Beach, Va., reported higher-than-normal    levels of inventory, despite good back-to-school shopper traffic and the    state's recent tax-free holiday. In    addition, a retailer in Charleston, W.Va., said sales had declined since    mid-July. On the employment front,    retailers generally trimmed payrolls, though those trying to hire said they    continued to struggle to find quality workers. On balance, retail prices moved lower in    recent weeks, although a contact at a large grocery supplier told us higher    costs of meats and dairy products had placed increased pressure on their    margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Revenue    growth at services firms remained healthy in recent weeks, though contacts    indicated that the pace of expansion eased somewhat since our last    report. Contacts at professional,    scientific, and technical services firms in the District reported steady    revenue growth in late July and August. Additionally, contacts at education    and health care firms said customer demand was unchanged. However, the administrator of a large    senior living facility in Virginia said that the housing market slowdown was    starting to trim his business as prospective residents were having difficulty    selling their homes. Similarly, an    executive at a financial services firm in Baltimore, Md., noted that the    recent volatility in financial markets had unnerved some clients, resulting    in slower business. The pace of hiring at District    services firms also slowed somewhat in recent weeks, while price growth in    the sector was contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District manufacturers reported that    activity moved higher in late July and August. Contacts noted solid increases    in shipments and new orders, and manufacturing payrolls expanded for the    first time since last November.    Producers of electrical equipment, food, industrial machinery, and    rubber and plastic products posted the strongest gains in output. A plastics producer in North Carolina told    us that business had been particularly good in August--both current    production and new orders turned higher. In addition, he anticipated that the    recent stronger activity would continue into the fall months. Similarly, a manufacturer of packaging    materials in South Carolina said demand was "heating up" and that there was a    good chance he would be even busier in the coming year. On the price front, contacts indicated that    the pace of growth in raw material prices was little changed since our last    report, while growth in final goods prices increased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      On balance, demand for home mortgages    continued to weaken across the Fifth District during recent weeks. Sources in    Bethesda, Md., and Virginia Beach, Va., noted a sharp slowdown in activity,    while contacts in Raleigh, N.C., and Charleston, S.C., noted more modest    decreases. In contrast, contacts in    Richmond, Va., and Parkersburg, W.Va., reported that demand was steady.    Lenders said that tighter credit standards were partly responsible for    decreased activity. Contacts said they    had reduced the number of mortgage products offered, set higher credit score    requirements, and raised the interest rates charged on mortgages to address    credit and loan quality. Contacts in    Baltimore Md., Richmond, Va., and Raleigh, N.C., generally believed the ripple    effects from the subprime market will be contained, though they report that    standards for commercial mortgage loans have tightened somewhat. A contact in Charleston, W.Va., said their    commercial loan standards tightened as they were following guidelines "more    strictly." Nonetheless, District bankers generally reported steady demand for    commercial mortgages over the last six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District    Realtors reported a further drop off in home sales across the District since    our last report. Agents indicated that activity had declined more noticeably    in the last six weeks, in part because concern about the health of financial    markets has increased. "We haven't    been as busy this year as we were three or four years ago, but activity has    fallen off even further here recently as more and more clients, spooked by    the evening news, remain on the sidelines," noted a Wilmington, N.C.,    Realtor. Contacts said that recent    developments in financial markets have greatly thinned their subprime    business, but that clients pursuing conventional loans continue to have    adequate access to financing. Despite    softer sales, listing activity has remained generally on track in recent    weeks, though a Realtor in Raleigh, N.C., noted some clients were considering    converting their unsold homes to rental units. Residential agents also reported an    increase in the number of foreclosures, and noted higher inventories with the    average number of    days on the market continuing to rise.    Moreover, contacts indicated that home prices moved lower in many    markets in recent weeks as sellers set more "realistic" prices. One agent in Hagerstown, Md., remarked,    "...sellers are finally getting the message on prices." Realtors throughout the    District generally said that they view the recent downturn as a "necessary    correction" needed to move to more sustainable levels of activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the commercial side, agents reported    a slight slowdown in office leasing in late July and August, while retail and    industrial activity remained generally healthy. Contacts in Washington, D.C., and Columbia,    S.C., reported that a normal, seasonal pause during the height of summer    vacations contributed to softer leasing activity. Reports on vacancy rates were mixed. In Washington, D.C., and Raleigh, N.C.,    contacts reported that office vacancy rates were steady in recent weeks,    while agents in Columbia, S.C., and Charlotte, N.C., noted slight decreases    in office vacancies. Retail vacancy    rates across the District were generally unchanged during the last six weeks. Reports on rental rates varied. Office rents    were said to have risen a bit in late July and August, though one contact in    Washington, D.C., noted a slight dip in rates in some office submarkets. Amid fears of tightening credit, agents in    northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., indicated that financing was still    available for new projects, though lenders were exercising more caution. Contacts reported little to no new    construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Tourist activity remained strong in late    July and August. Along the coast,    contacts in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and on the Outer Banks of North Carolina    reported brisk restaurant and retail sales, which they attributed to    near-perfect weather and later starting dates for North and South Carolina    schools. Similarly, a hotelier in Virginia Beach, Va., told us that bookings    had picked up since our last report. On the western edge of the District, a    manager at a mountain resort in Virginia said that sales of time shares were    going well and that tourists were "not holding back" when it came to spending    at his establishment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District temporary employment agents generally reported stronger    demand for workers in recent weeks, noting that it remained difficult to find    qualified, skilled workers. In    addition, agents in Raleigh, N.C., and Richmond, Va., expected demand for    temporary workers to strengthen further over the next several months, as    businesses resorted to temporary workers amid especially taut local labor    markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Severe,    drought-like conditions persisted in many areas of the Fifth District in July    and August. Despite widespread rainfall during the second half of August,    soaring temperatures and depleted ground moisture reduced potential crop    yields, particularly in Maryland, where over 60 percent of the soybean crop and    55 percent of the corn crop were reported to be in poor to very poor    condition. In Virginia, a contact    reported that the supplemental feeding of livestock continued as pasture    conditions deteriorated    further. In addition, cattle farmers in Virginia were culling their herds to    get ahead of possible feed shortages this fall and winter.
