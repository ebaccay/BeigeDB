      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy continued to experience moderate growth in October 
  and early November. Consumer spending strengthened despite slightly weaker auto 
  sales, and labor markets continued to expand. Commercial real estate activity 
  also increased further, while manufacturing grew modestly. Energy activity fell 
  slightly but was still high by historical standards, and agricultural conditions 
  were generally favorable. Residential real estate activity continued to decline. 
  Wage pressures were generally moderate, while price pressures eased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased solidly in October and early November, despite a 
  slight easing in auto sales. The share of retail stores reporting increased 
  sales from the previous survey continued to rise following a slowdown in the 
  summer, and recent sales were higher than expected at many stores. Gains were 
  reported across a variety of market segments, with sales of apparel particularly 
  strong. On the other hand, sales of home furnishings remained relatively weak. 
  Contacts generally expected a solid holiday sales season. Auto dealers reported 
  a modest decline in sales from the previous survey, which pushed inventories 
  above desired levels at many dealerships. However, vehicle sales remained above 
  year-ago levels and contacts were generally optimistic about the future. Travel 
  and tourism activity remained strong in October and early November. District 
  hotels continued to report high occupancy rates, and airport traffic was solid. 
  Most hotel and tourist attraction operators expected high levels of activity 
  to persist through the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District expanded modestly in October and early 
  November. Plant managers continued to report slower growth in production, shipments, 
  and new orders than earlier in the year, and order backlogs and finished goods 
  inventories fell for the first time in over a year. Producers of automotive, 
  residential construction, and agricultural equipment reported especially slow 
  sales. On the other hand, manufacturers who supply equipment to the energy, 
  railroad, aircraft, commercial office, and high-tech industries reported strong 
  demand. Plant managers expressed less optimism about near-term output than in 
  previous surveys, and one contact reported a reduction in productivity due to 
  limited skills and motivation among recently-added employees. However, factory 
  activity was still well above year-ago levels, and capital spending plans remained 
  solid.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity decreased in October and early November, while 
  commercial real estate activity strengthened further. Builders indicated that 
  home starts continued to drop and were below year-ago levels. Further easing 
  in home construction is expected in the months ahead. Residential real estate 
  agents reported continued declines in home sales, and additional decreases are 
  anticipated. Inventories of existing homes were still well above year-ago levels 
  but largely unchanged from the previous survey. Home inventories were generally 
  expected to begin falling in the months ahead, with the slowdown in construction. 
  Home prices were steady in most cities and still well up from a year ago in 
  Albuquerque and Oklahoma City. Many contacts in Colorado, however, reported 
  moderate price declines and expected further easing in the future. Commercial 
  real estate activity continued to improve. Sales and absorption of office space 
  increased in most cities, and vacancy rates were lower than a year ago throughout 
  the District. As a result, office prices and rents increased further. Most commercial 
  real estate agents anticipated continued strengthening in the months ahead, 
  although a few contacts were concerned about potential over-building of single-story 
  suburban commercial space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported that loans increased somewhat since the last survey, while 
  deposits held steady. Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose, while 
  demand for residential mortgage loans edged down. On the deposit side, interest 
  bearing deposits such as CDs and money market deposits were slightly higher 
  than in the prior period, while demand deposits were lower. Lending rates and 
  lending standards were basically unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity declined moderately in October and early November but remained 
  strong by historical standards. The count of active oil and gas drilling rigs 
  in the region fell slightly compared with the previous survey but was still 
  well above year-ago levels. The recent decline was concentrated in the Rocky 
  Mountain area, where contacts reported the cost to drill, equip, and produce 
  wells was becoming prohibitive. One contact also noted that many exploration 
  companies had moved their offshore drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico to other 
  parts of the world due to difficulties in obtaining hurricane insurance. Most 
  contacts anticipated steady drilling activity going forward, as energy prices 
  remained relatively high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions remained generally favorable in October and early November 
  despite a lack of moisture across much of the District. The corn and soybean 
  harvest was nearly complete, and winter wheat emergence was progressing normally. 
  The unseasonably warm and dry weather aided harvest activities but continued 
  to deplete soil moisture in many vulnerable parts of the District. Higher market 
  prices benefited producers of wheat and corn. Livestock producers, however, 
  faced higher feed costs combined with weak pasture conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to expand in the District, while wage pressures remained 
  moderate. Hiring announcements continued to outpace layoff announcements in 
  the region, and several contacts noted increases in newspaper and radio job 
  advertisements. The majority of businesses reported some type of labor shortage, 
  especially for skilled and specialized workers, including engineers, oil field 
  workers, accountants, welders, sales people, and truck drivers. Given the overall 
  shortage of workers, one contact lowered language standards for new employees. 
  Several contacts said more firms were hiring workers away from other companies, 
  resulting in higher wage expectations. Still, the overall share of businesses 
  experiencing wage pressures remained steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures eased somewhat in October and early November. The share of manufacturers 
  reporting increased materials costs continued to fall, and the share of factories 
  raising finished goods prices also dropped slightly. Builders reported metal 
  prices remained high, but prices for some other construction materials have 
  moderated due to both lower demand and lower transportation costs. More manufacturers 
  than in previous surveys expected prices to rise in the coming months, and builders 
  said any increase in fuel costs would lead to price hikes. Most retail contacts 
  reported flat selling prices and expected little change in prices in the months 
  ahead. However, several restaurants in Colorado planned to raise menu prices 
  to cover expected increases in labor costs resulting from the passage of a new 
  minimum wage law.
