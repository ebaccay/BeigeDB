     <p>
      The Fifth District economy expanded at a quicker pace in the weeks since our 

  last report as growth in the services sector edged up. District services businesses 

  reported moderately higher revenue growth in June and early July. Retail sales 

  gained momentum throughout the period, boosted by brisk automobile and light 

  truck sales in recent weeks. District manufacturing activity edged lower in 

  June but strengthened substantially in the first half of July. District real 

  estate agents continued to report robustness in housing markets and relatively 

  strong demand for office and retail space in the commercial sector. In the financial 

  sector, bank lending moved moderately higher as demand for residential mortgages 

  strengthened. When asked about prices, most of our business contacts responded 

  that price pressures remained generally mild. In agriculture, remnants of two 

  tropical storms brought substantial rainfall to the District in July, helping 

  to alleviate dry soil conditions and boost crop and pasture conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales rose at a moderate pace in the weeks since our last report. Automobile 

  and light truck sales, which languished in the spring, picked up in June and 

  the first half of July. Furniture sales also strengthened in recent weeks--a 

  manager at a department store in North Carolina noted that customer response 

  to an expansion of the store's furniture product line had been "very 

  positive." In addition, other retailers generally reported higher shopper 

  traffic and big-ticket sales in early July. District bookstores noted particularly 

  brisk customer traffic in mid July in advance of the latest release in the Harry 

  Potter series of children's books. Retailers reported that their hiring 

  picked up in June but eased in the first two weeks of July. Retail price growth 

  was moderate in both months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District services firms reported stronger revenue growth since our last report. 

  Contacts at business-to-business firms in central West Virginia and at financial 

  services firms in Richmond, Va., and eastern North Carolina told us that customer 

  demand rose at a quicker pace in recent weeks. In contrast, most contacts at 

  healthcare facilities in the District said demand, while strong, had shown little 

  additional growth. Services sector firms reported moderate increases in hiring 

  and noted that information technology workers, truck drivers, and registered 

  nurses were more widely sought. Prices in the services sector rose at a moderate 

  pace in June and July.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity softened in June but picked up the pace in early 

  July. Manufacturers told us that shipments, new orders, and capacity utilization 

  expanded at a solid clip in July. Manufacturers in the electronics, food, and 

  plastic products industries reported particularly strong growth in output during 

  the month. A plastics manufacturer in North Carolina, for example, reported 

  being "very busy right now...We have some good new orders in-house 

  and pending, so I'm optimistic about the next few months." Despite 

  higher output, manufacturing employment continued to drift lower. Textiles firms, 

  in particular, said they continued to trim payrolls. District manufacturers 

  told us that raw material price increases eased in June and July and that prices 

  for final goods manufactured rose only modestly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bankers said lending activity rose at a moderate pace in June and early 

  July as demand for residential mortgages picked up. A mortgage lender in Greenville, 

  S.C., told us that residential mortgage applications and closings in his office 

  in June were the best this year, and that while the year started off slowly, 

  they were now "turning the corner." Several lenders said that the 

  pickup in mortgage lending was due in part to uncertainty regarding future mortgage 

  interest rates--borrowers were committing to mortgages now in anticipation 

  of higher interest rates ahead. Commercial lending activity was little changed. 

  A commercial banker in Richmond, Va., reported "a lot of renegotiation 

  of existing loans, but little new business" in recent weeks. A lender 

  in Charlottesville, Va., told us there were new loans in the pipeline, but noted 

  that many of his commercial clients appeared reluctant to draw down their lines 

  of credit until business strengthened further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While a few residential real estate agents reported somewhat slower growth in 

  home sales, most told us that both home sales and prices strengthened since 

  our last report. Housing markets in Virginia were particularly robust; a Richmond 

  agent reported "great" home sales in July, while a contact in Virginia 

  Beach said he had never seen a stronger market. Residential real estate markets 

  in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area showed continued strength as well, 

  although the pace of activity was not as frenzied as in the spring. An agent 

  in Washington, D.C., said that multiple offers on homes for sale were still 

  common, and that condominiums selling for prices in excess of $500,000 were 

  moving particularly well. A contact in Fredericksburg, Va., however, noted that 

  while the market there remained busy, it was taking "maybe a bit longer 

  to sell properties." Real estate agents in several towns in the Carolinas 

  said that housing markets were generally stable; a Greenville, S.C., agent said 

  there were lots of homes on the market and they were being sold relatively quickly. 

  House prices continued to move higher in most areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate agents reported little change in Fifth District leasing 

  activity in June and early July. Demand for office and retail space remained 

  strong in most areas but the onset of summer vacations made closing deals a 

  little more difficult. "There is still a lot of business going on out 

  here; it just takes a little longer to get stuff done when summer rolls around," 

  noted a contact in Columbia, S.C. Despite robust demand for lease space and 

  investment properties, agents said that price increases for both had begun to 

  moderate during the last six weeks, and most contacts said they expected only 

  modest increases in rents in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity was somewhat stronger in recent weeks. Hoteliers along the 

  coast reported solid bookings for July. A contact at Myrtle Beach, S.C., noted 

  that hotel bookings were particularly strong around the July 4th holiday. In 

  addition, July 4th holiday celebrations attracted lots of visitors to the nation's 

  capital--the city's Metro subway ridership on the holiday was about 

  25 percent higher than a year ago. Tourism officials noted that the return of 

  professional baseball to Washington, D.C., had also boosted tourism in the city.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Temporary employment agencies in the District reported continued strong demand 

  for workers since our last report. Warehouse, production, sales, administrative, 

  and software skills in particular were widely sought. A Raleigh, N.C., contact 

  told us that renewed confidence in business growth strengthened demand for his 

  agency's services. An agent in Baltimore, Md., said that he expected demand 

  for services to rise further in coming weeks, and noted that he was seeing better 

  qualified applicants for temporary positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Remnants of tropical storms Cindy and Dennis brought much-needed rainfall to 

  crops and pastures in the Fifth District in early July. While some eastern parts 

  of the District remained generally dry, substantial rainfall greatly improved 

  soil conditions and yield prospects for corn and soybeans, and "greened-up" 

  pastureland in most of the District. Heavy rains in South Carolina, however, 

  caused some flooding and damaged crops in low-lying areas. On a brighter note, 

  small grain harvesting neared completion in the Carolinas, and peach crops in 

  Maryland and South Carolina remained in good-to-excellent condition.
