       January 19, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District expanded in December. Manufacturers 

  reported increases in orders and shipments during the month. Retail sales of 

  general merchandise during the holiday shopping period rose from the previous 

  year, with modest gains for most stores and greater increases among luxury goods 

  retailers. Auto sales were roughly steady during December. Banks reported that 

  overall lending continued on an upward trend in December. Service companies 

  generally reported a steady to slightly stronger pace of growth at year-end 

  compared with the fall.
      <p>
       Contacts in the Third District business community expect economic activity 

  in the region to continue on an upward trend through the winter, and some contacts 

  anticipate a slight quickening in the growth rate as the year progresses. Manufacturers 

  expect increases in shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers 

  expect modest growth in sales during the year, but auto dealers expect sales 

  to weaken. Bankers believe overall lending will continue to rise, although they 

  do not anticipate much growth in residential mortgage loan volume. Service companies 

  expect some pickup in the pace of growth for their businesses.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturing activity in the Third District increased in December. Around four 

  out of ten of the manufacturing firms surveyed during the month posted higher 

  shipments and orders compared with the previous month, and less than two in 

  ten reported decreases. Order backlogs at area plants edged up slightly from 

  November to December although delivery times were unchanged. Business conditions 

  varied among the major manufacturing sectors in the region. Growing demand was 

  generally reported by makers of food products, apparel, electrical machinery, 

  and transportation equipment. Some slowing in demand was reported by makers 

  of lumber and wood products, paper products, and plastics.
        <p>
         The region's manufacturers generally expect further gains in business 

  activity. Just over half of the firms surveyed in December expect their shipments 

  and orders to increase during the next six months, and around one in ten expect 

  decreases. On balance, area manufacturing firms are scheduling increases in 

  capital spending and planning to add employees. Although current conditions 

  vary among the region's major manufacturing sectors, the outlook for the 

  first half of the year is positive in almost all of them.
         <p>
          Third District manufacturers continued to report rising prices, with about 

  the same percentage of firms noting increases during December as in November. 

  During the next six months almost two-thirds of manufacturers expect increases 

  in input prices, and about one-half expect increases in the prices of their 

  own goods.
          <p>
           <strong>
            Retail
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Retail sales of general merchandise during the holiday shopping period were 

  generally in line with merchants' expectations. Most stores reported year-over-year 

  gains of around 3 percent, in current dollars. Stores specializing in luxury 

  goods did better than other types of stores during the period, as they did through 

  most of 2004; some posted year-over-year gains in excess of 10 percent. Merchants 

  indicated that the extent of price markdowns in December and early January was 

  roughly comparable to discounting in the previous year. In general, merchants 

  reported that their inventories after the holidays were not excessive. Store 

  executives forecast modest growth in sales during 2005. Those who commented 

  on expansion plans generally indicated that they will open as many new stores 

  this year as they did last year.
           <p>
            Auto dealers in the region reported roughly steady sales in December, on balance, 

  although results varied by dealership. In general, dealers selling domestic 

  makes saw some slowing in sales, and dealers selling imports saw increases. 

  Although manufacturers have maintained promotions on 2004 models and extended 

  them to 2005 models, many dealers' inventories remained above desired 

  levels. Dealers expect sales this year to be off at least a few percent from 

  last year.
            <p>
             <strong>
              Finance
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks rose in December, according 

  to banks contacted for this report. Commercial and industrial loans have been 

  growing, with new borrowing being done by firms in a wide range of industries. 

  Bankers also reported increases in consumer lending, including credit cards 

  and home equity lines. Banks generally indicated that growth in home mortgage 

  lending has slowed. Bankers in the District expect overall lending to rise in 

  2005. They anticipate further gains in business and consumer lending, but little 

  growth in residential mortgage loan volume.
             <p>
              Investment companies and stockbrokers in the region have been receiving strong 

  cash inflows, and most of the money has been directed toward equities. In response 

  to the greater volume of business, some securities firms are adding employees 

  and increasing their information technology capacity. Investment company executives 

  expect business to continue to expand this year, but they do not expect stronger 

  growth in 2005 than in 2004.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Services
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Most of the Third District service firms contacted for this report indicated 

  modest improvement in business conditions in the past few months, and some reported 

  recent pickups in the pace of growth. Information technology companies indicated 

  that demand for their services has strengthened as the result of improvement 

  in their clients' business, an increase in information systems requirements 

  to support regulatory compliance, and a growing need to upgrade computer systems 

  generally. Other business services activity has been on the rise, and the pace 

  of growth has increased somewhat. Most of the service sector firms surveyed 

  expressed cautious optimism that growth in business this year will be stronger 

  than last year.
               <p>
                Employment agencies in the region reported moderate increases in demand for 

  workers in the past few months, and they expect the pace of hiring to be steady 

  through the winter. Companies in manufacturing, trade, and the financial sectors 

  have relatively stronger hiring plans than do employers in other sectors.
