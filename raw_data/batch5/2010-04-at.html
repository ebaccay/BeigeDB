      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business contacts around the District described economic activity as   improving in March and early April. Retailers saw an increase in traffic and   sales and their outlook improved. Auto sales increased on a year-over-year   basis, while revenues in the District's tourism segment were described as   stable. Residential real estate contacts indicated that both new and existing   home sales improved and were above weak levels from a year earlier. Commercial   contractors, on the other hand, continued to cite weakness in nonresidential   construction activity. District manufacturers noted further improvement in new   orders and production. The flow of bank credit to businesses remained subdued.   Permanent hiring remained weak. However, temporary help agencies noted an   increase in job orders. Manufacturers and homebuilders reported increases in   input prices but indicated that they were not able to pass them through to   consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District merchants   indicated an improvement in traffic and sales in March. Retailers reported that   despite the uptick in sales, they continued to keep inventory levels lower than   normal; several merchants related that they preferred risking lost sales to   having excess inventories. The outlook among retail contacts also improved with   the majority expecting sales to increase over the next couple of months.   District vehicle sales increased from a year ago, largely driven by an expansion   in fleet sales deferred from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism-related spending was described as stable in most parts of the   District. Contacts in Atlanta, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Orlando, and Tampa   all reported hotel occupancy rates above the national average from February to   March. Cruise lines noted increased demand and have unwound some earlier price   discounting. The near-term outlook among hospitality contacts remained generally   upbeat. However, corporate bookings remained at very low levels at some high-end   resorts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders reported   improved new home sales across the region, and that construction activity   increased modestly from very low levels. Several homebuilders noted that   difficulty in obtaining mortgage financing and lower property appraisals were   impeding sales. New home inventories remained down, sharply from a year earlier,   and the majority of homebuilders continued to cite year-over-year price   declines. Overall, the outlook for home sales and construction improved modestly   from the previous report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Realtors indicated a slight improvement in existing home sales with nearly   half of those contacted reporting modest increases. Sales at the low-end of the   market continued to outpace those at higher price points. However, sales growth   at the low-end moderated from late-2009 levels, while mid- to high-end home   sales stabilized. Similar to comments from homebuilders, many Realtors also   noted that difficulty in obtaining financing was impeding home sales. Most   continued to cite downward pressure on home prices. The outlook for sales over   the next several months continued to be modestly positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Low levels of commercial construction continued across much of the District.   Most contractors described activity as relatively flat compared with previous   reports, and a few cited additional weakness. The volume of backlogs was little   changed but remained lower than a year ago. Most indicated that the demand for   new construction continued to be soft. Looking ahead, the majority of contacts   anticipated commercial construction will continue to be weak for the remainder   of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of District   manufacturers reported that new orders increased and production levels improved.   Contacts noted increased hours worked and many anticipated employment gains in   the short-term. A few auto assembly plants recalled some workers. Freight demand   continued to improve from low levels. Regional rail shipments through mid-March   were up notably for automotive, chemical, and other raw industrial   materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The flow of bank credit to businesses   remained subdued. District bankers continued to indicate that ample credit was   available to qualified borrowers, and many noted that the volume of loan   applications was low for households and small businesses. In contrast, several   firms noted that tighter credit standards were making it difficult for them to   obtain loans. Some contacts suggested that trade credit terms also tightened   with some suppliers having modified terms or reduced credit without regard to   payment history.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unemployment remained high across   the District in February and March. Some employers indicated that public policy   uncertainty had contributed to some reticence to hire permanent workers.   However, many businesses continued to increase hours worked for existing staff,   and some increased the number of temporary staff, particularly in Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturing and homebuilder contacts reported increases in   commodity-related material prices compared with a year ago, though prices   softened somewhat on a monthly basis. Several businesses expressed concern that   supply chain capacity reductions in some industries could lead to further input   price increases if product demand increased rapidly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crude oil production in   the District edged up in late February and March. The increase in output,   combined with soft energy consumption, pushed crude inventories in the Gulf of   Mexico close to the top of their seasonal average for this time of year. Recent   wet weather and colder-than-usual temperatures have negatively affected some   crops in Alabama and Florida and limited farm work in some areas.
