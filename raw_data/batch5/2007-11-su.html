      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports  from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the national economy  continued to expand during the survey period of October through mid-November  but at a reduced pace compared with the previous survey period.  Among Districts, seven reported a slower pace  of economic activity while the remainder generally pointed to modest expansion  or mixed conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      District reports indicated  relatively soft retail spending; most retailers said that they were expecting a  slow holiday season, with only small gains in sales volumes compared with last  year. By contrast, tourist activity expanded further in most Districts.  Providers of nonfinancial services to  consumers and businesses generally saw continued solid growth in demand,  although a few Districts pointed to reduced demand for transportation services.  Reports from the manufacturing sector were  mixed across Districts and sectors, suggesting little change in activity on  net.  Producers in the agricultural and  natural-resources sectors saw robust demand, with sales of agricultural  products spurred in part by rapid growth in export demand.  The glut of available homes continued,  keeping downward pressure on prices and construction activity.  The demand for commercial real estate  remained strong in most areas but showed signs of leveling off in some.  Reports from banks and other financial  institutions suggested slower growth in overall loan demand, with some  Districts noting a reduction in the volume of commercial and industrial  lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward pressures on the prices of  final goods and services remained modest overall but were significant for  products and services that rely heavily on food and energy inputs.  Increases in the costs of energy and selected  raw materials pushed up production and transportation costs for firms in  various manufacturing and services sectors, although this was offset in part by  price declines for lumber and transportation equipment.  Food prices remained on an upward trajectory.  Outside of products and services that rely  heavily on energy and food inputs, final prices were reported to be largely  stable or down a bit.  Wage increases  were moderate in general; upward wage pressures eased in a few areas where  labor markets loosened slightly, although they remained strong for assorted  groups of skilled workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on retail spending were  downbeat in general, with several significant exceptions. Most Districts  characterized sales as weak or indicated that they had softened, with a few  reporting that the volume of sales had fallen relative to the preceding survey  period or a year earlier.  However, the  Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts highlighted a  pickup in retail sales relative to the preceding survey period.  Among product categories, several Districts  noted continued solid growth in sales of consumer electronics, while a few also  noted that demand for luxury goods continued to rise at a healthy pace.  By contrast, sales of automobiles and light  trucks were flat to down, with contacts from several Districts expecting  declines going forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, the reports were slightly  pessimistic about prospects for the holiday retail season.  Most Districts reported that retailers expect  growth in retail sales to be modest at best relative to last year, and  retailers generally were described as having a "cautious" attitude about the  upcoming holiday season.  Consistent with  this assessment, the Richmond, Dallas,  and San Francisco Districts reported early-season price discounting by  retailers.  In the Boston  and Minneapolis Districts, retailers expressed cautious optimism for holiday  sales, but they generally expect consumer spending to weaken in 2008.  Several reports indicated that retail inventories  have risen a bit of late and were higher than desired levels during the survey  period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the travel and tourism  sector generally was at a high level and increased further in some cases.  The Richmond,  Minneapolis, and Kansas City  Districts reported that tourist bookings grew or were above normal seasonal  expectations during the survey period, and tourism activity in New    York City remained at a high level.  The Atlanta District reported that Florida's  tourist trade was up, spurred in large part by foreign visitors.  In contrast, visitor travel and business at  major tourist destinations in the San Francisco District, including Hawaii and  Southern California, have declined a bit from the high levels established in  2006.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on nonfinancial services  generally were consistent with expanding economic activity, with the primary  exception of transportation services.  Several  Districts pointed to continued strong demand growth for health-care services,  while the Richmond, St.    Louis, and Minneapolis Districts noted an ongoing expansion  for providers of legal and other professional services.  The Dallas District reported steady demand  for legal services but noted a shift toward litigation related to bankruptcy  filings, which may signal a slowing economy.   In the San Francisco District, demand for advertising services was held  down by weak demand from sellers of automobiles and home furnishings.  Providers of temporary staffing services saw  strong demand in the Richmond District as well as a pickup from the legal and  financial industries in New York City,  but demand for temp workers was reported as "sluggish" overall by Dallas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Available reports on the  transportation sector suggest that the level of activity declined somewhat  compared with the previous survey period.   The Cleveland District reported that trucking volumes were "steady to  declining" and that employment has fallen a bit; Dallas  noted that overall shipping activity has weakened; and Atlanta  reported lower shipping volumes for autos and materials for home construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity was mixed  across subsectors but appeared to be largely stable on balance.  Demand remained weak or fell further for  machinery and manufactured materials related to home construction, such as  lumber and concrete, and automakers have scaled back their production activities  this year.  By contrast, demand rose  solidly for various other types of capital goods, such as non-automotive  transportation equipment, information technology products, and machinery used  in the agriculture, energy extraction, and mining industries.  Chicago  reported that steel production increased, in part because of reduced import  competition of late, but Cleveland  characterized steel shipping volumes as "flat" in that District.  Among nondurable products, several Districts  noted continued robust demand for food and significant gains for paper and  plastics.  However, Dallas  reported "stable" demand for food and a drop in sales of corrugated boxes, and  St. Louis noted that food manufacturers plan to lay off workers in that  District.  The reports generally indicated  that increases in demand were especially strong for products and firms with  significant export markets, for which sales have been boosted in part by the  lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on capacity utilization suggested  that manufacturers on net were operating near long-term average levels, albeit  with substantial variation evident across sectors depending on the strength of  product demand.  The reports also  suggested little change in utilization rates during the survey period.  A few Districts reported on capital spending  by manufacturers and other businesses, noting tentative plans for continued  moderate capacity expansion, but with the proviso that actual spending will  reflect realized needs as they develop.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for residential real estate  remained quite depressed, with only a few tentative and scattered signs of  stabilization amidst the ongoing slowdown.  Most Districts pointed to further increases in  the inventory of available homes, with the earlier tightening of credit  conditions for mortgage lending continuing to create barriers for some buyers.  Consequently, prices on new and existing  homes sold were reported to be down on a short-term or year-earlier basis in most  Districts.  The pace of homebuilding  remained very low in general, and builders continued to shelve projects and lay  off workers in many areas; contacts generally do not expect a significant  pickup in homebuilding until well into next year at the earliest.  Among scattered positive signs, however, co-op  and condo sales in New York City picked  up during the survey period, Richmond  reported favorable readings on home sales in a few areas, and Kansas    City reported that home inventories fell a bit in the Denver  metro area.  Weak home demand had mixed  effects on conditions in rental markets:   Chicago reported that  builders' conversions of new homes to rental property put downward pressure on  rents, while Dallas noted that  demand for apartments picked up, in part because some potential homebuyers are  unable to qualify for mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for commercial, industrial,  and retail space generally remained at high levels and expanded further in some  areas, although signs of leveling off were evident in several Districts.  Vacancy rates on commercial and industrial  space remained relatively low in most Districts and declined in some, even  where substantial new space has been added of late.  Rents have risen accordingly in many areas.  In the extreme, New York  reported a 30 percent increase in asking rents on Manhattan  office space over the past 12 months; however, this represents a smaller  increase than in previous surveys, and a recent increase in vacancy rates there  is likely to further temper that trend going forward.  A few Districts reported emerging signs of  declining demand for commercial space:  this  included assorted indicators of weaker demand in the major metro areas in the  Boston District, reduced leasing activity in Philadelphia, commercial  construction activity that was described as "flat to down slightly compared  with a year ago" in Atlanta, and reduced transactions and rising vacancy rates  in some parts of the San Francisco District.   Construction of commercial and public buildings and infrastructure  projects remained high in most Districts, however, partly offsetting low  residential building activity and helping to limit losses in overall construction  employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending to businesses generally was  at high levels, but the reports suggested a slower rate of growth than in  previous survey periods.  Commercial and  industrial lending activity changed little or declined in the Cleveland,  Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, although it  increased noticeably in the Philadelphia District and continued to show modest  growth according to Chicago.  Lending  standards for construction projects and commercial real estate transactions  tightened further in the New York  and St. Louis Districts, and they remained tight more generally and reportedly  held down the volume of lending for these categories in the Boston District.  The reports indicated slight increases in  delinquencies on commercial and industrial loans and slightly larger increases  for commercial mortgages in many areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer lending was little changed  on net, while residential mortgage lending continued its downward slide.  More stringent credit conditions remained a constraint  for residential mortgage lending in general, with additional tightening during  the survey period reported by Chicago, Kansas  City, and Dallas; scattered reports  suggested slightly stricter standards on consumer loans as well.  Mortgage delinquencies increased  significantly in many areas, and some Districts pointed to slight deterioration  in credit quality for consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported strong  demand for agricultural products and favorable production conditions, with the  primary exception of an ongoing drought in the Richmond  and Atlanta Districts.  Demand and sales  were reported to be quite strong for a wide variety of tree and row crops,  dairy products, and livestock.  Several  Districts noted that the rise in overall demand has been propelled in part by  the lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar, which has spurred strong increases  in export sales.  Harvest and growing  conditions were quite favorable in most areas.  High corn production and yields were reported by  Chicago, Kansas  City, and Dallas.  St. Louis  and Minneapolis described healthy  early-season conditions for winter wheat crops, while Kansas    City described that crop's progress as normal.  By contrast, dry weather undermined pasture  conditions and created a need for supplemental feedings to livestock herds in  the Kansas City and Dallas  Districts.  Moreover, drought conditions  continued in the Southeast, and this reduced or delayed crop plantings and held  down crop yields in the Richmond  and Atlanta Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on the natural-resources  sector indicated further growth from very high levels of activity.  High oil prices have stimulated expanded  drilling in the Atlanta and Dallas  Districts; Minneapolis reported  increased activity in the energy and mining sectors since the last report; and Kansas    City reported that "energy activity remained robust."  However, Cleveland  reported a slight decline in production of natural gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Increases in prices of final goods  and services generally remained modest, except for food and energy.  Increases in the costs of energy and  petroleum-related materials created upward pressures on transportation costs  and the prices of some manufactured items; many producers responded by  increasing final sales prices, although limited pricing power forced some to  absorb cost increases in profit margins.   In addition, food prices continued on their pronounced upward march, and  some Districts highlighted price increases on various imported goods resulting  from the lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar.  Increases in final prices for products related  to food and energy were moderate in general, however, and they were  accompanied, in large part, by stable or declining prices for other products  and services, including various construction materials and assorted retail  merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor markets remained relatively  tight overall but loosened in some areas, and wage pressures were largely unchanged  from the previous survey period.  Most  reports suggested that wage increases continued at a moderate pace, with  numerical reports in the range of 3 to 4 percent on an annual basis.  Dallas  and San Francisco reported that  labor market tightness eased somewhat, relieving upward wage pressures in some  areas, but Kansas City noted that  wage pressures picked up.  Wage gains remained  especially rapid for assorted groups of workers with specialized skills used in  expanding sectors, such as engineers in the San Francisco District.
