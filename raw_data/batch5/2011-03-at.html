      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      According to reports from Sixth District business contacts, economic   conditions continued to improve at a modest pace in January and early February.   Most retailers contacted stated that adverse weather had affected the positive   sales trend seen at the end of last year. The hospitality industry experienced   moderate growth as hotel occupancy and bookings increased, most notably in   Florida. Weakness persisted throughout the District in both residential and   commercial real estate. Manufacturers cited growth in new orders along with   plans to increase production in the near term. Transportation firms remarked   that freight shipments remained stable. Credit conditions improved for segments   not related to residential construction and real estate. Labor markets continued   to recover at a slow rate, with most businesses maintaining a preference for   hiring temporary rather than permanent employees. Some businesses indicated   limited plans to pass costs through to consumers in an effort to increase their   margins from unusually low levels, recognizing that they may have to reverse   course if there is significant buyer push-back.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District merchants   reported that retail activity moderated in January and early February following   better than expected holiday sales at the end of 2010. In addition, many cited   bad weather conditions as having contributed to the reduction in traffic and   sales. Retailers mentioned that they would not be adjusting inventories in   response to the higher than expected sales at the end of last year. The majority   expressed that they will continue using lean inventory management. The outlook   among retail contacts for the next few months remained optimistic. District   vehicle sales improved from low volumes witnessed a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, leisure and business travel increased moderately compared with the   previous year. Hotel occupancy and convention bookings were up slightly in many   locations despite adverse weather conditions. The strongest gains were reported   in Florida, where international visitors increased noticeably. Cruise activity   remained healthy as well. Restaurants also noted a modest increase in business   as the economy and consumer confidence improved. The outlook among District   hospitality contacts for the upcoming months continued to be positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders   reported slow growth in new home sales for January and early February, while   buyer traffic weakened compared with late last year. The majority of   homebuilders stated that construction activity was below the year-ago level.   Some homebuilders noted rising material costs which they have been unable to   pass through because of continued downward pressure on home prices. The outlook   for sales growth over the next several months improved slightly from our last   report, but the overall level of sales are expected to remain very low.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential brokers in the District indicated that existing home sales   remained at low levels in January and early February. However, brokers noted   that sales exceeded the year earlier level, largely driven by gains in Florida.   Outside of Florida, some contacts suggested that adverse weather had dampened   sales. Brokers continued to notice downward pressure on home prices from   short-sales, REO's, and pending foreclosures. The outlook for sales growth over   the next several months improved from previous reports, but total sales are   expected to remain low.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity remained at low levels during January   and early February. Most commercial contractors said that the environment was   little changed since the end of last year. The majority of contacts expect   construction activity to remain at low levels this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since December, District   manufacturers experienced strong growth in new orders, while production levels   increased moderately. Reports showed that the majority of respondents plan to   increase production levels in the short term even as many manufacturing firms   are experiencing higher input prices. District trucking firms noted both   stronger demand and a firming of shipment prices; however, they also indicated   that they have been facing increasing fuel costs and extremely adverse weather   conditions, which have slightly affected overall activity. Trucking firms also   anticipate capacity to remain tight as seasonal demand for shipments increase.   District railroad companies reported that volumes remain solid for coal,   automotive parts, and container imports. Many railroad contacts noted that   higher fuel costs were successfully being passed through as surcharges.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported an   increase in mortgage applications in January and early February; most of those   attributed the increase in number of applications to refinance activity and   lower interest rates. The majority of bankers stated that mortgage lending   standards have increased in recent months; while a few bankers reported elevated   standards remained unchanged. Small businesses related to construction and real   estate in particular, described worsening credit conditions, with many   indicating that they either did not receive the amount of credit requested or   that they refused the offered credit because of unfavorable terms. Small   businesses outside of construction and real estate reported improving credit   conditions at community and regional banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets across the District   continued to recover slowly. Many businesses stated that their hiring plans   favor leaving employment levels unchanged or to increase them slightly. Among   those firms who plan to increase employment, the major factors driving their   decisions are expectations of higher sales growth and right-sizing staff levels   that were excessively decreased. District contacts maintained a preference for   hiring temporary staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some firms reported plans to pass more of input cost increases through to   their consumers as they try to restore margins from unusually low levels.   However, most indicated that markups remained below what they considered to be   normal. A majority of businesses anticipate rising materials and benefits costs   over the next year. A number of contacts, particularly those in manufacturing,   noted some concern about the impact of rising commodity prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts along the Gulf   Coast continued to express concern that the lower pace of drilling permit   issuance and additional rig inspections would stifle future energy production   and investment. Regional crude oil inventories have declined from unseasonably   high levels in November as cooler weather and holiday travel boosted fuel   consumption. Although drilling activity remains well below pre-oil spill levels,   the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico has gradually crept up since   October 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most areas of the District continued to be affected by varying degrees of   drought. Cold temperatures negatively affected many vegetable crops in Florida.   The outlook for the region's key agricultural commodities - including poultry,   cotton, and soybeans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has been brightened by higher prices driven by strong   global demand and tight supplies.
