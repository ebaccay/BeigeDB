      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 28, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Business activity continues to expand overall in the First District, but   individual firms' gains show some choppiness. Most contacted manufacturers and   advertising and consulting firms saw revenues rise in the most recent quarter on   a year-over-year basis, while retail results were more mixed in May and June.   Residential real estate markets continue to show positive effects of the   homebuyer tax credits, but activity slowed after the April deadline. Respondents   in commercial real estate were mostly downbeat based on office job forecasts,   but building sales are picking up, in some cases at distress prices. A few firms   with rising sales are increasing their headcounts, but most are holding   employment steady. Input costs for some metals, oil- and food-related products   have risen, but sales prices are mostly stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District retailers report mixed sales   results for May and June; year-over-year same-store sales figures range from   down close to 3 percent to increases of about 3 percent. The majority of   contacts express concern over consumer confidence, and even those retailers   reporting sales increases voice a cautious outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventory levels are mixed, with some increases due to softening sales; on   the other hand, decreased ocean freight capacity is raising concerns regarding   firms' ability to restock in a cost-effective and timely manner. Capital   spending is also mixed, with some retailers spending on new store openings,   remodels, and IT systems, while others remain cautious. Headcounts are growing   modestly, with most increases attributed to opportunistic hiring and new store   growth, but a few contacts indicate that staff cutbacks may occur in the future.   Retailers note cost increases for cotton and food-related commodities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Many manufacturing   firms are still finalizing their second quarter results, but the vast majority   of those contacted report optimism about demand. The specific sales reports   range from "extraordinary demand" at a semiconductor firm to   less-than-anticipated demand at two firms making life science equipment and   medical devices. In particular, the semiconductor firm reports sales in the   second quarter were 17 percent above their pre-recession peak. Other   semiconductor-related firms also report relatively strong sales. In addition,   second quarter results appear to be somewhat better than expected at a business   services company as well as a company whose sales of outdoor-related products   benefited from the warmer-than-average temperatures. By contrast, among firms   reporting weaker-than-expected sales growth, one speculated that it was due to a   slowdown in European demand and the other to state and local budgetary cutbacks   on medical equipment. In general, nearly all of the manufacturers surveyed feel   that demand will continue to improve gradually in the second half of the year as   well as in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most contacted manufacturing firms continue to report limited price pressure.   Input costs remain relatively stable. One manufacturer who uses many raw metals   in the production process says that prices remain higher than a year ago, but   have come down somewhat since the first quarter. A couple of firms who use   oil-related products also report somewhat higher input prices. Selling prices   are generally fairly stable. One manufacturer that implemented a moderate (3   percent) price increase in the first quarter says that the increase held. By   contrast, a firm that makes both capital equipment and consumables cites   downward price pressure on the capital goods they sell (as companies remain wary   about the costs of large items), but not on the consumables; this has been the   case for about a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employment continues to be steady at nearly all responding manufacturing   firms, and most say they are unlikely to expand headcount substantially in the   near term. A number of firms plan to hire to support new product lines or in   divisions that are experiencing robust growth. A semiconductor-related firm, in   particular, plans to increase its engineering workforce by about 150 by   year-end; that firm's employment is already above its pre-recession peak due to   strong demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers once again report that their planned 2010 capital expenditures   are in line with or somewhat higher than their expenditures in 2009. Planned   increases are primarily for new product releases and/or infrastructure and   IT-related improvements. Credit supply remains adequate for firm investment, and   many manufacturers also report having adequate cash on hand for investment   purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, contacted manufacturers are generally optimistic about the second   half of 2010 and 2011. The firms remain cautious, however, as uncertainty   continues to surround the domestic and foreign demand environments.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Selected Business Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consulting and advertising   contacts in the First District generally report increased demand for their   services in the second quarter of 2010, although a few say demand is flat. Among   those seeing increases, revenue rose 8 percent to 25 percent year-over-year.   Contacts cite healthcare and private equity industries as markets in which   activity increased; a consulting firm also notes a significant increase in   demand from the U.S. government regarding international development and   healthcare issues. One contact reports that the payment cycle from its clients   lengthened in the second quarter, slowing revenue growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consulting and marketing firms indicate that business costs are stable and   they are also generally holding their list prices steady, although some firms   have been able to remove the price concessions they made in 2009. Several   companies mention that they are replacing their laptops and purchasing new   software licenses. Employment is mostly steady, with firms simply making   replacement hires or modestly increasing the number of employees; more hires are   expected in the second half of the year. Wages are either stable or rising   slightly, by 2 percent to 5 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advertising and consulting contacts are optimistic about their firms'   performance in the second half of the year, primarily based on the increasing   volume of sales and the improving economic situation. However, many respondents   see downside risks to this outlook, notably the chance of a double-dip   recession; firms that contract with the government also note that budget cuts in   response to deficit concerns would harm their businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial real estate contacts   give mixed reports this round. Leasing activity is flat in Hartford, where   market sentiment remains subdued. Between the first and second quarters,   Hartford's office vacancy rate rose by close to 2 percentage points while rents   were roughly flat. Industrial vacancy in Hartford also rose over the quarter,   but by less than a percentage point, and industrial rents were flat. Hartford's   investment sales market remains largely dormant. The word from Providence is   more upbeat, as leasing activity remained solid in recent weeks and rents have   reportedly stabilized. Business sentiment in Providence is described as more   optimistic and less uncertain than it was earlier in the year. Absorption was   roughly zero across Rhode Island. Office-building sales in Rhode Island remain   scarce, but the industrial sales market saw some significant transactions. In   Boston, one contact remains largely negative about current market conditions and   near-term prospects, emphasizing slow job growth and the high office vacancy   rate--currently around 20 percent in greater Boston. Leasing velocity is   described as either steady or up slightly, but tenants retain very strong   bargaining power on rents and improvements. Contacts say investors are bidding   aggressively for fully leased, high-quality properties in greater Boston,   especially apartment buildings; at the same time, some investors are purchasing   distressed properties (with high vacancy rates) in the suburban corridor at   steep discounts and betting on a solid recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to commercial real estate debt markets, one noteworthy   development is that special servicers (who manage CMBS issues) are reportedly   starting to dispose of an increasing number of securitized mortgages in default   rather than continuing to extend troubled loans. This trend is expected to   accelerate over the next 6 to 12 months. At the same time, banks continue to   hold large sums of distressed commercial real estate debt and have not yet   initiated large numbers of foreclosures. Contacts across the region remain   concerned about the potential impact of inevitable foreclosures, especially if a   large number occur in a compressed time period; contacts say, however, that New   England is likely to fare relatively well compared to other regions with respect   to commercial foreclosures.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Hartford, expectations for market turnaround were pushed back a quarter,   out to late 2010. In Boston, contacts expect net absorption to remain slow, and   predict that office rents still have further to fall, but were uncertain as to   whether job growth (and related demand for commercial space) would continue at   current levels or become weaker in the second half of 2010. The outlook for   Providence is cautiously optimistic, but "optimistic" was defined as slow growth   rather than further deterioration.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Residential Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate markets   in New England continue to experience large year-over-year sales increases in   May and into June. Median home prices also increased modestly year-over-year in   May, although median condo prices were somewhat mixed. While April 30 was the   deadline to sign a "binding sales contract" in order to be eligible for the   homebuyer tax credits, buyers are allowed to close these deals as late as   September 30 (extended from June 30). The strong sales numbers of May and June   thus reflect closings on pre-April 30 contracts spurred by the tax credits.   Respondents report that activity has slowed considerably since the expiration of   the tax credit. Sales numbers will soften over the next couple of months as a   result of this slowdown, although respondents are uncertain whether sales will   show year-over-year declines. Pending sales of homes and condos in Massachusetts   dropped 16 percent and 21 percent year-over-year in June, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       A New Hampshire contact says that some types of homes are still selling well,   notably those in convenient locations near major highways. Meanwhile, prices in   rural New Hampshire are "plummeting." In addition, high-end vacation homes are   starting to move again after very low activity during 2008 and 2009. A   Boston-area contact believes that pent-up demand among potential buyers (because   inventory was low) will help moderate the size of the slowdown associated with   the expiration of the tax credit.
