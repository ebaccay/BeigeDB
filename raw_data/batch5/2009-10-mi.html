      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall economic activity in the Ninth District was steady with some signs of   recovery. The manufacturing, energy, mining and residential real estate sectors   saw moderate increases. Agriculture, consumer spending and tourism were mixed,   while activity in services was flat. Decreases in activity occurred in   construction and commercial real estate. Labor markets remained weak, but some   signs of improvement were noted. Meanwhile, wage increases were modest, and   overall prices were generally unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail spending was mixed.   A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in September   were down 2 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minneapolis area mall and a   Montana mall reported that recent sales were flat compared with a year ago.   Contacts in northwestern Montana said they generally have not noticed increases   in retail spending. Meanwhile, September traffic at a North Dakota mall started   stronger following a relatively slow August, when same-store sales were down   slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales slipped in September following the end of the cash-for-clunkers   program. An auto dealer in North Dakota reported that sales dropped to more   typical levels after the program ended. Inventory levels of new cars were down   substantially; some dealers were purchasing newer used vehicles at higher prices   to make up for the lack of new-car inventory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity was mixed. The number of visitors at several attractions in   the Upper Peninsula of Michigan during late summer and early fall was at or   above year-ago levels; however, lodging revenue was down almost 10 percent,   according to a tourism official. Tourism spending in northwestern Montana was   down slightly from a year ago. Meanwhile, attendance at the Minnesota State Fair   during late August and early September was up about 6 percent compared with last   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction was   at low levels. A construction products supplier in Minnesota said that drops in   spending on state and locally financed projects have been offset by federal   stimulus financed projects. A representative of a contractors' association in   Montana pointed to several large infrastructure projects, including coal and   hydroelectric power. However, private office, industrial and retail development   was very weak across the District. Residential construction activity was slow.   The value of September residential permits decreased 39 percent from a year   earlier in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and decreased 19 percent in Sioux   Falls, S.D. A Montana contractor reported slow activity in recent high-growth   areas, but activity was up in Great Falls, Helena and Billings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets saw continued sluggish activity. A   Minneapolis-St. Paul commercial real estate firm said office subleases have   increased as tenants required less space, and that more landlords were offering   "as-is" deals with lower rents in exchange for fewer amenities. Retail vacancy   remained elevated in markets across the District. Residential real estate showed   signs of improvement, as buyers scrambled to take advantage of the federal   first-time home buyer tax credit before it expires on November 30. Pending sales   in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in September were about 24 percent higher than   levels a year earlier. Home sales fell slightly from last year in Sioux Falls,   while sales in Bismarck, N.D., were about even with last year's strong   levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall activity was stable in the professional   business services sector. Over half the respondents to an October informal Fed   poll of professional business services firms reported that September activity   was flat at low levels. The remainder of respondents were evenly split between   growth and contraction. Contacts at legal firms said that business was level,   although the type of work had shifted toward work-outs and litigation. Some   information technology consultants noted an uptick, while engineers reported   fierce competition and delays in getting paid. Contacts from the management   consulting area noticed a slight downturn in activity. Architects continued to   report very few projects to bid on.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output was up. A September   survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated   that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and the Dakotas because of   strong new orders. A Minnesota metal fabricator noted plans to increase   production by adding shifts. A diversified manufacturer noted stable orders over   the past month. However, a cement plant in Montana ceased production, and a   North Dakota construction equipment maker shut down a factory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased slightly. Late-September oil and gas exploration inched up   from mid-August. Several large wind energy projects were planned in District   states. A new iron ore processing plant plans to open, and mines in northern   Minnesota were increasing production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions were mixed. The sugar   beet harvest was larger than previously expected. Montana winter wheat crop   planting was ahead of schedule. Favorable growing conditions occurred during   September across most of the District. However, parts of western Wisconsin and   Minnesota were in severe drought, and the progress of harvest of major District   crops was behind the five-year average. Meanwhile, cattle, dairy and hog   producers' profit margins have been squeezed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained   weak, but some signs of improvement were noted. Minnesota initial claims for   unemployment insurance were up 75 percent in August compared with a year ago,   but the pace of increase seems to have leveled over the past few months. A   Minnesota manufacturer announced plans to create 50 new positions to build   specialty cranes. Also in Minnesota, a vehicle plant increased overtime hours in   September, and an auto parts maker hired back 145 employees due to increased   demand. A representative of a career center at the University of Minnesota noted   that a recent job fair had more full-time jobs offered than a fair last spring.   However, an industrial heat exchanger plant in southwestern Wisconsin announced   plans to lay off 90 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases remained modest. According to respondents to the recent St.   Cloud (Minn.) Area Business Outlook Survey, 15 percent expect to increase   employee compensation over the next six months, down from 35 percent in last   year's survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall prices were generally unchanged. Only about 15 percent of respondents   to the St. Cloud survey expect increases in their own product prices over the   next six months, down from 33 percent a year ago. Minnesota gasoline prices   declined 12 cents per gallon in late September from a month earlier and were   down more than $1 per gallon from a year ago. Lower natural gas prices and an   expected mild winter could reduce home heating bills up to 15 percent in the   Midwest.
