      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has    continued to expand since the last report, while price pressures have been    stable. Housing markets remain mixed: as in the last report, New York City's    apartment rental and purchase markets are both tight; however, the sales    market in surrounding suburbs, as well as much of upstate New York, has    stayed sluggish. Office markets in the    New York City area are described as steady since the last report. Bankers' reports    received in late August reveal some further weakening in loan demand--particularly for consumer loans--as well as some further tightening in credit    standards, but little or no change in delinquency rates. The labor market remains tight and hiring activity    is characterized as steady and strong; overall, businesses in the District    continue to expect a modest increase in their employment levels, on balance,    over the next six months.    Manufacturers report ongoing expansion in activity in July and August;    while they note some leveling off in selling prices, a sizable proportion    still plan to hike prices over the next six months. Tourism has continued to    expand briskly. Retailers indicate    that sales were slightly below plan in July but on or ahead of plan in the    first half of August; inventories are said to be at favorable levels, and    selling prices are reported to be steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that sales were    somewhat below plan in July, but somewhat ahead of plan in the first half of    August. New York City continued to out-perform the rest of the region in    terms of 12-month sales growth. Sales of home furnishings and equipment,    though still fairly sluggish, are reported to have picked up somewhat    recently. Apparel sales were mixed.    Inventories were reported to be in good shape, though contacts    indicate that discounts to clear out summer clearance merchandise were a bit    steeper than usual. Overall, selling prices have remained steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity in New York City has continued to    expand briskly since the last report.    Hotels remained at close to full capacity in July and early August,    with room rates running 10 to 15 percent higher than a year ago. Broadway theaters report increased strength    in business in July and early August, with attendance up    10 percent and revenues up 15 percent from a year earlier--a bit stronger than    in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate markets across    the New York City area were steady in July and early August. Manhattan's    office building purchase market remains strong, though some tightening in    credit standards has put moderate downward pressure on prices; still a    contact at a major commercial leasing firm notes that purchase prices remain    well ahead of this time last year.    Manhattan's office rental market remains particularly tight: vacancy    rates were steady near cyclical lows at the end of July, and asking rents    were up 30 to 40 percent from a year earlier--about the same as in recent    months. Leasing activity has slowed somewhat,    but this is attributed, in part, to a dearth of available space. Office markets in the rest of the New York    City area are also characterized as stable in July, though a good deal more    slack than Manhattan's--particularly in northern New Jersey (except for    Jersey City, where the market is fairly tight). Asking rents in these suburban markets are    generally little changed from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing markets have remained mixed    since the last report. New Jersey homebuilders report that the market has    taken on a weaker tone in recent weeks--largely attributed to nervousness    among buyers and somewhat tighter mortgage lending standards. Sales are reported to have slowed more for    existing than new homes, reflecting sellers' reluctance to lower asking    prices. New York State Realtors report    that the median selling price for existing single-family houses was down 5    percent from a year earlier in July, while the number of transactions slipped    2½ percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      In New York City, however, market conditions    remained strong in July and early August, with no contacts reporting any    significant impact, thus far, from the recent developments in financial    markets. Sales of Manhattan apartments were brisk in July, while prices were    reported to be steady to up about 5 percent from a year ago. Real estate contacts report no discernible    weakening in the market in recent weeks; however, August is typically a quiet    month and, thus, difficult to gauge.    The number of listings (inventory) has declined fairly steadily since    the start of the year and remained low through the first three weeks of August. One    contact does report a steady increase in the volume of foreclosures over the    past year but from very low levels.    New York City's rental market remained especially tight in Manhattan    as well as nearby areas: two contacts report that rents are up 10 to 15    percent from a year ago on market-rate apartments; moreover, the inventory of    units on the market (vacancy rate) remains exceptionally low, especially for    larger units. Contacts indicate that demand remained brisk in the first three    weeks of August.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New York State manufacturers report    sustained expansion in business activity in July and August. Contacts continue to express widespread    optimism about the six month outlook and plan to increase employment    modestly, on average, in the next six months.    Manufacturers indicate ongoing moderate increases in input prices but    little change in selling prices. In general, non-manufacturing firms in the    district again report moderate expansion in general business activity, but    express somewhat less optimism about the general business outlook, and have    reduced their hiring and capital spending plans somewhat since the last    report.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major New York City employment agency,    specializing in office jobs, reports that the labor market has remained tight    in July and the first half of August, and that hiring activity by its    clients--dominated by legal and financial firms but not including mortgage    lenders--has shown no signs of slowing since the last report. Wages are reported to be steady, after    sharp escalation earlier this year, but are still up quite a bit from a year    ago. There is a persistently short    supply of qualified workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Based on our latest survey of Second    District banks, conducted from August 20th to 22nd, respondents generally    report weaker demand for loans--particularly consumer loans, where close to 40    percent indicate weakening demand.    There are also further declines reported in demand for home mortgages. Banks, on net, report some tightening in    lending standards in all categories, but more on commercial loans and    mortgages than on the household side.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers report some increase in loan rates for    consumer credit but no change in rates for commercial credit. Most    noticeably, roughly one in two bankers reports a rate increase for    residential mortgages. Bankers also reported a higher average deposit    rate. Reports on the spreads of loan    rates over cost of funds were also split. Despite tighter supply, bankers    indicated declining spreads for consumer loans and commercial mortgages, and    no change for the remaining categories.    Finally, bankers reported little or no change in delinquencies across    all loan categories.
