      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District improved in March, and contacts   indicated that consumer and business confidence were on the rise. Manufacturing   continued to lead the way, while consumer and business spending also increased   and credit conditions improved. Construction, however, remained weak. Price   pressures were small on balance. The spring weather resulted in good progress   toward normal planting conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased in March.   Retail sales continued to improve, with the rate of increase accelerating some   in late March. As in the previous reporting period, the strongest performance   was for sales of nondurables and necessities with some improvement in sales of   durable and luxury goods. Auto sales increased substantially in recent weeks.   Dealers noted an increase in showroom traffic as more serious buyers were being   lured in by favorable pricing and credit terms. Furthermore, dealers also   reported that new incentives from Toyota were helping to offset some of the   decline in their sales in February. The pace of tourism activity increased   slightly with hotel occupancy rates rising due in part to cuts in daily rates,   especially at luxury hotels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending also increased from   the previous reporting period. Contacts indicated that with overall inventory   levels still relatively low, some inventory rebuilding was occurring in retail   trade as well as manufacturing. In a further sign of rising business confidence,   capital expenditures on equipment and merger and acquisition activity were also   noted to have increased. Labor market conditions improved slightly from the   previous reporting period. Several manufacturing contacts added overtime or   additional shifts, and were beginning to consider adding more employees with   business conditions continuing to improve. Demand also continued to be strong   for temporary workers with a large staffing firm reporting that billable hours   had increased substantially. Some permanent hiring was noted in manufacturing   and retail trade; however, in general, hiring remained limited with many firms   still wary of adding employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity   remained weak in March. Residential construction was limited, and contacts noted   downward pricing pressure as builders continued to try to compete against short   sales and foreclosures in the resale market. Credit was still tight for   developers; but a few smaller builders reported that they had been able to   secure financing for homes that were expected to be occupied immediately. Demand   for single-family homes increased some in recent weeks with more purchase   contracts being signed before the expected expiration of the homebuyer tax   credit in April. Demand remained weak for nonresidential construction. The   overhang of vacant facilities and excess retail space dampened demand for new   commercial and industrial construction, and contacts reported continued downward   pressure on commercial rents. Credit conditions were also still tight for   commercial real estate, although a contact cited very slight improvement in   credit availability in recent weeks for higher quality properties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing picked up in March, and   contacts indicated business confidence was on the rise. Orders increased,   particularly in recent weeks, stemming in part from the restocking of   inventories. Contacts also reported that production schedules were beginning to   firm into the second half of 2010 and viewed this as a sign that some pent-up   demand was being released now that the economic outlook was improving and less   uncertain. The auto industry remained a strong source of growth, as did the   pharmaceutical, mining, and energy sectors. Activity in the steel industry   continued to improve, and a contact noted that they were having a hard time   meeting demand with the capacity currently on-line. Export activity also   remained strong with developing countries providing a boost to demand. In   contrast, business conditions for manufacturers with strong ties to construction   were weaker, although a contact did note a small increase in the demand for   construction equipment. Credit availability for suppliers and distributors   remained a concern for manufacturers, with contacts noting an increase in   requests to extend payment periods beyond the customary 30 days. Several   contacts did indicate, however, that bank credit seemed to be more available now   than in the recent past.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions improved from the   previous reporting period. Banking contacts again reported improvement in   consumer and business loan quality, although credit quality for many smaller   firms continued to decline. The pipeline for new loans was still relatively   weak. Many upper middle market firms were said to be making due with cash   reserves, holding back on borrowing. However, contacts indicated that this may   change going into the second half of 2010 as some higher quality borrowers were   already beginning to make inquiries now that economic conditions were improving.   Credit spreads narrowed for a number of District firms, and volatility declined   across financial markets. In addition, contacts reported that liquidity   continued to improve. An exception was the repo market where volume was still   very low and bid-ask spreads wide by historical comparisons.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures were small on balance in   March. Contacts indicated upward pressure on prices for plywood, industrial   metals, and petroleum-based fuels, although natural gas prices remained at   historically low levels. In contrast, retailers reported no significant change   in wholesale prices. Wage pressures were minimal. However, an increase in   healthcare costs was noted. Pass-through of cost pressures to downstream prices   was limited.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District should have normal planting   progress this year, as field conditions were better in March than contacts had   anticipated previously. Snow cover melted gradually enough and rains were spaced   out enough to avoid major flooding in the District. Farmers in most areas   started catching up on field work that was left undone last fall, especially   fertilizer applications. There was also harvesting of fields left standing over   the winter. Blending together poor and better quality corn minimized problems   with the feeding and storing of corn, but some farmers were still stuck with   lower quality corn. More acres of corn and soybeans were expected to be planted   than a year ago, as fewer acres of wheat were planted. Corn and soybean prices   were up slightly during the reporting period, while wheat prices declined. Hog   and cattle prices increased, but milk prices decreased.
